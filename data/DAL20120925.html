I am very conscious that I have been talking about putting an AEOS III in place for some time.  Therefore, I am pleased, in the week that is in it and given the focus on farming this week, to be able to announce an AEOS III today.  It will be modelled on last year's AEOS II.  I understand and appreciate the value of environmental schemes to farmers, not just as an income support but, more importantly, as a way of ensuring we remain committed to sustainable farming and the sustainable production of food.  That is the reason I have been working for the past four months to find a way to put a scheme in place, while at the same time remaining under the ceiling of expenditure allocated to my Department for next year.</p>

I am allocating &#8364;20 million for AEOS III next year.  I expect to be able to accommodate approximately 6,000 applicants.  A maximum payment of &#8364;4,000 will be available to farmers.  Essentially, they will sign up to get a recognition payment for specific actions they will take with regard to sustainability.  They will be asked to support the maintenance of traditional hay meadows, wild bird cover, hedgerows, stone walls and species-rich grassland, for example.  I think farmers understand such measures because of the first two agri-environment options schemes.  In my view, they will sign up for such measures again in return for a funding model that is essentially based on last year's AEOS II.  I wanted to stick with last year's model so farmers who studied that model will understand what we are doing on this occasion and be able to make applications.  I will explain how we will deal with applications from excess numbers of farmers if questions are asked on that topic.  If we have to prioritise who should be in and who should be out, we will try to do that in a very fair way.<br><br><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i><br><br>The scheme will be largely similar to previous years.  I intend to introduce a small number of minor changes which are designed to target increased benefits to participating farmers and to the environment.  As in earlier years, farmers with commonage land, designated special areas of conservation or special protection areas will be required to follow a sustainable management plan prepared by a planner.  Those applicants will be given priority in determining access to the scheme.  Applicants other than those requiring a sustainable management plan will not be required to engage a planner to complete their application forms.  In addition to the priority given to designated land, applicants will be assessed on the basis of selection criteria reflecting previous participation in REPS, farm size and location in disadvantaged areas.  Full details of the scheme will be announced by my Department in the next day or so.<br><br>  I want to reiterate my commitment to agri-environment schemes that put environmentally friendly farming to the fore and recognise the vital role farmers play in delivering public goods for the benefit of all of society.  This commitment is matched by the enthusiasm of Irish farmers who have shown a keen willingness to engage with environmental issues since the introduction of the first agri-environment scheme and have done so in huge numbers.  There are approximately 30,000 participants in REPS.  The agri-environment options scheme, which is the successor to REPS, is a more targeted agri-environment scheme.  It is part-funded from modulation funds under the CAP health check.  The scheme specifically targets the three challenges - halting biodiversity loss, contributing to the improvement of water quality and combating climate change - that have been assigned the highest priority at European level as they are in need of urgent action.  There are currently approximately 14,500 participants in AEOS I and II.</p>

It is an important scheme for many farmers.  Can the Minister outline the estimated expenditure on REPS in 2012 and in 2013?  Will there be constraints in the new agri-environment options scheme?  Will it be open to all farmers or will it be confined to farmers in designated areas?  Can the Minister confirm whether the maximum grant will be €5,000?  Will any changes be made to measures like that relating to stone walls?  I think he indicated that such changes will not be made.</p>

I do not want to give a figure off the top of my head.  We are ahead of schedule in terms of getting payments out across all schemes this year.  I am conscious that farmers have had a difficult summer.  We want to get the money that is due to them out as quickly as possible.  That is why €150 million is going out to farmers in disadvantaged areas this week.  That is why we have applied to the Commission for a 50% advance payment to be made under the single payment scheme.  That is why we will make as many REPS payments as we can this year.  We will certainly be well ahead of last year in terms of payments.  I can give the Deputy the exact figures at a later stage.  He also asked about designated areas.  On budget day last year, I gave a commitment to introduce at a minimum an agri-environment options scheme that would solely target Natura areas or special areas of conservation.  We have worked hard to broaden the scheme to allow farmers who are not in those designated areas to apply for AEOS payments.  As the new scheme is very similar to last year's scheme, farmers outside the designated areas will be able to make applications.  I can confirm that the measure relating to stone walls will be retained.</p>

If the Deputy is going to start quoting figures to me, I would make the point that the budget I was handed when we took over in government needed to be significantly adjusted before last year's budget because of the ceilings to which Fianna Fáil had signed up both when the Deputy was a Minister and a Fianna Fáil Member.  If we had to operate under these ceilings, there would be no REPS and no AEOS.</p>

We have had the worst summer rainfall on record since 1962.  Rainfall for most of the country was twice the average for the months of June, July and August.  This has caused significant problems and pressures for farmers, even on the most fertile of farms.  We have tried to respond as best we can.  What I said to farmers was that I would not put a short-term compensation scheme in place and then have to take the money back off them at budget time, as it would not be sensible to do that on any grounds.  Instead, we have tried to do what we can do within budget, including, for example, pushing back and giving early notice to farmers of the pushing back of the slurry spreading and chemical fertiliser deadlines in order to extend the grazing season by at least two weeks and allow farmers to take advantage of what was a period of dry weather.  This is to try to ease pressures on indoor feeding which will clearly be a problem this winter.</p><p><a name='N13'>  In addition, I met on a bilateral basis the Commissioner to discuss the consequences of the wet summer and made a request to him for an advance payment of 50% of the single farm payment.  It is true this has almost become the norm in recent years, but it still needs to be applied for, and Ireland was the first country to apply for it.  I am trying to improve cash flow for farmers in the autumn as livestock farmers, in particular, will have to spend more money on feed.  We are also ahead of schedule in getting out disadvantaged area payments.  As I said, approximately €150 million will go out to farmers this week in disadvantaged area payments.  Some of these payments will be made to farmers who are being given a derogation from the new criteria announced last year.</p>

The three issues here are Government cuts, soaring input costs and, of course, the weather, which is profoundly affecting profitability and output at farm level.  Not only has the bad weather resulted in a need for farmers to buy more feed for cattle here, but the US drought has resulted in an increase in the price of grain and animal feed internationally.  If the current bad weather continues, the IFA estimates that farming incomes could drop by 30%.  Some farmers in my own constituency in Waterford are fearful that should the disproportionate cuts already imposed on farm schemes continue in the upcoming budget, their livelihood is in real danger of being wiped out completely.  I have been told that some farmers are achieving average winter wheat yields of five to seven and a half tonnes per hectare less than last year, while quality issues such as low hectolitre weights have forced merchants to introduce price reductions.</p>

The Government is significantly contributing to their worries.  The 17% cuts in farm schemes in 2012 were almost three times the 6% cut applied across the entire agricultural budget and far in excess of the 3.5% taken out across other Departments.  An IFA survey conducted at the recent Tullamore Show suggests the weather has had a negative impact on production for more than 90% of all farmers, with over 60% estimating a production loss of greater than 10%.  Furthermore, 60% of those surveyed have purchased extra feed concentrate at an average additional cost of €3,700.</p><p><a name='N6'>  The Minister spoke about short-term compensation.  Farmers, particularly small farmers, have their backs to the wall now.  An immediate input of relatively small moneys - maybe a couple of million euro - might stop small farmers from going to the wall and going out of business.  They are out of time and do not want to hear the Minister say that if he gives them money now, he might have to take it back later.  They need money, immediately, that cannot be taken back.</p>

Payments worth some €154 million under the disadvantaged areas scheme will begin tomorrow, 26 September.  This funding will provide a boost to the rural economy and will benefit all areas of the country.  It is too early to estimate, at this stage, the total payments to be made under the scheme in 2012, because there is an issue to do with qualification criteria which is working through the system.  REPS payments for 2011 are currently up to date.  A total of €64 million has been paid out to date and I envisage that by the end of 2012 a further €121 million will have been spent.  AEOS payments are well advanced and continue to issue as quickly as possible.  To date, €23 million has been paid and a further €34 million will be paid out before the end of 2012.</p><p><a name='N12'>  We are prioritising getting payments out to farmers ahead of schedule and we are currently well ahead of schedule in comparison to last year.  I am more than conscious of the pressures that farmers are under.  This affects farmers not only in disadvantaged areas but also in places such as east Cork and east Waterford.  Farmers who were harvesting spring crops of three tonnes or more per acre last year will be lucky to reach two tonnes per acre this year.  There are similar losses for winter crops.  There was a significant increase in the amount of land that was put into arable crops this year because last year prices were strong, yields were very strong and it was profitable.</p>

I totally reject that we have done nothing.  It is quite the opposite.  I have met all the banks in this country and I met a number of them on more than one occasion.  Extra funding has been made available.  Ulster Bank, for example, launched a specific food harvest fund.  In the past fortnight Bank of Ireland launched with me a €250 million fund specifically targeting agriculture and farmers.  That is on top of another €250 million fund that was launched a number of months ago.  We have been active in pursuing and pushing banks to specifically tailor funding for the agrifood sector and for farmers, many of whom need to invest at the moment in anticipation of potential growth in the future.  We have been very active on the banking front.</p><p><a name='N11'>  Having said that, I would like to see more from the banks, in particular for sectors that are currently in crisis.  The pig sector, and to a certain extent the poultry sector, are under severe pressures because of the price of feed.  In many cases they need bridging finance to get them through a difficult period.  I hope and expect that banks would provide them with the necessary support.  I have been speaking to farmers' organisations about that.</p><p><a name='N12'>  No, we are not making any changes to the stocking density requirements.  We made changes last year on eligibility in an effort to try to avoid cutting the scheme for everybody.  We wanted to try to differentiate between farmers who get the majority of their income from farming and those who are essentially farming for schemes, many of whom do not live in disadvantaged areas but are renting and taking out land in order to draw down schemes.  That is not the kind of farmer we have the luxury of supporting at the moment-----</p>

Our Department is not the only body involved.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service is very much part of that process in terms of the assessment of Natura bays one after the other but we are making progress.<br><br>  When I came into office there was a huge amount of frustration that aquaculture licences had not been granted for years.  That process is now changing.  By the end of this year we hope to have a decision on 100 or more licence applications.  I am conscious there are 620 licence applications pending and since 2003 we have renewed or issued 176 licences but it is the last three or four years that have been the problem.  We are assessing bays one after the other in terms of the appropriate assessment procedure that we are required by law to implement.  We have completed Roaring Water Bay, Castlemaine and Dundalk and we are continuing to complete the assessment process for other bays.  That process will continue into next year and the year after.<br><br>  This is a priority area for me.  Seafood generally but also aquaculture and fish farming have extraordinary potential in Ireland but we must do it in an environmentally sustainable way.  If we do that we can have a profitable and substantial industry over the next ten years.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i><br><br>Applications for aquaculture operations are subject to the provisions of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997.<br><br>  In 2007 the European Court of Justice issued a negative judgement against Ireland for breaches of EU birds and habitats directives.  At that point the systems and data were not in place to enable the consenting of aquaculture in compliance with the relevant directives.  As most aquaculture activity takes place in areas designated as special areas of conservation and-or special protection areas for birds, known as Natura 2000 sites, it is necessary to gather a substantial amount of scientific data in the bays.  This data must be obtained in respect of the benthos and the birdlife of the bay under examination.  Once the data collection is complete, habitats maps are produced and conservation objectives are set by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  It is then necessary to undertake an appropriate assessment of the effects of aquaculture activity on these areas in the context of the set conservation objectives before any new licence can be issued or any existing licence can be renewed.  This process represents a major investment by the State to ensure the continued sustainable development of the aquaculture industry while maintaining the maximum protection for our coastal environment in accordance with the set requirements of European law.<br><br>  In order to implement the necessary procedures required, my Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the NPWS, has been engaged in a major programme to gather the necessary baseline data appropriate to the conservation objectives of aquaculture sites located within designated Natura areas.  This data collection programme which is substantially complete, together with the setting of conservation objectives, will enable all new and renewal applications to be assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU birds and habitats directives.  This work is ongoing but a great deal of progress has been made to date.<br><br>  The appropriate assessment process has been completed in respect of three bays &#8211;  Roaring Water, Castlemaine and Dundalk.  While the appropriate assessments are carried out on a bay by bay basis, each licence application within the bay must be assessed individually.  Factors to be considered include location within the bay, species, scale etc.  In addition to the Natura requirements, under the environmental impact assessment directive all licence applications must undergo environmental impact pre-screening assessment.  This requires significant input from the Department&#8217;s scientific and technical advisers.  All applications, in compliance with the requirements of the Aarhus directive are advertised in order to facilitate public consultation and submissions or observations received must be considered as part of the licence application determination process.<br><br>  In the period 2003 to date my Department has issued 176 licences, including 75 renewal applications.  A total of 626 licence applications are pending.  The majority of these are located in Natura 2000 areas and are accordingly subject to the appropriate assessment process.<br><br>  The sustainable development of the industry and the creation of long-term employment from aquaculture into the future can only take place if there is full compliance with the range of EU directives which impact on this area and national legislation on environmental protection.  I am very conscious of the requirement both to ensure compliance with our obligations under EU law and to make progress on addressing the licensing backlog.  In order to meet these objectives, my Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the NPWS, is investing significant resources into completing the appropriate assessment process.  I am confident that significant progress is being made which will facilitate determinations on a significant number of licence applications over the coming months.  I also anticipate significant progress in relation to licence determinations in non-Natura areas.<br><br>  At this stage it is expected that my Department will be in a position to finalise the processing of approximately 100 licence applications by the end of 2012.  This will represent a significant breakthrough in tackling this problem.<br><br>  In recent months there has been significant progress in relation to restructuring of salmon production licences in south Connemara.  I have recently approved the assignment of aquaculture licences from five separate operators to Bradán Beo Teoranta, a company established by Údarás na Gaeltachta, to consolidate and revitalise the operation of sustainable salmon farming in the area.  The assignment of the licences took place with the agreement of the former licence holders and follows a lengthy examination of all issues associated with salmon farming in south Connemara.  This assignment of licences will consolidate operations in one licence holder and thereby greatly assist in the sustainable development of salmon farming in the area.<br><br>  Apart from the focus on progressing licence determinations in the bays, it is also intended to expand radically the production of Irish organic farmed salmon by creating new fish farming production areas in deeper waters.  The placement of farms in deep waters will ensure there is no impact on Natura 2000 sites.  BIM estimates that just one of these production areas could generate over &#8364;100 million in exports per annum and create 350 direct jobs.  A further 150 jobs will be created indirectly in the service sector supplying fish feed, netting, transportation and other services.<br><br>  BIM, working with the Marine Institute, is currently investigating suitable sites.  An application for an aquaculture licence in respect of one of these sites in Galway Bay has been submitted to the Department by BIM.  This application is currently being assessed in accordance with the provisions of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997.<br><br>  My Department has also issued a site investigation licence to BIM for sites off Inishbofin and Inishturk islands off the coast of Mayo with a view to identifying a suitable site for a second deep sea production area.<br><br>  I am firmly convinced of the great potential for all types of aquaculture around our coast as set out in Food Harvest 2020 &#8211; A vision for Irish Agri-food and fisheries, and I am confident that the steps I have outlined above together with the work being done by BIM and the Marine Institute will result in the sustainable development and significant expansion of this important industry.<br><br>  In summary therefore, in relation to licensing, it is my expectation that by the end of this year licensing decisions will have been made in approximately 100 cases; a determination on the deep sea licence application for Galway Bay will be imminent; licence determinations will have commenced in Natura 2000 areas; and further progress will have been achieved on the appropriate assessment process affecting Natura 2000 areas.</p>

As an island nation the waters around our coastline are a goldmine, so to speak.  The development of our aquaculture industry is a major initiative that must be tackled immediately to realise the maximum potential of our high quality produce.  In 2011 in County Kerry alone, 1,115 tonnes of produce such as mussels, oysters, clams, scallops etc. were cultivated before processing.  The actual product was worth €2.4 million and if it goes through the full processing procedure one can imagine the number of jobs that could be added to the 112 working on the raw state of our produce.</p>

The Minister, Deputy Deenihan, has been very helpful on this issue and the Minister and myself have put extra resources into trying to get the assessments done in the Natura bays so we can make determinations on licence applications in those areas but we are required to do that by law.  There are no shortcuts in that regard.  One of the reasons we are in this difficult position is because we took shortcuts in the past.  We must ensure that when we put cages in the water or mussel lines on beaches that we are doing it in a way that is consistent with the ecosystems in which they are operating and in a sustainable way that is lawfully as well as environmentally acceptable.  Otherwise, we will be taken to court again and forced to shut down these industries.

I asked BIM and the Marine Institute to consider locating new sites for salmon farms in much deeper waters that are further offshore and outside Natura areas and special areas of conservation, SACs.  Since I made this request, BIM has lodged an application for a 15,000 tonne salmon farm to be located 5 km off Galway in the vicinity of the Aran Islands.  If this facility is licensed and goes into operation, it will have a turnover of approximately €104 million per year, at current salmon prices, and will employ in the region of 350 people.  The facility will be developed in an absolutely sustainable way, particularly in view of the fact that the site was hand-picked by Marine Institute scientists.  We are also examining the possibility of doing something similar at sites off the coast of Mayo.</p><p><a name='N4'>  We are moving into new territory in the context of the scale of this industry.

This development will be worth €11 million to the local economy.  There are approximately 90 bays around the coast of Ireland and I am sure a huge number of these remain to be licensed.  I welcome the fact that 100 commercial licences have been granted, particularly as approximately 450,000 people are unemployed at present.  If one takes it that 20 jobs can be created per licence, then 2,000 jobs can be brought on stream quite soon.  In addition, if the 600 licence applications that are pending are all granted, then a further 12,000 jobs could be created.

This must be done in the context of the legal framework within which we are obliged to operate under EU law.  That is what we are trying to do.

Scotland produces approximately 150,000 tonnes of salmon per year, while Norway produces in the region of 1.2 million tonnes.  Ireland, however, produces only 12,000 tonnes of salmon per year.  We have a fantastic resource on which to base the development of an industry but we must do this properly rather doing everything in a rush.  There are many coastal communities that are happy to facilitate the type of development to which I refer but they want it to be carried out in a proper and vigorous manner.  In addition, they want us to deal with all of the questions relating to the environment and the sustainability of the industry.</p>

That is where the ambition of the ocean wealth strategy meets the Common Fisheries Policy. We are in the process of renegotiating a Common Fisheries Policy.  In my view, the current Common Fisheries Policy has been an abject failure in many ways.  It has facilitated - in fact, encouraged - our fishermen to employ a discards policy, which means they must dump large quantities of fish over the sides of boats.  Up to 40% of the fish caught in Irish waters is thrown over the side because fishermen do not have a quota to land it and sell it.  They have no option because they cannot avoid catching such fish in their nets when they are fishing for other species.  In other cases they catch too many fish in a haul and must throw some of them back into the water.</p>

The plan sets targets for 2020 and 2030 for each marine sector and outlines 39 actions to be taken to facilitate this development.  I expect Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth to act as the framework to be referenced with regard to development in each marine sector in the same way that Food Harvest 2020 is seen as the driver and is referenced with regard to development in the food industry.  I also expect it to complement and augment the measures that will flow from the reformed Common Fisheries Policy, which is currently being reviewed and may be completed over the course of the Irish Presidency of the European Union, which commences in January 2013.<br><br>  Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth sets out the roadmap for the Government's vision, high-level goals and integrated actions across policy, governance and business to enable our marine potential to be fully realised.  My overarching goal for the new CFP is the development of a sustainable, profitable and self-reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to deliver a sustainable and eco-centred fisheries landscape for future generations.  In the current economic climate, we need a policy that both simplifies and reduces the administrative burden while at the same time strengthening and supporting the industry's capacity to maximise employment in coastal communities dependent on fishing.  In particular, I will be pursuing initiatives that will deliver and sustain jobs in coastal communities rather than those that promote a concentration of wealth and delivery of excessive profits for a few big international businesses.  I support a system that maintains strong economic links between national quotas and the traditional fishing communities that these quotas were allocated to assist.<br><br>  To my mind, the objectives I have set for the new CFP and the national ocean wealth initiative are compatible, and they will both contribute significantly to harnessing to a greater extent the economic and social benefits of our marine economy.  To that end, I will continue to work with all stakeholders, both nationally and internationally, to deliver on the common goals which are in Ireland's best interests.</p>

I am not sure why he questions my interest in this subject.  It may be because there are not too many women who are out fishing alongside fishermen or it could be because I represent a Dublin constituency.  However, it is a Dublin constituency which has important harbours such as Balbriggan, Skerries, Loughshinny and Rush.  Thankfully, I am blessed in that there are a number of people in the constituency who have taken a great interest in our ocean wealth precisely because existing fisheries policy has devastated small coastal communities and the potential of our fisheries industry needs to be developed.  It has been alleged by some of those people that much of the information in the report is not well researched and some of the information about eco-tourism is not based on any substantial research and not properly grounded.  The issue of regulation and the need for independent observation and collection of data is crucial, but this is not happening.  A total of 250 big trawlers are run by syndicates and, to a great extent, there is not adequate and proper information on what fish they are catching and discarding.  Where are the Minister's proposals to fund a direct monitoring team?  That could be done relatively cheaply; approximately €7.5 million would provide an independent observer regime to gather the data which could be used to develop a fisheries policy.  I know the Minister is interested in fish farming, which is an important but small part of an overall policy for sustainable fishing.</p>

I am upbeat about the industry because it has a bright future.  However, we need to manage both it and our fish stocks in a sustainable way.  Some of the stocks are currently in the process of recovery.  For example, many of the fishermen whom Deputy Daly knows are fishing in the Irish Sea and they will know that a cod recovery plan is in place there.</p><p><a name='N10'>  With regard to the Deputy's point about the collection of data, in many ways the European Commission uses Ireland and the Marine Institute as the example of how data should be collected.  The Marine Institute is independent of the fishing industry and it has credibility within the industry.  One of the reasons for Ireland's significant quota increases in a series of species last year was that the Marine Institute played a central role in last December's negotiations on the annual quota allocations or TACs, total allowable catches, for the Irish fishing fleet.  We will continue to take a scientific approach to the management of fish stocks.  We will not be catching fish that are not there.</p>

We are unusual in Europe in that only some 20% of the fish caught in the waters we control are caught by Irish boats, with the remaining 80% being caught by foreign fleets.  We are obliged to collect the data from all of these boats.  As such, we have strongly supported the Commission's proposal for electronic logbooks, for example, which would allow us to gather the data as quickly as possible from the many fleets that come in and out of Irish waters at different times.  It is a complex job.  Only this morning we made the case to the Commission that the European Fisheries Fund should support countries such as Ireland to put improved data collection systems in place to manage our fish stocks.</p>

Despite the presence of foreign trawlers in our waters, some 250 of them run by syndicates engaged in this type of activity, we do not have an effective, independent observation regime in place.  A mere 1% of the €750 million European Fisheries Fund would support 250 jobs in such a capacity, collecting the data and informing future policy.  In addition, we must enhance the area of eco-tourism.  A difficulty in this regard, however, is that our ocean wealth is not properly researched.  Activities such as recreational fishing which have been well exploited and developed in Britain have not been given the same prominence here.</p>

If one includes the Attorney General's office, ten Departments were involved in putting this report together.  For the first time, we have an integrated maritime strategy which involves all of the relevant Departments working collectively.  I chair the implementation group which meets on a bimonthly basis to discuss a range of issues relating to our ocean resource and how we can best obtain value from it.  We are taking a proactive approach with a view to realising the ambition expressed in the report.  In fact, I hope to upgrade some of the targets set out in that document for the various sectors.</p><p><a name='N5'>  On the issue of data collection and enforcement of the rules in terms of quotas, catches and so on, this is primarily a matter for the Naval Service, in co-operation with the Marine Institute and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  These bodies are rigorous in policing the implementation of the rules, but the reality is that we are talking about a vast amount of space to be patrolled.  When boats are coming into Irish waters for eight or ten hours but without ever coming closer than 150 miles from shore, they are difficult to monitor and police.  That is why the introduction of electronic logbooks is so important.</p>

To make the necessary savings it was proposed to make technical adjustments to the scheme criteria to ensure the aid payment is focused on farmers whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in disadvantaged areas scheme areas and are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the scheme.  These are defined in the governing European Union legislation as follows - to ensure continued agricultural land use and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a viable rural community; to maintain the countryside; to maintain and promote sustainable farming systems which, in particular, take account of environmental protection measures.</p><p><a name='N7'>  It was decided that real efforts should be made to focus the scheme on those farmers who are most actively contributing to achieving the aims of the scheme, namely, ensuring continued agricultural land use thereby contributing to the maintenance of viable rural communities, maintaining the countryside and maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems which take account of environmental protection measures.  As the disadvantaged areas scheme is co-funded as part of the rural development plan, the approval of the European Commission was required.  Following protracted discussions, the necessary approval was granted last August. </p><p><a name='N8'>  Payments will start issuing tomorrow, on schedule.  These payments are worth in the region of €150 million to 70,000 farmers and payment runs will continue on an ongoing basis, with individual cases being paid as their eligibility is confirmed.</p><p><a name='N9'>  In terms of savings for 2012, it is too early to give precise figures.  Given the approach taken in adjusting the terms and conditions of the 2012 scheme, with the changes designed to better focus the scheme on the more active farmers, namely, those who are contributing most to achieving the aims of the scheme, and the options of six possible forms of derogation, it remains to be seen what will be the precise outcome for the scheme in 2012 in terms of savings.  The need for applicants to maintain a minimum of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare for six consecutive months, while also achieving an annual stocking average of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare, means that some applicants will not become eligible until later in the year.  Furthermore, farmers who met the 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011 or will receive a derogation may have decided not to buy the required stock this year for whatever reason.  However, while those farmers who have yet to satisfy the average stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare for the year have the remaining months of the year to do so, such cases can only be cleared for payment once this requirement has been confirmed.  Therefore, we must wait until closer to the end of this year to quantify savings.</p><p><a name='N10'>  Last year, we could have taken the option taken by the previous Government, namely, reduce the payment per hectare to all farmers or reduce the number of hectare for which farmers could apply for a payment.  However, we decided not to take that approach and opted for a more intelligent approach.  We have been successful in maintaining full payment in disadvantaged areas for farmers who farm all year round, even where they have low stocking rates.  We introduced new criteria last year with a view to removing from the system farmers who while farming in, for example, County Kildare, were taking land in, for example, County Sligo to enable them to draw down payments.  We reduced payments to farmers with land both inside and outside disadvantaged areas on a ratio that was in accordance with the amount of land they hand in disadvantaged areas.  We also changed the stocking rate following consultations with farming organisations on what would be the appropriate stocking rate.  We wished to keep the rate as low as possible while ensuring it was also reasonable.  We also discussed for how many months in one year farmers would be required to have stock to qualify as being actively involved in farming rather than having flocks of sheep being passed from one farmer to another for the minimum period required to qualify for a disadvantaged area payment, namely, three months.  That practice is a luxury we can no longer afford.  We wish to focus the limited funding available to us on farmers who are actively farming.  If some farmers were caught out unfairly by the change in criteria last year, they have access to a generous derogation system.  I understand more than half of those who are seeking a derogation have been granted one.  If a person is not satisfied with a decision not to grant him or her a derogation, he or she can avail of an independent appeals mechanism.  If anything, we will not make the savings we were hoping to make in the disadvantaged areas scheme. </p>

Those who apply for a disadvantaged areas scheme payment do not automatically qualify for payment.  Applications are usually rejected because the applicant did not meet the stocking rate requirements for last year.  Farmers who apply for a derogation are effectively asking me to make an exception for them.  The reasons vary and include that they are full-time farmers or had good reason to have a low stocking rate last year, for example, owing to a death in the family, the farm being handed over to a son or daughter or they have particularly poor or stony land which prevents them from meeting the stocking rate requirement.  They are seeking a derogation because they did not qualify for a payment.  We have made decisions on approximately 4,000 of the 9,500 applications received for a derogation, while a further 950 applicants have been requested to furnish additional documentation because the Department requires greater clarity.  Work continues apace on processing the balance of the cases.  All applicants are being advised, in writing, of the success or otherwise of their applications and unsuccessful applicants are being afforded the opportunity of appeal to the DAS derogation appeals committee.</p>

All it had to do was superimpose those maps on the SAC, SPA, and NHA maps and then on the commonage framework maps.  The Department also knows which farmers are in AEOS and REPS.

We have made it clear in the case of Coillte that we will not be selling any Coillte lands or the company.  However, we are looking at changing the ownership structure of the forests on the company's lands.  This is a little bit like selling a crop ahead of time except for forestry it will involve a 50 to 80 year period.  We have been through a valuation process for the commercial forestry estate.  To protect the public interest we need to ensure, for example, the supply contracts that many private sawmill operators have with Coillte can be protected.  We need to ensure public access to State-owned forests remains intact.</p>

What is its advice about the desirability of the Government policy in this regard?  The Minister says the crop will strategically stay in ownership, but it will not.  The most important thing in the forest is the crop which will not strategically stay in ownership.  The Minister will be aware that, remarkably, our major mills are still at full production, despite the downturn in building here.  This is because of the co-operation between Coillte Teoranta and the mills at the time of crisis when the housing market and the building sector collapsed.  Is the Minister satisfied that if the crop was sold and there was a similar difficulty, we would have a similar happy result in the milling industry?  If the Government sells the crop, who will have responsibility for replanting?  What arrangements will be made and what consideration will be given to the impact of selling the crop and having harvesting activities outside of Coillte's control on rural recreational activities since some 45% of way-marked ways are through Coillte land?  Will the Minister indicate what is the expected gross return for the crop?  In other words, what is the total amount of money the Government expects to receive for the crop?  Have discussions taken place with the troika about finding alternative ways to raise the same amount of money, as the Minister used to ask when in opposition?</p>

The Deputy is correct in respect of the mills in that most commercial mills are at full production.  Many of them obtain 80% or more of their timber from Coillte forests and many have long-term supply contracts in place with Coillte.  We will need to protect these supply contracts to ensure that if the forest, not land, ownership structure changes, one can stitch it into any sales process.  This has been done successfully in other parts of the world.  If we cannot do this, naturally we will have difficulties.  I am not in the business of supporting any process that would put the timber sector out of business, an industry that has survived through a rather different building recession in Ireland.</p><p><a name='N5'>  On the management of the crop, it may well be the case that Coillte will continue to manage its forests, but it will no longer own them on behalf of the State.  A series of financing models for any new ownership structure may be considered, but one may find that at the end of the process, if it is concluded successfully, Coillte will be essentially on a contract to manage the 1 million hectares or so of trees and more or less continue what it does, except that its management could be obliged to have a commercial relationship with the new owner.  I would be slow to move away from the current replanting obligation, whereby Coillte plants approximately 15 million trees per year.  In other words, when Coillte harvests them, it must replace the crop by planting.  I expect any new owner to have the same obligation.</p>

They decided to select 20.  However, behind the back of the Minister of State and parallel with all of this, the Minister seemed to have a different thought process entirely.  After consulting Cabinet colleagues, he took a unilateral decision to add a further 15 to the 20, including two in his constituency.  He published no criteria or provided no evidence base to justify this unilateral decision.</p><p><a name='N11'>  Public private partnerships have a significant commercial dimension.  They involve general practitioners, allied health professionals, therapists and so forth.  For this reason, above and beyond anything else, there must be objective criteria, fairness and transparency because various interests and consortia are entitled to bid and tender for such centres and projects.  Is it appropriate that a Minister should ride roughshod over existing agreements and criteria and take decisions unilaterally which can benefit private sector interests?  These are multi-million pound ventures with profit as a desired objective.  There is nothing wrong with making a profit, but that is the key ingredient in this issue.  It is equivalent to tendering, which is the reason Ministers should be at one remove from such decisions.  Did the Minister know at the time of his decision who the preferred bidder for the Balbriggan site was?  Was this disclosed?</p><p><a name='N12'>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has described this as stroke politics.  Others have described it as naked clientelism, but I am saying it is more than this.  The commercial private sector dimension is significant, which is why the Minister is wrong in the decision he took.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the Minister's actions were inappropriate and unacceptable?</p>

Clearly, primary care centres have enormous capacity to take people in, rather than having them go to accident and emergency units in the first place.  Given the range of facilities that can, should and will be provided in primary care centres, they are important.  There were broader criteria used than just the deprivation index in the selection of primary care centres.  The criteria also included the impact on acute services in hospitals, competition and GP co-operation.  The Minister and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform accepted that competition was required to ensure there would be a cost-effective GP buy-in and on that basis the number of potential primary care centre locations was determined.</p><p><a name='N14'>  It is important to note that this is part of the overall stimulus package announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform some time ago, which included expenditure in the areas of road development, schools and primary care centres.</p>

Deputy Martin will be aware that in some locations the HSE was already at advanced stages of discussion about the development of primary care centres, including the leasing of premises by GPs for primary care, and this was deemed the most appropriate way of delivering those centres.  A number of other high-priority locations were selected for direct investment by the HSE using Exchequer funds from the HSE's capital allocation, and the remaining locations were then considered as being appropriate for public-private partnership development.</p><p><a name='N4'>  Deputy Martin will be aware that if one wishes to develop 20 primary care centres and one selects only 20 possibilities, one runs the risk of objections, non-buy-in by GPs, lack of competition and other factors.  What the Government approved and signed off was a list of 35 primary care centres, with 20 to be developed.  That does not mean that the first 20 will actually be developed, because of the factors that I mentioned.  In order to get this moving as quickly as possible, taking into account situations in which there were leases involved, an intention to lease, direct Exchequer funding or PPPs, the Minister, in consultation with his colleagues, made a recommendation to the Government and the Government signed off on that element of the stimulus package for the development of 20 primary care centres from a list of 35.</p>

The Taoiseach needs to be honest and transparent with the House in this regard.</p><p><a name='N6'>  What is clear from all of this is that the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, plays by the rules, while Deputy Reilly does not.  What is equally extraordinary is the degree to which the Labour Party hierarchy was willing to isolate Deputy Shortall to protect Deputy Reilly, and all in the name of deprivation.  That is why Deputy Shortall stood her ground.  Deputy Shortall's letter to Deputy Reilly gives the lie to what the Taoiseach just said.</p>

He has already given details on all of this to the House in a public statement.  He is one of the few people with a genuinely passionate interest in shifting the structure and nature of how health is delivered in this country in the interest of the patient.  This is not an easy task and the Minister is focused on getting the strategy right and implementing it.</p><p><a name='N4'>  The decision in respect of the primary care centres is to develop 20 primary care centres from a list of 35.  I have provided Deputy Martin with the reasons it was necessary to have a list of more than 20, simply because a range of issues could arise, such as objections, non-buy-in, lack of competition, impact on acute services in hospitals and the range of services that must be provided through the primary care centres in order to be effective.  As I have mentioned, some centres were in areas where a lease was arranged, some in areas where a lease was to be arranged, some had direct HSE-Exchequer funding and others were under the PPP programme.  They are the sectors and the Minister has set out the criteria involved.  </p><p><a name='N5'>  As mentioned, this particular development of primary care centres involves 20 from a list of 35.  It remains to be seen which 20 get across the line, taking all the criteria into account.  They were part of the Government stimulus package announced by the Government and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and were signed off in individual sectors through discussions and recommendations by each Minister in consultation with his or her colleagues.</p><p><a name='N6'>  I am sure that at the end of all of this the Deputy will appreciate the importance and function of primary care centres to provide decent, first-class care and attention in many areas for people who need them.  I wish to God we could provide more primary care centres in a shorter time because they are a part of the development of this stimulus package for primary care centres.  Where they work well, they are very effective.  I have been in a number of them and have seen at first hand the response from patients and the efficiency that applies when everybody buys into the provision of a really strong, effective primary care centre.  This is so important for the future health of people all over the country.</p>

It astounds me that this has not crossed the Taoiseach's mind.  It astounds me that when making his ministerial appointments, the Taoiseach did not clarify the position with the Minister.</p>

Did the Minister of State know about the additional criteria?  If she did not know, has she subsequently been apprised of them?  On foot of this, is she prepared to withdraw her charge of a lack of transparency?</p><p><a name='N10'>  It seems to me this has been stroke politics.  However, perhaps the Minister of State has been furnished with the information and perhaps she takes a different view now.  Can the Taoiseach tell us whether this is the case?</p>

These home help assistants have come together over recent weeks because the Government, as part of this raft of cuts, has cut 600,000 hours of home help.  This comes on top of 500,000 hours of cuts that happened earlier in the year.

That is the Minister's intention.  Obviously, the circumstances of those who receive home help care can change - circumstances may change within the family or the person might die - and these things are reviewed as a result.  At the same time, another person in different circumstances might be making a home care application.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Government are determined to ensure that where home help is needed, home help will be given.</p>

The priority of private multinational companies in this sector is to make money out of the disabled and the elderly, rather than to provide them with services or to treat the workers who provide those services with the respect they need.  I ask the Taoiseach to reverse the cuts in home help hours.  He can get savings from the consultants who are doing private work in public hospitals and are paid obscenely high public salaries.  Further moneys can be saved by cutting the prices that are paid to multinational companies.  That should be done instead of attacking the elderly, the disabled, the most vulnerable people in our society and the workers who provide these services, who are already inadequately paid for the vital work they do.</p>

As a result of the conclusion of those talks, services will be delivered much more effectively and substantial savings will be made.  When negotiations on the cost and delivery of drugs in the Irish health system come to a conclusion fairly soon, I hope the Deputy will find it within himself to appreciate the progress that will have been made.  The important point about home care and home help is its effectiveness.  I respect the work done by the home care personnel I meet all over the country.  Many of them have never been bound by the sort of clock alluded to by the Deputy.  Many of them have always gone out of their way to help those to whom they give care and attention.  It is in their nature to do that.  For example, a home help might return to a person's house more than once during the course of the day, even if that house is some distance away, because they know the person involved.</p>

On 26 July last, I wrote to the leaders of each of the political parties in Northern Ireland to invite them to nominate a representative to the Constitutional Convention.  On 13 September last, I met the Northern Ireland Executive Minister, Danny Kennedy, and family members of the ten Protestant workmen who were killed in the 1976 Kingsmill massacre in south Armagh.  I invited the families to meet me in Government Buildings to allow me hear at first hand about how their lives have been affected by one of the worst atrocities of the Troubles.  On 16 October next, I intend to meet the Northern Ireland Executive Minister, Arlene Foster, and the families of victims of paramilitary terrorism from the community of south-east Fermanagh.  My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, met the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, in Hillsborough on Monday, 17 September last.  I understand the Secretary of State will be in Dublin in the coming weeks, diary arrangements permitting.  I hope to have an opportunity to meet her.

Has the Taoiseach been kept up to date with what happened at certain parades in north Belfast over the summer?  He will be aware that tensions have been very high in the North, and in north Belfast in particular, since 12 July.  I am sure he will have seen footage of an incident in which a band played sectarian songs while marching in circles around St. Patrick's Church.  Another very big parade is planned for 29 September next in commemoration of the centenary of the Ulster Covenant.  That is also proving extremely problematic.</p>

However, the heart of the problem of contentious parades is still the refusal of the Orange Order and the loyalist institutions to enter into face-to-face dialogue with residents groups.  It is critical that the Orange Order moves in that respect.  That dialogue has to happen.  Will the Taoiseach talk to us about this?  I take it as read that he is following and has followed the events in north Belfast closely.</p><p><a name='N3'>  I am glad that the Taoiseach met the Kingsmills families.  I want to raise with him again the issue of the Ballymurphy families which Deputy Gerry Adams has raised with him time out of number.  The Taoiseach indicated previously a willingness to meet these families.  I ask him today to give a date or timeframe for that meeting.  As I told him before, the families are more than happy to travel to Dublin to meet him, if that would be more convenient.  They are understandably anxious because what happened in August 1971 in &quot;The Murph&quot;, as it is called, is clearly a matter of public interest, in particular the behaviour of the Paras - the Parachute Regiment - at the time.  The outgoing Secretary of State, Mr. Owen Paterson, MP, took the view that an inquiry into these matters would not be in the public interest.  It is very important that the families, the Nationalist-republican community and society at large understand the Taoiseach is prepared to meet the families and intervene.</p><p><a name='N4'>  I hope the Taoiseach will meet the new Secretary of State, Ms Theresa Villiers, MP, very soon.  My colleague, the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, met her last week.  There is a list of issues that need to be raised with her, the case of Mr. Pat Finucane being one, as well as the ongoing stubbornness in the British system as regards the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the Ballymurphy massacre, which I mentioned.  In addition, there is the continuing and festering issue of the imprisonment of Ms Marian Price and Mr. Martin Corey who find themselves in a completely unacceptable situation where it seems due process has been set aside comprehensively.  Ms Price, as the Taoiseach knows, is very unwell.  There are other issues relating to the transfer of fiscal powers which perhaps the Ceann Comhairle might allow me to raise at a later stage.</p>  
<!-- Snippet ref: R00200 type: 1 --> <a name='R00200'></a> <p><span class="speaker">The Taoiseach:</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=&HouseNum=&MemberID=580"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Enda Kenny"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=580&pid=EndaKenny&year=2012&month=09&day=25"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Enda Kenny"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N5'>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  Clearly, the events to which she refers, with which we are well acquainted, show how just one incident can have enormous implications, not only in Northern Ireland but throughout the entire island and beyond because of the coverage they are given.  One incident has the potential to destabilise a process into which so many have put so much time in recent years.</p><p><a name='N6'>  Clearly, the parade commemorating the Ulster Covenant on 29 September will be a central part of the decade of centenaries which the two Governments are agreed should be marked in as sensitive and an understanding a manner as possible.  The Minister, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, is chairing the parliamentary committee of the Houses in that regard.  It is particularly important in the run-up to 29 September that there be local engagement by all of those involved, as the Deputy rightly points out.  There is no point in criticising the Parades Commission.  That is a distraction from the main issue of ensuring there will be no further incidents which can lead to destabilisation, particularly among young people.  As the Deputy knows, all of these things lead to a highlighting of the necessity to address sectarianism and all what it means, and also the importance of improving community relations across the board.  We will concentrate on this in so far as we can assist.</p><p><a name='N7'>  I met the relatives of those killed in and the survivors of the Kingsmills massacre.  I was absolutely struck by the genuineness of Mr. Alan Black and his account of what had happened in being hauled out of a van, the voice of the booted person involved who said, &quot;Right,&quot; and the18 bullets being pumped into his body.  Subsequently, he could see people's faces being blown off - ordinary workmen - after the instruction was given to put a gun to the heads of those lying there.  Their grief is as strong today as anybody else's.  I had to assure the relatives, the families and Mr. Black that we did not have any priority in terms of loss.  For everybody who lost a loved one or a family member, that speaks for itself.  He made the point that they were ordinary workmen on their way back to Bessbrook.  They had no other intention, but this was clearly a retaliation and an assassination of perfectly innocent men, one of whom happened to be a Catholic.  I found the meeting to be a powerful engagement with people who had, in some cases, never been to Dublin before, who certainly had never been in Government Buildings before and who had not had the opportunity to meet personnel from the Government.</p><p><a name='N8'>  I would be happy to meet the Ballymurphy residents, either in Dublin or Belfast when I travel there.  It is just a matter of making the arrangements.  As I said, I have to meet a number of other groups.  The Minister, Ms Arlene Foster, MLA, is coming down with another group from south Fermanagh soon.  I will meet the new Secretary of State and there are a number of issues that clearly need to be follow through.  The view of the Government, as Deputy McDonald is aware, has not changed in respect of the recommendation of Judge Cory on the public inquiries and I made this perfectly clear to the relatives of those who had been shot at Kingsmills.  I look forward to meeting the new Secretary of State to discuss a number of these issues.  I do not want to comment on the medical condition of any person.  The question of people in detention has been raised with me on a number of occasions and it is an issue I will certainly consider raising with the Secretary of State.  </p><p><a name='N9'>  With regard to the next meeting of the North-South body, there will be a range of issues which we can discuss here before we have that meeting.  I will be happy to progress them in the best way possible.  Again, if the Deputy wants to make contact with my Department, I will be happy to let her know when we can meet the Ballymurphy residents, either here or in Northern Ireland, whichever is the more suitable or appropriate.</p>

That is partly the issue here and illustrates the degree to which, as recent events have proven, we have to remain actively involved.  We must remain actively involved because things can go very wrong very quickly.  During the violence that broke out in north Belfast, 45 PSNI members were treated in hospital.  It was quite a significant disturbance.  </p><p><a name='N3'>  The issue of parades is very important and in my view, both sides have played around with the Parades Commission.  The British Government deserves to be censured or criticised for allowing the previous commission to lose credibility.  They ran it down, essentially, if the truth be told.  With the agreement on the devolution of justice, a new dispensation was promised.  In fact, DUP and Sinn Féin representatives committed to a new order in terms of the organisation and regulation of parades and to engaging in a proactive way.  However, that seems to have fallen down.  One gets the feeling we are reverting to the kind of situations we experienced in the previous decade with Drumcree.  We want to avoid all of that if at all possible, and there is an onus on everybody to get involved.</p><p><a name='N4'>  Has the Taoiseach received detailed reports from our people in the diplomatic service and on the ground regarding the dynamic of what is happening now in north Belfast?  What does the Irish Government intend to do, with the Secretary of State and the British Government, to support the communities and the political parties in developing a new framework which would avoid the unacceptable behaviour that was witnessed in north Belfast in recent times?  In that context, the parades issue is extremely important.</p><p><a name='N5'>  I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach met a delegation to discuss the Kingsmill massacre.  That was an extraordinarily vicious and horrific crime, sectarian in intent and in execution, which ranks among any of the atrocities, of which there were many, in the North.  There is a need for transparency concerning that particular incident and for some attempt to proactively respond to the families of those who were murdered.  The Provisional movement and Sinn Féin have a role to play in that and should take a proactive lead in responding to their concerns, because their anger, sadness and sense of loss is still very raw.  By any yardstick, this was a heinous crime that stands out in terms of its brutality and sectarian intention.</p><p><a name='N6'>  I met the Ballymurphy residents on a number of occasions when I was Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Taoiseach has been asked on a number of occasions to meet them and I think he should do so.  He has not been able to meet them in Belfast to date but their offer to come to Dublin to meet him should be availed of because it would be useful for him to meet them in advance of his meeting with the Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers, MP.  However, I do not think he should meet them just for the sake of it.  When I met them I came away - having also spoken to Sinn Féin representatives and others - with no clear sense of where the issue was heading.  I am a great believer in having someone come up with an approach that will meet the needs of the families.  That was an appalling massacre.  The British Government has concerns regarding another Bloody Sunday-type inquiry but there are other ways to get a quick, objective assessment of that situation, perhaps by using an international grouping at the outset to do a scoping review of it and give an initial assessment.  I have put that idea forward in the past but there may be differences of opinion among those concerned as to the best way forward.  None the less, there is no point in just going on and on with meetings unless we have a pathway out of this that will achieve closure for those involved.  That is extremely important.</p><p><a name='N7'>  The key issue arising from the events of the last few months is the need for dialogue.  Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív has been very active in representing the prisoners in Maghaberry Prison; the issue there is that the regime is out of step with what has occurred in recent times in the North.  The danger is that a situation will develop there that will become a catalyst for activities on the streets and outside the prison that do not need to happen.  From my understanding of it, the issues at play can be resolved if there is political will on the part of the Executive, in whose hands the responsibility lies, given that the devolution of justice has now occurred.  Informed interventions can prevent this from getting out of control.</p>

With regard to the last point raised by Deputy Martin concerning Maghaberry Prison, I have heard different reports as to what is the best thing to do.  I believe progress can be made and as part of the aforementioned briefing, I hope to acquaint myself with more of the details of the situation.  It is true that nothing can be taken for granted; as I said to Deputy McDonald, the incident which resulted in 45 PSNI officers being injured, some seriously, speaks for itself as to how quickly matters can get out of hand.  I would not like to think there would be a drift where Northern Ireland issues are concerned.  As issues arise and become prominent, they focus attention and there must be constant engagement and interaction here.<br><br>  I met a number of members of the Ballymurphy community last year at the presentation of awards, one of which they won in the community development category for a play they staged.  However, that was nothing other than a cursory talk to the effect that they would like a meeting, to which I agreed at that time.  As I said to Deputy McDonald, I will arrange that as soon as I can.<br><br>  I assure Deputy Martin that I have asked all Ministers who are involved in the North-South Ministerial Council to continue to be active with their counterparts in Northern Ireland so that there is no drift and to ensure that where issues arise, they are addressed.  In addition, I hope that what the Ceann Comhairle and the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, William Hay, MLA, have been working on in respect of a parliamentary forum will come to fruition.  That will<b>&nbsp;</b>be an aid to understanding communities North and South and will be a valuable addition when it comes together.<br><br>  It is important, whenever people wish, to have further discussions in the House about the Northern Ireland situation as it evolves, in part because of the decade of centenaries and what that involves, but also to deal, where we can, with those issues that have the potential to destabilise communities.  There is no disagreement among Members on these matters.</p>

It is extremely worrying that 14 years after the Good Friday Agreement was signed, when power-sharing structures and a power-sharing Executive were set up, sectarian divisions in Northern Ireland are still so deeply entrenched, and that such extreme tensions exist between sections of the two communities in the North.  Unfortunately, this bears out the analysis that some of us made at the time - that, far from overcoming sectarian division, the structures that were set up institutionalised it.</p>

Unfortunately, that has been seen clearly in recent weeks in the various pronouncements from within a supposed government where the sectarian divisions are themselves reflected.  Is it not also true that the structures have not delivered for ordinary people in terms of transforming their lives, given the mass unemployment, poverty, homelessness and many social ills that are as prevalent now or worse than they were 14 or 15 years ago?  Whereas the vast majority welcomed the end of the futile, horrific paramilitary campaigns and the activities of the British army also, working class people and the poor continue to suffer.  The reality is that elements on both sides are deliberately stoking the flames.  Some forthcoming events such as the Ulster Covenant march on Saturday, 29 September are a source of tension in Belfast in particular.  We must be clear that there is a right to march, as there is a right for residents not to be intimidated in their communities by marchers on either side.  I put it to the Taoiseach that the most fundamental right of all is for the working class people in Northern Ireland not to be dragged back again into a sectarian nightmare.  The Kingsmill massacre - the Taoiseach correctly met the survivor and relatives of the victims - was one of the worst atrocities but, unfortunately, only one in very dark years.  Who wants to go back to that?  It appears that some elements do, who must be isolated and resisted and their policies overcome.</p><p><a name='N3'>  Is the Taoiseach aware that there is a hopeful and important sign pointing to a way out in that a week after the Ulster Covenant march there is a march in Belfast by the Youth Fight for Jobs organisation supported by the biggest trade unions, Unite, the Northern Ireland Public Service Association and other unions?  It commemorates the 80th anniversary of the outdoor relief workers' strike in Belfast in October 1932 when in the face of horrific conditions Protestant and Catholic workers united in an important struggle for rights and justice and got huge support across the community which united the community for an important period.  I put it to the Taoiseach that a united march of youth, trade unionists and activists from both communities, which hopes to go through both the Shankill Road and the Falls Roads as a symbol of the unity that is needed between Protestant and Catholic working class and youth, is a development that should be supported and is a pointer towards the idea that it is a united working class and communities being empowered in that way that can overcome the sectarian divisions as well as address the horrific social evils of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, which are a source of further tension and a result of the present system that, unfortunately, does not offer a future for young people.</p>  
<!-- Snippet ref: T00200 type: 1 --> <a name='T00200'></a> <p><span class="speaker">The Taoiseach:</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=&HouseNum=&MemberID=580"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Enda Kenny"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=580&pid=EndaKenny&year=2012&month=09&day=25"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Enda Kenny"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N4'>The points made by Deputy Higgins are all relevant.  Nobody wants to see a return to rioting or sectarian violence.  I fully agree with him that those communities do not want to be dragged back, as he said, into sectarian violence which ruined so many lives and communities.  The very young people who were involved in some of the most recent rioting are too young - some were not born - to remember the bad situation that applied over much of the previous 30 years in various locations in Northern Ireland.  It is true to say that the development of the economy and the creation of jobs and job opportunities is the single biggest benefit that can happen for any community where young men and women have the opportunity to find a job and contribute to their community.  Everyone can agree on the necessity for constant interaction with communities and support for those people from both sides of whatever divisions that exist to work incessantly with young people to show them that there is a positive way forward.  I was in areas in Belfast in the past 12 months where extraordinary community activists and workers go out of their way all the time to persuade young people from whatever background to take the opportunity to live their lives and not to go the wrong road too early in their career.  That is very important and it is why I fully support and will continue to work for continued funding both from the United States and Europe in that regard.  That is why I signed the strategic partnership agreement with Prime Minister Cameron.  This country faces serious economic challenges and so too does Northern Ireland.  I agree with Deputy Higgins that the worst thing that could happen is the loss of hope for young people in communities where they see no development taking place.  That is another reason why both in respect of the parliamentary forum and the North-South Ministerial Council we will continue to work with colleagues from the Assembly and the Executive to, as it were, assist where we can in the development of those issues that are helpful for communities.  I hope the Ulster Covenant parade will go off peacefully and, as I said to Deputy McDonald, that there is engagement and interaction at community level before it takes place so that disruption can be minimised and, hopefully, will not take place at all.<br><br>  I am aware of the march Deputy Higgins mentioned in respect of the outdoor relief strike.  I hope it is a positive engagement to show the political process the necessity for effective investment to create jobs.  It is fair to say that when one travels to Belfast now much of the city has been transformed into a modern, welcoming city which has had extraordinary economic benefit from the tourism aspect of the <i>Titanic</i> and due to the major sporting engagements that have taken place there.  The development of a new stadium in Belfast will have implications not only for facilities in the immediate term but I hope also in the longer term when the country either unilaterally or in conjunction with Northern Ireland can offer facilities for major international sporting events in the years ahead.  Those are things that will stand to Northern Ireland and its people and are a measure of the distance we have travelled as an island in recent years.<br><br>  It is not the case that everything is by any means well - I share the views of Deputies opposite that it is necessary to keep a constant engagement, involvement and understanding and to provide assistance where possible.  It takes leadership and engagement at local level and support for such personnel to prevent the kind of rioting we have seen for many years.  We will do what we can in so far as we can impact on that.  The Government will do that with the government across the water and the Executive and Assembly.  I am happy to hear from Members of this House at any time who are aware of issues that may arise that need the attention of Government.</p>

All of us, whatever side of the argument or the historical dispute we came from,  were too close to it.  In order to have credibility and be effective in delivering for victims, communities and survivors across society, a process must be credible from the start.</p><p><a name='N3'>  I agree with the Taoiseach that during the past 14 years the North has been utterly transformed.  The Orange state is gone.  There is a new order although, of course, it is not perfect.  Issues of social deprivation and poverty are acute in many areas throughout the Six Counties.  We have raised the issue of transfer of fiscal powers a number of times for the simple reason that we recognise that for the Assembly and the Executive to deliver for communities, tackle the issues of unemployment and stimulate the economy to do everything that needs to be done, those powers must be held locally and exercised by people elected to position in the North.  I urge the Taoiseach to give strong consideration to this matter and to take a strategic interest in it, as Taoiseach of this country.  Fiscal transfer would give very many additional levers to politicians, of whatever stripe, to make decisions they are currently prohibited from making.  </p><p><a name='N4'>  I refer to the parade on 29 September to mark the centenary of the Ulster Covenant.  We all agree that in the coming years each of the landmark dates, whether the Covenant, the Dublin lock-out or the 1916 Rising, must be marked and celebrated in a way that is inclusive and commemorative but which also looks towards the future, and I welcome the Taoiseach's comments in that regard.  However, in light of what happened in north Belfast during the course of the summer this particular parade gives rise to significant concern.  Its route has been lodged - as the Taoiseach knows this is organised by the Grand Orange Lodge - and it proposes to pass by two particularly sensitive points.  One is St. Patrick's church on Donegall Street, where there were incidents during the summer; the other is St. Matthew's church on the Newtownards Road, again a location where, on countless occasions, the Parades Commission's determinations were breached.</p><p><a name='N5'>  I return to the central point, which can be sorted out if there is dialogue.  The value of dialogue around parading issues is probably seen most notably in Derry, where the Apprentice Boys march has been very successful because there was a willingness to engage.  However, as things sit now, there is almost an axis of political unionism and the UVF which is refusing, point blank, to engage.  What, if any, contact has the Taoiseach had with political unionism, with the leadership of the DUP, the UUP, the Grand Lodge of the Orange Order or any other organisation, to urge them to see dialogue as the way forward?  There are 3,600 parades in the North, a phenomenal number.  A very small number of these remain contentious, the reason being that local communities expect us and the system to respect the commitment made to them in the Good Friday Agreement that they can live free from sectarian harassment.  Will the Taoiseach pursue that?</p><p><a name='N6'>  I refer to his comments on Marian Price and Martin Corey.  I should also have mentioned Gerry McGeough, a third person being detained.  I ask the Taoiseach not to underestimate for one second the corrosive effect of holding people when procedures have been set aside in this manner, and the potential for damage in terms of public confidence.  The worst case scenario is that cases such as this can become a rallying point for the very people to whom Deputy Higgins referred.  Aside from that, there is a basic human rights issue here in respect of all these matters.</p><p><a name='N7'>  Given that we have been discussing parades and communities working together, I wish to put on the record of the Dáil that year on year - I particularly note north Belfast - republicans and community activists have put in a mighty effort to keep things stable.  It is worthwhile acknowledging that effort and that work.</p>

Some fair points have been made in terms of the Good Friday Agreement and the transformation, at one level, in the political framework.  However, the social and economic dimension has not been built upon.  Many people live in areas where there is much unemployment and where significant socio-economic deprivation still prevails.  In west Belfast alone, for example, a recent survey showed that one of every two children born in the area is in poverty.  The same applies to loyalist communties.  I was involved with others in endeavouring to bring them into mainstream civic society but that was based around an economic plan to deal with the considerable unemployment among loyalist youth.  Many in loyalism were neglected in many respects by their own own Unionist hierarchies or communities, although there have been some changes.</p><p><a name='N10'>  Both Governments must act where there are flashpoints.  The fact remains that, unfortunately, the number of peace walls has increased.  We are not tearing down these sectarian or &quot;peace&quot; walls, as they are called - they are still in place, unfortunately, in spite of the great work by communities on the ground, as has been stated.  The Taoiseach has met them; so have I.  Our Department of Foreign Affairs has been most proactive in supporting them by funding and I ask the Taoiseach to ensure this is maintained.  The funding is not large but at least it supports communities to maintain reconciliation and peace-building efforts.  However, a major initiative is required to ensure the reverse does not happen for young people and those in various communities who are in danger of being sucked away, or into alternative activities we do not want.  The only way to combat that is by a genuine movement in terms of an economic and social dividend that reaches into those communities.</p><p><a name='N11'>  One of the disillusioning factors involved in the negotiations around the devolution of justice was the degree to which even other political parties were excluded by the two main parties, the DUP and Sinn Féin.  If one spoke to the SDLP, the UUP or the Alliance Party, one heard they were being brought in very late in the day to what we might call Cabinet &quot;considerations&quot;.  It was unthinkable on our part that Ministers would not receive, for example, Cabinet memos.  That was the scene two or three years ago.  It has improved since but there is the sense there were those who were in on the decision-making and those who were on the outside and this reflects back out into the community.</p><p><a name='N12'>  The parades issue needs both Governments to work again with the parties.  I would be sceptical in some respects because this was a Holy Grail issue for many years.  When it suited the parties to come to an agreement they did so, when it did not they resiled from the agreement.  It is important that both Governments ensure that an independent adjudication process is in place that has credibility and teeth and will hold, irrespective of whatever factors there may be.  We are in danger of a slide unless something fair, objective, independent and resolute occurs.</p>

The Orange Order must talk to the Catholic communities.  Equally, the Catholic communities affected must talk to the loyalists in recognising that there are rights on both sides but also a right above all not to be dragged back into sectarian divisions.</p>

Congratulations to the Ceann Comhairle for his part in that.</p><p><a name='N10'>  Deputy McDonald raised the question of the transfer of fiscal powers.  This is an issue I look forward to discussing with Secretary of State Villiers and, on the next occasion, with the Prime Minister when I have a chance to talk to him.  Proportionately speaking, it is fair to say there has been an enormous public sector in Northern Ireland for very many years and given the way the digital world has moved, things have changed in so far as the delivery of services is concerned.</p><p><a name='N11'>  In respect of the covenant, I genuinely hope that between now and March there will be engagement from local community leaders because that is where this will be sorted out.  I agree in respect of the Apprentice Boys in Derry.  This is about dialogue, conversation, understanding and building trust and where that is applied, leadership must see to it that it is applied in the interest of everybody.  Flashpoints in Belfast or in any location add immeasurably to the destruction of goodwill and the breakdown of that trust, which is so important for the development of communities.  St. Patrick's church and St. Matthew's church are in areas that have seen eruptions previously and I genuinely hope that between now and then this can be prevented.  The Deputy is aware of the visit of the Orange Order here recently.  I had discussions with them about the importance of this, and they made their case in the Seanad.  I thank the Deputy for those comments.</p><p><a name='N12'>  On Deputy Martin's point about the Good Friday Agreement, it did bring stability and the socioeconomic investment is critical for jobs.  There is nothing worse than the destructive corrosion of hope where people see no opportunity to have a chance to work.  While the funding has never been exceptional, as the Deputy pointed out, it is important and I hope to keep that in place.</p><p><a name='N13'>  I agree the parades require authenticity and transparency in their independence in the way they make their decisions, and that they be respected.  These are issues with which I have no disagreement.</p><p><a name='N14'>  To answer Deputy Higgins, the situation about unemployment both here and elsewhere is not the way we would like it to be.  While recent figures show an increase of 17,000 jobs in the private sector and a reduction in the public sector unemployment is still much too high.  The co-operation we show with the Executive, for instance, in giving it the benefit of our experience of visits to China for investment and in meeting with representatives of the Northern Ireland Executive, Senators, Congress people in the United States in respect of potential investment or opportunities for investment is a measure of the co-operation that we show but also of the hope that while Northern Ireland competes with the Republic in terms of attraction of inward investment for job creation, and there have been serious discussions about changing the corporate tax rate in Northern Ireland which is a matter for the Executive, we show a genuine degree of co-operation on improvement of the opportunities for jobs and so on.  The traditional relationship that existed here for trade where businesses in the South tested the product from Northern Ireland for market value before moving on to Britain has changed with the opportunity within the Single Market of a much larger population but there is a great deal of cross-Border activity and cross-Border trade.  That is what we like to see, and all of that should be legitimised.  As the Deputy is aware, some activities are taking place that are not in the interests of our economy or of Northern Ireland.  In so far as the opportunity for investment continues in the North, we are supportive of giving the Executive the experience we have had of attracting industry here because it works both ways.</p><p><a name='N15'>  The points made by the Deputies opposite are valuable for me as we prepare for further engagement with the Executive and the representatives of the people.</p>

Yesterday, we got the news that Bank of Ireland has hiked its interest rate by half a percentage point.  The net effect of this is that people who are just about meeting their mortgages are put under huge pressure and moved into the terrain of mortgage distress.  Without warning and without any increase in the ECB rates people received letters yesterday telling them that the rate had increased by half a percentage point.  That means, for instance, that someone with a €200,000 mortgage will be paying approximately €50 more per month.  That is an additional €600 each year which people have to find.  Has the Taoiseach or the EMC been in contact with Bank of Ireland on this issue?  Did he know it was going to happen?  Did the EMC realise this was about to happen?</p>

It is important to state this is a commercial decision on the bank's part.  The State only owns 15% of Bank of Ireland.  It is not the case that the Government is in a position to issue orders to any bank in respect of commercial decisions on interest rates.</p><p><a name='N7'>  It appears that the fluctuation in interest rates is coming to an end.  It seems that most of the rates are coming into the range of 4.3% to 4.5%.  For example, AIB's rate stands at 3.5%, that of the EBS is between 3.95% and 4.45% - depending on the loan-to-value ratio - while the position with regard to Bank of Ireland is similar, with a rate of between 4.3% and 4.5%.  In addition, the rate of the ICS is between 4.6% and 4.8%, that of KBC is 4.25%, NIB, 4.35%, the PTSB, 4.35% and Ulster Bank, 4.5%.  Any increase in interest rates creates a difficulty for people.  What one does not want is the development of a situation where losses on tracker mortgages are being funded by increases in interest rates for variable mortgages.</p><p><a name='N8'>  The State obviously has a real interest in persons with mortgages which are either in arrears or distress.

The Deputy's supplementary question relates to interest rates, but it refers to a commercial decision on the part of the bank in question.  As stated, however, the Government has a 15% share in Bank of Ireland and it is not a case of our ordering it or any other bank to reduce interest rates.  I would like to believe an interest rate reduction being passed on by the European Central Bank is designed to ease pressure on people.  However, the matter to which the Deputy refers relates to a commercial decision taken by Bank of Ireland.  The Government has given support to those mortgage holders who bought their houses when there were enormous surges in the price of property and who are experiencing particular pressures.</p><p><a name='N11'>  The Deputy referred to the Cabinet sub-committee on health, details relating to the membership of which I have provided.  A range of issues has been dealt with in the context of reform, be it in respect of the establishment of the implementation group on universal health insurance, the introduction of universal primary care and the risk equalisation scheme and the legislation to be put in place in 2013.  As the Deputy will be aware, the special delivery unit became operational in September 2011 and has had a significant and valuable impact on reducing the number of patients on trolleys in hospitals.  The overall surgical waiting list decreased by 7% in the past year, while the number of those waiting for over 12 months is down by 85%.  In addition, the backlog of 58,000 medical card applications was cleared by the end of April.  The development of chronic disease management programmes, particularly for diabetes, is also in train.  When the chief medical officer of the Department of Health was making a presentation some time ago, I was struck by his assertion that we could be faced with the possibility of there being up to 300,000 in this country in the future with diabetes.  The vast majority of the cases of diabetes to which he referred are preventable by means of adjusting people's attitudes, diets and patterns of activity.  An enormous information campaign on the part of the Government will be required in this regard.  There are so many other matters to which I could refer, including the case we discussed previously, namely, that of the cystic fibrosis unit at St. Vincent's Hospital which opened in July and provides between 20 and 34 inpatient beds for persons suffering from cystic fibrosis.</p><p><a name='N12'>  I cannot inform the Deputy about the detail of the discussions which take place at meetings of Cabinet sub-committees.  In general, however, the areas I have outlined in the context of the sub-committee on health are those which are acted upon as part of the strategy to change the health system to ensure better delivery and more effective care for every patient.  Such a system will come into being when the universal health insurance model applies at the end of the Government's term of office.</p>

On 2 August last, the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, was advised by a journalist from <i>The Sunday Times</i> that a senior executive in the agency, Mr. Enda Farrell, purchased a five bedroom house in Dublin last December from the agency's portfolio in a private deal without the property being put up for sale on the open market.  NAMA's response was to appoint its internal auditor, Deloitte, to carry out a review of the transaction.  The newspaper ran the story on Sunday, 5 August.<br><br>  On the question of the property transaction, Deloitte subsequently found that the National Asset Management Agency approved the transaction without apparently realising that the purchaser was one of its employees.  The agency stated the failure of Mr. Farrell to disclose the transaction was a breach of its internal procedures.  Incredibly, it appears there is no explicit rule in place to prevent NAMA employees from entering into private deals to purchase agency properties.  This position needs to change.  <br><br>  This story should have set alarm bells ringing in the National Asset Management Agency and Department.  The response from NAMA, in appointing its internal auditor to carry out an investigation, was entirely inadequate.  However, the story gets much worse.  During the course of the review carried out by Deloitte, evidence was found that pointed to the removal by Mr. Farrell of confidential commercial information from the National Asset Management Agency.  High Court proceedings were initiated by the agency in this regard and lawyers for NAMA told the High Court that the information had been taken in a premeditated way over a number of months.  This raises a number of serious questions about the internal control and governance arrangements in the agency.  How is it possible that information of such a commercially sensitive nature and pertaining to more than 11,000 loans, with a nominal value of approximately &#8364;74 billion and underpinned by approximately 16,000 properties, could be compromised in this manner?  The very essence of the work of NAMA was potentially compromised by the breach of confidentiality surrounding this information.<br><br>  It is my understanding that the information technology controls in the National Asset Management Agency prohibit the sending of e-mails to personal accounts, for instance, Hotmail, Gmail and Yahoo accounts.  However, as the recipient e-mail address in this case was a professional services firm with which NAMA engages in some work, the e-mail left the agency and was received.  Recently and belatedly, NAMA referred the matter to the Garda Síochána.  On 5 August, the day this story broke, I immediately called for the matter to be referred to the Garda as it was always one for Garda investigation.  Offences under the National Asset Management Agency Act are criminal offences.  It was never adequate for NAMA to carry out an internal inquiry into the private sale of one of its properties to an employee without the property being placed for sale on the open market.  In the course of the investigation into this matter it subsequently emerged that highly valuable commercial information had been potentially compromised.  This issue is of extreme importance and goes to the heart of the role of the National Asset Management Agency.  Members of the Oireachtas and citizens have placed their faith in the agency fulfilling its role.  NAMA is among the largest - if it is not the largest - property portfolio owners in the world.  It is entirely unacceptable to have information of this nature potentially compromised in this manner.<br><br>  If, as the lawyers for the National Asset Management Agency have stated, this was done in a premeditated fashion over a number of months, it calls into question the governance and control arrangements in the agency.  It is well past time the Minister appointed an independent person to find out exactly what took place in this case and carry out a root and branch review of the governance arrangements and control procedures that apply in the agency. </p>

<!-- Snippet ref: AA00100 type: 1 --> <a name='AA00100'></a> <p><span class="speaker">Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan):</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=&HouseNum=&MemberID=821"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Michael Noonan"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=821&pid=MichaelNoonan&year=2012&month=09&day=25"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Michael Noonan"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N2'>I fully support the swift and decisive actions of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, in dealing with this allegation as there should be no question but that NAMA employees are working in the best interest of the taxpayer.  NAMA became aware of the particular transaction involved on 2 August 2012.  On 3 August 2012, NAMA instructed its internal auditors, Deloitte, to carry out a comprehensive investigation into the transaction.  The Deloitte review established the sale of the property was transacted at market value as the sale price was in accordance with an independent valuation at the time of the transaction.</p><p><a name='N3'>  NAMA requires its entire staff to complete a disclosure under section 42 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 outlining all assets, liabilities and interests which they hold.  Each employee is also required to inform the agency’s chief executive officer of any changes to his or her disclosure.  He or she must also immediately inform the chief executive officer of any matter that could raise a question about his or her suitability to act as an officer of NAMA or that could result in an actual or potential conflict of interest with respect to his or her duties or obligations as an officer of NAMA.</p><p><a name='N4'>  However, the investigation found that the former employee did not disclose this transaction to NAMA at any time either prior to or following the transaction.  During the course of the Deloitte investigation, NAMA also became aware that confidential data may have been taken without authorisation from NAMA by the former employee.</p><p><a name='N5'>  I wish to inform the House that a thorough investigation has now been completed.  I am advised that the unauthorised disclosure was notified to An Garda Síochána and the Data Protection Commissioner on 12 September 2012 and that NAMA has provided, and will continue to provide, all information required by the Garda as part of this investigation.</p><p><a name='N6'>  I am also advised that NAMA has instituted legal proceedings against the former employee and his spouse seeking a number of reliefs including an injunction to prevent them from using, disclosing and/or dealing with confidential information.  NAMA is also seeking several court orders, including an order directing the former employee and his spouse to provide a full account on affidavit in respect of all confidential information that either of them has removed from NAMA.  This is to include the identity of all persons who have had access to the information or who have been made aware of its existence and/or contents and the identity of all persons to whom the information has been supplied.</p><p><a name='N7'>  These proceedings are within the jurisdiction of the courts and I am, therefore, not in a position to discuss them further.  NAMA's swiftly instigated investigation demonstrates how seriously it viewed the allegations raised in early August regarding the purchase of a NAMA property by a former employee as well as the level of adherence to statutory and other disclosure requirements by the former employee.</p><p><a name='N8'>  I am also advised that NAMA already employs a wide range of measures to prevent unauthorised disclosure of confidential data.  These include practical measures such as the deployment of e-mail monitoring technology to prevent e-mail attachments from being forwarded to personal and non-corporate e-mail accounts.  IT controls also ensure that data cannot be saved from the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, network on to external storage devices such as USB keys, CDs, etc.</p><p><a name='N9'>  NAMA employees are bound by several statutory obligations in respect of the confidentiality of information to which they have access by virtue of their employment.  These include obligations imposed under section 14(1) of the National Treasury Management Agency Act 1990 and under section 202 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009.  NAMA staff are also subject to the provisions of the Official Secrets Act 1963.  Contravention of these statutory obligations constitutes criminal offences and, under section 7 of the National Asset Management Agency Act, a person who commits such offences may be liable to a substantial fine, a term of imprisonment or both.</p><p><a name='N10'>  It is unfortunate that in spite of these wide-ranging controls and obligations, NAMA has suffered a breach of trust.  I take comfort in the fact that as part of its review of Deloitte's findings, the board of NAMA will assess whether there are any changes required to NAMA's current data control and compliance procedures.</p>

However, I disagree with him that NAMA made a swift and decisive response once the information was brought to its attention.  The Minister stated the contravention of provisions of the National Asset Management Agency Act are criminal offences.  NAMA is not a competent authority for investigating possible criminal offences.  This matter should be referred immediately to An Garda Síochána as soon as it was brought to the agency’s attention.  That is what I called for on 5 August.  NAMA delayed by appointing Deloitte to do an internal review.  Subsequently, only when further evidence emerged was the matter referred to An Garda Síochána.</p><p><a name='N12'>  The practice of NAMA engaging in the private sale of assets under its portfolio without putting those properties up for sale in the open market stinks.  It needs to come to an end.  Will the Minister make that one practical change immediately?  As the Minister knows, the gentleman in question, Mr. Farrell, on leaving NAMA went to work for Forum Partners, a property management company, as its Ireland representative.  I am making no allegation as to how information may or may not have been used.  However, the potential was certainly there for commercial information of an invaluable value to be used for commercial advantage for one or more parties.</p><p><a name='N13'>  What we need to get to the bottom of now is where all of this information ended up.  This is information concerning over 11,000 loans with a book value of over €70 billion and 16,000 properties.  Where is that information today?  In whose hands did it end up?  Since the information was leaked from the agency, is there any evidence of transactions from which persons could have commercially benefited?  These questions need to be answered quickly.  The Minister should carry out an independent review of what happened in this case, as well as into the wider control procedures and governance arrangements at NAMA.  There was a catastrophic failure of procedures in this case.  It could yet have potentially negative consequences for the agency and taxpayers.  We need to get to the bottom of it and ensure nothing like this happens again.</p>

ESB Networks told me last week that on average 300 families a week in the greater Dublin area are being disconnected.  It then takes them an average of five days to be reconnected.  The payment, for which these families must borrow, beg or find, also includes a €89 charge for disconnection, as well as a €89 one for reconnection.

These schemes offer discounts to customers who are in need rather than the typical Irish case of offering discounts to the staff of the ESB.</p>

I appeal to the Government to step in to ensure no one is cut off from his or her electricity supply as a result of a genuine inability to pay.  I appeal to all agencies to co-operate with customers and start accepting new payment structures.  Cutting off the electricity supply of families which are genuinely trying to meet their payments should not be an option.  Customers are trying their best to be responsible, with thousands opting to have pay-as-you-go meters installed in their homes as a way of dealing with energy bills.  However, this option is not on offer to those who are already in trouble, but these are the ones most in need of pay-as-you-go meters.  Will the Government seriously consider addressing the three energy suppliers on this matter?  This is happening on the day when Bord Gáis announced that it had to recruit 90 new debt collectors recently.  We are focusing our energy in the wrong places.  We need to be more compassionate.  Energy suppliers must do everything they can to ensure the most vulnerable, those most in need, including struggling families, are helped and assisted to pay their bills.  These are outstanding debts that most families want to pay in a structured and more stable environment.</p>

The regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, an independent statutory body with no ministerial role or function in this matter.  However, other than in vacant premises which account for approximately one third of disconnections, I am concerned about any level of disconnection to customers.  The CER is a statutorily independent body established under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and has responsibility for overseeing the regulation of Ireland's electricity and gas sectors.  It promotes competition in the electricity and natural gas markets in order that customers can ultimately benefit from competitive pressures and prices.  It also protects the interests of customers, especially the disadvantaged and the elderly, by ensuring standards of services are set and codes of practice are in place to protect consumers.  I am well aware that some consumers are having trouble meeting their electricity bills owing to challenges facing the economy at this time and the fact that gas and electricity prices are increasing as a result of a significant rise in the price of gas worldwide.</p><p><a name='N5'>  I had asked the regulator to work with all electricity and gas supply companies to implement initiatives to ensure disconnection for non-payment of accounts would not take place where customers were experiencing genuine financial hardship and had either entered into a payment plan agreement or had agreed to the installation of a pay-as-you-go meter, as appropriate.  The code of practice with the regulator holds that if consumers install a pay-as-you-go meter or if they enter into a payment plan, they will not be disconnected.  The meters are available, but we need to improve the rate of take-up.</p><p><a name='N6'>  The CER has introduced several initiatives in respect of a disconnections policy.  These include updating the guidelines for the disconnections code of practice, reducing the costs and the allocation of the costs of disconnection and reconnection for domestic customers.  Instead of the customer bearing the entire cost, these costs are now shared equally between the supplier and the customer.  This is an interim measure effective until December this year.  The regulator is also working with the energy supply industry on interim prepayment solutions and has consulted on the challenges of so-called debt hopping with the industry and other interest groups.  These groups include the MABS, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and so on.</p><p><a name='N7'>  In October 2011 the regulator introduced a process of debt flagging into the change of supplier processes.  Debt flagging will encourage customers and suppliers to address arrears in an upfront manner and hence prevent the accumulation of further debt and possible disconnection in the future.  The regulator has also proactively facilitated a pay-as-you-go metering system, also known as a prepayment meter, in the natural gas and electricity industries to allow customers to manage their bills more effectively.  The pay-as-you-go metering system is being rolled out throughout the country by all suppliers.  In addition to providing a useful budgeting tool for customers, suppliers are required to offer customers facing disconnection the option of a pay-as-you-go meter where this is suitable, instead of proceeding to disconnect the customer.  In these circumstances the customer's outstanding debt is placed on the meter and repaid over time.</p><p><a name='N8'>  In late 2011 the regulator carried out an audit of the guidelines for the code of practice on disconnections to see if suppliers were in compliance.  The audit ensured all suppliers had implemented the guidelines.  In the case of all examined domestic customer disconnections, the suppliers had exceeded the regulator's requirements in terms of timing of communications to customers and the numbers of attempts made to engage with customers prior to disconnection.</p>

Under the code, anyone who finds himself or herself with a difficulty in paying his or her ESB bill has the option of using a pay-per-hour meter as opposed to being cut off.  Some 300 families are being cut off in the greater Dublin area every week.  We are suggesting these 300 families are choosing to be cut off rather than using a pay-as-you-go meter.  This makes no sense whatsoever.  My information came to me by accident last week from a gentleman from ESB Networks who happened to be installing an electricity connection in a unit on the main street in Ashbourne.  He was able to detail the differences between the three service providers.  I suggest, therefore, that code of practice is not working.  Will the Government arrange for some communication with the CER to ask those responsible to examine the cases of the 300 families most recently cut off in the greater Dublin area, why they were cut off and whether they were genuinely offered pay-as-you-go meters or the opportunity to pay their bill or the outstanding debt over a longer period?  Will the Government ask the CER to sincerely reconsider the figure of €89 that people are charged for the luxury of having their ESB supply cut off and, more important, whether it will reconsider the figure of €89 they are charged to have to it restored?  While I appreciate we are now sharing costs, the price of the service being provided is outrageous for those who are already in considerable distress.  There is no family in the country which is having its electricity supply turned off which is not in distress.</p>

The accumulated arrears at the time are put on the meter and cleared over a period.  It is important that the Deputy has raised this issue at this time of the year.  The net point is that we should try to increase the uptake of pay-as-you-go meters or prepayment plans.  Under the protocol, where these are in place, the supply companies may not disconnect.  Many factors are involved.  The supply companies, whether it be ESB Networks or Bord Gáis, although they are State companies, have a commercial remit and are now operating in a competitive marketplace.</p><p><a name='N12'>  I am concerned about the second point the Deputy made.  That matter is covered in the remaining part of my script and relates to the length of time it takes to make a disconnection.</p>

Broughan"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N7'>As the Minister will be aware, I welcomed the publication of the Report of the Pyrite Panel in June, given that it finally provided some recognition of the seriousness of the problem of pyrite-affected homes in north and west Dublin and, indeed, in the north mid-Leinster region.  However, the position remains urgent.  In a recent email briefing from the chairperson, of Pyrite Action, Mr. Peter Lewis, he described how thousands of innocent people are living in houses and apartments which are literally crumbling around them.  As a group representing affected homeowners, Mr. Lewis stated Pyrite Action is increasingly hearing stories of both potential dangers and received injuries as a direct result of living in buildings which are becoming increasingly damaged and unsafe.  Recent reports include the skim on ceilings falling down and narrowly missing children, doors falling from kitchen cupboards and, in one case, a child was badly cut by a falling shower screen.  Households are also being left with no functioning toilet.  With the winter coming, families are wondering again about the safety of using gas fires and central heating given that pyrite causes radiators to come loose and moving floors buckle the pipes.  Where there is damage to external walls or window frames, it is next to impossible to keep the heat in.</p><p><a name='N8'>  The Report of the Pyrite Panel provides a valuable technical analysis of the enfolding pyrite disaster and it estimates that more than 12,250 ground floor dwellings in 74 estates across the country could be contaminated by pyrite.  Of these, so far approximately 850 have made a claim with a guarantee provider and approximately 1,100 have been remediated or are in the process of being remediated.</p><p><a name='N9'>  However, there are some concerns that the report by Mr. Brendan Touhy and the Pyrite Panel may still underestimate the scale of the pyrite catastrophe.  Over the years since 2007, I was given estimates of up to 60,000 units being affected.</p>

Broughan"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N11'>On the basis of reports of persons who had worked in the industry.  There are 24 key recommendations in the report and that is what I really want to ask the Minister about.  On publication, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, gave important stakeholders, including the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, the Irish Insurance Federation, the Irish Banking Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation and HomeBond, a deadline of the end of September 2012 to come together and respond with a comprehensive solution for all pyrite-affected homeowners.  There are five days to go until the end of September.  Can the Minister give us an interim report on this and tell us whether all of the stakeholders engage with the process?</p><p><a name='N12'>  One of the striking notes in the report, as the Minister will remember, is that the experience of the Pyrite Panel in dealing with the financial, legal and insurance sectors was hugely disappointing.  For example, the report states on page 105 that &quot;the Panel was amazed to learn that little or no discussions about the pyrite issue and its resolution had taken place within the representative bodies (or, indeed, the professional institutions), prior to the Panel seeking the views of the relevant bodies.&quot;  Will the Minister commit to give significant Dáil time in coming weeks to report on the outcome of these negotiations that he has been having with the representative bodies?</p><p><a name='N13'>  If there has not been full engagement by all the stakeholders involved, the report recommends the imposition of a levy on the industry to get the pyrite problem sorted.  As the action group has rightly stated, if the stakeholders are not willing to provide a solution the levy must be imposed as quickly as possible.  Has the Minister finalised plans for a process of imposing a levy on stakeholders who will not engage?</p><p><a name='N14'>  Recommendation 2 in the report proposes an identification system for clarifying affected housing of red, amber and green.  As the Minister will be aware, red represents a house which requires immediate remediation, amber represents one which requires ongoing monitoring and green represents a house which requires no further action.  Concerns have been raised, however, that all houses that have been identified as contaminated by pyrite will not be remediated.  I understand, also from the Pyrite Action group, that the phrase, &quot;significantly damaged&quot; has yet to be defined and the campaign group believes that the owner of any pyrite-affected whose damaged house is in the amber category will be left with a home that he or she will never be able to sell.</p><p><a name='N15'>  In addition, homeowners are worried that pyrite-affected homeowners are already being blacklisted by banks and insurers.  The action group has asked that the Minister provide an immediate commitment to ensure that all homes containing reactive pyrite are systematically remediated and asks whether he has taken any steps to ensure mortgage providers and insurers are not blacklisting developments.</p>

We now have a comprehensive picture of, rather than speculative figures on, the nature of the problem.</p><p><a name='N18'>  The report comments on the lack of engagement by stakeholders with homeowners in providing effective solutions for homeowners.  It recommends the constructive engagement by the key stakeholders, including the construction and quarrying sector, insurance industry and banking and mortgage providers, in processes that will lead to a resolution for homeowners.  Immediately on receipt of the panel's report, I met the key stakeholders and outlined to them my preferred option for a solution to the pyrite problem and the role I believe they should play in the resolution process.</p><p><a name='N19'>  Mindful of the difficult situations faced by affected homeowners and of the time they have waited for a resolution to the pyrite problem until I set up the panel, I set a tight deadline of the end of September for the stakeholders to come back to me with their proposals.  There are still five days to go and I live in hope that they will come back with the proposals.</p>

There are other homeowners who have potential pyrite problems who have been identified and this is where the National Standards Authority of Ireland will be able to give the necessary assurance or otherwise.  Certainly, we are conscious that one who has a potential pyrite problem does not want to escalate publicity about these matters because it has an implication for the value of one's property.  We have a sensitive issue to deal with in respect of homeowners, particularly those who paid a great deal for those properties and who have mortgage problems arising from it.</p><p><a name='N27'>  We are working through these recommendations and next week I will review the submissions I received from the stakeholders.</p>

Unfortunately, given the history of this horrendous disaster for many thousands of householders, it is incumbent on the Government to be prepared to take vigorous action.</p><p><a name='N4'>  With regard to the Minister's plans for property tax or the household charge for next year, and for budget 2013, recommendation No. 13 in the report of the pyrite panel is that pyrite-affected homes be exempt from the property tax until such time as those homes are remediated.  Does the Minister agree with that recommendation?  This exemption, while not a solution, should be granted immediately.  Pyrite-affected developments should be treated as unfinished estates, which is what they are.  Therefore, it is reasonable that there would be an exemption in this regard.  Is it the Minister's intention to provide for that this year and with regard to any future property tax?</p><p><a name='N5'>  Can the Minister give us an update on the NSAI's examination of pyrite testing standards, which he mentioned briefly in his response, and on the development of a remediation method statement for the certification of pyrite homes?  As the Minister will accept, it is key for the future that householders will be able to provide a certificate to a purchaser stating the house was remediated fully and is in good condition.  This is a key part of the Minister's responsibility.  Is the Minister going to provide up-front funding to any proposed remediation scheme to reflect the State's failings in this matter?  He has said it is not the State's responsibility, but the local authority and the State were there when these huge building programmes were undertaken, when we were building perhaps one third of the total output of countries such as the United Kingdom and approximately four or five times the output of countries such as Sweden, and when regulations were not being implemented.</p><p><a name='N6'>  A recent Fingal County Council notice sent to me, 216A, related to the quarry at Bay Lane, Kilshane, Dublin 11.  Astonishingly, it found that no further action on planning grounds was required by the owners, Irish Asphalt Limited.  Fingal County Council sent me a copy of that finding, but did the Minister receive a copy of it?  As the Minister is aware, there was consultation on the Fingal quarries recently, but the quarry at Bay Lane, Kilshane, was the main interest. </p><p><a name='N7'>  I welcomed the Minister's announcement of an information helpline and an e-mail contact address for families affected by pyrite.

I refer in particular to the parents of students attending Heywood community school in south County Laois.  I remind the Minister that this school was founded in 1990 as a result of a forced amalgamation by the then Department of Education of four schools, the Salesian college Ballinakill - the site of the current Heywood school - the Brigidine convent, Abbeyleix, Abbeyleix vocational school and the Presentation convent, Durrow.</p><p><a name='N19'>  The catchment area of the new Heywood community school was drawn up in accordance with the catchment areas of the four former schools.  This was agreed at the time, and I was part of the negotiations as a Deputy for Laois-Offaly.  I remind Members that this was not an easy amalgamation.  It was mandated by the Department and it took some time to bring about the support of the parents, students and people of County Laois.  Now we have seen that agreement unilaterally torn up by the Department of Education and Skills in a way that has given rise to serious frustration.  Already, the school has lost six first year students.  Three students from the village of The Swan, in County Laois, have no bus ticket.  Parents in the Raheen, Shanahoe area of County Laois are in dismay, as they have been told that their children must attend school in the large urban area of Portlaoise.</p><p><a name='N20'>  We are seeing unilaterally on the part of the Department of Education and Skills a breaking of the traditional links between rural areas and rural schools and a breaking of the historic links between rural families and their schools.  Students with brothers and sisters attending Heywood community school, which currently has approximately 700 pupils - one of the largest secondary schools in County Laois - have been told they must attend another school.  Students in south County Laois have been told they must attend schools across the border in County Kilkenny.  I mean no disrespect to the people of County Kilkenny, but I urge the Minister to share my sense of frustration at students being told they cannot avail of school transport and that they cannot attend their local school - a school with 700 students which was the result of a forced amalgamation and the closure of three schools - despite the guarantees given.  Students on the other side of County Laois are being told they must attend school in the larger urban area of Portlaoise.  Again, Portlaoise is many miles away from them and has no historic or traditional links for them.</p><p><a name='N21'>  I want the Minister to review this matter.  I want him to comment in particular on the mistakes that have been made, with particular reference to the measurement of the areas.  My information is that the measurements ascertaining the revised catchment districts refer to the old school in Portlaoise, which is at least 1,000 m from the new school.  The Minister will be aware that parents enrol students in secondary schools in January and buy uniforms, books, tracksuits, iPads - in the case of Heywood - and so on.  They have already attended to these needs by the time they are told in August that transport is being cut and that the students are in the wrong school.  This is unacceptable and I ask the Minister to address the issue.</p>

<!-- Snippet ref: EE00100 type: 1 --> <a name='EE00100'></a> <p><span class="speaker">Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Ciarán Cannon):</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=&HouseNum=&MemberID=2253"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Ciaran Cannon"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=2253&pid=CiaranCannon&year=2012&month=09&day=25"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Ciaran Cannon"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N2'>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  The school transport programme is a significant operation.  Bus Éireann, which manages the programme on behalf of the Department, covers more than 82 million km per annum as it brings children to and from school.  In the last school year, approximately 114,000 children, including more than 8,000 with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to schools throughout the country.  The school transport network involves approximately 4,000 vehicles, which between them cover more than 82 million kilometres each year.</p><p><a name='N3'>  The Deputy is referring to the changes to school transport eligibility for children attending post-primary schools which took effect from the beginning of the this school year.  The main objective of the Department's school transport scheme is to support the safe transport to and from school of children who would have difficulty travelling, for reasons of distance, to their nearest school if such transport were not supported.  That is the ethos that pertained when the school transport system was initially introduced and it is the ethos that pertains to this day.  Changes in the post-primary school transport scheme were announced in budget 2011 by the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government.  As a result of one of the changes that took effect from the start of this school year, the use of the catchment area system as a means of determining eligibility ceased for all pupils newly entering a post-primary school.  From the start of this school year, school transport eligibility for all new pupils entering a post-primary school is determined by reference to the distance they reside from their nearest post-primary school or education centre, having regard to ethos and language.  This eligibility criterion will be applied equitably on a national basis.</p><p><a name='N4'>  In general, children who were eligible under the former catchment boundary area system will retain their transport eligibility for the duration of their post-primary education cycle, provided there is no change to their current circumstances.  Siblings of these children and other children who are not attending their nearest school may apply for school transport on a concessionary basis only in accordance with the terms of the post-primary school transport scheme.  In order to allow parents ample time to consider the school options, a 20-month gap was allowed between the announcement of this measure and the time when parents needed to apply for school transport for this school year.  In addition, these changes were posted on the Department's website in October 2011 and the updated scheme was made available on 1 February 2012.  In addition, the Department contacted post-primary schools and the relevant education partners directly on two occasions to advise them formally of the changes.</p><p><a name='N5'>  The general approach of the Department to the planning of school infrastructure is to plan on the basis of attendance of pupils at their nearest primary schools.  Consequently, those primary schools feed into attendance at the nearest post-primary schools or the nearest post-primary centre generally.  The changes announced in post-primary school transport services are in line with this approach and will ultimately result in a more efficient and cost-effective scheme.  While it is the prerogative of parents to send their children to the school of their choice, eligibility for school transport is to the nearest school, having regard to ethos and language.  Deputy Flanagan used the phrase &quot;local school&quot; on a number of occasions.  I suggest that when we are organising the school transport system, the phrase &quot;local school&quot; must mean the nearest school to one's home.  That is particularly true at this time of severe economic difficulty.  If the Deputy has an issue with the system of measurement used by Bus Éireann to assess exactly how far a school is from a person's home - I gather he has - I will work closely with him to ensure measurements are taken to determine eligibility on a fair and accurate basis.</p>

He referred specifically to transport "on a concessionary basis" in accordance with the terms of the scheme.  I ask him to elaborate on the future of the concessionary scheme.  Could a student who has attended a school for a year find himself or herself without any transport to that school?  Does the Department envisage that a student in such a position would have to change to a different school midstream, perhaps at the start of second year?  Is he aware that private buses can cost more than €900 per annum?  How many mistakes have been accepted by the Department in cases involving this specific school?  Can he confirm that the measurement used by Bus Éireann relates to a school that is no longer situated at Tower Hill in Portlaoise but is now situated 1,000 metres away?  If that is the case, it indicates to me that the process is not accurate.  What has the Minister of State done since this issue was first brought to his attention after the school year started at the end of August?  How many mistakes have been found by the Department?  Will the Minister of State accept that the measurement is fundamentally wrong?  Bus Éireann's measurement relates to an area that is 1,000 metres from where the school is now situated.  I am seeking clarification on this matter.  The area of Portlaoise that is used for the purposes of measurement is Tower Hill, but the school there has been closed for more than a year.  The new school is located at Borris Road in Portlaoise, which is at least 1,000 metres from the former site at Tower Hill.</p>

Parents should be aware that these seats are made available on a concessionary basis.  If they choose to use them, there is no guarantee that the concessionary option will remain open to them in the future.  Parents will continue to have the option of accessing school transport to their nearest school, if they choose to do so.  The Deputy also asked whether mistakes have been made.  My understanding is that when the distance between a child's home and his or her school is disputed, Bus Éireann uses a specially equipped vehicle that can accurately measure - to within a metre - the exact distance between the child's home and the school.  Deputy Flanagan contends that Bus Éireann used the wrong location within Portlaoise when making the measurement in this instance.  I will undertake to interact with Bus Éireann at the earliest possible time tomorrow morning to ensure such a mistake has not been made.  If it has been made, it will be rectified immediately.</p>

I would like to begin by thanking Members on both sides of the political divide in this House who have given so much time and effort to the development of the amendment I am now proposing.  I thank those in every party who have expressed support for the recommended change.  Few changes matter as much as this.  Most of what we do in this House is about legislation.  By its nature, legislation has to be about delivering for the needs and problems of today.  Constitutional change goes way beyond that.  It gives us a rare opportunity to look at ourselves as a nation and ask if we are truly espousing the correct values.  It gives us an opportunity to assess what we stand for.  Ultimately, constitutional change allows us to consider future generations and ask what Ireland they should live in.</p><p><a name='N18'>  We are rightly proud of Bunreacht na hÉireann.  We are rightly proud to live in a State that is defined by a document which enshrines personal liberty, protects rights and guarantees religious freedom.  Over the decades, the society defined by such ideals has become taken for granted.  We assume our rights and we rarely question the freedoms or guarantees provided to us in the Constitution.  The average citizen does not wake each morning with gratitude for the protections provided to him or her by a document that is nearly 80 years old.  Few people think of the Constitution every day.  In one way, that proves the effect of Bunreacht na hÉireann.  The values it espouses and rights it provides are so intrinsically connected with being a citizen of this nation that we rarely question from where those rights and values come.  The only time the average person really needs to pay direct attention to the Constitution is when it is discovered to be lacking or when he or she needs to rely on it to protect his or her rights.  In the case of the children of the State, it is lacking.</p>

We have had reports such as that on Kelly Fitzgerald and the west of Ireland farmer case, reports such as the Ryan commission report and the Cloyne report, and reports in between, such as Roscommon - in all, at least 17 major reports on gross child protection failings.</p><p><a name='N3'>  Those reports are added to by the achingly sad personal evidence of those adults whose childhoods were poisoned by violence, neglect, abuse and loneliness, those who suffered at the hands of family members, State institutions and religious institutions.  Every person in this House knows now that, for decades, Irish children suffered in their own personal hells, while the system was unable, unwilling or simply unmotivated to do anything.</p><p><a name='N4'>  That knowledge leaves us facing a simple question.  Constitutional law can be complex.  The question facing us is not.  Constitutional language can be subtle and nuanced.  The question facing us is not.  Constitutional change can be contentious.  The question facing us is not.  The question facing us is simple.  Do we believe that the way children were treated in this State represents what we believe to be the values, morals, and ethics of the Irish people?  The answer is pretty simple too.  It is a &quot;No&quot;.  None of us should be proud of what happened to thousands of Irish children since the foundation of the State.  None of us should think that brutality, ignorance and neglect are the attributes that characterise us.</p><p><a name='N5'>  We, as a nation, are fair, decent and honourable.  If one attends any of the citizenship ceremonies which welcome the new Irish to our national family, one will see people proud to be joining a nation that they know stands for something, a nation that has, at its core, a belief that people are equal, that they deserve fairness and that they must be protected from harm.  Until now, we have failed to make sure that those beliefs are adequately expressed and enacted in regard to children.  This referendum is our opportunity to change that.  This referendum is the chance to create fundamental change in how we treat children.  In 50 years, we must hope that no one will pay much attention to Article 42A of the Constitution.  We must hope that it will be assumed.  We must hope that all children will have rights, will be protected and will be treated equally.  We must hope that Article 42A just becomes one more strand in the fabric of Irish life, defining directly and indirectly our belief that children deserve to be enveloped by the characteristics that make us proud to be Irish.  We must hope that, some day, the rights accruing to Irish children will be implicit.  Until then, we must make them explicit.</p><p><a name='N6'>  Some 64 dedicated meetings of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, chaired by the former Deputy and Minister, Ms Mary O'Rourke, and including many Members of this House, including Deputy Ó Caoláin and others, including myself, proposed changes to protect children, to give them legal clarity, to name children's rights at constitutional level and to achieve the right balance with other aspects of Bunreacht na hÉireann.</p><p><a name='N7'>  Since taking office, my Department and I have been working on this amendment, together with the Office of the Attorney General, to make the transition from an Oireachtas committee proposal to a robust constitutional wording and to achieve the right balance, one which will have the desired effect for children.  I pay tribute to the Attorney General and her staff as well as the staff of my Department for the work, commitment, time and effort they have put into the planning and work on the Bill.</p><p><a name='N8'>  The Bill proposes a new stand-alone article, Article 42A, titled &quot;Children&quot;, which will contain a series of provisions and will be put to the people as one, single question for their approval.  I want to emphasise that the Constitution must, of course, be read as a whole.  Changes to the Constitution and the formulation of appropriate wording to achieve the desired change is a complex and challenging task.  The aim of the Government in this case has been to present a coherent proposed wording which will interact, in the manner intended, with the Constitution as a whole.  It has been very carefully balanced in the final draft before us today because the balance to be struck is critical.</p><p><a name='N9'>  The Bill does not remove or diminish the recognition given to the family under the Constitution, nor does it remove or alter the rights and duties of parents under the Constitution to provide, in accordance with their means, for the education and care of their children.  However, it identifies and brings the greatest possible clarity to a number of key areas - for the Oireachtas in future law-making relating to children, for the Judiciary in future decision-making relating to children, but, most important, for all of us as a nation and as a State.</p><p><a name='N10'>  This is an essential amendment for our Constitution which, I hope, following Oireachtas consideration, will be supported by the people on 10 November.  It is a statement about the rights of our children and about our views of Irish childhood now.  This referendum will strengthen the protection of all children from abuse and neglect by putting their safety and welfare at the centre of decision-making; it will support families by reaffirming and underpinning the State's continuing development of early intervention and family support services to protect children in their homes; it will treat all children equally when it comes to issues such as adoption, regardless of the marital status of their parents; and, it will recognise children in their own right by providing, for the first time, an express statement of their rights and giving constitutional standing to the best interests and the views of the child in child care and family law proceedings.</p><p><a name='N11'>  This is a referendum for all children but, in particular, for those children most vulnerable and most at risk.  Childhood does not stand still.  Childhood can be a very vulnerable time and effective and timely decision making for vulnerable children is critical.  We know that the vast majority of children live in loving, caring families and never require the assistance of the State's child protection and welfare services, but this is not always the case.  Some families do need help and support in parenting their children.  This can involve providing help and support to parents by means of family support, including addiction and mental health support and family and individual counselling.  In the more serious cases, however, children may be moved from the family and cared for by people other than their parents.</p><p><a name='N12'>  Over 85% of non-voluntary admissions to care in 2011 were due to abuse, neglect and serious family problems.  In total, at present there are approximately 6,250 children in care placements.  We are very fortunate in this county that over 91% of all children in care are living with a foster family.  Therefore, already in this country, the focus is very much on family care, and more than 2,000 children have been living with the same foster family for over five years.  This amendment is about ensuring the safety and welfare of children, it is about ensuring that those children who need it can have the second chance of a family life and it is about ensuring that, when questions on such issues arise, the best interests of the child come to the fore and their own views on their future are given consideration.</p><p><a name='N13'>  I will now focus my comments on the intent of the different elements set out in the Bill which it is proposed to put to the people on 10  November next for incorporation in the Constitution.  Sub-article 1 states: &quot;The State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall, as far as practicable, by its laws protect and vindicate those rights.&quot;  The Constitution sets out rights for all citizens.  This sub-article will provide, for the first time, a strong affirmation of the rights and protections to be enjoyed by children as children.  It provides that the rights and protections enjoyed by children are to be enjoyed by all children, irrespective of their parent's marital status, while continuing to respect and preserve the rights of the family as set out in the existing Article 41.</p><p><a name='N14'>  The rights referred to are the &quot;natural&quot; rights, which means rights that belong automatically to a person.  They are &quot;imprescriptible&quot; rights - they cannot be lost, they cannot be abandoned.  They include the entire range of rights that all human beings enjoy, in particular, children in their formative years.  Under this provision, the State is required to protect and vindicate those rights &quot;as far as practicable&quot;.  There has been some discussion about the phrase &quot;as far as practicable&quot;.  I want to remind the House that this phrase is standard constitutional drafting and is used in respect of the provision of other fundamental rights in the Constitution, most notably in respect of the personal rights of all citizens under Article 40.3.1°.</p>

This is the sub-article in the Constitution that underpins the Child Care Act 1991 and many of the actions of the child and family support services to secure the protection and welfare of children.  Such actions include applying to the courts for the making of care orders whereby children are placed in foster care, or the making of supervision orders in which the courts can order home visits by social workers or other professionals to monitor a child's care.  Removing this sub-article from the education provisions fits well with having a new article relating to children.  However, while the existing and new wordings have similar content, there are essential differences.  It will continue to be the case that the power given by the Constitution in this area can only be used by the State in very well defined circumstances.  The State can only make use of the power in exceptional circumstances, as under the existing constitutional provisions.  There must be a failure of parental duty towards the child and any failure must involve harm or risk to the child's safety or welfare &quot;to such extent that the safety or welfare of any of their children is likely to be prejudicially affected...&quot;.  This represents a move away from focusing solely on the reasons for the failure of the parents to the impact of the failure on the child.  The Constitution currently provides that where parents fail in their duty to their children &quot;for physical and moral reasons&quot;, the State should intervene.  The proposed wording puts the focus directly on the impact of parental failure on children and their welfare.  This represents a more modern and child-centred approach to this provision.  <br><br>  The actions of the State must be &quot;proportionate&quot; to the harm or risk to the child that needs to be addressed.  This means that a child will only be removed from the care of his or her parents when there is no alternative option which can protect his or her safety and welfare.  The protections apply to all children equally, as explicitly provided for in the use of the phrase &quot;where the parents, regardless of their marital status, fail in their duty towards their child&quot;.  The cumulative affect of this new wording is to place the protection of children at the centre of decision-making, regardless of their parents' marital status.<br><br>  The presence of failure in parental duties towards the child remains a condition of the State getting involved.  The State cannot intervene where such a failure has not taken place.  The new wording focuses on the effect of such a failure on the child.  The wording will not change the assumption in law which is shared in Irish society that the best place for children is with their families.  As I have often said, protecting children and supporting families are simply two sides of the same coin.<br><br>  The referendum explicitly acknowledges the range of responses the State has to consider in protecting a child, including early intervention and family support services, which play a vital role in responding to child welfare concerns, thereby preventing more serious problems arising, with the objective of protecting children in the home and preventing children being taken into care at a later stage.  This amendment is about protecting children and supporting families.<br><br>  Under sub-article 2.2°, &quot;provision shall be made by law for the adoption of any child where the parents have failed for such a period of time as may be prescribed by law in their duty towards the child and where the best interests of the child so require&quot;.  The Constitution does not currently refer to the circumstances where adoption may be provided for in law.  This has created uncertainty in the development of laws dealing with this very important area.  The normal way a child is adopted involves the agreement of his or her parents or guardian, as required by law.  This is to remain the position.  <br><br>  The great majority of children are fortunate to grow up in loving, caring families.  In a small minority of exceptional cases, however, this is not so.  For example, following parental failure and harm to a child's safety and welfare, it may be necessary to place him or her in foster care.  I have referred to the large number of children in foster care, many of whom have been living with the same foster family for over five years, yet only 16 children in foster care were adopted in each of the years 2010 and 2011.  We must ask why this is so.  Currently, the High Court cannot authorise the Adoption Authority to make an adoption order unless it is satisfied that there has been a failure of duty by the parents towards their child, that this failure is likely to continue until the child is 18 years old and that the failure amounts to the parents giving up all rights towards him or her.  Therefore, while it is already the case that a child in care may be adopted by his or her foster parents, in practice - as the figure I mentioned demonstrates - this happens to a very limited extent, in the most extreme of cases, as the test set out in existing law is difficult to meet.  The proposed wording provides for the making of legislation to allow for adoption where it is in the best interests of a child in foster care owing to the serious and persistent failure of his or her parents, irrespective of their marital status.  This change is about giving children in foster care a better opportunity of achieving the certainty and permanency which comes from living in a loving, caring family.  <br><br>  Last week I published the draft adoption legislation which the Government plans to bring before the Oireachtas on the passing of the referendum.  This legislation has been the subject of much discussion and sets out, in detail, the conditions which will apply.  The draft Bill requires that for foster carers to be in a position to adopt a child, the child's parents will have to have failed in their duty towards him or her for three years and have no reasonable prospect of resuming the care of the child.  Furthermore, the child will have to be at least 18 months in the care of the foster parents who are applying to adopt.  The draft Bill will outline the role of the High Court which must be satisfied that the parental failure constitutes an abandonment of parental rights.  It must also be satisfied that adoption is the most appropriate way in which to provide for the parenting of the child.  It must consider the constitutional rights of all parties, including the natural parents where they wish to be heard, but, ultimately, in the resolution of these proceedings the best interests of the child must be the paramount consideration for the court.<br><br>  Sub-article 2.3° allows for the voluntary placement for adoption and the adoption of any child.  This important change will bring to an end the current constitutional situation where children are treated differently on the basis of their parents' marital status.  Under the current law, the only route to adoption for a child whose parents are married is for them to totally fail in their duties towards him or her.  Even if married parents, for good reasons and with the best interests of their child at heart, decide on adoption as the most suitable means for the future care of their child, they cannot achieve this end by giving their consent.<br><br>  Under sub-article 4.1° provision shall be made by law that in the resolution of all proceedings brought by the State, as guardian of the common good, for the purpose of preventing the safety and welfare of any child from being prejudicially affected, or concerning the adoption, guardianship or custody of or access to any child, the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration.  This wording requires the best interests of the child to be the paramount consideration in critical court proceedings relating to a child, including proceedings taken by the State under the Child Care Act relating to child protection, as well as proceedings on adoption, guardianship, custody and access.  The best interests principle is already well established in Irish statute law, including in the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the Child Care Act 1991 and the Adoption Act 2010.  The referendum gives constitutional recognition to this principle.  By so recognising it, it is strengthened when counterbalanced against other constitutional rights and principles that might arise in such proceedings.  This provision will also ensure no future Government can repeal or dilute the existing legislation that makes the best interests of the child the paramount consideration in such proceedings.<br><br>  Sub-article 4.2° is complementary and reads as follows: <ul style="margin-left:20px">Provision shall be made in law for securing, as far as practicable, in all proceedings referred to in subsection 1° of this section in respect of any child who is capable of forming his or her own views, the views of the child which shall be ascertained and given due weight, having regard to the age and maturity of the child.</ul>Similar to sub-article 1°, the aim is to give recognition at constitutional level to the rights of children to have their views heard and given due weight in critical court proceedings in the areas of child welfare and protection, guardianship, custody and access.<br><br>  While the amendment refers solely to critical court proceedings, my Department and I are equally committed to working with others in the development of legislation, policies or procedures to extend this &quot;voice of the child&quot; approach to other spheres of decision-making.  Similar to &quot;best interests&quot;, this principle is already recognised in existing child care and family law and will be included in further legislation in areas affecting children.  These two provisions together will provide for real visibility of children in the Constitution and the decision-making framework of our judges.  <br><br>  The dark stain of child abuse and the failure of those in positions of power to protect children must propel us to listen to children and act in their best interests.  On that day in the High Court, when the judge read the Constitution and made his decision in the Roscommon case, the only persons whose best interests could not be taken into account sufficiently were the children.</p>

This week coincidentally marks the 20th anniversary of Ireland's ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC.  The UNCRC has been ratified by more countries than any other human rights convention, with only two countries not having ratified it.  The principles of the UNCRC are clearly important and we have done much to act on those principles.  Later this year I hope to submit Ireland's update report on the implementation of the convention to the UN.  The change we are discussing today also forms part of the Government's ambitious programme of reform in child protection.  We are reforming child protection laws through the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act, brought to this House by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, and the publication of Children First and National Vetting Bureau legislation and we are significantly reforming child protection services through establishing the new Child and Family Support Agency independent of the HSE.  Each of the reforms is important but none can have the wide-ranging and permanent effect of constitutional change.  That is why this referendum is so important.  In essence, the referendum will help protect children from abuse and neglect, support families, treat all children equally and recognise children in their own right.  I look forward to a positive debate on this important legislation and I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

Last Wednesday was an important day in the history of the State, a day which finally saw the publication of the wording for the children's referendum - the 31st amendment to the Constitution.  I warmly welcome the fact this day has finally come.  The people of this country now have an opportunity for a national debate on enshrining the rights of children in the Constitution.  As we begin this debate it is important to question and to seek clarification on certain issues in order to satisfy ourselves that we are inserting the best possible wording into the Constitution.  In light of that, we have tabled a number of amendments which we feel will enhance and strengthen the wording.  I will outline my rationale for the amendments later in the debate.  We hope the Government will give them due consideration.</p><p><a name='N5'>  I acknowledge the work that has been done in publishing the wording and securing a date for a referendum.  I commend the work carried out by the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and her Department in the past 18 months, which has continued the good work initiated by her predecessors.  The development of child welfare and protection is not something that has only begun in the past 18 months, as some would have one believe.  In that context I wish to place on the record of this House some of the good work that was carried out in the past decade and prior to that.  The Child Care Act 1991 sets out the responsibility and duties of the Health Service Executive, HSE, towards children.  It places a legal obligation on the HSE to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate child care or protection and requires that &quot;the best interest of the child&quot; be considered in all matters affecting their welfare.  It places the emphasis on prevention, early intervention and family and community support, with the removal of the child being a last resort.  The Children Act 2001 is the main piece of legislation governing children within the criminal justice system.  It focuses on preventing criminal behaviour, diversion from the criminal justice system and rehabilitation.  The Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 provided for the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  The Ombudsman for Children must promote the welfare and the rights of children, including advising the Minister on the development and co-ordination of policy relating to children.  Information systems and accountability within the HSE have been improved through the national child care information system.  The Ryan report implementation plan was developed and €15 million was allocated to it.  A total of 256 additional social workers were provided as part of the plan.  Their recruitment was exempt from the moratorium on public service recruitment.</p><p><a name='N6'>  The original commitment to hold a referendum on children's rights was given more than five years ago.  It is disappointing that it has taken this long to come to fruition.  The former Minister, the late Brian Lenihan, introduced an amendment in 2007 but at that time it was decided to refer it to an all-party Oireachtas committee chaired by my former colleague, Mary O'Rourke.  No one knows better than the Minister the sterling work carried out by the committee to ensure consensus on an all-party basis.  In fact, many of her Cabinet colleagues know that to be the case as they were also members of the committee.  In her speech the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, alluded to the fact that the committee of which she was a member had met on 64 separate occasions.  My colleague on my right, Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, the Sinn Féin spokesperson on children, was also a member of the committee.  Extensive work was done by the committee which culminated in an all-party agreement with the final report being brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas in February 2010.  At the time the former Minister of State with responsibility for children, Barry Andrews, worked on putting forward wording for a referendum.  The wording was finalised by the Cabinet in January 2011 but, as we are all aware, the Government fell and it was unable to hold a referendum.</p><p><a name='N7'>  It is wrong to say that no work was done, but it would also be wrong not to recognise that much more work remains to be done.  That is borne out when one considers the publication of the 17 horrific reports that were published detailing the failure of the State to protect the children of the State from abuse by families and religious congregations.  A constitutional change will bring many benefits but it is not panacea, and without appropriate funding it is mere window dressing.  I was pleased to hear the Minister's colleague, the Fine Gael director of elections outline on &quot;The Week in Politics&quot; on Sunday night that this constitutional and legislative change alone will not guarantee child welfare and protection.  He correctly stated, as I have done on numerous occasions, that the changes must be matched by a commitment to additional funding.  Prior to the referendum campaign getting into full swing we must be informed that the Government is prepared to underpin the new rights it is seeking to establish for children in the Constitution with the necessary resources.  The Minister must outline the requirements for additional resources.  She must come into this House and itemise provision by provision where additional resources are required and commit to delivering them.  Could she advise how many additional social care workers will be provided?  In addition, could she outline whether it is her intention to maintain the foster care allowance for foster carers who adopt the children in their care?  Funding is crucial.  That is apparent from a reply I received last week detailing that the percentage of children in foster care and institutional care without a social worker has increased in the past 18 months.  Therefore, it is imperative that a commitment on resources is forthcoming.  I accept that we are in difficult economic times.  However, on the implementation of the Ryan report the previous Administration sanctioned 256 additional social care workers at a time when there was an embargo on recruitment in the public service.  When one talks to front line staff they express the wish to see the aspirations of the referendum matched by the required resources.</p><p><a name='N8'>  The question has been asked as to whether there is a need for a referendum.  We agree with the Government, and have always agreed, with the need for such a referendum.  This is a constitutional provision that will protect the legal, emotional and social needs of all children in this country.  The need for this constitutional change was first voiced by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness in 1993.</p>

Mrs. Justice McGuinesss presented her report to the then Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in 1993.  This matter has been ongoing for a long period and although many changes have been made through legislation this referendum was long promised and is long overdue.  I welcome it today.</p><p><a name='N3'>  In July, the Government's special rapporteur on child protection stated there is no current provision in the Constitution to protect children as autonomous individuals, that their rights are an after-thought and, as such, invisible.  Article 41 of our Constitution recognises the family as the natural, primary and fundamental unit group of society and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.  I welcome that this referendum does not seek to diminish the role of the family.  By inserting Article 42A, thereby enshrining the rights of children, we would recognise the importance of the family and, at the same time, balance that importance with the importance of our children.  The courts will now have to balance the rights of the individual and the rights of the family, as both sets of rights are constitutionally guaranteed.</p><p><a name='N4'>  The new Article 42A.1.1° states: &quot;That the State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall as far as practicable, by its laws, protect and vindicate those rights.&quot;  This is a very specific statement which recognises that all children have natural and imprescriptible rights.  The amendment leaves it to the courts to determine those rights.  The article applies to all children who live in Ireland, irrespective of whether they are citizens.  It also applies a set of distinct rights that will apply only to children.</p><p><a name='N5'>  My party's amendment seeks to replace the word &quot;shall&quot; with &quot;guarantees&quot; as we believe this will strengthen the article.  The amendment proposed in the draft Article 42A.1 should be amended so that it is consistent with the constitutional protection given to citizens under Article 40.3.1°.  That article provides that the State guarantees, as far as practicable, by its laws, to protect and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.  Fianna Fáil believes a similar level of protection should be afforded in a new article in regard to children which would state:  &quot;That the State recognises and confirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and guarantees as far as practicable, by its laws, to defend and vindicate those rights.&quot;  These amendments will ensure that the same protection is afforded to children as is referred to in Article 40.3.1°.  We believe this is necessary and appropriate because it is likely that the courts will interpret children's personal rights as being protected by Article 42A rather than by Article 40.3.1°.</p><p><a name='N6'>  The proposed Article 42A.2.1° states that in exceptional cases where the parents, regardless of their marital status, fail in their duty towards their children to such an extent that their safety or welfare is likely to be prejudicially affected, &quot;The State as guardian of the common good shall, by proportionate means as provided by law, endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard to the natural and imprescriptable rights of the child&quot;.  This would replace the existing Article 42.5 and insert the phrase, &quot;regardless of marital status&quot;, thereby removing the current discriminatory distinction between children of married and non-marital families.</p><p><a name='N7'>  We propose another small amendment and again do so to try to strengthen the wording.  The amendment is to the effect that intervention in exceptional cases, as provided for in Article 42A.2.1°, should be clarified to correspond to the statutory protection afforded to the child under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 and the Child Care Act 1991, which refer to the health, development and welfare of the child.  Our proposal is that this be mirrored in the constitutional protection and that it merely be broadened in order to correspond with the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 and the Child Care Act 1991.</p><p><a name='N8'>  The proposed Article 42A.2.1° is largely similar to Article 42.5 in that it emphasises that intervention may only take place in exceptional cases, which is the case under the current Article 42.5.  Unfortunately, in a minority of instances the best interest of the child is not served by remaining with his or her natural family and in those cases we are duty bound and the State has a moral obligation to replace the family and provide the care needed.  The State must ensure that all possible supports and resources have been made available to the family prior to removal of the child and that this action is undertaken only as a last resort.  The former governor of Mountjoy Prison, John Lonergan, was quoted in a newspaper at the weekend as stating that if the State is serious about vindicating children's rights it must be serious about resourcing and supporting children to ensure their lives do not fall into crisis.  I acknowledge that the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency is a move in the right direction in this regard.</p><p><a name='N9'>  According to the proposed Articles 42.A.2.2° and 42.A 2.3°, respectively: &quot;Provision shall be made by law for the adoption of any child where the parents have failed for such a period of time as may be prescribed by law in their duty towards the child and where the best interests of the child so require...&quot; and &quot;Provision shall be made by law for the voluntary placement for adoption and the adoption of any child.&quot;  This wording introduces adoption into the Constitution for the first time.  The article is an enabling provision and provides for the adoption of children who have been failed or abandoned by their natural parents.  It also provides for the voluntary placement of children for adoption regardless of their parents' marital status.</p><p><a name='N10'>  I am glad the Minister followed my advice and published the draft legislation in conjunction with the wording for the referendum.  Will she clarify that the draft we see before us is what will discussed if the referendum is passed?  On previous occasions draft legislation, as published, has changed by the time it comes for debate before the Oireachtas.  It is important that the Minister gives a clear commitment that what we see today is what we will see if the referendum is passed.  Perhaps she might give an indicative timeline for the passage of the legislation through the Oireachtas.</p><p><a name='N11'>  This is an extremely important element of the referendum and the accompanying legislation should receive priority as it will afford very many children the opportunity of a second chance in life.  I understand that at present there are approximately 1,600 children of married parents in foster or institutional care.  They are living in limbo.  According to current provisions, the child must have been abandoned for 12 months and must prove continued abandonment extending to the age of 18.  This is virtually impossible.  As a result, children are being left in long-term foster care with the prospect of spending all their childhood in this situation.  Foster carers are not legal guardians and many simple decisions, even one as small as taking a family holiday, cannot be made without the consent of the HSE.  The child who is welcomed into the family unit and brought up by a foster family has a different surname.  This is far from ideal.</p><p><a name='N12'>  The wording in the draft Bill as proposed under the new adoption legislation states that marital children will be eligible for adoption once they have been in foster care for a continuous period of 36 months preceding the time of the application, and have been living with the prospective adoptive parents for at least 18 months . The Bill also states there is to be no reasonable prospect that the child's birth parent will be able to provide for the child.  It is important to point out that involuntary adoption will affect a very small number of children in our country and only in exceptional circumstances.  It will have to be proved that the parents in question have failed in their duty towards their children to such an extent as to constitute abandonment of the children's rights.</p>

How will that be done?  It is vague, and the issue of resources will apply.<br><br>  Legislation on adoption is an extremely important aspect of the referendum.  An article by Olivia O'Leary in last Sunday's<i>&nbsp;</i>edition of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>  gave a harrowing account of many young children crying out in the night for their mothers, in need of a loving home and a second chance, when many couples who cannot have a child of their own would sacrifice so much to offer a child a warm, loving, affectionate stable home.  We must see far greater detail on adoption legislation and when it comes before the Oireachtas we will have a greater opportunity to debate it at length.  I have some questions in regard to it.  What level of counselling will be available for parents who wish to place their children for adoption?  Will the adoption board be given additional resources to deal with these new situations?  When will the Minister detail the way the new proposals will operate?  How many foster care children qualify for adoptions?  Will parents who adopt maintain the foster care allowance?<br><br>  In referring to adoptions, the Minister gave a commitment previously to bring forward legislation on information and tracing.  When will that legislation be forthcoming as we are one of the few countries in the western world not to have such legislation in place?<br><br>  I will not read the new Articles 42A.4.1 and 42A.4.2 into the record as my time is limited but both articles are enabling provisions where we will have to bring forward legislation.  When will that legislation be brought forward?  Has it been drafted yet?  Will the Minister indicate a timeframe for it to come before the Oireachtas?<br><br>  In recent days the Minister will have heard two voices expressing concern about these articles.  On &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; last Friday, David Kenny, an assistant professor of law in Trinity College, said that some clarification should be made in the language used to enshrine the consideration of the best interests of the child in Article 42A.4.  He is worried that the Bill does not go far enough to protect the interests of the child, in particular in cases of where guardianship is contested between adoptive and natural parents.<br><br>  I am sure the Government wishes the child's interests to be the paramount consideration in matters of adoption, custody, guardianship etc., and the amendment commands that this be placed in law where appropriate.  It seems clear that while family interests may be regarded in such determinations, what the Government wishes to achieve is a situation where the best interests of the child, assessed independently of other interests,<i>&nbsp;</i>are the primary concern.  Family and other interests would then be considered separately.<br><br>  The problem is that the phrase &quot;best interests&quot; is not new to Irish law.  For instance, section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 states that the best interests of the child shall be the &quot;first and paramount consideration&quot; in matters of guardianship.  However, the courts have interpreted this phrase in a way that does not necessarily put the independent interests of the child first.  The courts have ruled that, in light of the Constitution's very strong protection of the marital family, the best interests of the child presumptively lie with the marital parents.  <br><br>  The leading cases on this point, interpreting best interests in the 1964 Act, are Re J [1966] IR 295; Re JH [1985] IR 375; North Western Health Board <i>v</i> HW &amp; CW [2001] 3 IR 622, which are the most well-known, certainly to me; and N <i>v</i> Health Service Executive &amp; Other [2006] 4 IR 374, otherwise known as the baby Anne case.  I seek clarification that this may lead to a situation where even though the best interests of the child are nominally the central consideration, in reality these are rendered subservient to the interests of the marital parent.  One has to show very strong evidence that the child is not best served by its marital parents before this presumption can be shifted.<br><br>  I believe the Government hopes that this judicial reasoning would be reconsidered in light of the new constitutional language. That may happen, but I do not believe it is guaranteed.  The protection of the family in Article 41 will remain after this amendment has been passed, and it would be open to the courts to retain this interpretation of best interests in light of that.  If a presumption operates in this way, the best interest of the child are not being independently considered, as I believe the Government would like to see happen.  This is not a certain result and the Government's intended outcome could come about.  I am simply not certain that this will be the case and I ask the Minister to clarify it.  This is particularly the case given that the proposed amendment will not alter Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution except in so far as it repeals Article 42.5 and inserts a new Article 42A.2.1.<br><br>  In yesterday's <i>The Examiner</i>, Dr. Conor O'Mahony, a lecturer in constitutional law at UCC, raises a similar point.  He states: <ul style="margin-left:20px">One of the reasons that this amendment is being put forward is that existing legislation, which already provides for the best interests principle and the right to be heard, has been found to be ineffective due to the overarching influence of the constitutional protection provided to the family in Article 41.  In the hierarchy of laws, the Constitution takes precedence over legislation, and legislation falls to be interpreted in light of the Constitution.  </ul>I quote those two independent experts to reaffirm some of my own doubts.<br><br>  I seek clarification also regarding cases not brought by the State for the safety and welfare of the child where the voice of the child should be heard.  I do not know if the Minister read it but a case was brought to my attention this morning involving an article in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> which suggests that such cases would not be automatically entitled to the fourth proposal because the parents, and not the State, are bringing forward the case.  Is that the Government's intention and, if so, what is the reason?<br><br>  I appreciate the Minister will not answer this question today but it concerns a judgment delivered on 3 July 2010, KA <i>v</i> Health Service Executive and Others.  In that judgment it appears that where the State is not bringing forward the case, cases are not automatically entitled to the fourth proposal.  That is worrying.  I am sure the Minister will clarify if that is the Government's intention and, if so, give the reason.<br><br>  At the outset I said we will support this referendum.  I look forward to working with the Minister, all Members of the Oireachtas, the members of the Children's Rights Alliance and the various children's rights groups in a positive manner to ensure that we convey the true message about this referendum but we must be honest and up-front with the people.  It is not a panacea.  It will not fix everything.  I hope the Minister responds to the issues I raised.</p>

It is one that the children of Ireland have awaited far too long.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on bringing forward a formula of words which, if passed, will provide a constitutional amendment acknowledging children's rights, as individuals in their own right.</p><p><a name='N7'>  We in Sinn Féin have called for children's rights to be enshrined in the Constitution for many years.  It is our view that the minimum standard for children's rights within any state or legal system is the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC.  This was the view we set out when the discussions around the enshrining of children's rights resumed in 2008.  It was the view we held when the then Minister of State, the late Brian Lenihan, produced a formula of words.  It was the view to which we adhered during the deliberations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, chaired by former Deputy Mary O'Rourke.  It it was the view we retained when former Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Barry Andrews, produced a formula of words.  The UNCRC must be the document which underpins all of our laws concerning children.  As contributors to the wording that eventually received cross-party endorsement at the joint Oireachtas committee, we were pleased that although it did not directly incorporate the UNCRC into domestic Irish law, it did go some way towards including some of the core elements within it.  I refer, in this regard, to the principle of equality between all children and that the best interests of all children be paramount in matters concerning them.  While the words contained in the final report of the committee, which was published in February 2010, received cross-party support, it is regrettable - it would be a mistake on my part not to say so - that it did not find favour with all who have addressed this matter since.</p><p><a name='N8'>  The Thirty-first Amendment of the Constitution (Children) Bill 2012 does not mirror that wording.  However, I acknowledge that it addresses some important issues for children in Ireland.  If passed, the constitutional amendment will mean that the &quot;natural and imprescriptible&quot; rights of all children will be protected and vindicated.  The precise constitutional meaning of those natural and imprescriptible rights is not clear, however.  There is no accompanying legislation which sets out said rights but it is quite clear to anyone familiar with the Irish legal system and establishment that the Supreme Court will not interpret this to mean that the UNCRC will suddenly be part of domestic Irish law.  The Bill does acknowledge that children do have rights and this is important.  In my view this is a significant step on the road towards ensuring that children's rights, as set out in the UNCRC, will be incorporated into Bunreacht na hÉireann and will become binding upon the State.  We in Sinn Féin do not view this amendment as being a panacea to rectify the myriad ways in which the State has failed to cherish all children of the nation equally.  It is my opinion that the Minister also shares this view.  Sinn Féin sees the amendment as the first step on the road towards incorporating the UNCRC into Irish law.  We hope this will be achieved in due course.</p><p><a name='N9'>  This amendment does not do everything we would like it to but it does have the potential to rectify some of the legal barriers that have prevented the State from intervening in marital families where there is child is at risk or is being abused.  The amendment will readjust the threshold for State intervention and place an onus on the State to support children and adopt a proportionate response to parental failure in order that cases such as the notorious Roscommon abuse case will not be allowed to happen again.  It will also ensure that children who have, in very exceptional circumstances, been totally and utterly failed by their birth families and have been placed in the care of foster families and have formed loving family connections with their foster parents may be adopted by and become the legal children of the latter.  It will further ensure that such children will be entitled to all of the rights and privileges which accompany that status.  There are 6,000 children in the care of the State.  Some of them have been in care for more than five years and have no contact with their birth parents.</p><p><a name='N10'>  The amendment will also accommodate those parents who are married and who, as a result of whatever unfortunate circumstances, may wish to place their children for adoption.  While the State must do everything within its power to help keep families together and ensure that they are adequately supported, there will be those exceptional cases where this will simply not be possible.  In such instances, the child or children must be given a second chance to experience a loving family relationship.  This amendment will have no impact on the definition of the &quot;family&quot; under the Constitution.  It will, however, permit the Oireachtas to legislate to allow abandoned marital children to be adopted if this is in their best interests.  Under this constitutional amendment those children's best interests would be the paramount consideration for the courts.  We cannot underestimate the power of this.</p><p><a name='N11'>  Our only criticism is that this particular constitutional provision means that the courts will not be required to view the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration in cases where there is not a guardianship, or custody or access issue in question.  The provision is specifically drafted to exclude the courts from being required to consider the best interests of the child as paramount where the State is merely a party to a case.  The provision is drafted so that the wording means that if, for example, a parent of a child with a disability takes a case against the State because she or he feels the latter has breached its duties under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act as a result of a lack of special needs assistant hours, the courts will not be required to examine what are said child's best interests.</p>

It is restrictive in that it is quite particular, specific, in the areas in which this particular right will be provided for.</p><p><a name='N3'>  If this amendment is passed either in its current form or as amended in our debates over this and next week in the Houses of the Oireachtas, it is important that the Government gives a commitment that the necessary resources will be provided so that the rights provided to children will then actually be realised.  It will be essential that the legal profession and Judiciary receive appropriate training on the new constitutional and legislative provisions.</p><p><a name='N4'>  I am happy to note that some of the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, have been encapsulated in the Minister's text although Sinn Féin was disappointed with how narrowly they were drawn.  This constitutional amendment will not directly affect most children. It will resolve the outstanding child protection issues and adoption issues for children in marital families, but for the child who is living in poverty, or who has had his or her special needs supports cut, or who is in need of additional educational supports to help them through the school year, this constitutional amendment will not address, let alone resolve, their situation.  We must be clear about what this amendment does and does not do.  Some will be disappointed that it does not go far enough and I would be one of those.  Some will think it goes too far and I would like to address that view.  I believe the vast majority of people will support this constitutional amendment and see it as a real progress and a strengthening of the foundations of our society.  I wish to record that this is how I see it.  It is the reason that I and my party will campaign in support of this constitutional change at the conclusion of the debate.</p><p><a name='N5'>  I have referred to other opinion.  I have read some of the commentary of those who oppose this proposed constitutional change.  As I said earlier, this amendment will have no impact on the definition of the family in the Constitution.  I understand that there are people who will be concerned that this amendment will mean that there will be unnecessary levels of State intervention or that the parent will not be the rightful automatic carer of their children.  I wish to state categorically that these arguments are false and potentially misleading.  While I would like to see a constitutional amendment to change the definition of family in order to more accurately reflect the diverse nature of modern families, this particular proposition will not do so.  It will neither alter nor weaken the constitutional family unit.  The special protection afforded to the traditional family construct in Article 41, will not be damaged.</p><p><a name='N6'>  I call on the Government to ensure that it invests the required resources to inform people as to the reason for this referendum.  It is of the utmost importance that false arguments are shown to be so because what is at stake are children's lives, end of story.  Childhood does not last forever, and for far too long in our society we have seen generations of children grow up without their needs being met.  If this constitutional provision is passed it will mean that the Irish people will have acknowledged that children have legal rights as individuals.  It will be a constitutional acknowledgement that children have the right to be seen and heard, something they did not have in 1937 or since.  It will be another important step forward to a new and enlightened attitude towards children.  For several years and with what has seemed an almost six-monthly regularity, new reports have been published.  Some are historical investigations while others are current and interim.  I refer to the Ryan report, the Roscommon case, the independent child death review group reports, the inspections of the special care homes and the investigations into church dioceses.  It has been a long and sorry litany.  They have made for harrowing reading and we must all have felt ashamed.  We have read the details of who knew of child abuse and when they found out and their failures to act.  People have cried out: &quot;Why did no one say stop?&quot;</p><p><a name='N7'>  This constitutional amendment gives all voting citizens the opportunity to say &quot;Stop&quot;.  It is also about starting anew.  This amendment is not perfect but it is a major step forward.  We in Sinn Féin commend to the Government and to all Members our amendments to the proposed wording.  We have tabled them to help make the wording as strong and comprehensive as possible.  This referendum is a very real opportunity to make further tangible changes to children's lives in Ireland and it is an opportunity that may not present itself again for some considerable time.  I appeal to the Government to look favourably and sympathetically at the proposals being made and to seize the moment and to make this proposed constitutional change the very best and most worthwhile possible.  Whatever the outcome of our debate and deliberations over these couple of weeks, I am happy to confirm now that it is my party's intention to proactively participate in the commendation to the electorate of the 31st amendment of the Constitution.</p>

Sinn Féin welcomes the proposed referendum on children's rights.  As a State and a society, we are all too aware of our abysmal record in terms of the protection of children.  Therefore, any measures and particularly legislative measures which safeguard and protect the rights of children, are significant and important.  Since the foundation of the State and particularly since the enactment of Bunreacht na hÉireann, children and their accompanying rights were essentially subsumed within the rights of the family.  Indeed, specifically child-centred rights are most notable in the 1937 Constitution by their almost total absence.  The imposed invisibility, which is enshrined in law, has had major ramifications for the well-being of successive generations of Irish children.</p>

The current lack of rights for children in the Constitution places significant restrictions on the legislation that may be enacted and on judicial decisions.  Moreover, in many instances, children's rights arise merely as a consequence of their membership of a family, defined in constitutional case law as the marital family.  The proposed legislation, should it pass by way of referendum, will essentially give rights to children in their own right for the first time since the foundation of the State.</p><p><a name='N3'>  We welcome this proposal to acknowledge the rights of children as individuals under the Constitution.  Nevertheless, Sinn Féin has several concerns in regard to specific provisions.  Our first concern relates to language, particularly the vague and abstract nature of sections of the Bill.  The proposed Article 42A, for example, begins thus: &quot;The State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall, as far as practicable, by its laws protect and vindicate those rights.&quot;  While the reference to &quot;natural and imprescriptible rights&quot; already appears in Article 42.5.5, there is no legislative or constitutional precedent defining exactly what these rights entail.  In other words, it will be left to the Supreme Court to define what is meant by such rights.  The lack of clarity in this regard is worrying.  Moreover, while the Bill makes provision for the best interests of the child to be given paramount consideration, this applies only in instances where the State itself has taken a case regarding the child's safety, welfare, guardianship, custody and so on.  Conversely, the courts are not obliged to consider the best interests of the child in cases where the State is a respondent or defendant.</p><p><a name='N4'>  The bottom line is that rights, be they economic, educational, to do with health care, the arts, sports or whatever, cost money.  Unfortunately, as we in this House know only too well, when it comes to cutting spending in crucial areas of social provision which directly impact the lives of children, this Government has no qualms about slashing budgets.  Lone parent households remain at risk of experiencing persistent poverty.  Children of asylum seekers are still subjected to all the negative and destructive aspects of life in direct provision.  Traveller children who benefited little from the boom years remain among the most excluded in Irish society.  Moreover, not only has the State failed to address this appalling situation, it has actively engaged in the reproduction of Traveller inequality and disadvantage through the various educational reforms which eliminated resource teachers for Traveller children.  One in ten children under 17 years of age in this country now lives in consistent poverty.  An additional 20%, or 250,000 children, are at risk of poverty, as are children living in households headed by an unemployed person.</p><p><a name='N5'>  For these reasons, while Sinn Féin welcomes and supports the proposed constitutional amendment, we will continue to oppose the cruel and vicious measures which plunge so many ordinary families, including large numbers of children, into poverty.  It was recently brought to my attention in my constituency that Youghal Town Council has taken upon itself, with the permission of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, to include the foster carer's allowance as part of household income when determining the weekly rent allocation for a council house.  As a result, a constituent of mine who is fostering four and a half year old twin girls has seen her weekly rent go from €32 to €120.  When I contacted the Health Service Executive to inquire about this hike, the staff member to whom I spoke was adamant that it could not be the case.  Likewise, the official at the Department of Children and Youth Affairs with whom I spoke was appalled by what she heard and said it should not have been done.  It seems, however, that such matters can indeed be determined by each local authority and, as such, it is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It is appalling that local authorities are taking so much money from the children for whom this particular allowance is intended.</p><p><a name='N6'>  Child poverty damages children's lives in many ways.  While a lack of adequate income is at the core of the problem, it is the knock-on effects such as exclusion from adequate education and play, poor quality housing and inadequate and delayed access to health care, which make a real difference to a child's welfare and fundamentally determine his or her life chances.  Sinn Féin supports the proposed constitutional amendment and welcomes any measure that enshrines the rights of children in the Constitution.  We remain, however, firmly opposed to Government cuts which negatively impact the life chances of children and their families.</p>

That is not to say I am satisfied with every provision therein or that I do not wish to see it modernised.  However, it does serve to frame the higher principles from which laws are enacted and society is organised.  The inclusion of a section in the Constitution dedicated to the rights of children is essential, particularly in view of the failures by the State over many decades to protect them.  The wording of the proposed amendment has taken time to produce but is well considered and offers a fair balance.  In short, it achieves what it is intended to achieve.  It is, however, merely a starting point and must be seen as such.  If we are to remedy the many failures involving the welfare of children and draw a line in the sand that will not be washed away by yet another scandal, we must construct integrated institutions that are capable of responding to changing needs and risks.  We must resource key services and seek to ensure, in so far as it can be guaranteed, that the children of today and of the future will have better stories to tell than the many tragic stories of the past.  Many of those children were not only robbed of their childhood but suffered serious consequences in their adult lives in terms of opportunities lost.</p><p><a name='N10'>  I commend the Minister on her work thus far and on her open-door approach in regard to consultation.  This referendum must be about one issue only, namely, the welfare of children.  The Minister's approach has reflected that imperative.  I take this opportunity to express my support for the proposal and to encourage support for it.  As others have observed, the passing of this referendum will lead to no immediate changes in practical terms.  It will, however, afford rights the State must assume responsibility for delivering.  I was a member of the Commission on the Family which was established following the second referendum on divorce.  It was a major initiative which took some three years to complete its deliberations.  Some of us found our eyesight was impacted by the volume of material we had to read.  The intention was to consider how families could best be supported in the case of divorce and how the problems arising from marital break-up could be minimised.  Divorce was intended as a second chance for those who wished and needed to avail of that chance.  It was not intended to undermine families, despite some of the scaremongering claims that were a dominant feature of both divorce referendum campaigns.</p><p><a name='N11'>  In accordance with a recommendation of the Commission on the Family, the Department of Social Welfare was renamed the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  This was one of a range of useful recommendations by the commission that were subsequently delivered, including the proposal that a Ministry dedicated to the welfare of children and young people be established.  The Minister might consider whether there is an opportunity in the aftermath of the referendum to consider in a more complete way, by means of a consultation forum akin to the commission, how best to ensure children and young people can be supported.  It is particularly important that such issues remain in focus during these difficult economic times.  It will be necessary to examine how to make best use of resources and integrate services.  I ask the Minister to consider adopting a similar approach to that taken by the Commission on the Family following the passing of the referendum on divorce. </p>

More than 30,000 women and girls were incarcerated in these institutions, endured brutal hardship and worked without pay.  They have lived with the stigma attached to being confined in the laundries, a confinement that was not their fault.  The State has failed these women at every turn.  They are both victims and survivors.  We applaud their courage in coming forward and telling their story, we stand alongside them in their fight for justice and we offer them our profound apology for the failure of the State to protect them.  They did nothing wrong; they were innocent victims of a brutal, intolerant system overseen and enforced by the State and religious orders.<br><br>  The motion has been written with a survivor centred ethos.  Politics has failed the women in question so we have looked to them to tell us what they need and what must be delivered.  By shirking its responsibilities the State has played for time, which the women in question do not have.  We put the Government on notice that this issue and these women will not go away.<br><br>  There has already been ample acknowledgement of the abuse that took place in the Magdalene laundries.  In February 2010, the then Minister for Education and Science, while explaining his  exclusion of the Magdalene women from the residential institutions redress scheme, stated he did not &quot;wish to dismiss the fact that abuse of adults could and did occur in Magdalen Laundries or that the abuse was an appalling breach of trust or, indeed, that the victims of that abuse suffered and continue to suffer greatly.&quot;  Survivors have documented in heartbreaking detail the  violence they endured.  They worked without pay, were kept behind locked doors and were returned by the Garda if they attempted to leave. <br><br>  There is a wealth of evidence in the public domain which shows the State provided direct and indirect financial supports to the laundries.  The Ryan report details the women&#8217;s forced, unpaid labour in the laundries and notes that their working conditions were harsh.  The women were deprived of their liberty and forced to work without pay, which constitutes slavery as defined in international law.  The women and girls also suffered both physical and emotional abuse. <br><br>  The need for acknowledgement and redress has also been set out in the public domain.  In November 2010, the Irish Human Rights Commission found that serious human rights issues arose in the laundries and called on the Government to establish immediately a statutory inquiry into their treatment and provide redress to the survivors, as appropriate.  In June 2011, the United Nations Committee Against Torture recommended that the State institute prompt, independent and thorough investigations and, in appropriate cases, prosecutions in addition to affording redress, compensation and rehabilitation to the Magdalene women.  The women are predominantly elderly and many of them are in ill health as a direct consequence of their incarceration in the laundries.<br><br>  Also in June 2011, the four religious congregations which ran the institutions expressed a willingness to bring greater clarity, understanding, healing and justice in the interests of all the women involved.  Despite this, the State continues to refute its collusion with the same religious orders in the incarceration and forced labour of the women for commercial gain.  It does so despite the fact that its judicial system regularly referred women to the Magdalene laundries. The Justice for Magdalenes group has provided the State with evidence that women and girls found guilty of a crime were referred to the Magdalene laundries and other religious run institutions throughout the State in almost every year following independence until at least 1983.  These committals were far worse than the equivalent prison sentence as the women were incarcerated for periods far exceeding their original sentences.  In many cases, the crimes in question were as simple as the theft of an apple or a pen.  <br><br>  The stigma attached to incarcerations in the Magdalene laundries was horrendous.  It is for this reason, perhaps above all other reasons, that an acknowledgement and a State apology are so urgently needed.  In a Seanad debate in 1960, Senator Connolly O'Brien spoke of the lifelong stigma attaching to a girl sent to the laundries.  She stated: &quot;If I were asked to advise girl delinquents, no matter what offences they were charged with, whether to go to prison on remand, or to go to St. Mary Magdalen's Asylum on remand, I would advise them wholeheartedly to choose prison, because I think having a record of having been in prison as a juvenile delinquent would not be so detrimental to the after life of the girl as to have it legally recorded that she was an inmate of St. Mary Magdalen's Asylum.&quot;  Justice for Magdalenes has also provided evidence dating back to the 1920s of a magistrate's comments that &quot;in many instances offenders have expressed to me in Court a desire to go, in some cases they have begged to be sent, to prison rather than a home.&quot;<br><br>  Women were held in the laundries pre-trial and sent to them after release from long sentences in prison.  Orphaned, neglected or abandoned children and children who did not attend school were sent to industrial schools and their experiences have been well documented.  Religious orders often transferred girls directly from these industrial schools into the laundries.</p>

The Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act 1923 provided a statutory basis for using the Galway Magdalene laundry to confine women seeking public assistance for a second or subsequent pregnancy outside of marriage.  In 1928, the Commission on the Relief of the Sick and the Destitute Poor similarly recommended mandatory incarceration in the laundries for women applying for maternity assistance a second time.  More recently, the 1970 Kennedy report into reformatory and industrial schools details the many reasons why girls and women were placed in the laundries.  It noted the so-called voluntary arrangement for placement could be criticised on several fronts, questioned their legal validity and found that the girls admitted were not aware of their rights.</p><p><a name='N4'>  Those who sought to escape their imprisonment were returned by the Garda, regardless of the reason they had been confined in the laundries in the first instance.  One survivor, telling of her efforts to escape, was asked on her capture by the Garda why had she had tried to escape.  She replied it was because the nuns were cutting her hair and putting her in a hole all the time.  The gardaí involved did nothing to protect her; they simply returned her to the very people who were abusing her.  This is just one example of a vast catalogue of the State's failure to supervise the religious orders' operation of the Magdalene laundries.</p><p><a name='N5'>  Tonight's motion sets out clear support for the work of the interdepartmental committee established under the chairmanship of Senator Martin McAleese.  I do not, however, accept that this committee should be used as a delaying tactic or as a rationale for withholding the apology, acknowledgement and supports that the Magdalene women are due.  The facts of the brutality in the laundries have been established.  The complicity of the State has been established.  The McAleese committee is tasked with quantifying the extent of that collusion.  It must be very clear that the facts of cruelty and State collusion stand established. </p><p><a name='N6'>  This Government, however, hides behind the interdepartmental committee.  It is its last fig-leaf, its last excuse to stand still.  It does this in the full knowledge that time is not on the side of the aging Magdalene women.  The Government offers no apology and refuses even the meagre comfort of their pension entitlements.  Those are the pension entitlements of incarcerated women and girl slaves.</p><p><a name='N7'>  The Government's amendment to this motion is dishonourable.  It dishonours this democratic assembly.  It belies the Government's priority of protecting the State above vindicating the women, the same State that failed thousands of women and girls by holding them in the laundries.  This evening, by failing to support this motion, it tramples on their rights again.</p><p><a name='N8'>  Several years ago, it was a different matter.  In 2009, Labour Party women called for a separate redress scheme for the Magdalene women.  In 2010, Deputy Burton, who was to become the Minister for Social Protection, said she strongly supported justice and restitution for these women.  Deputy Alan Shatter, now the Minister for Justice and Equality, said the State was directly complicit in the confinement of these women and children.  Three current Ministers of State made the very same arguments in opposition yet the Magdalene survivors still cannot even access their pension entitlements.  Where did it all go wrong?</p><p><a name='N9'>  I acknowledge the support for this motion by the Independents and Technical Group Members.  I also welcome Fianna Fáil's support.  I had asked the Government to support this motion because it is couched in language that simply reflects what happened.  However, it has refused to do so and it has refused to give some comfort to the Magdalene women.  Instead, it has chosen to completely ignore the word, spirit and intent of the motion.  The Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party cannot even commit to providing the meagre supports the Magdalene women need now.  These women and girls were stripped of their rights.  They were the innocent victims of a barbaric system.  The State colluded with religious orders to enslave them in laundries run for commercial gain.  Abuse did take place and trust was breached.  These facts have already been established.</p><p><a name='N10'>  I ask for Members on the Government benches to support this motion.  It is one they can support in good conscience.  The Magdalene women deserve the Government's support.  They have suffered for a very long time.  The very least they can expect at this juncture is a unified voice from the Dáil that says to them that we acknowledge and accept their story, we apologise, we will ensure the basic services they need in the here and now will be put in place and we commit to redress.  Time is against us, the clock is ticking and justice cannot wait for ever.</p>

We must all hope that it is also another significant step on the road to justice and truth for the former detainees in the Magdalene laundries.  That will be decided by the Minister and her colleagues in government.<br><br>  I commend the Justice for Magdalenes campaign group for their work.  It has given a voice to women who were appallingly treated over decades.  They were the forgotten women and girls whose lives meant little or nothing to church and State authorities and whose memory was erased by official Ireland.  Until they themselves spoke up through Justice for the Magdalenes, few knew the reality of what they endured.<br><br>  This is no small scandal.  We are talking about the illegal confinement, detention and treatment of thousands of innocent women forced to work in the so-called Magdalene laundries over several decades.  These women had nothing.  They did not know their rights.  They had no one at that time to advocate for them.  Like the children abused in other residential institutions, they were surrounded by a wall of silence and ignorance.<br><br>  I commend to all Deputies the submission from Justice for Magdalenes to the interdepartmental committee in May of this year.  I will cite one extract from it:<ul style="margin-left:20px">The reality is that incarceration in the Magdalene laundries was very similar to being sent to prison.  The survivors clearly express this view.  One recalls, &quot;I felt as if I was being sentenced to a prison.  Indeed, at a certain level I was a prisoner&quot;.  Another says, &quot;Definitely it was a prison.  You get paid in a prison.  But this was a prison.  There was no doubt about it, it was a prison&quot;.  A third says simply, &quot;These were prisons&quot;.</ul>The State resisted calls to establish a prison for young girls similar to the borstal-type institutions for young boys.  The availability of the Magdalene laundries, operated by the Catholic religious orders, enabled the State's Judiciary to use them as an alternative to imposing a prison sentence.<br><br>  With other Deputies in the last Dáil and before, I was proud to support this campaign.  In July of last year, I hosted a briefing session here in Leinster House for Deputies and Senators and their support staff on the issue of the confinement, detention and treatment of thousands of innocent women forced to work in the so-called Magdalene laundries over several decades.  It was the hard work of Justice for Magdalenes that conclusively disproved the State's claims that the women were in these institutions voluntarily or solely at the behest of their families.  That fiction has now been firmly laid to rest, thanks to documents uncovered by Justice for Magdalenes.</p>

It also recommended prosecution and penalties for those who had perpetrated the abuse.  It is regrettable that the Government did not see fit to issue an apology with its announcement of the interdepartmental group to investigate the role of the State.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, said it would be more appropriate to wait until the outcome of the investigation.  Sadly, some of the survivors will be unable to wait that long and they are all entitled to an apology now.  Issuing it would not preclude a further apology when the full extent of the Government's complicity is revealed.  Is it too much to expect that the State would say sorry twice?</p><p><a name='N3'>  The reply to a parliamentary question I tabled last year revealed that three of the four orders involved in running the Magdalene laundries had received a total of €87 million from the HSE in the past five years.  During the so-called boom years the Sisters of Mercy made €165 million in land sales.  The Sisters of Our Lady of Charity earned €61.8 million on the land surrounding the mass grave of Magdalene victims discovered in 1993.  The contrast with the funds available to the laundry survivors could not be more stark: they received no pay for their years of forced labour; they are not in receipt of pensions and they were excluded from the residential institutions redress scheme.  I reiterate our endorsement for the Justice for Magdalenes group's support for the inclusion of the Bethany Home survivors in the schedule to the residential institutions redress scheme.</p><p><a name='N4'>  I appeal earnestly to the Government to withdraw its amendment.  It is not too late to do so.  The motion not only has the stated support of all who have signed it and the further stated support of the Fianna Fáil Party, but I believe it also has the support of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  I call on her to be courageous and stand up and so declare.</p>

The Sinn Féin Party did everything in its power to try to ensure the motion received the support of every Member.  It is unfortunate that we do not find ourselves in that position tonight, but I thank all of the Members who signed the motion and indicated their support for it, especially those in the Technical Group, Independent Deputies and Fianna Fáil Deputies.  Unfortunately, the Government side has seen fit to bring forward its amendment.  However well meaning they try to portray it, it is a matter of regret because this is a missed opportunity for all Members to speak with one voice on behalf of the victims.  As the previous two speakers outlined, the primary purpose of the motion is to keep the issue of the Magdalene laundries at the top of the political agenda and try to finally arrive at a position where the Government will act decisively and swiftly, unlike previous Governments, by providing redress for the cruelty and abuse inflicted on the women concerned, with a much overdue apology on behalf of the State.  Many speakers tonight and tomorrow night will rightly focus on the injustices inflicted on the women of the Magdalene laundries.  </p><p><a name='N6'>  As Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin noted, it is equally important not to forget another dark episode in our recent history.  We are mindful of another group of survivors who were treated in an equally appalling way by the State, that is, the women and children who suffered in Bethany Home.  Like the Magdalene laundries survivors, they have campaigned courageously for an apology and an independent inquiry into what happened in that residential home.  It is important to reflect on what happened.  We know that between 1922 and 1949 more than 220 children died in Bethany Home, of whom some 219 are buried in unmarked graves in Mount Jerome cemetery.  We know that countless others suffered illness and abuse resulting from neglect.  As far back as 1939, there were reports of the abuse that people had suffered in this residential home.  We have heard countless stories of children being insufficiently cared for, going unwashed, sick, neglected and left in soiled nappies for lengthy periods.  This is the most appalling abuse that anyone could put any child through.  Bethany Home symbolises the abandonment of the State's duty of care to women and children who found themselves in institutions.</p><p><a name='N7'>  It is regrettable that the plight of the victims of Bethany Home have been largely ignored and disregarded by previous Governments.  Earlier this year when we were discussing the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill, there was an opportunity to go some way to try to rectify this.  During the debate we brought forward a motion that would have seen the establishment of a separate redress board for the women of the Magdalene laundries and the Bethany Home survivors.  Unfortunately, like the previous Governments which failed to address this issue, the Minister for Education and Skills could not find it within himself to support the amendment.  During the debate he cited the well worn excuses of previous Governments about the potential cost to the State and the fact that the Bethany Home survivors had come from a privately run mother and baby institution and, therefore, were not entitled to redress.  This is all the more regrettable when one considers that there are serving Ministers and Ministers of State on the Government benches who held very different views when they sat on these benches.  For example, in 2010 during a memorial service for the Bethany Home victims buried in Mount Jerome cemetery the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, said it was time for the Government to &quot;do the decent thing and end this outrage&quot;.  These sentiments were echoed by many within her party.  We have heard Deputy McDonald quoting other Labour Party Deputies in this regard.  Now the Minister of State and other Labour Party Ministers who spoke so passionately on behalf of the victims two years ago find themselves in a position to honour what they said to rectify the situation and put an end to the outrage.  It is baffling why this issue has not been resolved before now, given some of the comments the Minister of State has made.</p><p><a name='N8'>  It is more than 70 years since the first reports on events at Bethany Home.  It appears from the Government amendment that once they attained power, those in government, like those in previous Governments, seem more concerned with refusing to face up to the State's responsibility to survivors and that they are willing to wash their hands.  This is despicable - there is no other way of describing it.  The actions of this and previous Governments in comparison to the dignity and integrity of the survivors' groups which have campaigned tirelessly on behalf of the victims bring shame on this and previous Governments.  It is simply unacceptable by any moral or ethical standard that the women concerned are still being denied any official acknowledgement of their suffering.  Just as the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, urged the previous Government, I urge the Government to do everything in its power to end this outrage.</p>

The purpose of this motion is to challenge the Government to act on the immediate measures necessary to support the survivors of the Magdalene laundries based on the information already in the public domain.  To suggest this information is now virtually beyond dispute is almost an understatement.  However, in spite of this the women and girls incarcerated in the Magdalene laundries have yet to receive an apology from the State and official acknowledgement of the injustices that were perpetrated upon them.<br><br>  In his Fifth Report as Special Rapporteur as Child Protection to the Oireachtas, Mr. Geoffrey Shannon states:<ul style="margin-left:20px">The seriousness of the alleged abuses of the rights of these women and girls cannot be overstated.  The allegations of forced labour in the laundries are of particular gravity... The detention and use of women and girls as workers without pay would amount to 'forced labour' under the 1930 Forced Labour Convention of the International Labour Organisation...  It appears from the reports provided by these women and girls that their treatment constituted slavery.</ul>He goes on to note that &quot;The prohibition of slavery is a 'peremptory norm' of international law: that is a norm of state practice which is so fundamental that no derogation from it is ever permitted.&quot;<br><br>  One could talk at length about the appalling injustices and crimes perpetuated against these women, the hopelessness of their lives, the cruelty and violence meted out to them on a daily basis and the lack of humanity which permeated virtually every aspect of their lives, but the fact is that the State is already aware of this appalling catalogue of information.  This, of course, is to be expected as the State itself was actively involved in the perpetuation and reproduction of the Magdalene institutions.  Thus, it is the specific responsibility of the State to make every effort to redress this grave injustice and in so doing, to atone for its past actions.  Therefore, I call on the Government to act without further delay to implement the necessary supports that thus far have been denied these women.<br><br>  A state that continues to deny these women long overdue justice and proper and adequate economic reparation for their forced labour seriously diminishes its own moral and ethical authority in the eyes of all its citizens.  Irish society recognised some time ago the grave injustice perpetuated against these women.  It is time for the Government to do the same and to act without further delay in the best interests of the women concerned and also in the overall interest of Irish society.  It is in the interest of all decent Irish men and women that justice, even at this late stage, is seen to be done and this is in the final analysis the responsibility of the State.</p>

The first duty we as legislators owe survivors is to acknowledge openly and loudly the full extent of the human suffering that went on in these institutions.</p><p><a name='N6'>  The many survivor accounts reveal this.  The basic lack of humanity and compassion evident was made all the more insufferable in that these institutions were set up out of some perverted notion of Christian, Catholic sympathy and charity, that these women must be saved from themselves and from their imagined sins.  Beneath that hypocritical piety, there is evidence through the survivor accounts of what can only be described as a barbaric programme of dehumanisation through enforced manual labour, physical abuse and psychological isolation.</p><p><a name='N7'>  It falls on us in this Parliament, both Government and Opposition, to seek whatever means are at our disposal to provide the justice and redress that has remained out of reach of these women and it is good to see that the interdepartmental committee, under Senator McAleese, is advancing this process.  We do not know the full extent of the State's culpability - we must wait for the committee to report on that - but we know, through the work of Ms Mary Raftery and others, that several State agencies used the services of the Magdalene laundries.  I suspect that we have scarcely begun to get to grips with the State's total responsibility to the survivors, and we have some way to go.</p><p><a name='N8'>  Tonight there will be a &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme dealing with the Magdelene laundries.  No doubt that will produce an emotional response and a sense of revulsion, but it is not enough.  We must do what is practical.  We must do what is demanded by the victims themselves.  The pension component of it is incredibly important to these victims to acknowledge what they went through.  That particular aspect is something that can be practically done and I want to support that in particular.</p>

The scale of what was carried out in the Magdelene laundries is best summed up in the Justice for Magdelenes submission to the UN Committee Against Torture, which states:<ul style="margin-left:20px">the Magdalene Laundries abuse ... involved the unlawful deprivation of liberty of adult women and girls over extended periods, it involved school-age girls being deprived of an education and it involved both women and girls being subjected to forced labour and servitude by private actors.</ul>It is even more galling when these private actors went under the names of Sisters of Mercy and Sisters of Charity.  There certainly was no mercy or charity involved in what the women in the Magdelene laundries went through.<br><br>  This is an important motion and it is a pity that the Government has seen fit to amend it.  The motion has been prepared with the full support of Justice for Magdelenes and it contains three simple recommendations.  The first is that a helpline would be established.  This is simply because many of the Magdelenes would still be suffering and would need ongoing support.  A helpline would be an easy point of access for many of those who still have not come forward and campaigned but who would still be suffering in private, and it would be something of which they could avail and use easily.<br><br>  Access to pensions, another of the recommendations, is vitally important.  It would recognise that these women were forced to work and did a service on behalf of the State.  It would be simple for the Government to recognise their pension rights and credit them with pension rights for the slave labour that they were forced to carry out.<br><br>  An apology, redress and restorative justice - all three - are simple demands and something that no Government should have difficulty in dealing with.  It would not add significant cost to the State to do this but it would be easy and positive and would go a long way to restoring the Magdelenes' faith in the State and in the State's ability to support them.<br><br>  I also support the calls for the Bethany Home survivors to be included as well and redress to be provided for them because that is another shame on society that has been going on far too long.</p>

The first point I would like to make is that Members should be sensitive to the concerns of those who have been in Magdalene laundries.  Both I and the Minister have met with many of the women who have been in Magdalene laundries and I understand Senator McAleese has met all of those who have come forward.  All the women we met told their stories with a great deal of dignity and they deserve our respect.  None of those we met were unmarried mothers and the branding of Magdalene laundries as a place for &quot;fallen&quot; women is a cause of great distress to them.  We have also met with the various representative groups involved and those advocating on behalf of the women.  We have listened carefully to all of them and we understand and share their desire, after so many years, to finally address their concerns and bring closure to this difficult chapter of their lives.<br><br>  I assure the House that the Government is committed to addressing these issues.  We began this process by establishing the interdepartmental committee under the independent chairmanship of Senator Martin McAleese and we are fully committed to addressing these issues once the final report is received.  At all times, we have been conscious of the need to progress these matters as quickly as possible.  I have a lot of sympathy for the position of those who ended up in Magdalene laundries.  I have long held this view and I know many of the women involved and what it meant for them.  They existed in an era where Irish society could be harsh and even hostile to those less fortunate.  It goes without saying, as I am sure many in this House will agree, that life in an institution can be a very poor substitute for the emotional and other support that is normally found in a family setting.<br><br>  Turning to the Government amendment, the main point behind the amendment is that it is premature to have this debate without the benefit of Senator McAleese's report and the factual information it will bring.  The Magdalene institutions that were still in operation when this State came into existence were all run by congregations of nuns.  Like convents, they operated behind walls and closed doors, isolated from the mainstream of the community, and their story has not been told.  The report of the interdepartmental committee will hopefully give us the first comprehensive, objective insight into that world.  I do not doubt the sincerity of the women whom I have met and one must have sympathy with them for the hardships they faced and endured.  Anyone who has read the Ryan report and its account of the industrial school system that operated in this State must be mindful of the possibility of abuses in other institutions run by religious orders.  However, we cannot leap to conclusions without following fair procedures and trying in so far as we can to establish the facts.<br><br>  As far as I am aware, allegations of abuse in Magdalene laundries has never been the subject of scrutiny by the courts, a commission of investigation or tribunal of inquiry, so the facts remain undetermined.  I presume that is one of the reasons that led in June 2010 to the Justice for Magdalenes group contacting the Irish Human Rights Commission and requesting it to conduct an inquiry into the treatment of women and girls who resided in Magdalene laundries.  The Irish Human Rights Commission decided not to conduct an inquiry.  However, in its assessment published in November 2010, it considered that the issues raised warranted a statutory investigation.  It recommended a two-stage approach.  The first stage was to examine the extent of the State's involvement in and responsibility for what happened in the Magdalene laundries.  Then, if State involvement and responsibility were established, a larger scale review of what occurred should take place and in appropriate cases redress should be granted where warranted.  The previous Government did not take any action but within a month of taking office, this Government moved to set up the interdepartmental committee under the impeccable, independent chairmanship of Senator Martin McAleese.<br><br>  Senator McAleese was appointed to the chairmanship of the committee so as to ensure there would be full confidence in the workings of the committee and no legitimate issue could arise with regard to the committee properly fulfilling its mandate.  Both the Minister, Deputy Shatter, and the Government are very grateful to Senator McAleese for undertaking this important task and for the commitment he has shown to it.  From conversation with him, I know his job has not been easy.  Membership of the committee is drawn from representatives of six Departments: Justice and Equality; Health; the Environment, Community and Local Government; Education and Skills; Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation; and Children and Youth Affairs.  Relevant Departments and State offices not represented on the committee have also been contacted with a view to checks being conducted on their records.<br><br>  The committee was set up by the Government to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalene laundries, to clarify any State interaction and to produce a narrative detailing such interaction.  It effectively is carrying out the first examination as recommended by the commission.  It was deliberately decided not to start with a statutory inquiry.  Our experience of statutory inquiries is that they are slow and expensive and the Government was conscious that many of the women concerned are elderly.  It was confident that a non-statutory examination would be much quicker, less costly and equally, if not more, effective.  The indications from Senator McAleese are that he expects to be in a position to submit a substantial final report in a matter of months, certainly before the end of the year.  This will serve to confirm that the Government was right in taking this approach.<br><br>  My understanding is that the religious congregations are giving their full co-operation.  This is on a voluntary basis and has not given rise to the type of adversarial approach that often arises in statutory inquiries.  I am glad to see that both the original motion and the Government amendment give due recognition to this co-operation.  The House will know that the committee undertook to produce an interim report within three months of its establishment and that report was published within that timeframe, in October 2011.  That report acknowledged the co-operation the committee was receiving from Departments, the religious orders and representative groups of women formerly resident in the laundries.<br><br>  The committee also reported that extensive searches of all State records had commenced, with results being reported on a regular basis.  While the interim progress report of the committee expressed the hope and intention that the committee could conclude its work by mid-2012, it pointed out that: &quot;If the volume of records uncovered or available resources, including personnel, vary substantially from those currently anticipated, it may be necessary to adjust this intended time-line.&quot;  I understand a significant level of information and documentation has already been identified by the committee and drafting of the final report has begun.  However, relevant records continue to be identified and the committee also continues to receive new submissions from representative and advocacy groups.  Indeed, a submission in excess of 100 pages was only recently received from one such group, on 15 August 2012.  I am firmly of the view that the committee cannot be criticised for taking the time necessary to consider such material or any material which may of course have the potential to enhance the fact finding process and the eventual outcome of the committee's work.<br><br>  Senator McAleese has advised that the committee intends to produce its final report as soon as possible, but at the latest before the end of the year.  He has explained that information is still being identified which has the capacity to add to the overall outcome of the committee's work in a meaningful way.  The committee feels that it would be improper to conclude without examining this additional information.  The Minister and I have long believed that the issues raised by or on behalf of the women and girls who were resident in the Magdalene laundries must be addressed.  We have great sympathy for these women and want to help in bringing some closure for the individuals concerned.  The Government has put a process in place.  All involved - the various Departments and agencies, the religious congregations who ran these institutions and the representative and advocacy groups of the women who formerly resided there - are co-operating with the process and we must now see it through.  All the indications are that the report of the interdepartmental committee will put us in a position to have a meaningful debate on the issues raised by the different groups representing those who have been in Magdalene laundries and provide a proper response.  The House is in full agreement on this issue.<br><br>  Both the original motion and the Government amendment welcome the establishment of the committee and commit to an open and meaningful response to all the issues when the report is received.  Indeed, the only difference is that the Government is not going to pre-empt the report of the committee by either making decisions or assertions.  We have been told that we will have the report as soon as possible, and certainly before the end of year, which is only a matter of months.  The only reasonable course of action now is to await the report.  We will be better informed, the report will be published, and we will have a clearer understanding of the facts involved.  In fairness to everyone, I believe we will be better placed then to respond fully to the issues and for that reason I commend the Government amendment to the House.</p>

They deserve the support of this House in their search for justice.  I applaud their courage.  Their support is paramount.  It is safe to say there is broad agreement on the need to fully investigate the involvement of the State in the dreadful experiences of these women, who were shunned and separated from society.  It is horrifying to contemplate the brutality that existed in these places, which lasted for the first 84 years of our State.  Given that the last of the Magdalene laundries closed in 1996, we should realise that we are not just talking about a historic legacy.  We are dealing with something that is a recent memory and a recent scar, unfortunately, for the many women who endured appalling treatment in these institutions.</p><p><a name='N3'>  I applaud the speech the Minister of State made tonight.  For decades, these women were made to stand apart from society.  They were removed from their families, their communities and their country.  They deserve better.  As a State, Ireland should be deeply ashamed of this legacy.  As parliamentarians, we should work to ensure it never happens again.  As a society and as a State, we have a duty to protect all our citizens, particularly those who are most vulnerable.  The women who occupied the Magdalene laundries were not afforded this protection.  Instead, they were subjected to physical abuse, emotional abuse and ill treatment.  Their experiences have been described as &quot;imprisonment&quot; and as &quot;slavery&quot;.  When one reads about their experiences and when listens to these women, one understands why these terms appropriately describe what happened.</p><p><a name='N4'>  The Government's decision to establish an interdepartmental group, chaired by Senator McAleese, was a welcome one.  This step signalled the beginning of our State taking responsibility for its action and its inaction.  I am pleased that a quasi-legal approach was not taken.  It is important for the committee's work to conclude and for its report to be compiled quickly.  The Minister of State mentioned that the deadline for the publication of the report, which was initially supposed to take place in the middle of this year, was extended after Senator McAleese's group indicated that it needed more time.  It behoves us to give more time to the group.  We should bear in mind that these women are getting older.  There has been huge anguish in their lives and they have been affected profoundly.  Nevertheless, it is important for additional time to be made available to the group to ensure it can draw up a comprehensive appraisal of the involvement of the State.  If that facilitates the compilation of a report that accurately reflects and acknowledges the involvement of the State, it will be a small and significant step towards due reparation for these women.  That is very important.</p><p><a name='N5'>  I am aware of the desire of the Minister of State and the Government to address this issue properly.  Following the publication of the report of the United Nations Committee against Torture, prompt action was taken to establish an independent and thorough investigation.  Now that delays in the process have become evident, there is a need to consider whether the group requires additional resources.  Government action should be taken to ensure there are no further delays.  There should be consultation to see if the Government can act to expedite the delivery of this report in the interests of all involved.</p><p><a name='N6'>  There is an unwanted and undesirable symmetry to the issues that are being debated in this House tonight.  The Second Stage debate on legislation providing for a referendum on children's rights, which stems from the devastating failures of church and State, was commenced earlier this evening.  This motion has been tabled to highlight the failure of the same institutions to deal compassionately with women who had children outside marriage or were otherwise treated wrongly.  As I have said, their failure to compassionately protect children has necessitated a referendum on children's rights.  Regrettably, the State that we as legislators work to change has failed the women of the Magdalene laundries.  Regardless of party politics, we must take collective action to ensure they receive redress.  Only when the involvement of the State has been fully catalogued will it be an appropriate time for a comprehensive apology to be made in the full knowledge of the facts.  I hope this occurs quickly.  These women deserve nothing less from the State.</p>

It is no less that we can do for these remarkable individuals who have always shown enormous grace and dignity in their dealings with this issue.  They have stayed with it and made progress with it over the years.  Without doubt, the era under discussion is one of the most shameful and distressing periods in our country's short history.  It defies belief.  It must be extremely upsetting for the people concerned and their families to think of the abuse, torture, neglect and societal stigma that were endured by those who were pushed away from the norms of society.  These places were not intended to be used as prisons.  No court orders were ever secured.  These people were there against their will.  They were put there to be kept out of the way.  It further compounds our sense of disbelief to think that the people behind this abuse acted in the names of God, Jesus Christ and clerics of various descriptions.<br><br>  As I said in the Seanad previously, this is our own holocaust.  What was inflicted on these people was atrocious.  There is no other way of describing it.  As Deputy Buttimer pointed out, the last laundry closed in 1996, which is not that long ago.  There will be a great deal of debate on the children's rights referendum in this Chamber and outside it in the weeks to come.  In recent weeks, a senior cleric in Galway had the temerity to say that he had thought paedophilia was a step of friendship gone too far.  That is the context in which we should reflect on the shameful behaviour of those who occupied positions of trust and respect in Irish society.  Those who hid behind religion mocked it when they inflicted this kind of misery on people.  It is shameful.  I sincerely hope these people, many of whom are still around, hang their heads in shame at the thought that they went through this life inflicting such misery on others and engaging in such rank hypocrisy.  It is disgraceful.<br><br>  Many of the victims, or survivors as they have correctly been termed during this debate, never again saw their own families after they were incarcerated and, in effect, taken for slave labour purposes.  They were worked to the bone for 10 hours a day, six days a week.  They were completely cut off from what was happening outside these institutions.  The initial trauma of being brought from one's community and one's home into these places must have been compounded by being used as slave labour.  It makes the blood boil to think that capitalists who hid behind the name of religion profited from this free labour.  The survivors are no longer physically incarcerated in these institutions but many of them have continued to feel forgotten and abandoned in the past and in the present.  The lack of political conviction displayed by successive Administrations has compounded that sense of stigma and exploitation.<br><br>  As we try to bring an element of dignity to this debate, we must acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy Shatter, established the interdepartmental group within three weeks of the formation of this Government.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, worked like a Trojan on this issue in opposition and is continuing to do so in government.  I believe that deserves to be acknowledged by those who tabled the motion this evening.  I hope the fine and eloquent contribution made by the Minister of State in explaining the amendment she has moved will not be lost on them.  I am trying to be as restrained as I can when I say I sincerely hope that those who tabled this motion will always practice what they preach when it comes to the misery that has been inflicted on these people and on people in other sectors of this country in recent years.<br><br>  I would like to quote from one of the victims who spoke out about her experience in a Magdalene Laundry:<ul style="margin-left:20px">Those places were the Irish gulags for women.  When you went inside their doors you left behind your dignity, identity and humanity.  We were locked up, had no outside contacts and got no wages, although we worked 10 hours a day, six days a week, 52 weeks a year.  What else is that but slavery?  And to think that they were doing all this in the name of a loving God.</ul>A report on the Magdalene laundries that was published by the Irish Human Rights Council approximately two years ago provided further evidence of State complicity in the grave injustices that were visited upon the victims.  It stated:<ul style="margin-left:20px">The treatment of these women and girls by the Religious Orders appears to have been harsh.  They were reputedly forced to work long hours.  Their names were often changed to a religious name, they were isolated from society and the girls were allegedly denied educational opportunities.  The then Minister for Education and Science told the Oireachtas in 2001 that this treatment was abuse, that it involved an appalling breach of trust and that the victims suffered and continued to suffer.</ul></p>

While I am new to the justice portfolio, the groups representing women who were residents in these institutions had constant contact with my predecessor, Deputy Dara Calleary, who kept our party briefed on their ongoing issues.  At the outset, l want to put on record my own opinion and that of Fianna Fáil that it was totally and utterly unacceptable that women were sent to Magdalene laundries and kept there against their will.</p><p><a name='N7'>  I am not here to make political points; nor should any Member of this House when speaking about this sensitive, hurtful and complex part of Ireland's history.  There should be an all-party approach to reaching a satisfactory solution, if at all possible.</p><p><a name='N8'>  I am conscious also that we all use the term &quot;Magdalene laundries&quot; but that they were known by a variety of terms, including &quot;asylums&quot;, &quot;refuges&quot; and &quot;homes&quot;.  The women who resided and worked in the institutions were referred to as &quot;penitents&quot; or &quot;inmates&quot;, and latterly as &quot;girls&quot; and &quot;women&quot;.  In my speech, I will be referring to them as &quot;residents&quot; even though the Justice for Magdalenes submission to the interdepartmental committee chaired by Senator McAleese has numerous contributions from residents who said they were held against their will and were never let out to visit their families or even to go into town to meet friends or go for a walk.  There were women who said they were held in locked dormitories, with bars on the windows and with high walls surrounding the premises so the outside world was invisible.  This, according to many residents, was particularly bad before the 1970s.  According to one survivor, they seemed &quot;to wake up in the 70's and realise that people could not be treated in that way anymore&quot;.</p><p><a name='N9'>  The Justice for Magdalenes submission, which is very detailed, refers to the legislation that covered these institutions, which applied in Ireland from the beginning of the last century.  The Factory and Workshop Act 1907 entered into force on 1 January 1908 and applied to the whole of what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  This Act had provisions covering laundries as a trade, hours of work and also &quot;any premises forming part of an institution carried on for charitable or reformatory purposes&quot;.  Other legislation offering &quot;protection to workers&quot; was the 1901 Factory and Workshop Act, which, according to Justice for Magdalenes, should be considered by the interdepartmental committee.  It included a section which outlines why any room a person is in &quot;must not be locked or bolted or fastened in such a manner that they cannot be easily and immediately opened from the inside&quot;.  The Justice for Magdalenes submission gives many solid examples of sections of legislation from 1901 onwards, and some before, which, on the face of it, should have given some protection to the residents if it had been applied.  However, there was little or no inspection and Justice for Magdalenes believes it was clear that, where the institutions were run by religious orders, &quot;they fought tooth and nail to avoid inspection&quot;.  Even when letters of complaint were submitted, they were quickly dismissed.</p><p><a name='N10'>  The redacted parts of the Justice for Magdalenes report contains even more harrowing evidence but, even as it stands, the report gives a picture of society at the time, particularly the social stigma that applied to women who became pregnant outside of marriage.  There is no doubt this stigma was due to what the Catholic Church predominantly dictated at the time and how society responded to this.  It is important that this is all put into context and, while I am obviously not condoning what happened, context is crucial.  Institutions such as these existed not only in Ireland; as confirmed in the Justice for Magdalenes report, there is also reference to such institutions run by religious orders in France and the UK and there are references to debates in the House of Commons in the 1920s regarding how inspections should be strengthened.</p><p><a name='N11'>  The Justice for Magdalenes report described how, in 1928, after Irish Independence, a Commission on the Relief of the Sick and Destitute Poor was set up, which outlined how a woman should be &quot;incarcerated&quot; for one year if pregnant outside marriage with her first child or for two years if it was her second pregnancy, and stated that the health board had the power to &quot;retain for such period as they think fit, having considered the recommendation of the Superior or Matron of the Home&quot;.  It is stated the object was to &quot;regulate, control [or] segregate those who have become sources of evil, danger, and expense to the community&quot;.</p><p><a name='N12'>  Obviously, we are debating this in the Dáil in 2012.  What we need to do is to determine what is best for the residents who have survived these institutions and what can be done for them to ease their pain, which is no doubt both physical and psychological.  The State must do all it can to co-operate as fully as possible in making notes, referrals and any other information available to the interdepartmental committee chaired by Senator McAleese.  The religious orders and the Church also need to co-operate fully, and I welcome the announcement in July last by Archbishop Diarmuid Martin, who offered full and open access to the Dublin diocesan archives.</p><p><a name='N13'>  Everyone in Irish society needs to learn lessons from the Ryan report and other reports that exposed horrific stories from our past.  The more open and honest the parties can be at every stage, the more it will enable a satisfactory solution.  I see from the interim report that Senator McAleese has confirmed that full co-operation is being given, which is to be welcomed.  However, the group is looking at ten institutions in operation since 1922 and this involves four religious orders.  The work has been delayed slightly to allow all submissions to be examined, which is understandable given the extent of the task and given that records made before computerisation can be hard to find.  There has been a call to include other institutions such as Bethany Home, and perhaps the Government could examine this request.  Contact has been made by the committee with Departments, agencies, the Garda, the courts, the local authorities, the HSE, the LRC, the National Library and the National Archives, and the Irish Human Rights Commission has also made presentations to the committee.</p><p><a name='N14'>  When this report is finalised, it will be another step towards redress.  I believe there should be a full debate in this House when the report is finalised and that there will be an all-party and constructive approach to redress.</p>

There was direct State financial support through the payment of capitation grants, while indirect financial support was provided through other means.  The laundries were used for incarceration and there was a failure on the part of the State to insist that the laundries complied with health and safety legislation, as referred to by Deputy Collins.  The State also failed to ensure that the children were educated, that tax and social welfare payments were collected from the laundries or that death certificates were issued by the laundries.  There are unmarked graves in this city and elsewhere on this island and as a direct consequence of that, memories have been lost.<br><br>  The point made by many Deputies is that this is not an historic event.  This still goes on.  Tonight there are people such as Maisie, who reports that she still suffers from nightmares 50 years later.  In her dreams, she is locked in and cannot get out.  She says that she cannot believe it still haunts her at her age, but &quot;...it never leaves you...&quot;.  Attracta says she feels very bitter and that Ireland let her down.  Her husband says that she still cries at night and wakes up crying and that it has effected all of her life.<br><br>  There was no way out.  When people tried to escape, as they did, they were caught by gardaí.  One of the generous aspects of the Justice for Magdalenes submission is that they do not hold individual gardaí accountable.  They want the force to respond.  The forces of the State were mobilised to bring these people back into their prisons, which they are still in metaphorically tonight.<br><br>  I thank Deputy McDonald for giving us the opportunity to discuss this matter.  Deputy O'Sullivan has just joined us and I know that both Deputies have been very involved in this issue.  I have absolutely no doubt that Senator Martin McAleese is giving this his full commitment.  He was an inspired choice to lead this inquiry.  I also have no doubt of the commitment of those in Government who are working on this issue.  However, I doubt the institutions of the State.  When I hear of cross-departmental committees, I get worried because immediately a defensive mechanism which is in-built in the institutions of the State kicks in.  There is some sort of innate inability to acknowledge our role in this.  We cannot acknowledge our debt to these people.  We cannot admit or contemplate the fact that these women and their families are still living that nightmare.  The motion before us puts the machinery of the State on notice that this Oireachtas will not waver.  This Oireachtas has a moral mandate to deliver to these people and to account for the mistakes of previous Oireachtais and the machinery of Government.<br><br>  In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, Fintan O'Toole asks, &quot;How long must they wait before the stain of the laundries is washed clean?&quot;.  This Oireachtas is putting the machinery of Government on notice that we intend to do that.  I know of the personal commitment of some of the Deputies on the other side of the House but we do not have a lot of time for a meaningful debate and response.  Debate takes time and these women are owed their cleanliness moment and their dignity.  I ask the Minister to ensure that when the report is published it is not passed off to some other interdepartmental committee for a report or response.  I urge her to act on it so the 31st Dáil can say it gave these women back their dignity.</p>

We have learned of the systematic abuse of people in industrial schools, the Magdalene laundries, the Bethany Home and in various sports organisations.  These are very dark moments in our history but they do not belong to the past.  They are still very much in the present because those people have to live with the scars of that abuse and the scars do not go away.</p><p><a name='N5'>  The ladies are asking for an apology and redress.  Many of the women are living in very difficult circumstances.  They are generally quite elderly so time is of the essence.  It is important that more women do not die without an apology and redress.  When I put a priority question to the Minister, he was quite horrified at my suggestion that delaying tactics were being employed but people cannot be blamed for thinking that.</p><p><a name='N6'>  The response to most of the questions posed by Members on this issue is that the Department wants to establish the facts fully.  We know what Justice for Magdalenes has submitted regarding State involvement with the Magdalene laundries.  Their submission document contained 12 files of supporting material and two files of survivor testimony, totalling 795 pages.  They also submitted over 3,700 pages of archival and logistical documentation.  These documents outlined what happened to these young girls and women.  They were deprived of their liberty, physically and sexually abused, forced into slave labour, deprived of medical treatment, neglected and humiliated.  They endured enormous fear, as well as the loss of their identity.  One relative who visited a laundry described it as a &quot;Gulag-style incarceration facility&quot;. </p><p><a name='N7'>  There is clear evidence that the State's judicial system routinely referred people to the Magdalene laundries.  There was evidence of transfer from the industrial schools and from the mother and baby homes, which received State and local government funding.  An aspect of this that I find particularly horrific is the number of young people who were put into the laundries by their families and simply left there, not to mention the State's failure to supervise this.</p><p><a name='N8'>  The State apologised to the survivors of the industrial schools in May 1999, before carrying out the relevant inquiry and before establishing the redress scheme.  A further apology was issued in 2009.  In that context, I ask, as an interim measure, for a gesture of goodwill and an acknowledgement of what went on, that the apology could come sooner rather than later.  I discovered in the Justice for Magdalene's documentation that the first parliamentary question on the matter was asked in 1938.</p><p><a name='N9'>  In conclusion, this time last year I went to a play at the Dublin Fringe Festival called &quot;Laundry&quot; by Louise Lowe, whose family is from the north inner city.  The play was based in the convent that was used as a Magdalene laundry in Sean McDermott Street and was like a virtual reality tour through the various rooms.  I was totally traumatised by the experience, even though I was only there for about an hour and a half.  It was a very visual representation of what those women went through.  During the play, one of the characters said &quot;Will you tell somebody?&quot; and I reacted, as an audience member, and said &quot;Who will I tell?&quot;.  Thinking about it afterwards I wondered who I would have told because nobody wanted to listen.  Nobody in authority wanted to know what was going on.  Finally, enough is enough for those ladies.</p>

What they are seeking is acknowledgement.  Redress is required for people who are still alive.  It is sinful that so many have gone to their eternal reward without getting so much as a proper or acceptable apology.  People only live for so long.  It is awful to think of lovely young girls incarcerated in such institutions as the laundries who were mistreated and robbed of the happy days and nights they should have had.  That is sad and an indictment of society at the time.  It shows the lack of tolerance and humanity that existed at the time that beautiful, young people were mistreated in such a way.  It was an awful period.  It should never have been allowed to happen but it is the responsibility of each one of us elected to the Dáil to ensure we put forward our case and that the Government acts.  I do not refer to the current Government specifically because there has been an unwillingness to deal adequately with the matter for many years.  The State must live up to its responsibility.  I compliment the Justice for Magdalenes group, which has done tremendous work, as have many other people in the past.  It is time those in government ensure redress is provided and there is a proper apology.</p><p><a name='N3'>  I wish Senator Martin McAleese every success.  He is a deeply committed individual whom I know is going about his job in a meticulous and hard-working fashion.  We all acknowledge that.  A stigma was put on those fine young people and the experience they went through was horrendous.  Many of those affected are still alive and we must do everything we can to try to make up for the wrong that was perpetrated on them.</p><p><a name='N4'>  Unfortunately, there have been delays.  I am not afraid to say and as has been stated that stalling tactics have been employed.  When it comes to an issue such as this, sometimes the initial reaction of those in positions of responsibility is to stall in order to buy time.  Unfortunately, time is running out for many and has run out for others who suffered in the past.  I hope that once and for all proper justice will be done and that it will be seen to be done.  It has been suggested that rather than taking different sides, we should all speak with the one voice on the issue.  We should all sing from the same hymn sheet and ensure redress is provided.</p><p><a name='N5'>  I compliment and thank all of the speakers who have spoken on this important motion.  I thank Deputy Mary Lou McDonald for introducing the Private Members' motion.  Every week various important issues are raised on the floor of the House during Private Members' time.  This is an important issue and must be given the utmost respect, which is the case.  I am pleased to be present to support the motion.</p>

Poverty takes power away from people.  It was the children of poor families who often ended up in industrial schools or orphanages.  Many of them suffered horrific abuse and were scarred for life.  That was at a time when little children were supposed to be seen but not heard.  Ironically, it was at a time when we had a greater number of families based on marriage.  Often, they could not fight back because it was a time when religious institutions were at their most powerful.  Some of that power led to horrific abuse, with successive reports detailing how a powerful institution such as the Roman Catholic Church abused its power by protecting itself at the expense of countless children.  It is important to qualify that by saying that I refer to the institution of the church, because some members did not take any hand, act or part in the abuse.  Sometimes, that is not said.  We must learn from history or else we risk repeating it.  That is the intention underlying what we do, namely, the commencement of a process by first putting a referendum to the people.<br><br>  The commitment to be given in the Constitution, that &quot;the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration&quot; is one that must relate to all facets of a child's life.  The Ryan report, for example, sought for a culture of respecting and implementing rules and regulations and observing codes of conduct to be developed.  That can only be achieved if the institutions are in place and are properly resourced.  If all services for children are to be subject to regular inspections, as the Ryan report demands, there must be a sufficient number of inspectors who must be independent and capable of talking and listening to children.  I frequently say that in this country we do not have experience of building good institutional architecture.  Reform must include such an element of change.  Too often we find that one arm of the State is not talking to the other and measures fail the very people they seek to protect.  A great deal of attention must be paid to those failures at institutional level.  In the context of reform, we currently talk about only one issue, namely, cutbacks.  We must go beyond that to bring about serious institutional reform.  We have a habit of throwing money at issues without going to the core of an issue to resolve it or building an integrated and workable solution.<br><br>  While the referendum extends the prospect that many more children might be adopted, that happy outcome will not be available for all children in care.  The Ryan report highlights the need for aftercare services.  Serious work must be done in this area.  Most families would not contemplate dumping out a child once he or she reached the age of 18, yet current guidelines indicate that the State &quot;may&quot; provide aftercare.  It does not say it shall<i>&nbsp;</i>provide it.  That approach is currently causing great distress for some young people and is in need of urgent change.  It seems to me there are two sets of standards, one for services delivered by the HSE and another for 16 to 18 year olds in particular who are in the care of a service that is contracted out.  I am concerned that the latter service is about looking after those aged 16 for whom one is paid and getting them out as quickly as one can when they reach 18.  We must pay attention to the issue now to avoid talking about it in the future as a form of failure.<br><br>  One of the major concerns that followed the failure of the economy in recent years was the damage to our reputation.</p>

What the report had found was described as &quot;appalling reading&quot;, a shocking scale of sexual and physical abuse in the Irish education systems.  &quot;Ireland's shameful tragedy&quot; was the headline in the <i>New York Times.</i>  We will rebuild our reputation if we do not repeat these mistakes and are seen to learn from and respond to them but it is not only about our national reputation, which can be repaired.  What cannot be repaired are the children who were damaged.  We must anticipate problems and ensure they are not repeated. To do that we cannot merely pass a referendum.  If it is to mean something further we will need a world-class child protection system.  We cannot use the excuse that the state of the economy will not allow this.  We need to make the best use of resources available to us but we also need a vision and a blueprint for the kind of service to which we aspire.  We must begin to build and resource that system.<br><br>  Too often, one institution of the State does not know what another arm of the State is doing.  That must stop.  Children are often not seen in the delivery of vital services.  The Oireachtas Library &amp; Information Service Bills digest draws attention to the family support model, describing the strong legislative framework and leadership that is especially needed to underpin services at levels 3 and 4.  These levels are where one really comes across children at risk, where there may be violence and all kinds of abuse.  I will offer one example from County Kildare, from the south of the county which is not my constituency.  County Kildare has a population of 210,000 which makes it the fourth most populated county in the country.  I say this to underline that it is a fairly large centre of population.  The HSE built a refuge for victims of domestic violence but there is no money to open it although it is there and available.  What is there at present is an information and support service which is really vital.  I have referred people to it on several occasions and have been really impressed by the service provided, albeit very limited.  When the centre opens the service will need a child protection worker to work in the refuge but it appears this is an afterthought for the HSE although there will be more children accommodated in that refuge, if it ever opens, than there will be women.  It must be seen as an essential part of the service.  There is also a suggestion that the centre will be run by volunteers.  That would not meet the HIQA standards this State demands of such a service.  The refuge might be opened, therefore, without meeting the very basic minimum standards expected of it.  At present there are people staying in violent situations because there is no place for them to go.  That is the kind of service in which one will see children at what are described as levels 3 and 4.  We must put this situation right.<br><br>  We also need to have detox beds for adults with a drug addiction.  We often see such adults and can see their children being used and pushed around in situations where drug dealing may be going on, very openly.  Those children very often end up in care.  If we are serious about keeping children with their families we must deal with the origin of the problem.  Having sufficient remedial action for people with a drug addiction is vital.<br><br>  Increasingly, our focus is exclusively on the cost of everything, and what can be cut further.  A greater reliance is being placed on any person or organisation that will assume responsibility for those with problems.  In the absence of a blueprint we basically hope for the best.  It is interesting to note that some of the most radical notions such as, for example, a welfare state, was conceived by the social reformer, William Beveridge, in 1942, in the middle years of one of the most tragic world events, the Second World War.  He was capable of thinking beyond the present and constructing something worth aspiring to although his idea obviously played out differently depending on the country.<br><br>  Let us aspire to something really world class for children.  We need to look beyond what now seems certain and must aim for something bigger in the future.  The kind of society we aspire to, how we share limited resources in a more equal way, how we can get more with less, how we protect our children, are all central issues for a good society.  This referendum is a beginning but it must be followed by the means to deliver the aspiration it contains.  I support the referendum but it must be seen as a beginning and I believe this is something the Minister also accepts.</p>

That certainly has not happened in our history but this is an opportunity finally to get it right.  The Minister and her Department have done amazing work to ensure the wording is as near perfect as is possible in the circumstances.  It goes a long way.  I take on board the support from the various reputable organisations involved in children's rights, which is an affirmation of the Minister's work.  Those organisations have been calling for stronger protection for children's rights for a long time.</p><p><a name='N5'>  The Ombudsman for Children gave the bottom line as the need to enshrine key children's rights and principles in the Constitution in order to underpin a fundamental shift in our law, policy and practice regarding children.  Of course, the irony cannot be lost on us in the Chamber tonight.  We are now actively promoting children's rights and seeking to include them in the Constitution but only five or six minutes ago I was speaking on the tragedy and horrors of what went on the Magdalene laundries, when children and young girls were confined, deprived of their rights, stripped of their identity and dignity and subject to humiliating and degrading treatment at the hands of adults.  We know about the direct adult involvement, whether it was of members of religious orders or the different involvement of people in State organisations and Departments, or the gardaí who facilitated that abuse and allowed it to continue.  For those few individuals who managed to escape there was the horror of being brought back by gardaí.</p><p><a name='N6'>  I am struck by another irony associated with the laundries and industrial schools.  The family is central to our Constitution yet many families put their children into those institutions and allowed them to stay there for indeterminate times - one turned the key and forgot about it.  That is not to take from those families who cared and visited, as is so powerfully conveyed in much of the work the Justice for Magdalenes group has done.  That was not the end of it, of course, because we cannot say there was abuse only in the laundries and industrial schools.  It went on in families, sports clubs and organisations and in residential care homes.  The two reports, HIQA's national standards for the protection and welfare of children in July and the independent review report on the deaths of children in care, show a litany of failures of instances of how children were so badly treated.  This Bill, along with the National Vetting Bureau Bill, the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children) Bill, the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill and the Mental Capacity Bill, will go a long way.  The hope is that the measures will ensure not only adequate but thorough protection for all children.  It all comes back to resources and the need for them to be in place to match what is intended.</p><p><a name='N7'>  I refer to the terms of the Bill, the &quot;imprescriptible rights&quot;, or rights that will not diminish over time.  The Minister has mentioned &quot;all&quot; children.  Will this term apply to those children living in the State who are not citizens of the State, in particular, to unaccompanied minors?  We know from the Irish Refugee Council that the rights of these children are not being respected.  The council's recent report detailed children in our State asylum process who are living in extreme poverty in overcrowded accommodation and with inadequate food.  These are the children in the direct provision centres.  The report reviewed the conditions over a ten-year period.  One of the points that struck me was that children were described as &quot;alienated&quot;, as a result of enforced poverty and social exclusion.  There was a real risk of child abuse because of the overcrowding in the centres.</p>

Some of the children born here have lived here all their lives.  I am aware of the improvements, but these children are suffering in the meantime.  I hope the Bill will cover them and also include those children whom we know have been trafficked.</p><p><a name='N4'>  Some reservations have been expressed about the possibility of high handed interference and intrusion in family life.  We are aware of cases in which this has happened.  There were some horrific cases in the United Kingdom where families were torn apart and children taken from their families.  There was an abuse both of the rights of the children and those of their families.  Some parents and individuals have a real fear in that regard.  I hope the terms &quot;to such extent&quot;, &quot;proportionate means&quot; and &quot;due regard&quot; take this into account.  I hope they are sufficiently adequate to ensure no family will feel threatened by what the Bill proposes to do.</p><p><a name='N5'>  People can be vicious.  I was a teacher and the Minister was a social worker.  We know about the making of allegations and the way in which situations can be misused and abused by young people.  Care must be taken to ensure balance in order that no family is broken up or a child taken from a family needlessly and that no child is left in a position in which he or she should never be left in.  We know there are such examples.  We always presume that a child's best interests are served in the family, but that is not always the case and the Bill is doing something to address this.</p><p><a name='N6'>  I am very interested in the adoption issue and aware that work in that area will accompany the Bill.  It is welcome that married parents will be able to decide to have their children adopted and that children who have been in foster care for many years can now see light at the end of the tunnel.  It is important also to acknowledge the work of foster carers.  There are people who foster who do not want to go any further in the process, but there are also those who are fostering with a view to adoption.  The reference in the Bill to a considerable period is welcome because a child can be in care for a number of years, there is a process to be followed and then a further process where the child is with the prospective adoptive parents.  I am glad there will always be provision for children to maintain contact with their birth parents, but it is welcome that there will be a greater possibility for giving a second chance to these children.  We know there are parents who will not parent and parents who cannot do so for a variety of reasons.  Such parents need support.  I hope the legislation will help parents with particular difficulties such as addiction who need support for a particular period, but it does not mean they are giving up on their children or do not want anything to do with them.  Support is needed to ensure they can fulfil their duties.  Sometimes there is too much emphasis on rights rather than responsibilities and this is one area where we can see this.</p><p><a name='N7'>  I am also conscious of the father where a couple is unmarried.  There are various men's organisations who cater for unmarried fathers who have been done a terrible injustice by the State.  Their rights, responsibilities and interest in their child have often been disregarded.  I hope they will be covered by the legislation and that they, too, will be eligible to participate in the fostering and adoption process.</p><p><a name='N8'>  I have mentioned the extent of addiction in the north inner city and the number of grandparents and extended family members who take on the responsibility of caring for children.  I would hate to think this work would be undermined in any way and hope it can be supported by the Bill.</p><p><a name='N9'>  The Bill states the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration.  I like the reference that where a child is capable of forming his or her own views, his or her views shall be ascertained and given due weight.  There is a balance to be struck in that regard.  There is a song with the line, &quot;You say it best when you say nothing at all&quot;.  Social workers are trained professionals who can read situations and sometimes words do not reveal much; a child's silence can reveal more.  If we want to protect children and vulnerable persons, they must be covered in the Constitution.  The Minister is trying to do this in the Bill which reflects what we value in society.  The Minister is including such provisions in the Bill because we did not value children in the past.  I hope we have got it right this time.</p><p><a name='N10'>  This morning I was handing out certificates in a local primary school in the North Strand.  The children received a blue flag and a green flag.  I looked at all of them, some of whom had just started school.  I am always struck by the line in Yeats' poem about the childish day being turned to tragedy.  One hopes none of their days will ever be turned to the tragedy that comes with being abused and left in a situation they should not be in.  I acknowledge all of the Minister's work on this legislation which goes a long way and I will support.</p>

She was correct when she stated: <ul style="margin-left:20px">We must hope that some day the rights accruing to Irish citizens will be implicit.  Until then we must make them explicit.  </ul>I hope the legislation will represent not just a new beginning but also the creation of a new Ireland which allows us to learn from what we have done wrong and protects and embraces the welfare of all our children.<br><br>  This debate is critical.  It is taking place at a time when our economic sovereignty is being questioned and our economic recovery is in its infancy.  We are saying to families, children and the people that we value each other and that we want to live in a society that cherishes children.  On an evening when we have debated the issue of the Magdalene laundries we are saying we have learned from the past and that we want to embrace the future through the medium of this constitutional amendment.<br><br>  I had the pleasure and the privilege of chairing the Joint Committee on Health and Children which dealt with the Children First legislation.  I have been fascinated by people's sense of expectation and excitement in looking forward to the referendum, but I have also been struck by the tremendous work, insight and ability of so many to reach out and make this a better society.  The Bill is not just about children; it is also about building the family, supporting communities and stating children at risk must not just be a headline in a newspaper or a statistic in a report.  It cannot be a catch-phrase.  It states the State will act and work with parents to ensure the dark evil days will be no more.  <br><br>  The House debated the Magdalene laundries in Private Members' time.  Seanad Éireann debated Private Members' motions on the issue of homophobic bullying and tonight in this Chamber we are dealing with a Bill to hold a children's rights referendum.  It is about putting people first.  After the bringing forward of 17 reports, it is very much welcome that we will have a referendum which I hope the people will resoundly pass.  Those who question the need for a referendum should do so, but they should also cast their minds back to the reports we have seen.  Seventeen reports were written, independent of Governments of all hues; they outlined a catalogue of errors and a failure to act on behalf of children.  We have a Government which has reached across the floor and stated we can no longer continue in the way we have been.  The journey must not conclude with the referendum.  We must continue to work with and provide for families which require the State to intervene and work for and with them.  Mrs. Hillary Clinton famously wrote that it took a village to raise a child.  I agree with her and, as the Minister stated at the press conference, that the best place for the child is at home with his or her family, but if the family cannot rear him or her, the State has a duty and right to intervene in exceptional circumstances.  That is the reason the referendum is vital.  It is about protecting children and supporting families.</p>

However, we have done what we set out to do.  As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, I compliment its Opposition members, Deputies Ó Caoláin, McConalogue, Troy and Seamus Healy, and Senator van Turnhout and those on the Government side on the work they have done to ensure that we put children first.</p><p><a name='N4'>  Lest people forget, it must be stated that the forthcoming referendum will reassert the view that the best place for a child is within his or her family.  However, I cannot overemphasise the fact that this is not always the case and that there will be instances when intervention will be necessary.  The Government has seen to it that for the first time in the history of the State a senior Minister with responsibility for children and youth affairs has a seat at the Cabinet table.  It is also in the process of establishing a child and family support agency and has put in place the Children First legislation and drawn up the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012.  These comprise a suite of legislative and administrative procedures and policies designed to ensure that the referendum will be another part of the jigsaw relating to Irish society.</p><p><a name='N5'>  I welcome the new Article 42A, which deals with children.  This is an important point.  It is incumbent on everyone in this House, irrespective of his or her political affiliations or views, to ensure that children are protected.  The forthcoming referendum is necessary not just as a result of the failure on the part of the State but also that of the church to act and intervene on behalf of children.  The proposed new article declares that &quot;The State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall, as far as practicable, by its laws protect and vindicate those rights.&quot;  That is what we are about, namely, ensuring that we allow our society to flourish and blossom.  We must, as Deputy Catherine Murphy indicated, send a message to the outside world that this is a new and modern Ireland which has values and a sense of itself going forward.</p><p><a name='N6'>  If one considers our journey from the report compiled by former Supreme Court Justice Catherine McGuinness on the Kilkenny incest case to the point at which we find ourselves today, one can see that this referendum is necessary.  The Bill does not merely relate to amending the Constitution, it is also relates to people.  If we are to cherish all of our children equally, then the referendum must be passed.  If we fail to pass the referendum, it will not necessarily be a regressive step.  It will, however, be a statement to the effect that the work done in the past 18 months on a cross-party basis has been worthless.  That work is not worthless, it is worthwhile.</p><p><a name='N7'>  In the context of adoption, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has in recent days reached out to the authorities in Vietnam and re-established our connection with that country.  This shows that there is new thinking and a new approach within the Government in respect of the issues involved.</p><p><a name='N8'>  The forthcoming referendum is important and I encourage everyone to take the opportunity to vote.  In particular, I wish to take this opportunity to reach out to the young people in our third level institutions to take advantage of the fact that the referendum is being held on a Saturday.  I urge them to go home to vote or to register in the new constituencies in which they are living in order that they may do so.  Everybody has a duty to vote &quot;Yes&quot; in the referendum.  What is being done here is not about today, rather it relates to the Ireland of tomorrow.</p>

Amending the Constitution is a serious matter which always requires serious debate.  This has never been more true than in the case of the proposed thirty-first amendment to the Constitution.  The aim of the amendment is clear, namely, to enshrine children's rights in the Constitution - a document which dictates how our Government operates and that for which our country stands - for the first time.  This amendment was not drawn up overnight, it is the result of five years of formal deliberation and almost 12 years of public and private debate.</p><p><a name='N10'>  I compliment the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on arriving at a wording that is acceptable to everybody in the House.  Earlier this evening I listened with interest to the contributions of Opposition Members who also praised the Minister.  It is a welcome, if not unique, development that we are discussing children in this House and that there is agreement on the matter.  I again compliment the Minister in that regard.  I also compliment those opposite on being fair and open.  What is happening here bodes well for the Houses of the Oireachtas for the future and we must seek to learn from it.</p><p><a name='N11'>  Ireland has been obliged to learn the importance of children's rights the hard way.  Members do not need to be reminded of that fact.  Since 1993 there have seen 17 reports in which the failures of our child protection system have been outlined in detail.  Arguably, one of the most shocking reports relates to the Roscommon child care case.  This report laid much of the blame at the feet of the State.  It also detailed how it took the relevant health board eight years to react appropriately to horrific levels of child abuse.  We watched in amazement as the details relating to that case emerged.</p><p><a name='N12'>  While most of us in this Chamber are in broad agreement on the need for the rights of children to be enshrined in our Constitution, some outside do not see matters in that way.  Some opponents say that the forthcoming referendum is not necessary and that legislation alone would be sufficient.  I disagree.  While it was never the intention of those who framed it, the Constitution, as it currently stands, is vague on this issue.  The Constitution can often be manipulated and interpreted as a document which places greater value on the rights of parents than on those of children.  In some cases, this has allowed abuse to continue even when that should not have been the case. There are too many examples of instances when the State could have intervened but did not do so simply because it felt vulnerable from a legal standpoint.  I contend that this will no longer be the case.</p><p><a name='N13'>  The thirty-first amendment to the Constitution will put the rights of the child front and centre in our legal system.  It will give children, having regard for their young age and potential vulnerability, special protection by virtue of formally recognising their importance within our Constitution.  The amendment will also remove obstacles for married parents to the voluntary placement of children for adoption.  In the absence of this change some children would remain in short-term care for the entire duration of their childhoods, without the possibility of being party to the security that adoption brings.  The amendment will also end the current practice of treating children differently on foot of their parents' marital status.  It will ensure that the rights of the family, as set out in Article 41 of the Constitution, will be respected and preserved in exactly the way they were meant to be.  It must be remembered that our Constitution expresses our priorities as a country, shapes all of our discussions in this House and provides certainty as to that for which we stand.</p><p><a name='N14'>  I wish to conclude by recognising the work already done by the many families throughout the country that have devoted their lives to children in need.  I refer to those who have taken in children and helped them through difficult periods in their own lives.</p>

Táim buíoch as ucht an deis labhairt san díospóireact tabhachtach seo.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>In the words of Herbert Hoover, the 31st President of the United States of America, children are our most valuable natural resource.  In the 80 years since those words were uttered the value of that statement has not changed and, if anything, society has a stronger realisation of its truth.<br><br>  Yesterday I had occasion to visit a residential centre offering treatment for substance misuse to teenagers.  I spoke with many of the professional staff who deal with the teenagers and I also spoke with the teenagers themselves.  The message I took from my visit is the same as the Minister's, which is the importance and need to suport families.  The best way to protect children and to enshrine their rights is by supporting families because the family is the natural home for children and teenagers.<br><br>  My own family, for all its function and dysfunction, has the privilege of welcoming and taking care of children who are in the care of the State.  The experience of fostering children has highlighted many of the wonderful elements associated with caring for children but it has also highlighted for me the very necessary changes required to ensure the well-being of children.<br><br>  A cursory glance at case law will show there is a need for serious reform at judicial level.  The constitutional amendment, which it is hoped will be passed, will make it easier for the Judiciary to recognise the rights of the child.  It will ensure that for the first time - ashamedly - the welfare and the well-being of the child will be paramount in all judicial proceedings.<br><br>  The decisions of the Judiciary which often seem to be cold and clinical, fail to recognise the importance of the needs of the child.  I look forward to the day when cases of children being put into care will be decided not in the courts but by a committee of competent persons qualified in the necessary welfare of children.<br><br>  I refer to other worrying trends that have developed in the child care area.  In my past experience as a teacher and currently as a parent and foster parent, I have noted a worrying development in some cases where there is a tendency to over-compensate for a lack of parenting skills by diagnosing and labelling our children.  This is detrimental to our society and it will be harmful to our children in the future.<br><br> The best support to offer children is to support the family.  Society needs to recognise the needs of parents.  Not every parent possesses the parenting skills necessary to rear children and many of us lack the necessary resources and wherewithal to do so.  If the State is to genuinely put the needs of children first the first step must be to support families.  I look forward to us developing those strengths and the necessary parenting skills.</p>  
<!-- Snippet ref: AAA00200 type: 1 --> <a name='AAA00200'></a> <p><span class="speaker">Deputy Barry Cowen:</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=&HouseNum=&MemberID=2340"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Barry Cowen"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=2340&pid=BarryCowen&year=2012&month=09&day=25"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Barry Cowen"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N3'>Like many other speakers I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald and her staff on this momentous occasion.  She has brought forward a wording which has been deliberated upon for many years by her predecessors and by Oireachtas joint committees.  I welcome the wording of the amendment and the decision to hold the referendum on a Saturday which ensures that everyone in the State will have an opportunity to participate in the vote.  I  hope there will be full participation in the debate over the coming weeks.</p><p><a name='N4'>  The wording is similar to that proposed by Barry Andrews and agreed by the previous Government in January 2011.  Significant progress has been made, despite many contentions to the opposite, in recent years.  The rights of children have been enhanced through legislation such as the Children Act 2001 and the Child Care Act 2007.</p><p><a name='N5'>  I wish to acknowledge the work of former Ministers with responsibility for children, Barry Andrews and Brian Lenihan.  That this proposed wording has achieved cross-party consensus is a tribute not only to the Minister but to all those across the political divide who were members of the previous Oireachtas joint committee chaired by Mary O'Rourke.  There is universal approval for the measure before the House, which will be put to the people.  It is right, however, to examine the failings of the State in the past and more important, seek to rectify the wording in the Constitution to ensure the many failings recognised in such damning reports are not repeated in the future.</p><p><a name='N6'>  A few points keep re-emerging and which were to the forefront of the minds of everyone who, in the past, sat down with a view to rectifying this situation in the Constitution.  The aim is that all children, both from marital or non-marital relationships, are treated the same.  The voice of the child must be recognised in the Constitution.  A welcome provision is that children are to be treated equally with regard to adoption.  This is a very welcome development in addition to the wording and it is vital that it is dealt with alongside the amendment to the Constitution.</p><p><a name='N7'>  Having witnessed these damning reports we have a duty as legislators and parliamentarians to give the electorate the opportunity to make this amendment, based on the best expert advice and opinion that has been used, through the leadership of the Minister.  The amendment must ensure that the State takes responsibility and responds in a timely fashion to protect children who are being abused or neglected.  It must ensure that the State takes responsibility and will never again stand idly by and allow troubled children to fall through the net and end up in prison and on the streets.  It must ensure that children are never discriminated against again.  It must ensure that in any legal or judicial setting where the future welfare of a child is at stake, the best interests of that child are paramount.</p><p><a name='N8'>  We accept that the children's rights referendum is not necessarily a panacea for all child protection issues but there are some immediate and substantial differences which it will bring about.  It will allow for hundreds of children in long-term foster care to be adopted by their foster parents, something that until now has not been possible.  I commend Deputy Jim Daly and I acknowledge his commitment in his capacity as a foster parent.  I pay tribute, as did both he and the Minister, to all those who take it upon themselves to nurture and develop the minds of children who have not had the same opportunities as many of us.  That is a most commendable trait in any person.  Expending effort in so many ways, financially and emotionally, for someone else's child, is a significant service to the State which must be recognised.  I am pleased that the proposed amendment contains the options for this service to be formalised in an adoptive nature in the future.</p><p><a name='N9'>  The Children's Rights Alliance notes that currently more than 2,000 children in long-term foster care will be affected by this proposal. </p>

We hope the referendum will end the legal limbo in which hundreds of child find themselves and which hundreds more will face in the future unless the Constitution is changed to allow for the adoption of marital children.  These are points we hope to reiterate at every given opportunity to ensure the public understands absolutely that these amendments to our Constitution can only improve the lot of the children we seek to protect.<br><br>  Under the proposed amendment, married parents will be allowed to place their children for adoption.  This is about giving all children equal rights regardless of the marital status of their parents.  It is not about removing children from their families and putting them into care.  The objective is to ensure that children in the care system are no longer left to drift but are instead given a second chance.  Mr. Shannon has articulated his view that this will not lead to a situation where larger numbers of children go into the care system.  Instead, it will ensure the right children are brought into the system, which is precisely what matters most.<br><br>  One only has to consider the work of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children to see how children's rights are absent from decision making across a wide range of public bodies.  In a report published by that office in April 2011, entitled A Children's Rights Analysis of Investigations, ten investigations by the office in recent years were reviewed from a children's rights perspective.  These cases concerned school transport, local authority housing provision, special needs provision, Health Service Executive provision for alternative care and the handling of a child protection complaint.  Several common themes emerged in these investigations, with all of them showing that children appear to be largely invisible in decision-making processes which affect their lives and that decision making by public bodies often was not informed by the impact on children or what was in their best interests.  In short, decisions taken and how the decision-making process was handled were not informed by children's rights principles.  It is amazing in this day and age, despite all the warning signs and all the damning reports, that arms of this State can make decisions without taking into consideration the basic rights of children.  The report stressed the need for an amendment to the Constitution based on the principles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.<br><br>  Fianna Fáil considers the proposed amendment to the Constitution as a welcome addition to the legislation already in place to protect the welfare of children.  Various items of legislation introduced in the Dáil in recent years were welcome in so far as they went, but they did not complete the package as this proposal will do.  As such, we congratulate those involved in bringing the proposal to this stage.  Our decision to submit amendments is based purely on a desire to strengthen the proposed wording as much as possible.  It is not an attempt to take from what is before us or to deflect from the effort and commitment attached to the achievement of having brought the proposal before the House.  It would be commendable of the Minister to assess our proposals on their merits.  To reiterate, we fully support the Government proposal and will campaign for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote.  Nevertheless, we are of the view that the proposed wording could be amended slightly to afford even greater protection for children.<br><br>  Specifically, our proposal is that the draft Article 42A.1 be amended to make it consistent with the constitutional protection afforded citizens under Article 40.3.1.  The latter provides that, &quot;The State guarantees in its laws to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.&quot;   A similar level of protection could be afforded in the new article concerning children by amending the proposed wording to read as follows:<ul style="margin-left:20px">The State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and guarantees, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate those rights.</ul>This configuration would ensure the same protection for children as is provided to the citizen in Article 40.3.1.  This is necessary and appropriate since it is likely that the courts will interpret children's rights as being protected by the new Article 42A.1 rather than Article 40.3.1.<br><br>  Our second amendment proposes that the exceptional cases intervention provided for in Article 42A.2.1 be clarified to correspond with the statutory protection afforded to the child under the Child Care Act 1991, which refers to the &quot;health, development or welfare&quot; of the child.  It is proposed that this be mirrored in the wording of the constitutional protection.  For the same reason, Fianna Fáil proposes, in its third amendment, that Article 42A. 4.1(i) be amended by replacing the reference to the &quot;safety and welfare of any child&quot; with a reference to the &quot;health, safety, development or welfare of any child&quot;.<br><br>  I ask the Minister to give careful consideration to our amendments.  I conclude by commending her once again on the work she has done to bring this proposal to the House.  I hope she will be rewarded by way of a resounding &quot;Yes&quot; vote by the electorate.  I thank other speakers for the insight and personal experience they brought to bear in their contributions.  If this Dáil were to achieve nothing other than the successful passage of this proposal to include specific rights for children in the Constitution, it will have been a good Dáil.</p>

It has been recognised for years that a constitutional amendment was required to guarantee that children's interests are foremost when the State is dealing with their rights.  I take this opportunity to thank Deputy Barry Cowen for his contribution.  It is heartening to see a Government proposal receiving such a resoundingly positive response from the Opposition.  It goes to show that when we get it right, everybody is an agreement.<br><br>  The family plays a very important role in Irish society, but the concept of &quot;family&quot; has changed over the years.  We must seek to recognise these changes while always ensuring that the welfare of the child is protected.  The balance between the rights of parents and children was always a sensitive issue and the Constitution has strong provisions protecting parents' and family rights.  The inclusion of the exceptional circumstances proviso seeks to maintain this balance by ensuring the State will intervene only where parents are totally incapable of looking after the best interests of their children.  Unfortunately, several recent cases have shown the need for such intervention by the State.<br><br>  It has been argued that this type of intervention is already possibly through the application of existing laws.  The reality, however, is that the current position sets up a conflict between the rights of parents and the rights of children, a lack of clarity which inevitably leaves matters open to interpretation by the courts.  This constitutional amendment, along with the accompanying legislation, clarifies the whole area by putting the rights of children to the forefront.  In future, all legislation will have to be proofed against its provisions.<br><br>  I particularly welcome the provision that children in foster care may, in certain circumstances, be adopted.  Again, the wording is well balanced:<ul style="margin-left:20px">Provision shall be made by law for the adoption of any child where the parents have failed for such a period of time as may be prescribed by law in their duty towards the child and where the best interest of the child so requires.</ul>The practice in Ireland up to now is that children in long-term foster care placements were being adopted just before their 18th birthday.  Long-term foster parents have adopted this approach so that the child they have fostered for many years can avail of all the legal rights offered to adopted children.</p>

Even in Britain, which does not have a constitution enshrining a promise to cherish the country's children, the adoption of children who have been in foster care for 12 months is permitted.</font><br><br><font color="#2F2F2F">  Under the proposed adoption legislation, children of married parents will be eligible for adoption once they have been fostered for 36 months.  The key element in this proposal is that the time envisaged will ensure a child's parents have every opportunity to prove they have the capability of caring for their child should they wish to do so.  The proposed law will also mean a child must spend 18 months in the foster care of his or her proposed adoptive parents.  As a result, the adoptive parents and child will have sufficient time to ensure adoption is the desired option.</font><br><br><font color="#2F2F2F">  The new legislation recognises the right of children to be heard.  Where children are capable of having a voice, their voice must be taken into account.  The views of the child will be taken into consideration and given due weight in accordance with his or her age and maturity.  For the first time, input about a child's welfare will not be made solely by adults because the opinions of the child in question must be taken into consideration.</font><br><br><font color="#2F2F2F">  This referendum has the potential to change children's lives for the better by enshrining their rights in the Constitution.  I am pleased this major step forward in promoting the legal, emotional and social needs of all our children who remain vulnerable is being fully supported by all political parties and organisations dealing with child welfare.  I believe that on polling day a large majority will vote in favour of this amendment to the Constitution.  I concur with Deputy Cowen's point that if nothing else is achieved in this Dáil, the children's referendum will at least be remembered.</font><br><br><font color="#2F2F2F">  I congratulate the Minister on recently finalising agreement with the Vietnamese Government on the adoption issue that has been ongoing between Ireland and Vietnam.  I understand Vietnam has signed up to the Hague Convention, which has allowed the Minister to sign an agreement that will resolve many of the difficulties experienced by Irish couples seeking to adopt Vietnamese children.</font><br><br><font color="#2F2F2F">  Protecting the rights of children and giving them a better life must always be at the heart of society.  For this reason, I am very pleased the Bill is before the House and that, on 10 November, people will be given a chance to vote on an important and necessary change to our Constitution.  I am, therefore, pleased to commend this Bill to the House.</font></p>  
<!-- Snippet ref: CCC00200 type: 1 --> <a name='CCC00200'></a> <p><span class="speaker">Deputy Tony McLoughlin:</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&HouseNum=31&MemberID=2325"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Tony McLoughlin"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=2325&pid=TonyMcLoughlin&year=2012&month=09&day=25"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Tony McLoughlin"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N3'>I am grateful for an opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  I was elected to the House in 2011 when, for the first time in our history, the Taoiseach appointed a full Cabinet Minister with responsibility for children.  It is important to pay tribute to him and the Tánaiste for recognising the importance of placing our children at the heart of government.  The establishment of a full Department of Children and Youth Affairs is significant as it signals the intent of Fine Gael and the Labour Party in government to address children's rights.<br><br><font color="#2F2F2F">  Over the next seven weeks, children will be at the heart of political debate.  This fact alone is to be welcomed.  To date, opposition to the referendum is small and focused, which tells us much about the weight of opinion behind the &quot;No&quot; side of the debate.  Nevertheless, it is important we examine the points of opposition to the Bill and referendum.  The former Supreme Court judge, Hugh O'Flaherty, has argued that the referendum is unnecessary and in a recent eloquent article in the </font><i><font color="#2F2F2F">Irish Independent</font></i><font color="#2F2F2F"> referred to the skill of President de Valera in drafting the 1937 Constitution.  While I am not a lawyer or constitutional expert, it is clear from the Roscommon child abuse case that our Constitution proved inadequate when challenged to provide for the care of children.  The shocking case to which I refer, involving the abuse and neglect of children at the hands of their parents, was well documented and highlighted in the media.  Social workers who sought to intervene to protect the children in question were met by a High Court challenge taken by the parents of the children in question.  Their action was successful and the children continued to suffer for some time afterwards.</font><br><br><font color="#2F2F2F">  Unacceptable as it was, the judge's decision in the case was based on a reading of Bunreacht na hÉireann.  The children's interest makes the case for change.  The new Article 42A provides that: </font>&quot;In exceptional cases, where the parents, regardless of their marital status, fail in their duty towards their children to such extent that the safety or welfare of any of their children is likely to be prejudicially affected, the State as guardian of the common good shall, by proportionate means as provided by law, endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.&quot;<br><br>  Of approximately 30,000 child protection and welfare concerns reported to the welfare services last year, the majority were addressed by way of support to the parents and families in question.  More than 16,000 of them related to child welfare, including 1,500 confirmed cases of sexual, physical or emotional abuse.  This referendum seeks to ensure children at risk are protected from harm and sets out when and how intervention should occur.  Intervention is an issue for the small number of people who oppose the referendum who argue that personnel from the Health Service Executive and social services will have <i>carte blanche</i> to remove children from their parents and homes.  However, the key proposal sets out when and how intervention should occur and provides for a focus on the child in that it refers to the impact of parent failure on the child's safety and welfare rather than solely on such failure and the reasons for it.  Overall, Article 42A focuses on affording protection to children under the Constitution, while respecting and preserving the rights of parents and families.<br><br>  I welcome developments in adoption reform.  I listened recently to a radio interview with a lady who detailed how she and her family had fostered a child for 12 years beginning at the age of three.  It was obvious the child in question was in a loving home where it was cherished and loved.  When the child sought to be adopted by the foster family, with its wholehearted endorsement, this provided impossible.  The legislation and proposed constitutional amendment, if passed, will change the position for children and foster families in such circumstances and is, therefore, warmly welcome. <br><br>  For many years, some children were taken into care and institutionalised and it is well documented that the State did not protect them.  However, many people have provided magnificent support and care in their homes for children who had to be taken from their parents as a result of abuse.  Many of the children in question were fantastic individuals who were able to progress to adulthood and lead lives free from social and mental deprivation.  The real heroes are the foster families and the women and men who lead them.  The referendum proposal and associated legislation to be published at the same time will provide greater possibilities than are currently provided for children to have a second chance by means of adoption by a loving family.  In addition, it is intended to allow for the first time for the voluntary placement for adoption of a child of married parents who voluntarily decide they are not in a position to care for it.  Such voluntary placements are currently only possible in the case of children of unmarried parents.<br><br>  I share the belief held by many other Deputies that the family is at the centre of society and life.  This is a Christian philosophy.  I sometimes worry what the future will hold if the family model breaks down.  Social breakdown, crime, drugs, sexual abuse and underage alcohol consumption have all resulted from family breakdown.  When one parent leaves a relationship, the other partner may not be in a position to manage the children on his or her own and matters spin out of control.  While this may be a debate for another day, it is a concern for society when family units break down because children in such broken partnerships often lose their way.<br><br>  I welcome the proposal in the Bill to give firmer recognition to the protection of the rights of children under the Constitution while continuing to respect and preserve the rights of the family, as set out in the existing Article 41 of the Constitution.  Many other proposals in the Bill are also worthy of mention but time does not permit me to discuss them.  My final words are for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and her team in the Department who worked hard over the summer to prepare the legislation.  They have got the wording and timing of the referendum right.  The criticism levelled at the Minister that she should have moved more quickly and announced a date for the referendum earlier is not valid.  Time is needed to prepare any proposed wording to change the Constitution.</p>

<!-- Snippet ref: WRA01100 type: 7 --> <a name='WRA01100'></a> <p><span class="speaker">Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney):</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=&HouseNum=&MemberID=250"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Simon Coveney"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=250&pid=SimonCoveney&year=2012&month=09&day=25"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Simon Coveney"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N12'>Exemption from income tax on the net rental profits arising from the lease of farmland has been available since January 1996 in certain circumstances and with defined limits. The eligibility and reliefs associated with it have been adjusted in a number of budgets since. At present, farmers must be a minimum of 40 years of age or over to be eligible for the relief.  The following income exemption rates also apply.<ul style="margin-left:20px">·  &#8364;12,000 for leases of 5 &#8211; 7 years,<br><br>·  &#8364;15,000 for leases of 7 &#8211; 10 years, and<br><br>·  &#8364;20,000 for leases of 10 years or more.</ul>  The objective of this measure is to provide the leasee with more security of tenure and thereby promote the proper maintenance and development of the land. Most recent figures available from Revenue are for 2009 when there were 2,747 claimants of this relief. <br><br>  The Department recognises that conacre or short term rental arrangements are not a desirable basis upon which medium or long term farm business planning can be founded upon. Many commercial full time farmers require leased land to achieve the necessary scale and efficiency as purchased land is scarce and expensive. Long term leasing gives such farmers more security of tenure, allowing them to make better longer term investment and planning decisions. The continued availability of this measure is a key element of the Department&#8217;s policy around addressing the land access and mobility issues faced by farmers and I would urge both farmers and landowners who are engaged in conacre rental arrangements to carefully consider the mutual benefits of switching to a longer term leasing agreement. <br><br>  The issue of possible tax incentives in Budget 2013 is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Finance. The taxation measures announced in Budget 2012 reflected the Government&#8217;s commitment to the agri-food industry and in particular to the expansion planned in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy, and I will be engaging with the Minister for Finance again before the introduction of Budget 2013 in relation to possible taxation measures linked to policy priorities in my Department.</p>

These schemes support farmers who choose to deliver environmental goods for the benefit of society as a whole. The fact that I made provision of &#8364;243m in the 2012 Vote for my Department for REPS and AEOS, despite a very difficult budgetary situation, demonstrates the strength of both my own and the Government&#8217;s commitment to environmentally-friendly farming practices. I believe that the schemes enhance the farmer&#8217;s role as custodian of our countryside while allowing productive farming to continue and are an essential part of our response to the significant environmental challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup>   century. <br><br>  REPS and AEOS are area based schemes which are co-funded by the EU under the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 and EU Regulations governing the Schemes must be strictly adhered to. These require that a full and comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, as well as field inspections, must be completed before payment issue. The Commission have made it clear, in the course of audits, that all checks must be passed and eligibility conditions met. This means that a farmer&#8217;s application must be fully in order, all outstanding documentation provided and queries resolved before payment can be released to him or her. Given these requirements, my officials take considerable care in validating payments while also ensuring that farmers receive their payments as soon as possible. <br><br>  In overall terms, the situation is that payments are more advanced at this stage than in previous years and I am satisfied that payments are issuing on schedule. I am confident, also, that the full Vote provision of &#8364;243m will be spent this year and that there will be no underspend. <br><br>  Insofar as REPS is concerned, practically all of the remaining 30,000 participants have received their 2011 payment and the last remaining query cases are being dealt with as queries are resolved. Arrangements to commence payments in respect of 2012 are ongoing and I expect that I will be in a position to commence payments earlier than last year and in higher numbers.  There are about<u>&nbsp;</u>14,500 active participants in AEOS, 8,200 in AEOS I and 6,300 in AEOS 2. Practically all of the early backlogs associated with these payments are now resolved. Almost all AEOS I 2010 payments have issued, and nearly 7,000 cases are finalised for 2011. The main issue holding up Year 2 payments are queries associated with capital investment claims and receipts. The Department has contacted all of the farmers where queries have arisen and is dealing with the responses received. Nearly 4,000 AEOS II participants have received their 2011 payment and payments continue to issue as the validation process is finalised. I expect to commence AEOS payments in respect of later in the year and to make a substantial number of payments before year end.</p>

I will prioritise securing final agreement between the EU Fisheries Council and the Parliament on all these proposals during the Irish Presidency during the first half of 2013.<br><br>  Ireland&#8217;s overarching goal for the new CFP is for a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to deliver a sustainable and eco centred fisheries landscape for future generations. <br><br>  Key issue and developments arising from the General approach adopted in June include:<ul style="margin-left:20px">·The removal from the Commissions original proposal of the mandatory nature of the proposed system of <b>Transferrable Fishing Concessions(TFCs)</b>   which I vehemently opposed since the outset and which had the potential to concentrate quotas in the hands of a few powerful European fishing companies. <br><br>· The Commission proposal provides for the  continuation of the <b>Hague Preferences</b>   system under which Ireland gets an enhanced share of certain key stocks on which we are traditionally dependant.  While I would prefer their permanent incorporation in Ireland&#8217;s percentage share, I have not received any support for this arrangement.<br><br>·A new compromise approach setting down a definitive timetable for the elimination of <b>discards</b>   on a phased basis was agreed at Council in June. <br><br>·Plans will be designed to bring the fish stocks above levels capable of producing <b>maximum sustainable yields (MSY) by 2015</b>  , where possible and for all stocks by 2020.  <br><br>·Irelands position on <b>regionalisation</b>   is to a large degree mirrored by the conclusions of the Common approach where Member States involved in a region would work together, in consultation with the EU Advisory Councils for the region and formulate general recommendations for fisheries conservation and management in the region.   <br><br>·<b>Future Funding</b>   - the new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund will be structured around 4 pillars, a) Smart, Green Fisheries, b) Smart, Green Aquaculture, c) Sustainable and Inclusive Territorial Development and d) Integrated Maritime Policy. I am seeking the continuation of aid for seafood processing and aquaculture, as well as for fleet modernisation and restructuring.</ul></p>

At the June Agriculture Council, the Danish Presidency presented a Progress Report outlining the current status of the negotiations. The Cyprus Presidency has continued the negotiating process, with debates at the Agriculture Council as recently as yesterday (24 September) on rural development and market support issues. The proposals are also being discussed in the European Parliament. Earlier in the summer, draft reports from EP rapporteurs on each of the Commission’s proposals were published, and about 8,000 amendments proposed by MEPs are currently being processed within the Parliament.  A  number of these elements will be the subject of substantial discussion and amendment over the coming months, and there will be ongoing contact at informal level between the Presidency, Commission and Council as they are developing their positions. </p><p><a name='N21'>  Negotiations on the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the EU budget for the period 2014 to 2020 are being progressed in parallel, primarily through the General Affairs Council, although the final decisions will be taken by the European Council. Many of the CAP issues, including the key issue of distribution of funds between Member States, are being discussed in the MFF negotiations and will ultimately be agreed as part of these negotiations.  </p><p><a name='N22'>  My key concerns as regards the reform proposals arise in four areas.  These are the overall CAP funding, the method for distributing CAP funds between Member States, the method for distributing direct payment funds within Member States and the overarching need for simplification in the reformed CAP. </p><p><a name='N23'>  On the budget, the funding proposals in the MFF maintain CAP spending at current levels in nominal terms post-2013. The agriculture heading is the one showing the greatest restraint, and in my view the amount proposed by the Commission is the minimum required. However, there are continuing, and intense, pressures for reductions in the proposed overall EU budget, with obvious implications for proposed CAP allocations. The Irish Government will continue to resist any pressure for reductions in the CAP budget. </p><p><a name='N24'>  As to the allocation of CAP funds between Member States, the current Commission proposals for Direct Payments in Pillar 1 take a pragmatic approach to redistribution and are broadly satisfactory, albeit with some loss to Ireland (estimated at around 1.4%).  The Commission has yet to table a specific proposal for allocation of pillar 2 (rural development) funds.  I have concerns that the basis on which they propose to do so could reduce our allocation.  However I am vigorously defending our Pillar 2 funds, and will continue to do so.  </p><p><a name='N25'>  As to the distribution of direct payments within Member States, the Commission proposal is to gradually move towards a system of uniform per hectare payments, or flat rates, by 2019, in each Member State or region of a Member State.  Many Member States already have such flat rates or are evolving towards them. I recognise that we cannot continue to base our payments on outdated historic production references. Nevertheless, I have major difficulties with the pace and extent of convergence in the Commission’s proposal.  </p><p><a name='N26'>  Under a national flat rate, although the overall allocation to Ireland would not change, around 76,000 Irish farmers would gain an average of 86% on their current payments, while around 57,000 would lose an average of 33%. These are average percentages, and some of the gains and losses would be far larger than this. For example, in the extreme case of those on very high payments of over €1000 per hectare, the loss would be well over 70%.  In general, the losses would be incurred by more productive farmers. This would have undesirable consequences at a time when Ireland is trying to encourage sustainable intensification in the agri-food sector, as we strive to achieve the objectives in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. </p><p><a name='N27'>  I have accordingly been pressing for the maximum possible flexibility to be given to Member States to design payment models that suit their own farming conditions. I also want a more gradual, back-loaded transition process. The ‘approximation’ approach, by which all payments could gradually move towards, but not fully to, the average, is one alternative that I believe should be considered in this regard. The Commission’s “pragmatic” proposal for redistribution between Member States is, in effect, an approximation approach and provides a useful precedent. Modelling in my Department suggests that the application of this system to the distribution of funds between farmers in Ireland would lead to much smaller gains and losses to individual farmers than a flat rate system. However the precise level of transfers depends on the details of the methodology used.</p><p><a name='N28'>  I have been very active in seeking allies for this position and I have been making significant progress, particularly with a group of Member States with somewhat similar concerns.  However, it should also be understood that a majority of Member States have no difficulty with the idea of flat rate payments, although they have concerns about other aspects of the proposals.</p><p><a name='N29'>  The negotiation process on CAP is a complex and difficult one, but all of my efforts are focused on achieving the best possible outcome for Ireland. These efforts will be continued over the coming months as I continue to build close working relationships and potential alliances with the European Parliament and with Member States. I will also continue to press the Irish position with Commissioner Ciolos - whom I met as recently as last Friday in Dublin - ahead of a determined attempt to reach an agreement during our Presidency in 2013.  </p>

The catch per pot haul has declined in those areas and while the stock does not appear to be in imminent danger, the reduction in catch rates has resulted in fishermen using more and more pots to maintain their earnings.  </p><p><a name='N32'>   Present measures to protect the lobster stock include Council Regulation (EC) No. 850/98, which prescribes a minimum landing size of 85mm for lobster and the Lobster Conservation of Stocks Regulations 2006, which prohibit the catching, landing or sale of v-notched lobsters.  The lobster v-notching and live return scheme, operated by BIM and co-funded by the European Fisheries Fund, is a vital national tool in ensuring that many female lobsters caught are v-notched by BIM staff and returned alive to the sea to spawn and contribute to the reproduction of the stock over many years.</p><p><a name='N33'>  My policy for all sea-fisheries is to promote sustainable fishing, good environmental practice and compliance with law.  In the case of inshore fisheries, in light of the judgement of the European Court of Justice against Ireland concerning non-compliance with the EU Habitats and Birds Directives, the overriding priority continues to be to bring all inshore fisheries and aquaculture in Natura 2000 sites into full compliance with the EU Birds &amp; Habitats Directives.  </p><p><a name='N34'>  The Habitats Directive requires that an appropriate assessment consider the potential impact of the proposed activity on the conservation objectives for each Natura 2000 site affected.  Given the national nature of the lobster fishery, almost all of the approximately 90 Natura sites around our coast could be affected.  In addition, the Directive requires that the potential impacts on the habitat of a proposed activity be considered in combination with the potential impacts of all other activities or proposed activities in each Natura site, including other fisheries, aquaculture and non-fishing activities.  </p><p><a name='N35'>  The resource intensive Natura 2000 compliance project will ultimately lead to appropriate assessment of all of our Natura sites.  That multi annual, multi-agency project is continuing to address appropriate assessment of each of our Natura sites in turn.  A substantial body of scientific data has been generated over the course of recent years and is now near completion.  The project is currently focussed on roll-out of appropriate assessments.  Three comprehensive appropriate assessments under the Habitats Directive are already completed, in respect of Castlemaine Harbour County Kerry, Dundalk Bay Co. Louth and Roaring Water Bay Co Cork.  Work is at an advanced stage in respect of Lough Swilly Co Donegal and Clew Bay Co Mayo, among others.  </p>

Coordination of the State contribution to FH 2020 is being overseen by this Committee which includes representatives from Bord Bia, Teagasc, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Enterprise Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department. The HLIC also engages regularly with various private sector groups with a key role in FH2020. Implementation of many of the key measures needed to achieve the growth figures set out in the report is a matter for private sector actors including industry and individual farmers.<br><br>  As a high level strategic vision, the Food Harvest 2020 report does not contain implementation plans related to specific sites, including Natura 2000 sites. However, my Department and the HLIC are acutely aware of the need to ensure that appropriate assessment and strategic environmental analysis are considered, in line with the relevant EU Directives, and carried out where required, in the course of achieving the targets set out in the report. <br><br>  The HLIC committee recognised that the broad strategic targets in the report could be achieved in a variety of ways and determined that an independent environmental analysis should be commissioned of various possible scenarios through which the targets set out in the report could be achieved. The results of this analysis will inform the implementation of measures by all relevant actors, including those in the private sector. An independent team of experienced consultants with expertise in both agriculture and environmental assessment has been procured by my Department to carry out this work. The team has presented a detailed interim report to the HLIC and is due to present its final report by the end of October.<br><br>  The analysis is in line with the strategic environmental assessment process and includes the likely impacts of achieving the targets, through a number of scenarios, including; biodiversity, flora/fauna, water, including groundwater quality, soil, air quality, landscape and climatic factors including impacts on greenhouse gas emission levels. My Department is considering if the analysis should include an appropriate assessment under the Habitats Directive, and in this regard we are engaged in discussions with the European Commission. <br><br>As part of the analysis<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  process my Department has facilitated a public consultation, with details of the consultation posted on my Department&#8217;s website on 11 May 2012 and advertised in the Irish Independent on 16 May 2012 with a closing date of 28 June 2012 so that submissions could inform the work of the consultants in preparation of the interim report. Following representations from a number of interested parties, my Department extended the closing date to 6 July 2012, representing an eight week consultation period. Any further submissions received after the deadline, are also being forwarded to the consultants to inform their final report. </p>

Specifically within the dairy sector, the stakeholders identified the abolition of the milk quota regime in 2015 as a real opportunity for the sector to expand.  Ireland strongly supported the abolition of the regime, on the basis that quotas were widely regarded by both the Irish dairy industry and market analysts as a brake on the potential of the sector to respond positively to market opportunities.</p><p><a name='N4'>  The setting of the target that the volume of milk produced in 2020 will be 50% greater than that produced in the 2007-2009 baseline period, reflects the confidence of the industry, as represented by the stakeholders on the Food Harvest Committee, in the potential of the sector.  </p><p><a name='N5'>  My Department and its agencies are playing their part through the monitoring, and implementation where relevant, of the 55 actions identified by the Dairy Expansion Activation Group’s Roadmap as a means to achieving the 50% target; through the provision of support for a Dairy Efficiency Programme which provides for the  transfer of critical knowledge within the sector by way of Discussion Groups; through  the provision of dairy equipment grants for the upgrading of dairy farms; and through the activities of Teagasc who are playing a critical role in research, development and innovation in the sector and Bord Bia who are engaged in the  development of a sustainability model for the Irish dairy sector, as well as the provision of support for the work of ICBF in improving breed quality in the Irish herd. I am confident that  milk processors will also play their part, taking appropriate decisions on the basis of viable market assessments, to have in place the necessary processing facility to meet the increased supply.  Indeed I am aware that the country’s two leading milk processors have recently announced their plans for providing the necessary increased processing capacity.</p><p><a name='N6'>  While we are all aware that the supply management arrangements that currently exist under the Milk Quota regime will no longer apply after 2015, I am confident that the processing industry will work with the milk producers to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place to allow a coherent and thriving dairy industry to exploit the undoubted potential in existing and new markets. </p>

Given that GM crops are not cultivated commercially in Ireland and are unlikely to be for the foreseeable future, the issue of cultivation and coexistence does not arise at present.  <br><br>  Policy on genetic modification across Government Departments is that Ireland&#8217;s general stance at EU level and in international fora should be positive but precautionary, recognising the potential benefits of genetic engineering, while maintaining a fundamental commitment to human safety and environmental sustainability based on scientific risk assessment and management.  <br><br>  The field study being carried out by Teagasc on genetically modified potatoes resistant to late blight is part of a publicly funded EU research project being carried out by a consortium of 22 partners representing 15 EU Member States.  The goal of the study is to research the impact of the GM potato on the blight disease itself and on soil organisms, which are essential to maintaining soil health.  <br><br>  The Aarhus Convention recognises the need for increased transparency and greater public participation in decision making. Teagasc are committed to disseminating all their research findings on these trials to the public, and have stated that during the study, the trial site will be accessible to the public for open days and information sessions and that they welcome the participation of all stakeholders.     </p>

In relation to the authorisation and use of products consisting of or containing authorised GM ingredients in animal feed, my Department adopts, on the basis of scientific evaluation, a positive but precautionary approach to EU applications for the authorisation of GM ingredients in food and feed and supports applications which have been deemed to be safe by EFSA.  <br><br>  In regard to the recent approval granted by the EPA to Teagasc, to carry out field trials on a genetically modified potato, with improved resistance to late potato blight, it must be pointed out that these trials do not constitute cultivation of a commercial crop and that under the EPA consent attached to this approval, they will be subject to strict conditions with regular monitoring and reporting to the EPA for compliance. </p>

This was approved and will enable payment to issue immediately following 16 October and will represent early payment of €600 million to farmers.  </p><p><a name='N33'>Also I appreciate fully the value and importance of the other scheme payments to farmers and I remain committed to ensuring that the maximum numbers are paid at the earliest possible date, mindful, of course, of the over-riding necessity to ensure compliance with the governing EU requirements.  Payments worth some €154 under the Disadvantaged Area Scheme will begin tomorrow, 26th   September. This funding will provide a boost to the rural economy and will benefit all areas of the country.  REPS payments in respect of 2011 are up to date. A total of €64 million has been paid out to-date and i envisage that by the end 2012 a further €121 million will be spent. AEOS payments are well advanced and continue to issue as quickly as possible.  My intention is to ensure that payments in respect of 2012 are paid on the earliest possible date.   </p><p><a name='N34'>  Teagasc have been very active in providing advice &amp; assistance for farmers affected by the bad weather.  All Teagasc offices are taking calls from concerned farmers. A series of public meetings are being held across the country in September to address fodder / financial and social aspects of the weather crisis. Weather clinics were held in all Teagasc offices recently. </p><p><a name='N35'>  I am very aware of the difficult situation with regard to winter fodder this year. A survey conducted by Teagasc identified a shortage on many farms, particularly dairy farms and also highlighted that addressing this would require different approaches on each farm. I am delighted that a number of workshops have been conducted by Teagasc where farmers could discuss with an advisor the best solution for their own circumstances.</p><p><a name='N36'>  In addition, I approached Minister Hogan who is responsible for the Nitrates regulations and agreed extensions to the period allowed for spreading of both chemical and organic fertilisers this Autumn to 30 September and 31 October respectively. This is aimed at maximising the opportunity for a farmer to extend the grazing season this Autumn and reduce the winter feed requirement.</p><p><a name='N37'>  My officials are in regular contact with the banking sector with a view to discussing the credit needs of the sector.  I am also pleased that a number of banks have recently announced new lending programmes for farmers that take account of the specific needs of the sector.  The banks have also attended a number of recent workshops and conferences and are engaging with academics with a view to improving financial training in the sector.  I am fully aware that credit is severely limited due to the current global economic situation and my officials will continue to engage with all relevant parties to ensure that adequate credit is made available for the sector.</p>

This re-structuring included:<br><br>  -dissolving and reorganising a number of administrative Oireachtas Committees to allow the re-allocation of resources towards Oireachtas Committees dealing with Government Departments;<br><br>  -the establishment of an Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, to focus solely on this Government priority area;<ul style="margin-left:20px">  The establishment of an Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to deal with the increased workload in this area in light of the proposed changes to the CAP; and </ul>  -the merger of the role of Chairperson of the Oireachtas Committee on the Good Friday Agreement with that of the Irish Co-Chair of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.<br><br>  These reforms did not increase the number of Oireachtas Committee Chairpersons.<br><br>  The Programme for Government also contains a commitment to increase the number of Dáil sitting days by 50%. The number of sitting days has been significantly increased since the change of Government through the introduction of regular Friday sitting days and by reducing the length of Dáil breaks at Christmas and Easter; after bank holidays; and during the summer. In the Government&#8217;s first year in office there were 127 Dáil sitting days, compared with 88 Dáil sitting days in the last year in office of the previous Government.<br><br>  Work on a second set of Dáil reforms is at an advanced stage. The Government Chief Whip has held discussions with the Dáil Whips, the Ceann Comhairle, the Dáil Reform sub-committee of the Dáil CPP, the Chair of the Working Group of Committee Chairs and officials in Leinster House and the second phase of Government&#8217;s Dáil Reform Programme will be introduced later in the year. </p>

However, I will contact the Deputy shortly with the information requested in relation to committees and working groups insofar as it is available.  <br><br>  The National Economic and Social Development Office (NESDO) is the only agency under the aegis of my Department.

This is a reduction of over &#8364;1.1m<b>&nbsp;</b>  on 2010.<br><br>  My Department also rationalised the work and achieved substantial savings in relation to three other bodies which were formerly within its remit in recent years.  The total separate programme funding for the work of the Ireland Newfoundland Partnership and the Active Citizenship Office ceased in 2009 and their work subsumed into the Department.  The separate Offices in these areas have been discontinued which has given rise to savings in my Department&#8217;s Estimates of approximately &#8364;356,000 per annum.  The National Forum on Europe was closed in 2009 which also gave rise to savings in the Estimates of &#8364;360,000.</p>

In focusing on EU development policy during the Presidency, we will seek to build on the strong focus in Ireland’s aid programme on the fight to end hunger and undernutrition and the growing impact of global challenges, including climate change. </p><p><a name='N24'>  The Irish Presidency comes at a crucial period for international development policy, as the international community opens discussion on the framework for global development after 2015, the target date for the Millennium Development Goals.  A special political meeting will be held at the United Nations, probably in September 2013, to review progress on the Millennium Development Goals and to begin consideration of the post-2015 development framework. </p><p><a name='N25'>  A key priority for Ireland’s Presidency will be to ensure that the EU adopts a strong, coherent position for this Millennium Development Goals event.  In working with our partners to guide discussions on the post-2015 development framework we will build on our commitment to eradicate poverty and hunger in the world.  We will also work to highlight the important linkages between hunger, nutrition and climate change and to have these linkages recognised for future policy and programming internationally.</p><p><a name='N26'>  We will also work to forge stronger links between humanitarian relief and development aid, based on experience in emergencies in recent years.  Drawing on lessons from the Horn of Africa emergency in 2011 and with input from our partners in developing countries, we will explore the practical application of these principles and showcase examples of best practice. We will place particular emphasis on the EU’s approach to disaster risk reduction, helping communities to prepare and take action to avert the effects of disasters and emergencies.  We plan to hold an informal meeting of EU Development Ministers in Dublin in February 2013, which will be the first opportunity for substantive discussion by Ministers of all these key issues. </p><p><a name='N27'>  I and my officials have been consulting closely with Ireland’s development NGOs in preparation for the EU Presidency.  The policy document just published by Trócaire is an important contribution to the discussion.  I look forward to continuing our dialogue with Trócaire and the other members of Dóchas, the umbrella body for the development NGOs, in the lead-up to and during the EU Presidency.</p>

In addition to its normal ongoing functions, the Department currently has to manage an unprecedented conjuncture of major international responsibilities against a background of a 12% reduction in its core personnel complement over the past three years.  Ireland’s current Chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which has impacted heavily on the workload of staff at headquarters and in many of our Missions abroad, overlaps with the necessary extensive advance preparations for Ireland’s 2013 EU Presidency, which will also considerably increase the demands on the Department.  Meeting these challenges requires the maximum possible availability of skilled and experienced staff, particularly at middle management and senior levels.  While the Department has been granted some temporary additional posts for the OSCE chairmanship and for the EU Presidency, sourcing sufficient suitably experienced staff has presented major challenges.  </p><p><a name='N7'>  Under the relevant Department of Public Expenditure and Reform circular, the operation of the career break scheme is subject to the operating requirements of the Department not being adversely affected.  Discretionary release of experienced staff, without the ability to replace them, would have a very negative impact on the Department’s capacity to deliver on its responsibilities in the period leading up to and during the EU Presidency.  Accordingly, the Department concluded last January that it simply had no available alternative but to temporarily suspend the career break facility, other than in the most exceptional circumstances.  The position will be reviewed at the end of the Presidency in mid-2013 in the light of the Department’s business requirements at that time.</p>

Prior to that Act, any person taking a pension under a defined contribution (DC) scheme or a Retirement Annuity Contract had no choice but to purchase an annuity with their remaining pension pot after drawing down the permissible  tax-free lump sum. </p><p><a name='N14'>  The choices which then became available included the existing option to purchase an annuity with those remaining funds, and new options to receive the balance of the pension funds in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate), to invest in an approved retirement fund (ARF) or an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF), subject to certain conditions. Access to these flexible options was extended to all main benefits from retirement benefit schemes (other than Defined Benefit arrangements) in Finance Act 2011.</p><p><a name='N15'>  Under the regime the options to</p><p><a name='N16'>       ·    invest in an ARF, or</p><p><a name='N17'>       ·    receive the balance of the pension fund in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate)</p><p><a name='N18'>are subject to conditions. The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has a guaranteed level of pension income (“specified income”) actually in payment for life at the time the option to effect the ARF or cash option is exercised. The purpose of the specified income requirement is to ensure, before an individual has unfettered access to their remaining retirement funds via an ARF or by way of the cash option (subject to tax), that they have the security of an adequate guaranteed pension income throughout the period of their retirement.</p><p><a name='N19'>  Finance Act 2011 increased the specified income limit from the previous fixed amount of €12,700 per annum introduced in 1999, and unchanged since that time, to a variable amount equal to 1.5 times the maximum annual rate of the State Pension (Contributory) bringing the specified income limit to €18,000 per annum at present.  However, as a transitional measure, Finance Act 2011 allows the previous lower guaranteed income requirement of €12,700 per annum to continue to apply for a period of 3 years from the date that Act was signed into law (6 February 2011), including for individuals who had retired before that date and who already had an AMRF.</p><p><a name='N20'>  The State Pension (Contributory) would count towards meeting the specified income limit.  You should note, however, that only guaranteed pension income paid to the individual in his or her own right can be taken into account for this purpose. Pensions paid directly to the spouse of an individual or pensions/allowances received on behalf of a spouse or dependant may not be included.</p><p><a name='N21'>  Where the minimum specified income test is not met, and an individual does not wish to purchase an annuity, then an AMRF must be chosen into which a “set aside” amount must be invested. The purpose of an AMRF is to ensure a capital or income “safety net” throughout the latter period of their retirement for individuals with pension income below the specified income limit.  Prior to Finance Act 2011, the “set aside” amount was fixed at the first €63,500 of the pension fund or the remainder of the fund after taking the tax-free lump sum, if less than €63,500. Finance Act 2011 increased the “set aside” amount to 10 times the maximum annual rate of State Pension (Contributory) – €119,800 at present – or the remainder of the pension fund, after taking the tax-free lump sum, if less. The capital in an AMRF is not available to an individual until he or she reaches 75 years though any income generated by the fund can be drawn down subject to tax. The capital in an AMRF can be used by the owner at any time to purchase an annuity and the AMRF can be changed to an ARF with access to the capital sum (subject to taxation) before the age of 75 where the specified income test is met before that age.</p><p><a name='N22'>  These are the various requirements around the operation of the options at retirement for those with Retirement Annuity Contracts, Personal Retirement Savings Accounts and other defined contribution pension arrangements and the reasons for those requirements.  While I am not in possession of all of the relevant personal details of your constituent’s case which would impact on the scope of the options available to your constituent, and subject to that very important caveat, the following options may be available with regard to the AMRF, other than to leave the capital sum until age 75:</p><p><a name='N23'>  -	The use of the AMRF funds to purchase a pension annuity.</p><p><a name='N24'>  -	If your constituent is in receipt of the State Pension (Contributory), the amount of that pension in payment to him/her in his/her own right (excluding any amount in respect of a dependent) would count towards meeting the annual specified income test which in this case could be €12,700 at this point in time. The funds in the AMRF could be used to purchase a pension annuity equivalent to the difference between the relevant State Pension amount and €12,700. Any remaining funds in the AMRF would then be available as an ARF and could be withdrawn as a lump sum amount subject to income tax at your constituent’s marginal rate.</p>

This increase is an international phenomenon. Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions.</p><p><a name='N27'>  The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase. On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  However, in this regard it should be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is re-allocated to petrol and other oil products, and away from other VAT liable spending, and to the extent that the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.</p><p><a name='N28'>  It should also be noted that businesses are of course entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel. For example, VAT incurred on auto-diesel and marked gas oil (MGO or green diesel) used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system. VAT on petrol cannot be deducted/reclaimed.  There are no plans for temporary taxation adjustments, as to do so, could lead to significant costs to the Exchequer. </p>

Hospital consultants<b>&nbsp;</b>are classified on tax records as a constituent of specialist medical practice activities and are classified within the same economic sector as certain other health-related services, such as treatment in family planning centers<font color="#FF0000"> </font>and therefore cannot be separately identified.  The income tax for 2010 paid by individuals engaged in specialist medical practice activities amounted to close on &#8364;100 million representing an average effective tax rate of 29.7%, which is calculated as the percentage of total tax liability to gross income. It should be noted that gross income is as defined in Revenue Statistical Report 2010. This figure is derived from the details of personal income tax returns filed for the year 2010, the latest year for which the necessary detailed information is available. <br><br>  You may wish to note that the sector identifier used on the tax records is based on the 4 digit &#8220;NACE code (Rev. 2)&#8221; which is an internationally recognised economic activity code system. The NACE codes are not essential for the assessment and collection of taxes and duties and the correct allocation and maintenance of these codes is subject to the limit of available resources within the Revenue Commissioners. NACE code classifications on tax records are compiled by reference to the primary area of economic activity reported by individual and corporate taxpayers on their own behalf and the taxes collected are allocated to those codes without reference to the precise economic activity which generated them. <br><br>  While the accuracy of the NACE codes on tax records is sufficient to underpin broad sector-based analyses there will undoubtedly be some inaccuracies at individual level. This should be borne in mind when considering the information provided. The sector identified for this reply represents the closest equivalent in the NACE code system to the activity mentioned in the question. </p>

The Domicile Levy was introduced in Finance Act 2010 and was charged on an individual:</p><p><a name='N33'>  ·	who in any year is Irish domiciled and an Irish citizen,</p><p><a name='N34'>  ·	whose worldwide income for the year exceeds €1m,</p><p><a name='N35'>  ·	whose Irish located property in the year is greater than €5m, and</p><p><a name='N36'>  ·	whose liability to Irish income tax for the year is less than €200,000.</p><p><a name='N37'>  Where a relevant person has paid income tax that person is entitled to a credit for the tax paid in calculating the amount of the Domicile Levy.</p><p><a name='N38'>  The amendment introduced in section 136 Finance Act 2012 removed the requirement to be an Irish citizen.  The effect of this amendment is that persons who meet the other criteria will be liable to the levy whether or not they are Irish citizens.  The returns for the tax year 2012 will be the first returns affected by the amendment.  These returns are due to be filed on or before 31 October 2013.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that no returns in relation to the Domicile Levy for the tax year 2012 have been filed to date.  It is not possible at this point to determine how many persons this measure will affect for the tax year 2012.</p><p><a name='N39'>  The only year for which Domicile Levy returns have been filed is the tax year 2010.  These returns were due on 31 October 2011.  In all, 11 returns have been filed in relation to the Domicile Levy for 2010 and the tax paid was €1,667,011.  The levy applies to both resident and non-resident individuals who meet the above criteria.  Based on information available to Revenue, eight individuals who filed Domicile Levy returns for 2010 are not resident in Ireland for tax purposes.  The number of persons who have filed income tax returns for 2010, the latest year for which figures are available, indicating that they are non-resident is 10,781.  Many non-resident individuals who file Irish tax returns would have a foreign domicile and accordingly would not be liable for the Domicile Levy.</p><p><a name='N40'>  The Programme for Government update in March 2012 confirmed the commitment to undertake a consultation process on residence issues in 2012 to inform preparation for further changes in 2013. I launched a public consultation on tax residence rules in May this year, wherein I invited interested parties to make submissions on possible revisions to the current residence rules for the taxation of individuals.  This consultation process has now concluded.  A total of eight submissions have been received and these will be published in due course, as indicated when the consultation was announced.  My officials are considering the submissions and will be advising me on possible further changes as part of the preparations for Budget 2013.</p>

Contravention of these statutory obligations constitutes criminal offences and, under Section 7 of the NAMA Act, a person who commits such offences may be liable to a substantial fine or term of imprisonment or both.</p>

For these reasons, Revenue focuses on deterring shadow/hidden economy activity and non-compliance through its audit and investigation programmes based on risk analysis, use of Revenue powers and their intelligence and information systems.   Revenue tackles the problem of the shadow economy through its range of compliance and audit interventions including through targeted special projects. Case interventions are undertaken based on Revenue&#8217;s assessment of compliance risks, the level of those risks and other relevant information available. Revenue is using a wide range of methodologies to identify those operating in the shadow economy and is deploying the full range of compliance interventions. Activities can include covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues as well as pre arranged aspect queries on specific items. This work is continuing.<br><br>The Revenue Commissioner&#8217;s approach to the shadow economy is underpinned by close consultation and cooperation with the Department of Social Protection. The primary objective of these activities is to uncover either non-declaration<b>&nbsp;</b>  or under declaration of income and/or fraudulent DSP claims.<br><br>  The Deputy will be aware of the continuing strengthening of legislation to provide for a robust framework within which the Revenue Commissioners may tackle tax and duty evasion, including recent provisions relating to: - <ul style="margin-left:20px">  -The making of returns of transactions by merchant acquirers, and other payment settlement entities, to the Revenue Commissioners.<br><br>  -The more effective investigation of white-collar crime.</ul>  Further provisions included a comprehensive package of measures in relation to Excise (Oils) including, requirement for separate licences for auto-fuel traders and marked fuel traders, requirement to have a separate licence for every premises or place at which the fuel concerned is dealt in, and a requirement that a licence must be clearly displayed at the premises or place.<br><br>  Revenue&#8217;s tobacco strategy, &#8220;Strategy On Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011- 2013)&#8221; was published on the Revenue website in June 2011. This three-year strategy is underpinned by annual action plans. <br><br>  The strategic level plans include taking steps to ensure that the legitimate trade remains compliant, delivering more effective and visible interventions through enhanced capability and better deployment of Revenue resources. The strategy also include further development of cooperation and intelligence sharing at national and international level, together with a commitment to prosecute all serious cases of tobacco tax evasion and a focus, in partnership with other Government agencies, on reducing the demand for contraband tobacco.<br><br>  During 2011 Revenue&#8217;s Customs Service seized a total of 109 million cigarettes in 10,581 seizures. Commercial quantities in maritime freight traffic accounted for 76.4 million cigarettes. Revenue also seized 11,158 kg of tobacco in 2011. In six particular operations, over 19 million cigarettes, 1,344 kg tobacco and 49 vehicles were seized.<br><br>  Regulations were also introduced in 2011 requiring Government Departments and State Bodies to supply details of payments made to the Revenue Commissioners. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this data is matched to the Revenue records of the various recipients, and is used to profile risk. Similar matching is also carried out using other third party data received by the Revenue Commissioners.<br><br>  Revenue has a prioritised focus on those sectors that traditionally have been susceptible to shadow activity such as cash businesses. All possible sources of information, including following up on services advertised on TV, radio, local newspapers, Internet, special interest publications are used by Revenue. <br><br>  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that in order to inform the approaches they are taking, and help determine where resources may best be deployed, they continue to engage in meetings with trade and representative bodies. The Hidden Economy Monitoring Group provides a forum for the exchange of views on the effectiveness of measures introduced in combating the hidden economy. This group, which is chaired by Revenue, includes representatives from employer and business organisations, trade unions and other Government Departments and agencies. Regional hidden economy liaison groups have been established to facilitate greater local interaction and more immediate responses to insights and issues that may be highlighted. <br><br>  Revenue investigations have detected the use of computer programmes or electronic devices to alter or conceal sales records. To counteract these risks, legislation was enacted in 2011 providing penalties for the possession, use or supply of automated sales suppression devices known as &quot;zappers&quot; for the purpose of evading tax. <br><br>  Streetscape programmes, in which every cash business in an area is visited, without prior announcement, have been carried out. While the main focus of real time activity is on businesses that use cash registers, all sectors that have cash receipts are monitored. This includes professionals such as doctors, veterinary surgeons, etc.  These operations have also resulted in the registration of previously unregistered persons. 803 such registrations were recorded in the period from January to the end of April 2012.<br><br>  The results from all the various projects are reflected in the general audit and compliance results from audits, assurance checks, site visits etc. which are published in the Revenue Annual Report.</p>

This will serve to broaden the tax base and increase betting duty receipts.   The Finance Act 2011 provides for the taxation of bets that remote bookmakers enter into with persons in the State. This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based. The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets. The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements; however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model, in other words a 15% tax on the commission charged. In addition, excise duties are being applied to the granting and renewal of remote bookmakers’ and remote betting intermediaries’ licences. </p><p><a name='N10'>  The Betting (Amendment) Bill, which was published in July, will establish the regulatory framework for these licences. The tax changes provided for in the Finance Act can only be implemented once the Betting (Amendment) Bill is enacted. </p><p><a name='N11'>  I am hopeful that by including the high-growth area of the betting sector the tax base from betting will be boosted significantly.</p><p><a name='N12'>  In addition, this measure conveys a positive signal to international betting operations that have expressed an interest in or have already invested in Ireland. A location with an appropriate licensing regime coupled with relatively low taxes provides real investment and employment opportunities in this sector, which ultimately can potentially be beneficial to all concerned.

Lump sum amounts up to €200,000 are paid free of tax. They are also paid free of USC. The portion of a lump sum between €200,001 and €575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%. This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum. No USC is chargeable. Any amount of a lump sum in excess of €575,000 is taxed at the individual’s marginal rate of tax (credits and other tax reliefs are available). In this instance, USC is chargeable on the excess. These amounts are lifetime amounts with prior lump sums aggregating with later lump sums.   I assume from the Deputy’s question that he is proposing that retirement lump sums in excess of €150,000 be taxed as outlined above. As there is no general requirement for data on the number of persons who are receiving payments of retirement lump sums of less than €200,000 to be returned to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners, I am not in a position to provide definitive figures on the Exchequer impact of reducing the tax-free retirement lump sum amount from €200,000 to €150,000.</p><p><a name='N20'>  As an exercise that might provide some indication of the scale of the savings involved, it is estimated that just under 2,500 individuals in the public service would be on salaries of over €100,000 and less than €133,500 which, under existing pension scheme arrangements generally applying across the public service, would deliver retirement lump sums of between €150,000 and €200,000. If it is assumed that these individuals would retire in line with retirement trends from the public service in a normal year (about 2.5%), then the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums in excess of €150,000 at 20% could be less than €0.5 m in a full year.</p><p><a name='N21'>  I have no data on which to provide a similar estimate in relation to the private sector. I should point out, however, that one significant difference between public sector and private sector pension schemes is that private sector schemes invariably allow scheme members the option of commuting part of their pension fund for a tax-free lump sum. This option is not available to members of public sector schemes. Depending on the impact of any tax charge on retirement lump sums, the option to commute part of a pension fund may no longer be exercised by private sector pension scheme members or may be exercised in a manner that reduces the value of the lump sum taken to minimise or avoid any immediate tax charge.</p>

It was last reviewed in 2007.   The terms of reference for this Review, which is currently underway, involved the evaluation of the tax expenditure scheme in broad socio-economic and fiscal terms, and are summarised as follows:<br><br>  ·Examination of the costs and benefits of the existing scheme, taking into account displacement/deadweight impacts, and the interplay between this and other tax reliefs<br><br>  ·The identification of value for money of the scheme to the economy overall<br><br>  ·Examination of the international competitiveness context within which the sector operates <br><br>  ·Recommendations, where and if necessary, for changes that could be made to enhance / maximise the value for money to the tax payer and sustainable job creation and taking digital production and technological advances into account.<br><br>  Part of the work of the Review also involves an assessment of incentives in a number of competitor jurisdictions including the UK.<br><br>Twenty one responses were received following a public consultation process , which ended on 31 August last.

It is offered to each party after the internal complaints procedure of a financial services provider (e.g. Bank) has been exhausted by the complainant.  There is no obligation on either party to accept the offer of mediation. The Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau has advised me that, in the majority of cases, it is not taken up by either party.  The Bureau does not keep a record of refusals by banks to proceed to mediation.<br><br>  Since the Financial Services Ombudsman commenced processing complaints in 2005, mediation was offered in each case. In 2011, 15 cases were referred to full mediation i.e. where the two parties met with a mediator. I have also been advised that a total of only 23 cases were ever resolved through mediation.  If mediation is not taken up by either party or is unsuccessful, the file is sent for investigation and ultimately, adjudication by the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p>

Each tranche pays a market based fixed rate of interest which is set on the date of issue and is appropriate to the maturity date of the tranche. The promissory notes pay 10% of the initial principal amount of each tranche annually.  Interest to be earned by IBRC on the promissory notes will, over their contractual life, total &#8364;16.8 billion.(table attached)   As the Deputy is aware IBRC provides details of sale and repurchase agreements with Central Banks in their published accounts. This figure amounts to C &#8364;42.3bn as at 30 June 2012 (Interim Accounts).  However, as I have already indicated that while there is an implicit link between the current repayment schedule on the Promissory Note and ELA there is no specific repayment schedule, as such, in relation to ELA.<br><br>  Finally, while not issuing a revised projection the bank remains of the view that there will be a small return to the State at full resolution, given the assumptions currently being used. <br><br>  Set out below is a detailed aggregated schedule of capital repayments and interest payments on the promissory notes:<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="90%"

The scheme also permits employers to take a double deduction for the salary of the employee when calculating profits for the purpose of taxation.   This incentive applies in respect of individuals who have been unemployed for at least 12 months and are in receipt of a specified social protection payment or, who are in a category approved for the purposes of the scheme by the Minister for Social Protection with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Disability benefit and disability allowance are both qualifying payments for the purposes of this scheme.<br><br>  The scheme is designed to help the long-term unemployed get back into paid employment by helping to ensure that the income earned from that employment is greater than could be obtained by staying on welfare payments. The additional income deductions are gradually reduced over the three year period.<br><br>  To amend the scheme such that the disabled would retain access to the additional income deductions in perpetuity would go beyond the objectives of the scheme.<br><br>  I would point out that if an individual is in receipt of certain disability payments, they may be allowed to do work or training and keep their payment or part-payment on the grounds that it is considered rehabilitative or therapeutic.<br><br>  People with disabilities are, in general, liable to pay tax on their incomes in the same way as everyone else. The tax system does however provide additional tax credits and exempts certain incomes from tax for persons with disabilities of a permanent nature.<br><br>  Anyone who is permanently incapacitated either physically or mentally, where he or she is unable to maintain himself or herself, may be able to claim one or more of the additional tax credits available. In addition, parents/guardians and persons who care for dependent relatives may also qualify for some of the relevant tax credits, which are set out below:<ul type="disc"><li><b>Incapacitated Child Tax Credit</b> - can be claimed by a parent in respect of a child who is permanently incapacitated either physically or mentally from maintaining himself or herself and had become so before reaching 21 years of age or finishing full-time education or full-time training for a trade or profession. <u><font color="#0000FF">(Leaflet No. IT18 - Incapacitated Child Tax Credit</font></u>  )<li><b>Note:</b> One Parent Family Tax Credit may also be claimed by a single parent (whether widowed, separated, deserted, single or divorced) with an incapacitated child.

This increase is an international phenomenon. Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions.    The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase. On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  However, in this regard it should be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is re-allocated to petrol and other oil products, and away from other VAT liable spending, and to the extent that the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.</p><p><a name='N4'>  It should also be noted that businesses are of course entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel. For example, VAT incurred on auto-diesel and marked gas oil (MGO or green diesel) used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system. VAT on petrol can not be deducted/reclaimed. </p><p><a name='N5'>  There are no plans for temporary taxation adjustments, as to do so, could lead to significant costs to the Exchequer. 	</p>

Information regarding employment vacancies can also be accessed by telephoning Jobs Ireland at Freephone 1 800 611 116.  Keep FÁS Services to Business informed of all details relating to his/her apprenticeship employment with a FÁS approved employer so that this time may be credited in calculating the finish date of his/her apprenticeship..In addition, in order to assist redundant apprentices to complete their apprenticeships, FÁS has put the following interim measures in place:-1. Apprentices who are made redundant may progress to the next off-the-job training phase of their apprenticeship, in line with current scheduling criteria. 2. FÁS is providing a temporary Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme, whereby FÁS approved employers in the public and private sectors will provide redundant apprentices with training and assessment on-the-job at Phase 3, Phase 5 and Phase 7 of their apprenticeships.  3. FÁS has introduced a Competency Determination Mechanism (CDM).  This mechanism will provide redundant apprentices who have a time deficit in their apprenticeship with the opportunity to demonstrate their skills and knowledge against the occupational standard for the specified trade over a number of days in a FÁS Training Centre.</p>

My Department has sought the assistance of, and is working closely with, the relevant Local Authority in relation to identifying and acquiring a suitable site for the school to which the Deputy has referred. Due to commercial sensitivities attaching to site acquisitions generally, it is not possible to comment further on the site acquisition aspect of the project at this time. Once a site has been procured, the project will proceed to architectural planning and the appointment of a design team.  A building project for an 8 classroom school would be generally expected to take between 30 and 36 months from the time of appointment of a design team to the completion of construction. However, the exact timeframe will be dependent on a number of factors including the granting of planning permission for the proposed building.  In the meantime, the school in question will continue to be located in temporary accommodation pending the provision of a new school building.</p>

The purpose of the report, which I requested, was to identify new possible structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland so that it is comparable with the best in the world. The international panel of education experts who prepared the report recommended that teacher education be provided in six "centres for teacher education".  The new collaborations recommended will mean that a smaller number of publicly funded centres for ITE exist, but that they offer education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education. These centres will also possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity which is not always possible in smaller institutions.</p><p><a name='N33'>  Only publicly funded HEIs are included in the proposed new collaborations. Private providers of ITE exist outside this framework but are subject to the same accreditation requirements by the Teaching Council. There are no immediate impacts for students presently pursuing or intent on pursuing courses with private teacher training colleges. However, the report also makes various comments and recommendations on matters such as overall teacher supply and I intend to explore these further with the HEA, the Teaching Council, and the initial teacher education providers, as appropriate.</p>

School building projects, including the project referred to by the Deputy, which have not been included in the five year construction programme will continue to be progressed to final planning stages in anticipation of the possibility of further funds being available to the Department in future years.</p>

<!-- Snippet ref: WRJ00300 type: 7 --> <a name='WRJ00300'></a> <p><span class="speaker">Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Brian Hayes):</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=&HouseNum=&MemberID=493"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Brian Hayes"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=493&pid=BrianHayes&year=2012&month=09&day=25"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Brian Hayes"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N3'>An open competition was held in July 2011 to establish a Framework for the provision of Managed Print Services (MPS) to the public sector.  The Request for Tender for MPS was advertised, in accordance with the EC Procurement Directives, on e-Tenders and in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU).  15 tender responses were received, of which seven tenderers were selected to be Framework Members.  The Framework Agreement for MPS was established on 8 February 2012.  The Framework Agreement will be in place for two years, with an option to extend for a further two years. <br><br>  Four of the successful tenderers are indigenous small and medium enterprises (SMEs) (MJ Flood, Bryan S Ryan, Hibernian Business Equipment and Ergo). The Framework Members have also indicated in their tender submissions that they will use a further 11 indigenous SMEs in the delivery of MPS. <br><br>  MPS is a unique office print solution, where a supplier provides an all inclusive service based on an on-going per click charge, that includes the provision of print/imaging devices at no capital cost to the public sector body.  The supplier, in effect, provides the full infrastructure required for all day-to-day office printing.  Research carried out by the National Procurement Service (NPS) has indicated that such an approach gives best value to the Irish public sector. Some of the smaller suppliers do not have the resources to provide such infrastructure themselves, but they can have roles within the supply networks of the seven Framework Members.  <br><br>  The majority of public sector bodies currently have <i>ad-hoc</i> print arrangements in place.  A typical Government office has multiple print and imaging devices such as photocopiers, scanners and faxes.  These devices can potentially come from a wide range of different suppliers with separate supply and servicing arrangements.  The ratio of print devices to staff is often in the region of 1:2 and in some cases as low as 1:1 where a large number of staff have their own desktop printer.  <br><br>  Circular 6/12 specifies that the MPS Framework is mandatory from 1 September 2012.  However, it is important to note that this Framework is only mandatory where a public sector body opts for an MPS solution. If a public sector body simply wishes to purchase a printer or a photocopier they do not have to use the MPS Framework.  It is a matter for each public sector body to determine which route offers the best value for their organisation.</p>

The relevant provisions of the Employment Permits Acts of 2003 and 2006 hold that where an employee, who was required to hold an Employment Permit, has failed to do so then he or she is guilty of an offence.  Furthermore, while an employer may also be guilty of an offence in this matter, Justice Hogan points out that the legislation provides for a defence with regard to an employer but fails to do so with regard to an employee.</p><p><a name='N12'>  As I understand it, this lack of defence affects the courts’ scope to interpret the statutory provisions and compels the court to hold that the legislation has created an absolute offence so far as an employee is concerned.  Importantly, Justice Hogan found that it must therefore be taken that the Oireachtas intended that such a non-national employee automatically commits an offence if he or she does not have a work permit irrespective of the reasons for that failure and that this has implications so far as the civil law is concerned in that such a contract of employment must also be taken to be void.</p><p><a name='N13'>  The question that arises for policy makers is to what extent such non-nationals should be dissuaded from working illegally in Ireland by virtue of there being a statutory offence to do so versus to what extent should certain employment rights protect vulnerable migrants who find themselves unwittingly in such employment positions. </p><p><a name='N14'>  The Deputy will recognise that this question requires careful consideration as the applicability of rights in one context can have far reaching consequences beyond that originally intended.</p><p><a name='N15'>  I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department is treating the matter with the utmost importance and that I would expect proposals on the matter within the coming months.</p>

Business growth and job creation are inherent considerations in the activities of the CEBs.<br><br>  The CEBs deliver a series of Programmes to underpin this role and can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.  The forms of financial assistance that are available, subject to certain eligibility criteria, include Priming Grants, Expansion/Development Grants and Feasibility/Innovation Study Grants.  The provision of non-financial assistance can take the form of a wide range of business advice such as Programmes covering Start Your Own Business, Business Management and Mentoring.  Due to the Boards unique relationship with their clients and the local business community they can specifically tailor their programmes to meet the evolving needs and requirements of these small enterprises going forward.<br><br>  The promoter may therefore wish to contact the Chief Executive Officer of Dublin City Enterprise Board, Mr. Greg Swift, to discuss what options may be available to them and their proposed business venture.

The new jobs are being supported by IDA Ireland.  The jobs announced will come on stream within a 3 to 5 year period, in line with the company’s business plan, and will be filled by the appropriately qualified personnel.  Building on the foundation of its existing facility, EA will now provide multilingual international customer support and services for its major game titles.   EA has stated that the European Customer Experience Centre is a key element of its strategy to serve gamers on a global basis. The company wishes to engage with its worldwide customer base on a 24/7 basis, across all of EA’s games and services and in multiple languages in today’s fast-moving digital environment.   I am delighted that this is another vote of confidence by a major player in the Games Sector in the attractiveness and competitiveness of Ireland as an investment location and in Galway as a location of choice. </p>

The LRC does not have any jurisdiction to adjudicate on disputes in relation to redundancy payments. </p><p><a name='N13'>  The EAT is an independent body bound to act judicially and was set up to provide a speedy, fair, inexpensive and informal means for individuals to seek remedies for alleged infringement of their statutory rights.  The EAT has jurisdiction to deal with and adjudicate on disputes under a number of pieces of legislation including the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 1997 and the Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Acts 1984 to 1994.   The Redundancy Acts provide that all eligible employees are entitled to a statutory redundancy lump sum upon being made redundant.  The latter Act provides for the protection of employees’ entitlements in regard to matters relating to pay (e.g. arrears of wages, holiday pay etc.) in the event of the insolvency of their employer.  The Act also provides that disputes concerning some of these entitlements may be referred to the EAT.  </p><p><a name='N14'>  The EAT currently has the power to compel any person (including the director(s) of  a company) to attend a hearing to give evidence and to produce any documents in his/her possession, custody or control, relating to any matter referred to the Tribunal, including complaints referred under the aforementioned legislation. A person who fails to attend a hearing in response to such a notice from the EAT or who refuses to give evidence or to produce any required documents will be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine.  The EAT also has the power to take evidence on oath and may administer oaths to persons attending as witnesses.  Penalties are prescribed by law for wilful and corrupt perjury by any person convicted in a Court of Law giving false evidence or wilfully or corruptly swearing anything, which is false as a hearing of the EAT.  </p><p><a name='N15'>  It is entirely a matter for the Tribunal, having regard to the circumstances of any particular case, to determine whether or not to invoke its powers to compel a witness to attend a hearing in order to give evidence. </p><p><a name='N16'>  I have no plans to introduce legislation amending the existing rules concerning the compellability of witnesses to either the EAT or LRC.  However, as you may be aware, I am currently undertaking a root and branch reform of the existing Workplace Relations Bodies. The Reform Programme I have commenced will deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the LRC, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the EAT and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.

Management confirmed that the plant will close by the end of 2012 with the loss of 30 jobs if a sale is not successfully concluded by then.

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice. The first two involve the enhancement of the website <a href="http://www.keepingyourhome.ie"><u><font color="#0000FF">www.keepingyourhome.ie</font></u></a>   and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears. <br><br>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders. This advice will be provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.<br><br>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower&#8217;s choosing for the provision of this advice.<br><br>  An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main recognised accountancy bodies and the lenders. The general scope of the advice will be limited to the borrower&#8217;s principal private residence. <br><br>  The advisory framework has commenced with practicing accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.  <br><br>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as requested by borrowers.  It is intended to review the operation of the advisory framework in June 2013 at which point other interested parties who meet the criteria in terms of qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc., may be considered for inclusion.   <br><br>The accountancy bodies have already notified their members about the new service with a view to having the panel in place before the end of September. The panel will be available on a county by county basis and the details will be available on the website <a href="http://www.keepingyourhome.ie"><u><font color="#0000FF">www.keepingyourhome.ie</font></u></a><u><font color="#0000FF">.</font></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Internship opportunities can vary significantly spanning many occupations/disciplines from high skill specialist placements to lower skilled general placements.  The principal aim of internships advertised is to provide interns with an opportunity to keep close to the labour market while gaining valuable experience in a working environment and thus enabling them to increase the knowledge and skills required to explore a new career path or enhance their career prospects and build their confidence through work experience.  </p><p><a name='N47'>  The scheme has made significant progress to-date.  Our records indicate that a significant proportion of individuals have progressed into employment across various occupations/ disciplines on completion of their internship placements.  To ensure that both the host organisation and intern are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme, the JobBridge team are involved in the continuous monitoring of internships.  This involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and the conducting of random monitoring site visits to facilitate discussions with both parties to the Internship.</p><p><a name='N48'>  All internships advertised on the JobBridge website clearly state “This is an internship.  An allowance of €50 per week will be paid in addition to your current social welfare payment.  See eligibility criteria above.” </p>

The service provided in relation to processing mortgage interest and rent supplement applications is also subject to ongoing review.</p><p><a name='N24'>  The timescale for determining applications for rent and mortgage interest supplements is dependent, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant's income, bank statements etc. In addition, some aspects of the application are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where investigations such as home visits or third party evidence are required. Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.</p><p><a name='N25'>  Statistics are not available on the length of time taken to assess rent and mortgage interest supplement applications or the number of applications awaiting a decision. The provision of a prompt service is a major objective for the Department’s staff dealing with rent and mortgage interest supplement applications. This is tempered by the necessity to ensure that every case is fully investigated and that all cases are dealt with in a consistent and fair manner.</p><p><a name='N26'>  I am satisfied that the Department’s staff dealing with these applications make every effort to ensure rent and mortgage interest supplement claims are processed in an efficient manner.</p>

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 90,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement, for which the Government has provided €436m in 2012.</p><p><a name='N16'>  Standards for rented houses are set in regulations by the Minister of the Environment, Community and Local Government. Responsibility for enforcing these standards rests with the relevant housing authority.  In consultation with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, S.I. No. 572 of 2006 and Section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 introduced the condition that allows the Department’s officers to decide that a rent supplement may not be payable where it has been notified by a housing authority of the non-compliance with standards.  Where such a notification is received from a housing authority in respect of an existing tenant, it is recommended that the officer would discuss the situation with the tenant and take whatever action they decide is necessary in the best interests of the tenant. Department officers dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met.  This approach supports the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in their aim to promote further improvement in private rented accommodation standards.</p>

The person concerned can only be entitled to a rent supplement in respect of this accommodation when his portion of the rent is reduced to the appropriate limit.</p>

The &#8364;100 rate does not apply to certain categories of claimant including:<ul style="margin-left:20px">·  claimants with a qualified child;<br><br>·  those transferring to Jobseeker's Allowance immediately after exhausting their entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit;<br><br>·  those making a claim for Jobseeker's Allowance where that claim is linked to a Jobseeker's Allowance claim made within the previous 12 months to which the maximum personal rate applied;<br><br>·  those transferring directly to Jobseeker's Allowance from Disability Allowance and<br><br>·  certain people who were in the care of the HSE during the period of 12 months before s/he reached the age of 18.</ul>  A rate of &#8364;144 applies to claimants aged 22-24.  The adoption of these measures reflected the need to encourage more young jobseekers to improve their skills by either pursuing further study or accessing a labour market programme.<br><br>  Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseeker&#8217;s payment without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training can lead to welfare dependency.  While many young people with low levels of education and training were able to get work in construction and other areas when the economy was doing well, they are likely to find it much harder to find employment over the course of the next few years.  The measures encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis.<br><br>  Where a person is in receipt of a rate of Jobseeker's Allowance described above and s/he participates in a course of education, training, community employment, rural social scheme or Tús, the full normal rate of payment applicable to that course or scheme applies without any reduction for persons aged under 25.<br><br>  I understand that a number of Deputies have been contacted with regard to these measures following a campaign by Focus Ireland.  My officials have engaged in constructive dialogue with Focus Ireland with regard to their concerns.  As part of this work, Focus Ireland has recently supplied my Department with details from their network organisations of relevant individual cases.<br><br>  This information is currently being examined and my Department will engage in further discussions with Focus Ireland.  These discussions will seek to achieve a satisfactory resolution of any issues arising in respect of these persons, while also preserving the integrity of the social welfare system and avoiding any potential drift towards welfare dependency.</p>

The national social target for poverty reduction provides a key reference point for government policies and offers a tangible benchmark against which to measure social and economic progress.<br><br>  Given the challenging economic and fiscal context, the Government initiated a comprehensive review of the national poverty target, first set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion<i>&nbsp;</i>in 2007, in order to ensure that it remained appropriate and achievable.  I will shortly be publishing the result of the outcome of the review and following that will make arrangements for appropriate consultation with stakeholders to discuss how best to implement its recommendations.<br><br>  Notwithstanding this, I should point out that in advance of the publication of the review, the revised targets were set out in a document submitted to the European Commission in April 2012 entitled the &quot;National Reform Programme for Ireland 2012 Update under the Europe 2020 Strategy&quot; and are available on the website of the Department of An Taoiseach.  In that update, the Government indicated that it had decided to revise and enhance its national poverty target to meet Ireland&#8217;s contribution to Europe 2020 and commitments in the Programme for Government.  The revised target is to reduce consistent poverty to 4 per cent by 2016 (interim target) and to 2 per cent or less by 2020, from the 2010 baseline rate of 6.2 per cent.  Ireland&#8217;s revised contribution to the overall EU poverty target is to lift a minimum of 200,000 people out of the risk of poverty or exclusion between 2012 and 2020.  I want to stress that the revised targets still mean that the Government has retained the ambition of the original target, despite the difficult economic conditions.  The target will now be achieved over an extended timeframe of 2020, in line with the EU timescale.  In addition, the Government has agreed a number of other changes which will have a positive impact for poverty reduction, notably the adoption of sub-targets for children and jobless/low-work intensity households and new supporting indicators.<br><br>  The Government and I, as Minister for Social Protection, are determined to ensure that the least well off in society are protected from the economic crisis and are enabled to benefit from economic recovery and new employment opportunities.  I look forward to working with all stakeholders to implement the revised and enhanced national social target for poverty reduction.</p>

The introduction of such a scheme would also bring Ireland into line with practice in other countries in this area.  However, there is a range of complex issues that needs to be addressed before any decision is taken by government on the possible introduction of such a scheme – including the extent of coverage; the rate of payment; possible compensation mechanisms for employers where appropriate, and how the scheme would be enforced and policed - and these will be discussed as part of the preparatory work for Budget 2013.</p><p><a name='N42'>  I should point out that while I am acutely conscious of the pressures facing employers in the current economic climate, and the concerns expressed by small and medium sized enterprises in particular regarding the introduction of a scheme of statutory sick pay, a regulatory impact analysis is not undertaken on the package of measures announced in the annual Budget Day statement.</p>

I am advised by IFI that any extension to the recreational angling season would need to be based on scientific analysis of available surplus, catch returns, counter information, run timing, exploitation rates etc.  With the majority of these parameters the time series of available data is considered by IFI to be too short to draw any meaningful scientific conclusions and therefore, in line with the conservation Imperative based on the precautionary principle, no recommendation can be made for an extension to the salmon angling season at this time.  </p><p><a name='N20'>  The independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) for salmon provide advice on the criteria that should be evaluated when considering a proposal for an extension to the angling season in any salmon catchment.  These criteria include the advice that, where an extension is being considered, there should be a reasonably sized quota and a reasonable proportion of the surplus remaining after the original season has ended to ensure essential recruitment and to avoid over fishing.  A further criterion is that an angling season in a river should only be extended if the salmon stock in that river has been meeting the Conservation Limit (CL) and is likely to continue to meet the CL if an extension is given i.e. provided no more than the harvestable surplus is taken.  2012 is only the third year where a full assessment of the salmon run on the river Maine is available.  A higher salmon surplus and a longer time period of fish counter data would be required before the SSC criteria can be adequately assessed.   </p>

The rate of obligation will increase over time and by 2020 it will require suppliers of road transport fuels to make certain that even higher volumes sold are biofuel.

Some initiatives that SEAI has undertaken to support micro-generation include:<ul style="margin-left:20px">  Formation of a standards development group to develop FETAC standards for accredited microgeneration installer training awards<br><br>  Development of micro-generation product quality assessment criteria and the extension of the SEAI Triple E register to include micro-generators<br><br>  Publication of information and guides on the implementation of micro-generation projects. </ul>  The SEAI microgeneration pilot programme, launched in 2009, was designed to assess the potential market for small- and micro-scale renewable energy generation; to identify barriers to meeting the potential; and to determine the performance of the technologies in the field.  The pilot encompassed a range of renewable technologies including wind, solar PV and hydro up to a nominal capacity of 50kw.  <br><br>  Ongoing monitored pilot field trials were a significant part of the programme and provide robust data on the performance of installations.  The installations have been subject to an 18 month monitoring period since January 2011.  SEAI have provided an interim report on the monitoring to my Department and a final report on the trials will be presented before end 2012.  I will discuss with SEAI the options for publication of this report, when finalised.<br><br>  The Department has asked SEAI to update some initial information on feed-in-tariff costs, given how significantly solar PV costs have fallen globally in the last 2 years.  While the Programme for Government proposes a microgeneration feed in tariff not significantly above the single energy market price for electricity, indications from the combined ESB Networks/Electric Ireland microgeneration programme that ran 2009-2011 were that there was only a modest take up of microgeneration in the domestic sector, although the feed in tariff offered in total was almost three times the current single electricity market price.  Should a scheme be introduced, if this to be funded from the PSO levy, increased electricity costs would have to be borne by all customers to fund it.  <br><br>My Department and SEAI are continuing to finalise analysis on the cost effective options which could be considered for supporting the micro-generation sector, having regard to the costs and benefits for all energy consumers.    </p>

Secondly, the spectrum auction will release valuable new spectrum into the Irish market and is therefore, a vital step allowing telecommunications operators to provide advanced 4G wireless broadband services and finally, the decision by ComReg on the regulation of next generation broadband access.  The confluence of these three key policy, operational and regulatory reforms will define the delivery and availability of high speed broadband to all areas of Ireland as envisaged in the Programme for Government.</p>

They have chosen to do this in two ways &#8211; using both a digital terrestrial network and also using satellite.  Their satellite service, Freesat, is intended to provide for reception to the UK only but also covers Ireland through overspill.<br><br>  In order to overcome copyright issues which are associated with broadcasting, the UK channels must purchase the rights to show their acquired content in Ireland as well as the UK.  The copyright costs are proportional to TV viewer numbers so the additional cost for acquiring the rights to broadcast in Ireland is small.  As an alternative approach, the UK could choose to encrypt the satellite service so that it could not be received in Ireland or elsewhere.<br><br>  For the Irish channels to be freely available on the same satellite as the UK channels, the issue of copyright also arises.  Irish stations would need to acquire copyright throughout the footprint area of the satellite, in the UK as well as Ireland, or to provide an encrypted service.  RTÉ has informed us that both options are prohibitively expensive and that they have no plans to seek to place Saorview channels on Freesat.<br><br>In Ireland RTÉ has chosen to build its free to air digital network over two platforms - over a digital terrestrial network (SAORVIEW) and over satellite (SAORSAT).  SAORVIEW is available to 98% of the population whilst SAORSAT has 100% coverage, covering only Ireland.<br><br>  RTÉ has informed us that with SAORSAT it is possible to pick up the UK Freesat TV channels as well as the Irish TV channels by using a second  Low Noise Block Down converter Feedhorn (LNBF) which is correctly aligned.  SAORSAT therefore provides a mechanism whereby both Saorview and Freesat TV channels can be received.<br><br>  Further information on SAORSAT is available at: <a href="http://www.rtenl.ie/broadcast/saorsat-digital-television.html"><u><font color="#0000FF">www.rtenl.ie/broadcast/saorsat-digital-television.html</font></u></a>.</p>

Under the legislation, it is a function of a local authority to collect the household charges and associated late payment penalties due to it and all such charges and late payment penalties imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.  In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Section 7 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act 1983 provides that where a sum is due to a local authority in respect of a charge under any enactment and at the same time, another sum is due by the local authority to the same person, the local authority may set-off the money owing to it against the money it pays out. Local authorities are thus legally empowered to withhold money due to an individual if that person owes unpaid charges to the local authority . However, this does not apply to higher education grants, which are administered by local authorities on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  The Student Support Act 2011 does not provide for withholding the payment of a student grant on foot of non-payment of the household charge.  </p><p><a name='N13'>I am aware that Clare County Council recently issued letters in relation to the disbursal of higher education grants and asked in the letter for applicants to indicate if the household charge had been paid in respect of the relevant household.  I understand that the question was added in order to facilitate the local authority’s information gathering in respect of collection of the household charge and was not linked to the assessment of grant applications, which will be processed in the normal way.  No moneys have been withheld by any local authority in respect of higher education grants.</p>

The decisions on whether or not to disregard either a proportion of income or particular sources of income for the purposes of calculating rents are matters for each individual housing authority to consider in accordance with their own rent scheme.</p>

Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:<br><br>&#8226; Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist; <br><br>&#8226; Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;<br><br> &#8226; Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and <br><br>&#8226; Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.  <br><br>Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorisation process include, <i>inter alia</i>:&#8226; the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting facilities, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development;&#8226; the extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission;&#8226; the extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007;&#8226; the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act;&#8226; the extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned and,&#8226; where there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with. <br><br>  This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge.  Only households in developments in categories three and four, as identified in October 2011, are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge.  The list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012.  It is a matter for the relevant local authority to interpret and apply the relevant provisions. <br><br>  A revised list of estates will be prescribed for 2013 after which time the waiver for unfinished housing developments will end.  Throughout this period it is anticipated that the numbers of categories 3 and 4 developments will decrease significantly as my Department continues to work with local authorities and other stakeholders to resolve outstanding issues, including through the Public Safety Initiative.<br><br>  Under the legislation, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.</p>

It takes no account, for example, of the fact that while rent levels can be adjusted to reflect changing household income, mortgage repayments cannot.  Nor does it take account of the additional costs taken on when a household becomes a homeowner thereby assuming responsibility for the on-going maintenance of their home. </p><p><a name='N44'>  Provisions governing mortgage lending by local authorities are set out under the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012 and associated credit policy.  Persons in receipt of social welfare payments are not specifically precluded from purchasing their home under any tenant purchase scheme.  However, if the applicants are applying to fund the purchase through loan finance from the local authority they must meet the criteria which apply to such loans. </p><p><a name='N45'>  While, as a general rule, the credit policy provides that loans are not available to those in receipt of unemployment/social welfare benefits, an exception may be made where there is a primary income of a permanent waged/salaried nature and where the secondary income is from the Department of Social Protection. </p><p><a name='N46'>  In such cases long term social welfare payments can be considered, provided the long term nature of the payment is confirmed.  The final decision on whether to grant/refuse an applicant lies solely with the relevant local authority.  All local authorities must satisfy themselves on the financial risk they are undertaking.</p>

As a result, over 30 searches were conducted of various locations in Dublin and surrounding counties and a substantial number of arrests were also made.  Three people have been charged with membership of an unlawful organisation under the Offences Against the State Act and Garda inquiries into the matter are ongoing.</p><p><a name='N40'>  I am strongly committed to ensure that the Gardaí have the necessary resources they need, not just in terms of manpower and equipment, but also in terms of legislative provisions, to bear down on these paramilitary groups.  I am also committed to making sure that there is seamless cooperation between the security services North and South in dealing with the threat.  That is exactly what is happening.</p>

It is anticipated that such a visa will prove an attractive option for tourists and business visitors and a trial period will be used to gauge likely demand. Such a visa will supersede the Visa Waiver Programme.</p>

This means, among other things, reducing expenditure on public service pay, whether by reducing headcount or otherwise.  This is particularly so in those public service bodies where pay forms an especially large part of overall expenditure, such as the Garda Síochána where 90% of expenditure is on pay and pensions. </p><p><a name='N22'>  The current and projected Garda budgets will necessitate a significant reduction in Garda expenditure. This will undoubtedly require further reductions in Garda numbers. This has been well known for some time, dating right back to when the last Government was in office and the question of exact level of the reductions required will depend on the potential for alternative savings which could mitigate the scale of the reduction in head count required. In this context, the Department of Justice and Equality is engaging in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this matter and it would not be appropriate to comment further on this at this point in time.</p>

My Department consulted on the matter with the Law Reform Commission, which had been involved in drafting the 2009 Act, and it took the view that unreasonable interference caused by high trees or hedges was a matter in any particular case for tort law or more generally for planning or environmental law.  In England and Wales, complaints about high hedges are dealt with under Part 8 of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003.  This Act makes provision for local authorities to determine complaints by the owners or occupiers of domestic property who are adversely affected by evergreen hedges over 2 metres high.  Broadly similar legislation, i.e. the High Hedges Act (Northern Ireland) 2011, came into operation in Northern Ireland on 31 March 2012.  Helpful information notes for hedge owners, complainants and local authorities have been published on the web site of Northern Ireland's Department of the Environment.</p><p><a name='N8'>  The manner in which problems associated with high hedges and trees are resolved in England, Wales and Northern Ireland demonstrates a clear preference for the resolution of such disputes at local level, preferably by mediation, with recourse to the courts as a last resort.  This is designed to reduce the risk of prolonged and costly litigation and the risk that court proceedings would leave a legacy of bitterness between neighbours and ill-feeling in the local community.  The introduction of such legislation in this jurisdiction would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and his Department.  Under our existing law, a person may be in a position to seek damages or an injunction requiring the cutting of boundary hedges or trees under the tort of nuisance.  In order for the nuisance to be actionable, the person would have to show that an easement existed - an easement of light or otherwise - and that there had been a substantial interference with that right.  It is my intention to bring forward a Mediation Bill later this year to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings, thereby reducing legal costs and speeding up the resolution of disputes.  The legislation, which is currently being drafted, will introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person wishing to commence court proceedings to consider mediation as a means of resolving a dispute before embarking on such proceedings.  It will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of proceedings, on its own initiative invite parties to consider mediation and suspend the proceedings to facilitate the mediation process.</p>

Short of removal from office following such an impeachment process, which has never been used to date, there are currently no provisions which permit a member of the judiciary to be &quot;disciplined&quot; as envisaged in the Deputy's question.  The Deputy will be aware that the Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to legislate to establish a Judicial Council to provide an effective mechanism for dealing with complaints against judges.  This commitment is being given expression in the form of the proposed Judicial Council Bill.  As well as providing for the establishment of a Judicial Council and Board that will promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges, the proposed Bill aims to provide a means of investigating allegations of judicial misconduct supported by the establishment of a Judicial Conduct Committee which will have lay representation.  In November 2011, the Chief Justice announced that the Judiciary had agreed to establish an Interim Judicial Council pending the publication and enactment of the proposed Judicial Council Bill.  A sub-committee of the Board of the Interim Judicial Council was subsequently established to consider the General Scheme for a Judicial Council Bill, a version of which had been published by the previous Government in August 2010.  This sub-committee has provided observations which are the subject of ongoing consideration and consultation, taking account of intervening developments and current Government policy.  This continuing work will inform the framing and drafting of the new Bill, in conjunction with the Offices of Parliamentary Counsel and of the Attorney General.  I intend to publish the Bill in the course of 2013.</p>

To avail of this facility, a person must apply to the court and the court must be satisfied that requiring the person to pay the fine in full by the due date would impose undue hardship.  It is not an automatic facility open to all persons on whom fines are imposed.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce attachment of earnings to collect unpaid fines.  It is my view, having reviewed how the fine payment and recovery system will work after the introduction of attachment of earnings, that the system set out in the Fines Act needs considerable amendment on a number of fronts.  To that end, I am finalising proposals for the approval of Government, which are aimed, on the one hand, at making it easier for people to pay fines and on the other, at making the recovery of fines more efficient and effective.  I hope to be in a position to publish these proposals in the coming weeks with a view to having them enacted and operational by the middle of 2013.</p>

Publication of the discussion document follows the Minister&#8217;s announcement that he would be arranging a public consultation process as part of the current review of prostitution legislation. Announcing publication of the discussion document, Minister Shatter said:<br><br><br><br>&quot;The criminal law in this area is being reviewed primarily because of the changed nature of prostitution in Ireland. Prostitution was once mainly a street-based phenomenon. That is no longer the case. The organisation of prostitution is now much more sophisticated, highly mobile and is easily facilitated by the use of mobile phones and the internet.<br><br><br><br>There is, of course, already a clear consensus on the great evils of child prostitution and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. However, I am aware that there are differing and genuinely held views on the approach the criminal law should take to other aspects of prostitution. While there is a significant amount of criminal legislation in this area already, there is always scope for change and improvement. It is important to review the law periodically to ensure it is up to date and comprehensively responds to altered circumstances.&quot; <br><br><br><br>The Minister added that: &quot;Prostitution is an issue which affects individuals, communities and society as a whole. It is important that I facilitate the expression of all views on this subject and that those views are examined in due course. Public debate should therefore, be open to the widest possible audience and I want to ensure that everyone who wishes to make a contribution to this important debate is given the opportunity to do so. It is for that reason I have decided on a consultation process before charting the way forward.<br><br><br><br>My Department will hold a conference in the autumn to discuss the document. The widest possible participation will be encouraged in order that we have an open and transparent discussion on all aspects of this very important issue. <br><br><br><br>This discussion document will now be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. Interested groups and members of the public, I expect, will be invited to make submissions to the Committee which will hold such hearings as it deems appropriate. I am asking Mr. David Stanton T.D., Chairman of the Joint Committee, that it publish its report and recommendations by the 30th November 2012 and that the report be furnished to me together with any submissions received. I expect it is likely that the Committee&#8217;s report will also be lodged in the Oireachtas Library and that a debate on it will subsequently take place in both the Dáil and the Seanad. The report received by me from the Joint Oireachtas Committee will be fully considered in the framing of any necessary new legislative proposals to be submitted to Government in due course. <br><br><br><br>I look forward to the results of the consultation process.&quot; <br><br><br><br>The discussion document is attached below and will be made available on the Department&#8217;s website, <a href="http://www.justice.ie/">www.justice.ie</a> <br><br>This discussion document does not favour any particular approach but simply tries to assist reflection. The arguments contained in the document are not exhaustive and the questions posed are not intended to limit in any way the range of questions readers might want to consider.<br><br>22 June, 2012</ul></ul></ul></ul></td></tr></table></div></p>

It is the responsibility of all non-EEA nationals who are resident in Ireland to ensure that they have an appropriate permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Individuals who do not have a permission to be in the State are liable to be subject to the deportation process as provided for in Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999.  </p><p><a name='N7'>  I am of course aware that there have been proposals of this nature from sources outside of Government.  However, great caution should be exercised before embarking on such a project.  A proposal of this nature could give rise to very large, unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.  Any possible implication for the operation of the Common Travel Area would also have to be very carefully considered.</p><p><a name='N8'>  At EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments &quot;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&quot;.  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.</p><p><a name='N9'>  The circumstances of individual cases can vary considerably and it is logical that the outcomes will not always be the same.  At one end of the spectrum are those whose illegal status is genuinely through no fault of their own while at the other can be found a flagrant disregard of the laws of the Irish State and an unwillingness to accept that those laws, under which tens of thousands of lawful migrants have made Ireland their home, must also apply to them.  It is open to persons in an undocumented situation to present their case on its merits and to have it considered.    </p>

Arising from the consultation process, Minister McCausland has recently announced that while he proposes to proceed with the prohibition on fixed price promotions in premises with on licences, he has decided not to proceed with restrictions on bulk purchases from off licences following concerns raised by the Northern Ireland Assembly's Social Development Committee.</p><p><a name='N13'>  In light of the approach being adopted in Northern Ireland, I am now considering how best to proceed with regulations under section 16 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.

However, at this strength ceiling, the organisational structures that had been in place for a strength ceiling of 11,500 personnel were no longer viable. Accordingly, I initiated a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces.  In July of this year, I accepted the proposals submitted jointly by the Secretary General of the Department of Defence and the Chief of Staff which recommended a re-organisation of Defence Forces units based on a two Brigade structure.  The implementation of the re-organisation has commenced and all personnel in the Permanent Defence Force have now been briefed on the re-organisation proposals.</p><p><a name='N25'>  The new structure will continue to support the inter-operability of the Defence Forces with other military forces on peace support operations. I am committed to maintaining the capacity of the Permanent Defence Force in order to ensure that the organisation can continue to fulfil all roles assigned both at home and overseas. The current re-organisation is part of that process.</p>

This management regime has been very successful in reducing lice infestation levels nationally.  Treatment triggers during the spring period are set close to zero in the range of from 0.3 to 0.5 egg bearing females per fish and are also informed by the numbers of mobile lice on the fish.  Where numbers of mobile lice are high, treatments are required even in the absence of egg bearing females.  The mechanism for requiring treatments is to issue a notice to treat where appropriate.</p><p><a name='N4'>In the case referred to by the Deputy, the lice levels on the 11th of April were 0.47 ovigerous females and a total mobile count of 2.25 lice per fish.  This is within the range where a notice to treat can be issued.  A treatment regime was in place and no notice to treat was required.  At the subsequent inspection on the 30th   of April lice levels had reduced to 0.27 ovigerous females and a total mobile count of 1.16 respectively.  These are well below any treatment trigger levels and reflect the efficacy of the treatment undertaken by the company.</p><p><a name='N5'>  As a general point, the sea lice controls operated by the Marine Institute, on behalf of the State are more advanced than those operating in other jurisdictions and are regarded by the E.U.

<!-- Snippet ref: WRV00500 type: 7 --> <a name='WRV00500'></a> <p><span class="speaker">Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney):</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=&HouseNum=&MemberID=250"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Simon Coveney"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=250&pid=SimonCoveney&year=2012&month=09&day=25"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Simon Coveney"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N7'>Research carried out in Ireland indicates that, up to 2008, using a detailed post mortem and histological examination, 35-50% of badgers in high cattle TB prevalence areas were infected with TB compared with an infection rate of 14.9% in areas of low cattle TB prevalence areas thereby substantiating the link between the presence of TB in cattle and in badgers. However, more recent research has shown that the percentage of badgers now infected with TB in previously high cattle prevalence areas has halved since then. The reduction in the incidence of TB in badgers is welcome and indicates an improvement in the health of the badger population. It is to be hoped this will also have knock on benefits for any future badger vaccination programme.<br><br>With regard to the impact of TB in badgers for TB in cattle, a research paper published in 2010 summarises the evidence on the role of badgers in the spread of TB in cattle both in Ireland and the UK and concludes that &#8220;badgers are directly implicated in the transmission of infection to cattle&#8221; and &#8220;the ability to eradicate tuberculosis is severely constrained while infection continues to be spread from badgers&#8221; (<i>Mycobacterium bovis Infection in the Eurasian Badger (Meles Meles): the Disease, Pathogenesis, Epidemiology and Control</i> (Science Direct)  <i>). </i><br><br>  There is considerable evidence that the removal of badgers results in a reduction in the incidence of the disease in cattle.  In summary, the first major research project into the impact of badgers on TB incidence in cattle in East Offaly found that the risk of herd breakdowns was found to be 14 times higher in the control area compared with the area from which the badgers were removed.  A later study, the Four Area Project, involved the intensive and proactive removal of badgers in four &#8220;removal&#8221; areas and &#8220;reactive&#8221; culling of badgers in matched reference areas. The published results of this project also demonstrated that there was a significant reduction in TB levels in cattle following the removal of badgers. In view of this research and in order to limit the spread of TB from badgers to cattle, the Bovine TB eradication programme implemented by my Department contains a wildlife strategy involving the removal of badgers by culling when an epidemiological investigation associates a TB herd breakdown with the presence of badgers. This strategy is an important element of Ireland&#8217;s bovine TB eradication programme and has contributed to a significant reduction in the incidence of bovine tuberculosis in the cattle population in recent years.  TB reactor numbers were 18,500 in 2011, the lowest recorded number in any year since the commencement of the eradication programme in the 1950s.<br><br>  My Department is satisfied that the badger culling strategy has contributed to a reduction in the incidence of TB over the past number of years. However, it is my intention to replace badger culling with vaccination when research demonstrates that this is a practicable proposition.  There are trials ongoing at present to determine if vaccination of badgers can provide an effective alternative to badger culling in the longer-term and to develop an efficient and effective vaccine delivery methodology.</p>

The function of the Board is to provide an independent authority for the determination of appeals of decisions of the Minister on aquaculture licence applications. The management of ALAB’s functions is the responsibility of its Board and therefore the Minister does not have a role.   </p><p><a name='N22'>  The fact that the majority of locations for which aquaculture licences are sought are in areas designated as Special Areas of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive and/or Special Protection Areas under the EU Birds Directive (so-called Natura 2000 sites) has had implications for the processing of licence applications. My Department is constrained by law from issuing or renewing aquaculture licences for sites located within Natura 2000 areas until such time as an ‘appropriate assessment’ of the potential impacts of the proposed aquaculture and fishery activities on the conservation objectives for those areas has been conducted.   The rate of issuing of Aquaculture licences has been affected by this change but as licences are issued the number of appeals may increase in the future.</p><p><a name='N23'>  The Secretary General and senior officials from my Department have met with the Chairman and members of the Board to review its resourcing and operational issues.  An experienced officer from the Department has been assigned to work on administrative aspects of the ALAB operation.  The operational needs of ALAB will be continually reviewed in the light of any change in circumstances.</p>

In order to assist meeting the ambitious targets set out in Food Harvest 2020, new taxation measures were introduced in last year&#8217;s budget aimed at improving land mobility and farm consolidation, and encouraging transfers to younger, more progressive farmers. Two measures are of particular note in this regard;<ul style="margin-left:20px">  1.Reduced stamp duty rate applying to farm transfers<br><br>  2.Restructuring of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) retirement relief<br><br>1. <b>Reduced stamp duty rate applying to farm transfers</b></ul>  There was a reduction in the stamp duty rate applying to the sale on agricultural land from 6% to 2%. In addition, half the rate (1%) is now applicable on transfers to close relatives until the end of 2014. This change substantially reduced the stamp duty payable on transfers of farm land by gift or by sale. The measure promotes inter-generational transfer, as the cost of lifetime transfer to transferees who do not qualify for the young trained farmer stamp duty relief has been reduced considerably.<ul style="margin-left:20px">2. <b>Restructuring of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) retirement relief</b></ul>  Budget 2012 restructured the retirement relief available on Capital Gains Tax in order to incentivise the earlier transfer of farm assets to the next generation, and to encourage the sale of land by those farmers with no successors. As of 1st January 2014, for those farmers aged 66 and over, an upper limit of &#8364;3m will be introduced on family transfers, compared to an unlimited amount currently. On non-family transfers, the current upper limit of &#8364;750,000 will be reduced to &#8364;500,000. Applying the new limits from 1st January 2014 allows farmers already aged 66 and over to plan the orderly transfer of assets in advance of that date.<br><br>  It is important to remember that these new measures do not mean that a farmer has to cease farming altogether beyond the age of 66, but it allows them to plan for a phased gradual transfer of assets to the next generation.<br><br>  Retirement relief was restructured in order to encourage farmers around the normal retirement age, who have successors, to transfer their land and holdings to young, innovative, ambitious, prospective farmers. This measure encourages an improvement in the age profile of farmers, and should ensure that farmland is put to more productive use.  It should be noted that there has been no change to the very important 90% agricultural relief on Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT). This means that farms worth up to &#8364;2.5 million will continue to be fully exempt from CAT with regard to transfers to a child.</p>

Prices have continued to increase during 2012 and are currently at record levels, some 12.53% ahead year on year, or 18c per kilo higher. The industry faces a number of challenges in the short and medium term and my Department will continue to assist the sector to resolve these issues.</p><p><a name='N19'>  New EU Animal Welfare rules set down new standards in relation to the housing of sows and will come into force on 1 January 2013. A significant number of producers have undertaken the necessary work required in order to upgrade their facilities in order to comply with the new rules.</p><p><a name='N20'>  Notwithstanding this, my Department is aware of the scale of the challenge facing pig farmers in respect of the new requirements. To this end, the Department introduced a Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) for Sow Welfare in June 2010, with a total of €13 million being set aside under this scheme.  It follows two earlier schemes in 2005 and 2007 which made payments of €6.36 million to 64 applicants.</p><p><a name='N21'>  Following discussions with producers and the evidence of the initial stages of the scheme my Department modified and improved some elements of the scheme. Grant-aid is now available at a rate of 40% to eligible producers with a maximum investment ceiling of €500,000 for the first sow house, with further amounts of €300,000 for each of the next three houses.  Applications from 47 producers with a value in grant terms of €4 million were received prior to the enhancement of the scheme.  Since the revised scheme was launched a further 37 applications have been received with a grant value of €7.1 million. This latter number includes a small number of the initial 47 which were withdrawn and resubmitted under the more favourable terms. The penultimate tranche closed yesterday with a final closing date for applications of 31 October 2012.</p><p><a name='N22'>  I, together with officials from my Department met with the IFA during the summer to discuss a number of issues including the new animal welfare measures. My officials continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders with a view to ensuring Ireland’s compliance with the requirements by the January 2013 deadline.  My Department is in regular contact with banking representatives and has encouraged them to discuss requirements with sectoral agri-food interests. It is of course important that those seeking credit present a suitable business case with detailed cash flow projections. In this context the Department also facilitated contacts between Teagasc and the Banking sector to encourage seminars and training in relation to credit application.  Any farming enterprises that feel they have not been treated fairly in relation to access to credit can contact the Credit Review Office, who will review their case.</p><p><a name='N23'>  Improving access to credit is a priority on the business agenda and is an issue which the Government is addressing in a comprehensive and co-ordinated manner.  To address the issue the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will shortly launch both the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme and a Microenterprise Loan Fund for small business. While primary production in agriculture, horticulture and fisheries are excluded from the scope of the Credit Guarantee Scheme in the light of particular restrictions under the De Minimis State Aid rules, these enterprises may be eligible under the Microenterprise Loan Fund provisions.</p><p><a name='N24'>  I am also working to improve access for Irish pigmeat to 3rd Country markets, and indeed in 2011, exports of Irish pigmeat to international (non-EU) markets increased by 25% to 43,000 tonnes.  I can assure you that my Department and its agencies will continue to work closely with the industry to ensure that it can continue to develop and grow in accordance with the targets in the Food Harvest 2020 Report.</p>

I am aware that, like many other sectors, farmers are finding it difficult to get credit due to the strict assessments introduced as a result of the global financial crisis.  The banks do provide information online, via the Irish Banking Federation, as to the type of information that they require when making a decision on a loan request in the agriculture sector, however, farmers who are not satisfied with the service provided by their banks can ask for an internal review by the relevant bank and if they are still not satisfied can apply to the credit review office to have their case reviewed.  Despite concerns, a relatively small number of cases from the Agri-Food sector have come before the Credit Review Office.</p><p><a name='N28'>  Over the last year some of the banks have been involved in organising information sessions and conferences to explain the credit facilities available in the sector and just this month one of the pillar banks announced its intention to expand its lending activity in the agri-sector.  Nonetheless, I will continue to meet with relevant parties, including the Irish Banking Federation, on a regular basis to discuss all credit-related issues.</p>

In addition, quality has also been negatively affected.  There are significant problems with blight in this year’s crops due to high disease pressure coupled with grower’s inability to spray at the appropriate times during the severe wet weather.  In many cases harvested potatoes are also showing signs of rot and other wet weather conditions.  Increased production costs associated with the poor weather and rising input costs for growers will have to be carried by a significantly lower marketable yield.</p><p><a name='N31'>  These poor yields are being offset somewhat by higher prices. In addition, improved weather has provided good harvesting opportunities over recent days.  Unfortunately, the EU Commission does not provide funding to compensate for losses that arise due to this type of adverse weather conditions.

In developing the EU2020 strategy for recovery and growth in Europe, Heads of State and Government in the European Council recognised this contribution concluding that “a sustainable, productive and competitive agricultural sector will make an important contribution to the new strategy, considering the growth and employment potential of rural areas while ensuring fair competition”.</p><p><a name='N34'>  The three key principles underpinning the EU Commission’s proposals for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy are to preserve food production potential in the EU, to ensure sustainable management of natural resources and to maintain viable rural areas.  In those circumstances, I am satisfied that there is good support to ensure the viability and future development of the food industry throughout Europe.</p><p><a name='N35'>  My own view is that food security in the European Union is the essence of what the new Common Agricultural Policy is about. Growing populations and increasing demand for protein-based foods, which is what we predominantly produce in Ireland through the dairy and meat industries, present a significant opportunity not only to continue, as the EU has been, to promote a sustainable way of producing food from an environmental and climate point of view but also to produce greater volumes of food.  I will continue to make the case for sustainable intensification of food production, which is what agriculture should be all about.</p><p><a name='N36'>  As to the WTO Doha Development Round, talks are stalled at present and the prospects for conclusion of an agreement are uncertain at this point in time.  Nevertheless, I will continue to maintain pressure to secure an acceptable outcome from these negotiations that does not undermine the development of European and Irish agriculture.</p>

However looking specifically at the Irish situation, figures from the Bord Iascaigh Mhara Annual Report for 1971/72 gives the number of both full and part time employed on board fishing boats as being 5,801.   An employment survey from BIM gives the 2010 equivalent figure as being 5,475, a reduction of 326 over the full intervening period.</p><p><a name='N13'>  Both Food Harvest 2020 and Action Plan for Jobs 2012 recognise that most of the future growth and employment potential in the seafood sector is in the areas of processing and aquaculture.  Food Harvest 2020 aims to increase employment in the seafood sector as a whole, from 11,000 to 14,000 by 2020 and to increase revenue from €700 million to €1 billion by 2020.     In May of this year I announced €3.2 million in grants to 21 seafood processing companies to support investments worth €15.5 million in 2012.  These investments are projected to generate over 142 additional jobs and increased sales of value added seafood products of nearly €44 million by 2015.  These plans add to investment worth €7 million by 21 companies in 2011 and further investment worth €2.7 by 8 companies in 2010.  Together these forward looking developments are setting a clear path to achievement of the value adding potential of the seafood sector, as identified in Food Harvest 2020 and Action Plan for Jobs 2012. </p>

In the context of internal market and third country trade, DG Agriculture &amp; Rural Development produces regular market forecasts for various agricultural sectors and its most recent short-term outlook for the meat and certain other sectors was published in June 2012. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dairy sector</b><br><br>  The June report predicted increased EU production and exports for most dairy commodities but it is important to note how quickly the market can change. Extreme weather in different parts of the world this summer has had a significant impact on global dairy markets, as rising grain prices have led to an increase in dairy commodity prices.   <br><br>  Volatility in dairy prices is caused by imbalances of supply and demand in international markets, which are cyclical in nature.  However, while there will always be short term fluctuations in dairy prices, the medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good.  Growth in global population and wealth is forecast to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products.  Against that background, I believe that prospects and opportunities for the dairy sector will expand significantly over the coming years.  My Department and its agencies will continue to play their part in providing an appropriate framework to support the development of this critically important industry.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Beef Sector</b><br><br>  According to its analysis of the overall beef trade, the Commission expects that weak domestic demand and exchange rate movements will cause EU imports to fall by almost 6% in 2012 followed by a stabilisation in 2013. EU beef exports will be affected by a significantly reduced export capacity in 2012 and 2013 because of a shortage in domestic supply. As a result, the EU will revert to a being net beef importer in volume terms in 2012 and 2013 after the exceptional trade surplus recorded in 2011.<br><br>  The EU cattle population, which was estimated at 86 million head in December 2011, has declined at an average rate of 1.1% since 2008 and this trend should persist in the near future. EU beef and veal production in 2012 is expected to decrease by 3.5% compared to 2011 and to remain largely unchanged in 2013. A consequence of these supply constraints is that EU beef prices are likely to remain at record levels for the remainder of 2012. High beef prices combined with weak internal demand will lead to a reduction in beef and veal consumption in 2012 before stabilising at the lower level in 2013.<br><br>  Ireland is over 600% self sufficient in beef production and exports around 93% of slaughter output with volumes averaging approximately 0.5 million tonnes annually over the past 3 years. The outlook is for continued buoyant cattle prices on the basis that total prime cattle throughput at Department-approved meat plants is down 16% for the year to date compared to the same period in 2011. However, data on calf birth registrations in 2011 and 2012 indicates that prospects for production growth in the beef sector in 2013 are positive. Increased supply availability can be expected to result in increased beef output and exports in the short run. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Lamb sector</b><br><br>  According to the latest forecasts from the European Commission, the European sheep flock is expected to remain relatively stable in 2012 with slaughterings also at similar levels to last year. There are uncertainties about consumption levels due to the economic situation.<br><br>  Regarding the sheep sector in Ireland, slaughterings for the year 2012 up to week ending 16 September are up by 7% on the corresponding period in 2011. This points to an increase in production following the recovery in the breeding flock which was noted in 2010 and 2011. Factory prices for the year 2012 to date are approximately 2% below 2011 levels for the corresponding period. This reflects the competitive pressures in the market.<br><br>  The vast majority of Irish sheepmeat is sold on EU markets, with France being the single most important export market. Although almost all Irish sheepmeat has traditionally been sold on European markets, there has been more interest shown by exporters in third country markets in recent years. My Department, in co-operation with Bord Bia and with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs, has been active in negotiating access to key third country markets. In recent years we have succeeded in gaining access for Irish sheepmeat to Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa and Singapore and we are continuing to work on other possibilities. I am confident that this work will give the sector the options it needs to ensure the best returns possible going forward.</p>

The purpose of the Adoption Act, 2010, is to improve standards in both domestic and intercountry adoption and its enactment coincided with the establishment of the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI). The Adoption Authority of Ireland is an independent statutory body charged with implementing the Adoption Act, 2010. The Authority has responsibility for the direct operational implementation of legislation and Government policy. It has a quasi-judicial role and is independent in its decision-making functions.The AAI is the Central Authority with responsibility for overseeing standards in respect of the adoption process taking place within this jurisdiction.   <br><br>  In considering matters relating to intercountry adoption the Authority must satisfy itself that the adoption complies with the terms and conditions of the 1993 Hague Convention, which is a co-operative agreement drawn up to allow countries to mutually support one another in protecting the best interests of children in the intercountry adoption process. It is designed in such a way as to allow for mirrored mechanisms and structures to mutually assure countries of the safety and standard of intercountry adoptions in those countries.  This applies to all children in the inter country adoption process, including those with special needs.<br><br>  The Adoption Act, 2010, which provides the legislative framework for adoption in Ireland, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that <b>all </b>  adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child and to the highest possible standard.  The phrase &#8216;in the best interests of the child&#8217; is absolutely key in this regard. It must not be forgotten that intercountry adoption is a service for those children who cannot be raised by their birth parents or cared for in their own country. The interests of the child must always be paramount throughout the adoption process. This is best achieved through the full implementation of the highest national and international standards governing adoption practice. This is the primary concern for the Adoption Authority of Ireland in conducting its business as it relates to intercountry adoption.</p>

However, because all persons have a constitutional right to privacy it is envisaged that there may be some restrictions on the information that could be made available without the consent of the parties involved.  However, consideration of the policy issues in relation to all aspects of the proposed Bill is ongoing. It is intended that non-identifying information could be provided to an adopted person over 18 or to a birth parent. Non-identifying information is information by which another party could not reasonably be expected to be identified and could, for example, include the  forename, religion, approximate age, occupation, birth details, interests, hobbies, educational history, family history and medical history. The release of medical information would be proportionate to the objective for which it is sought by or on behalf of an adopted person or a birth parent.  </p>

The special allocation of &#8364;35m for mental health which was announced in Budget 2012 in line with the Programme for Government commitments will be used primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both Adult and Children&#8217;s mental health services, to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems and to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention.<br><br>  Of the 414 posts approved to implement the &#8364;35 million package of special measures for mental health introduced in Budget 2012, 353 are with the National Recruitment Service of the HSE at various stages in the recruitment process, 321 have been put to candidates to express an interest and others are awaiting competitions or the completion of essential paperwork.  Most start dates are expected to be in December to allow for the process of checking references, Garda clearance etc.   <br><br>  This Government remains committed to engaging these professionals as soon as is feasible and the work of completing the process remains a priority.  These posts will not generate a full year cost in 2012.  However, overall expenditure in mental health for 2012 is not available yet but the provisional outturn to mid-year was, like many other areas, running ahead of budget.  It is not possible at this stage to say what the net end year position will be in mental health.</p>

The HSE and IMB have been advised that there is sufficient availability of the product to meet the needs of patients within the State. </p><p><a name='N33'>  In order to ensure that stocks of this product are continuously maintained, it has been necessary for the principal wholesaler to introduce measures to manage the supply of this product to other wholesalers and pharmacies.  These measures have been necessary to address the depletion of stocks on the Irish market for Irish patients because of export of the product from Ireland to other EU markets. is known as parallel distribution and is permitted under EU law. Parallel export has the potential to result in product shortages on the Irish market.</p><p><a name='N34'>  The measures introduced by the principal wholesaler to maintain a necessary stock of this product on the Irish market include limitations on the quantity of the product that can be ordered, in one transaction, by other wholesalers.  The allocations from the principal wholesaler have been determined based on historical demand and, therefore should reflect current patient needs. There have been a small number of temporary shortages which have been quickly resolved.  The HSE and the IMB will keep the situation under review.</p><p><a name='N35'>  My Department has been engaging with the IMB, the HSE and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) to identify ways in which the Irish system can manage medicines shortages as effectively as possible in order to minimise the impact on patients.  The IMB and HSE work closely with each other to operationally manage medicines shortages when they arise.  The PSI has recently published guidance to registered pharmacists on managing medicines shortages. International efforts to effectively manage medicines shortages are also being considered.</p>

The Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2012 was published last July.  The Bill provides for the abolition of the Board of the HSE under the Health Act 2004 and the putting in place of a new governance structure.  The Board will be replaced by a Directorate, headed by a Director General and with strengthened accountability arrangements for the HSE.  The Bill is scheduled to being second stage in the Seanad on Wednesday 26 September.</p><p><a name='N22'>  In tandem with the proposed new governance structures, new administrative structures will be put in place in the HSE, to reflect the need for a greater operational management focus on the delivery of key services and greater transparency about funding, service delivery and accountability.  These new governance and administrative arrangements represent important first steps in the process of delivering the reform agenda contained in the Programme for Government.  The next steps, which will include measures to facilitate clearer and better integrated delivery and funding arrangements, are under consideration at present.</p>

My Department has been engaged in a review to identify the most appropriate mechanism to compensate those women excluded from the scheme on age grounds alone.  This review has included taking instructions and legal advice, including advice from the Office of the Attorney General, with a view to bringing proposals to Government for decision.

Glucosamine is indicated for the management of symptoms of osteoarthritis.  The National Centre for Pharmoeconomics (NCPE) have assessed the cost-effectiveness of glucosamine on two occasions and concluded that it did not offer value for money to the HSE.

These dealt with a range of matters, including measures to ensure that the relevant parts of the Health Sectoral Agreement within the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 can be given effect.  These discussions were also attended by officials from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and concluded on  17 September 2012.<br><br>  The outcome of this engagement is that detailed proposals have been agreed between the parties.  Amongst the key provisions of this agreement are that:<ul style="margin-left:20px"><ul type="disc"><li>  Consultants will be available for rostering for any five days out of seven as opposed to weekdays as at present;<li>  There can be rostering of consultants where required on 16/7 (8 a.m. to midnight) or 24/7 basis in services where this is required;<li>  Clinical Directors will have a strengthened management role in respect of consultants;<li>  There will be cooperation with a range of measures to support improved Community and Mental Health services;<li>  Consultants commit to expeditious processing and signing of claims for submission to private health insurers;<li>  There will be more cost-effective arrangements for funding of continuing medical education.  </ul></ul>  Separately, Government will apply a 30% reduction in salary for future consultant appointees.  Management proposals to reduce the &quot;rest day&quot; arrangements that currently apply and the elimination of the fee to consultant psychiatrists for giving a second opinion under the Mental Health Act 2001 will be referred to the Labour Court, in line with the procedures provided for in the Public Service Agreement.  The issue of &quot;historic rest days&quot; will be referred to the Labour Court in line with normal procedures.<br><br>  Government policy is to increase the number and availability of consultants in the public health service.   This policy is reflected in the 2008 Consultant Contract and the outcome of the recent discussions.  The revised salary levels for new consultants will facilitate the appointment of more consultants, which will directly enhance the care of patients through increased provision of consultant-delivered services.</p>

All relevant implications arising from this proposal will obviously have to be taken into account including, for example, a recent report by the Law Reform Commission entitled <i>Legal Aspects of Professional Home Care,</i> which in itself  is a follow up to its 2009 consultation paper <i>Legal Aspects of Carers. </i><br><br>  Primary legislation and resources will be required for the introduction of a statutory regulation system for home care services.  The question of possible changes to legislation, including regulation, inspection and complaints procedures for Home Care services for older people is at present under consideration.  The Department is examining this matter in the overall context of the licensing of Health Care providers.  Legislation is currently being prepared  and various options are being considered,  including the complex legal issues involved, and the need to prioritise legislation across the Social Care area overall.<br><br>  It should be noted that statutory regulation or licensing is only one way of improving the safety and quality of services and that other measures have or are being taken to improve Home Support services delivered by, or on behalf of, the Health Service Executive (HSE).  This approach is reflected in the HSE Service Plan 2012, and includes a new public <i>Procurement Framework</i> for Home Care services (with quality and screening requirements); new <i>National Quality Guidelines for Home Support Services</i>, and new <i>National Home Help Guidelines</i>.  These various measures, taken together, have been designed to improve relevant aspects of HSE Home Care provision nationally, pending progression of the legislative proposals raised by the Deputy.</p>

The aim of the Review was to consider all the possible options for the earliest possible delivery of a new children's hospital.

However, a number of changes have been made to the way in which medical card applications are processed by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  Any medical card holder undergoing a review, who genuinely engages with that review, will not have their entitlement withdrawn before the review is complete, regardless of the expiry date shown on their medical card.  In cases where a decision is made not to grant a medical card, the applicant is informed of the decision and is notified of their right to appeal this decision.  Contact details for the appeals office are provided to them.  Where a person submits an appeal to a decision not to renew a medical card within 21 days of that decision, they retain their medical card or GP visit card until the appeal is decided.  The Appeals officer notifies the appellant of the final decision in the case.</p><p><a name='N30'>  In relation to those persons under the age of 25 years who apply for medical cards, in future being on age related Supplementary Welfare Allowance will not, in itself, prohibit a person from being awarded a medical card or a GP visit card.</p><p><a name='N31'>  The HSE has implemented a set of guidelines in relation to the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill, or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford.  Emergency medical cards are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant.  With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card.  As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months.  The arrangement is slightly different for persons with a terminal illness.  Terminally ill patients are given an emergency medical card for six months.  Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible. </p><p><a name='N32'>  The Health Service Executive has confirmed that 96% of fully completed applications and reviews are now processed within 15 days.</p>

Benzodiazepines are commonly used to treat anxiety, sleep disturbance and insomnia and are known to be associated with dependence and withdrawal symptoms.  Consequently, benzodiazepines are usually recommended for short-term treatment only.   The Irish Medicines Board-approved prescribing information for alprazolam products states that they are only to be used when the symptoms of anxiety are severe.  It is also recommended that treatment with an alprazolam product should be as short as possible and generally not more than 8 to 12 weeks, including a tapering off process.</p><p><a name='N29'>  In Ireland, benzodiazepines are prescription-only medicinal products.  Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is prohibited for a person to supply a prescription medicine except in accordance with a prescription and the supply must be made from a registered pharmacy by or under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist.  A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence.  The Regulations also make it illegal for prescription medicines to be supplied by mail order.  The definition of mail order includes reference to electronic custom solicitation and order for supply.  This includes ordering prescription medicines through internet sites.  </p><p><a name='N30'>  The Irish Medicines Board is aware of illegal supply of alprazolam from internet sites outside Ireland and is working closely with the Revenue's Customs Service officials to detain supplies on entry to Ireland and, where possible, with counterpart agencies in other countries to stop the supply.  </p><p><a name='N31'>Furthermore, m y Department is reviewing the Misuse of Drugs Regulations with a view to introducing additional controls on certain prescription drugs, including benzodiazepines.  These include the introduction of import and export controls as well as an offence of unauthorised possession, thereby assisting the law enforcement roles of Customs and of the Garda Siochána.  My Department is consulting with key stakeholders in relation to the proposed amendments and it is anticipated that new legislation will be introduced by early 2013.</p>

In this regard it is imperative that the confidential nature of the background papers relating to this process is respected. In any case my Department does not have the names and addresses of individuals and/or groups associated with this consultation process.</p><p><a name='N25'>   It should also be noted that the consultants themselves may also have engaged in discussions with stakeholders by email and telephone.  To assist the consultants the IRCG gave them an indicative list of stakeholders. This is attached for information.</p><p><a name='N26'>  There is also a reference to a “Fearon Report”. This relates to an internal briefing note prepared by a member of the Management Board of the Department. In this case there was no formal external consultation process involved.  The Fisher reports on the Irish Coastguard and the Marine Survey Office are available on the Departments website.</p>
