Drafting of the primary legislation and the statutory instrument was complex and time consuming.  Nevertheless, we have delivered on our quarterly commitments under the action plan for jobs in terms of the credit guarantee scheme. </p><p><a name='N3'>  With the consent of my colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I have now made the necessary scheme under section 5 of the Act.  The scheme, which is SI 343 of 2012, was laid before the Oireachtas on 13 September.  Officials in my Department are working on the final arrangements in conjunction with the participating banks and the operator of the scheme, Capita Assets Services.  Launch of the scheme is imminent.</p><p><a name='N4'>  With regard to the interest rate, this will be a matter for the individual participating banks.  As required under EU State aid rules, a premium will be charged by the State to companies availing of the scheme.  This has been set at 2%.</p>

I look forward to working with him.</p><p><a name='N6'>  I want to raise a couple of issues arising out of the Minister's response.  The Minister has missed his target in terms of the assurance given on passage of the Credit Guarantee Bill 2012 at the end of the previous Dáil term that the scheme would be up and running in quarter three.  We are now into quarter four.  I cannot understand the reason all of the technical issues to which the Minister referred were not addressed while the scheme was being negotiated and all the heavy lifting was under way.  Issues such as training, briefing of the banks and so on should have been addressed in parallel with the legislative process.  The Minister knew, given the Government majority and broad support of the House for the legislation, that it would be passed.</p><p><a name='N7'>  I would like to put this matter in context.  While this training, briefing of the banks and so on is under way, the reality in terms of lending on the ground is stark, as set out by the Central Bank in its report of September last.  I know there is an understanding in the Minister's Department of the seriousness of the lending situation.  However, I fear this is not properly understood in the Department of Finance.  They are either blind or ignorant of it.  Gross &quot;new&quot; lending was down one third in the first quarter of 2012 versus the last quarter of 2011.  Only Greece has refused more small business loans than Ireland during that quarter, with one in four businesses seeking credit in Ireland being refused in the past six months versus one in 28 in Greece.  It is constantly stated that Ireland is not Greece.  However, small businesses seeking loans would get an easier hearing in Greece while there is a continual faffing around here in terms of the introduction of the loan guarantee scheme.</p><p><a name='N8'>  I am incredibly concerned that it is being left to the banks to set the interest rate.</p>

I do not need to tell the Minister or his officials that small businesses around this country are creaking at the seams.  There is hay rolling down streets for the want of access to finance by businesses.  The Minister need not bother reading out the statistics supplied to him by the Department of Finance in regard to the Credit Review Office.  Businesses on the ground are not getting finance.  If they are, they are getting it at penury rates and conditions and only in respect of the re-financing of existing working capital.  As such, this lending cannot be defined as new.  While people are being trained and we are negotiating interest rates, businesses are laying off people and are unable to create jobs or access whatever demand exists.</p><p><a name='N11'>  When will this money be in the pipeline and when will a business be able to apply for money from the scheme?

While these schemes were considered by the previous Minister, he did not deliver them.  My Department has delivered two new instruments, the microfinance scheme which was launched last week and the loan guarantee scheme which will be, as stated in my reply, launched imminently, which means within the next fortnight.</p><p><a name='N13'>  There are huge problems in terms of bank lending.  We are seeking to introduce schemes to assist where the system is not working.  It is important we give a break, through the provision of microfinance, to those wishing to start up a business.  We are also seeking to introduce a scheme for loan guarantees.</p>

Where a loan has been turned down the credit guarantee scheme is applied, and in return for this guarantee we charge a 2% premium on top of the rate which would otherwise have been provided to the lending.  Our scheme is to intervene where people are turned down wrongly because of a system whereby the bank rejected the risk on the grounds of collateral or because of the sector.  This intervention is very targeted.</p><p><a name='N3'>  As the Deputy stated, I accept wider issues exist with regard to banking.  We need to get to grips with banking and no State scheme can fill the gap whereby banks must take primary responsibility.

The private sector experienced the brunt of the job losses, with the construction sector alone losing 150,000 jobs in the period.  To reverse this trend and deliver our target of 100,000 extra jobs by 2016 will require a major transformation in the economy.  The new economy which we must build will be based on enterprise, innovation and exporting.  For the Government to promote this transformation will require progress on a number of fronts, including improving competitiveness, improving access to finance, embedding a jobs agenda within the necessary fiscal consolidation, taking strategic action to facilitate growth in sectors with significant potential and improving the capacity to convert good ideas into good jobs.</p><p><a name='N6'>  The action plan for jobs seeks to integrate work across the whole of Government to deliver the focus on employment.  Actions are delivered in accordance with stretching timelines.  The progress we have made in our first 18 months in office is encouraging, but there is a long way to go.  Employment in export oriented companies supported by the agencies under my Department has increased by a net 10,000 in the past 18 months.  This is in sharp contrast to losses of 45,000 among such companies in the previous three years.</p><p><a name='N7'>  It is particularly encouraging to see that exports from indigenous companies have been growing even faster than foreign direct investment and reached €15.2 billion in exports in 2011, the highest level ever.</p><p><a name='N8'>  In spite of continued job losses in more traditional sectors such as construction, and financial, insurance and administrative activities, we are seeing stabilisation in the level of private sector employment.  However, the downgrading of growth forecasts in most of our trading partners will create a particularly challenging environment for the next 12 months.  We are working on the preparation of proposals for the action plan for jobs 2013.  I have had a number of consultative meetings and invite submissions for consideration for the strategy.</p>

This is a phenomenal indictment of the Government's policies and those of the previous Government.  A total of 87,000 people emigrated last year, which is more than the number that sat the leaving certificate last year.  Emigration and unemployment are the burning issues in Irish society today.  The action plan for jobs was launched last February, 12 months after the Government came to power.  At the time, the Taoiseach stated he would create 100,000 additional jobs.  In this period alone, 33,000 jobs have been lost net so the Government is already at -133,000 given its promises.  In this period, the Government has seen long-term unemployment increase from 50% to 60% and the jobs free action plan is the micro-management of the Department rather than what is needed, which is macroeconomic investment in the State.<br><br>  We need significant investment if we are to tackle the major burning issue of our generation.</p>

I wish to make it clear that we are undertaking a massive transformation, as Deputy Tóibín pointed out.  Construction collapsed and 60% of employment in this sector was wiped out.  A total of 160,000 mainly male employees became unemployed.  There is a huge job to create a new economy that will absorb people from the sectors that, as we know, are in decline.  They grew too big and the policy that supported them was not sustainable.  We know that about banking, construction and so on.  So we have to create the new economy that builds the opportunities.  That is what we are doing.  Last year, the IDA had the best year in a decade.  It created the most new jobs in a decade and had the lowest level of job losses for a very long period.  International investment in Ireland has returned and we are seeing a jobs dividend from that.  As I also pointed out in the reply, we have reversed the dramatic collapse that was occurring in indigenous export-oriented companies.  That has been reversed and Enterprise Ireland companies are now growing employment.</p><p><a name='N7'>  We have seen a huge turnaround but I do not underestimate the scale of the challenge.  It is a huge challenge and we are working on it with determination.  The merit of the action plan for jobs is that every year, every Department focuses on what changes can be made this year to make a practical contribution to the target.  That is the approach we need to take and that is the one we are implementing.</p>

The difficulty with the proposal is that the Minister for Social Protection has form.  Last year, she pushed through substantial changes to the redundancy rebate payment system.  She justified this on the basis of the argument that large companies can afford to make the payment.  Nobody disagrees with that but when I asked for a breakdown of the payout from the redundancy fund over a number of years, I was told by the Minister's Department that the figures were not available.  Therefore, the Minister did not know how many large or small companies were involved.  She made the decision completely ill prepared.  I fear she will do the same again.  She clearly does not like the business sector and has, since she entered her Department, produced a range of policies that are anti-business.  We depend on the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to defend the business sector against this.</p><p><a name='N5'>  The Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, referred to the SFA.  Its figures suggest that 88% of businesses will be affected by cash flow changes if the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, proceeds with her plan.  Some 69% of businesses said it would restrict recruitment.  Despite all the talk of job creation and the action plan, the proposed measure would restrict the creation of new jobs.  Some 61% of firms indicated the proposal may lead to job losses.  The decision is in the Government's court and it could have a negative impact on jobs.</p><p><a name='N6'>  In case the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation would like us to believe employers do not pay their share he should note that in 2010, employers paid €5 billion towards the social insurance fund.  This is 75% of the total contribution.  Does the Minister agree that €5 billion is a very substantial contribution from employers generally towards the fund, and that increasing the contribution will, as said by the SFA when reflecting the views of its members, potentially add to the unemployment problem and hamper cash flow within companies?</p>

There is a consultative process and the Minister is open to consultation and giving groups the opportunity to make submissions.  The groups have made submissions which, as the Deputy knows, signal that within small businesses, the absence rate is but a little over 2%.  This is contrasted with the figure for the public service, where it can be 5%, on average.  Clearly, there are germane issues.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy John Burton, is concerned about the drift into long-term reliance on sickness benefits.  This is an important policy issue and we need to have a debate on how the problem can be contained.</p><p><a name='N8'>  These matters will all be weighed up by the Government when making decisions.

I ask the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to indicate that he, as Minister responsible for jobs and business, will fight for the interests of businesses against a Minister who clearly does not care about the business community.</p>

Ensuring more such businesses can start up, expand and export is a key pillar of our plans for jobs and growth.  For this reason, the Government has decided to implement an ambitious reform of the delivery of services to small and micro businesses.  This will include the development of a new small and microbusiness division within Enterprise Ireland as a centre of excellence in the provision of supports to that sector; the dissolution of the county and city enterprise boards, CEBs, and the transfer of their functions, assets and liabilities to Enterprise Ireland; the establishment of local enterprise offices, LEOs, to provide a high quality, innovative, one-stop shop support service for small businesses within local authorities and early access to services provided by national bodies; the integration of key local authority business services into the LEOs; and the promotion of a local environment in which enterprise can thrive.</p><p><a name='N7'>  Not only is it important that this restructuring be conducted as a priority, we must also ensure the new model is fit for purpose.  A high level implementation working group chaired by my Department is progressing the range of issues involved, including a focus on functions, structures and staffing, all of which will form the basis of a detailed and ambitious service level agreement between Enterprise Ireland and the local authorities.  A project plan is in preparation that will set out clear milestones and timelines for implementation.  I intend to complete the process as rapidly as possible.</p><p><a name='N8'>  In tandem with the work of the implementation working group, my Department is engaged with the Office of the Attorney General regarding the detailed primary legislation that will be necessary to implement the new arrangements.  My ambition is to give administrative effect to the new structures as soon as possible and in advance of the formal enactment of legislation.  To this end, I plan to deliver a series of significant interim milestones during the transitional arrangement.  These are in preparation.</p>

That is certainly true of this Government.  The majority of the State's employment is found in small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  Some 2,200 new businesses open every month.  However, 1,400 businesses also close every month.  Whenever we discuss this issue with the Government, it tells us that steps forward are being taken.  While there have been some steps forward, for example, in terms of foreign direct investment, there have also been major steps back.  On balance, the latter worsen the State's unemployment situation.</p><p><a name='N10'>  Last week, the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation received evidence from the Irish Exporters Association, IEA.  Like us, it has seen a vacuum develop within the supports for SMEs.  The city and county enterprise boards, CEBs have been in a state of chaotic limbo since Mr. Batt O'Keeffe was the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  The evidence to the committee suggests this situation is costing jobs.</p><p><a name='N11'>  I do not mean this personally, but there is a vacuum in this area because there is a vacuum in the Department.  Ineptitude in the Minister of State's small enterprise section is allowing a critical sector that is heavily dependent on job creation to flounder.  We are dealing not only with significant economic challenges, but also with a lack of leadership on the part of the Minister of State.  The Government has been in power for nearly 18 months, yet he was unable to provide a date for when the new regime would be in place.  Will he show some leadership today and indicate the date on which the regime will start?</p>

This is about the evaluation and management of enterprise in every sense and potential in the market.</p><p><a name='N3'>  It is important to note that the new interim milestones relate to the determination of local enterprise offices and accommodation plans; this is taken with enterprise officers on the ground, the centralisation of services and roll-out of services for small companies.  The backbone of the economy is made up of small enterprises, and these take in manufacturing as well as high-potential start-up companies.  All these are doing exceptionally well.  I have been all over the country meeting the people in all these companies.  Enterprise Ireland has a very focused working plan and this was not a simple shift from county and city enterprise boards.  The working group has formulated a strong level service agreement that will establish a one-stop shop for business.</p><p><a name='N4'>  With regard to the timeframe, the legislation has been formulated, as I noted in the initial reply, and it will go the Attorney General.  I expect the local enterprise offices will be up and running in the second quarter of 2013.</p>

The proposed measures follow upon the call by the European Council on 29 June that urged member states to step up efforts to increase youth employment, with "the objective that within a few months of leaving school, young people receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, apprenticeship or a traineeship".</p><p><a name='N4'>  My colleague the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, was invited to the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection on 26 September to outline the business of the forthcoming formal meeting of the Employment and Social Affairs Council, EPSCO, in Luxembourg on 4 October and to brief the joint committee on her priorities for the forthcoming EU Presidency in the first half of 2013.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, informed the joint committee that the European Commission is expected to publish a set of proposals in early December in the form of a youth transitions package.  The main element of the forthcoming package is expected to be a proposal for a youth guarantee aiming to ensure targeted young people are either working or in appropriate training or work experience within a specified time after becoming unemployed.  The objective of the Commission’s proposal is to intensify actions at EU and member state level aimed at addressing the high level of youth unemployment across Europe. </p><p><a name='N5'>  My Department is responsible for convening an interdepartmental committee to co-ordinate policy in regard to the work of the EPSCO.  I can confirm that there are continuing discussions involving the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Education and Skills and my Department, among others, regarding the possible content of the expected European Commission proposals, how they can be best adapted to the most urgent needs in the differing labour market circumstances of the EU member states in order to support young people in securing access to good quality apprenticeships, traineeship contracts and entrepreneurial skills, as well as modernising education and training systems to better reflect labour market needs.</p><p><a name='N6'>  I will have an opportunity on Wednesday, that is tomorrow, to discuss the Commission’s proposed measures directly with László Andor, the EU Commissioner responsible for employment, social affairs and inclusion.  I will assure Commissioner Andor that the  incoming Presidency will co-operate with the European Commission to secure early adoption by the Council in 2013 of measures designed to encourage EU member states to strengthen co-operation among employment services and other labour market stakeholders, including the social partners and education and training bodies to target young people. </p>

The rate in Europe is 23%, the common rate having regard to all labour market conditions in Europe.  Therefore, have a serious problem, yet we get more words and verbiage.  The European Commission does not understand the seriousness of this problem or, if it does, it is doing nothing about it. </p><p><a name='N10'>  When the Minister, together with almost the entire Government, go to Brussels tomorrow, can he emphasise that in Ireland, Spain, Greece and all of the member states the biggest issue to be faced is youth unemployment.  Young people are not getting their chance.  Deputy Tóibín referred to the brain drain out of this country in terms of emigration.  The statistics reveal that 65% of young people now report their principal status as a student compared to 51% four years earlier.  People are going down the education route.  They are doing many things to avoid becoming an unemployment statistic.  We have 306,000 people unemployed in this country, yet big companies tell us they cannot fill vacancies.  I ask the Minister why do we not take action in Ireland and put in place an upskilling programme in the IT sector?  It would involve the Minister's Department and the Department of Education and Skills.  Surely the vacancies that are in the technical sector can be filled by those who are unemployed, particularly those who are classified as youth unemployed.</p>

It is a much wider issue than the Commission's specific initiative.  The policy changes are those that have been brought in.

These innovative policy instruments have proved successful and Ministers will look to build on those.</p>

A total of 5 million young people are unemployed in Europe currently while, in this State, 30% of young people are unemployed with 50% long-term unemployed.  The Minister mentioned the preparatory action.  The Commission has allocated €4 million for this, which equates to 80 cent per unemployed youth in the State.  That is laughable if one is looking to tackle this issue.  There are 7,000 participants in JobBridge but 1,600 people are emigrating on a weekly basis.  The amount allocated is nowhere near proportionate.  What budget is necessary to deal with this problem?  Where will be Minister get this money?  Will it be through Europe or the Government?</p>

He quoted JobBridge figures but that initiative is one of the biggest scams going.  In reality, it is an exploitative scheme to replace real jobs with bogus internships.  Only 400 jobs have been created under it and the Minister has yet to explain how that will be a solution to chronic youth unemployment.  It is estimated the €3.5 billion in cutbacks the Government is proposing will take another 30,000 jobs out of the economy.  How will that address the position of young people who are currently unemployed?</p>

Even prior to the recession in the construction sector, apprenticeship schemes had almost disappeared and we became reliant on eastern Europe for tradesmen.  There has to be direct Government action to stimulate such schemes across every industry because they have disappeared gradually over the past 20 years and we have reached a point where all our young people must leave the country to get work.</p>

However, it is clearly Commissioner Andor's intention that there will be a shift in emphasis towards youth unemployment and youth guarantees.  That is the implication of what he is seeking to do.</p><p><a name='N10'>  With regard to the domestic economy, I take Deputy Wallace's point.  For a start, FÁS became solely focused on apprenticeships within the construction sector whereas the reality, if one examines the German and other successful continental European markets, is their apprenticeships models have a much broader industrial base.  The EU is seeking to promulgate the building of a wider base of apprenticeships for member states.  The role of SOLAS and the reorganised VECs will be in this area and the Deputy ought to table a question in this regard to the Minister for Education and Skills.</p>

However, within that, there are a number of strands in the strategy.  One element is to make financial consolidation, which is essential, more job friendly.  For example, selling old assets in order to invest in new assets is a way of becoming more dynamic.  Examining the establishment of funds to exploit through NewERA and infrastructure can drive potential.  Equally, the action plan for jobs considers how to get the whole of Government to move to a more pro-employment area.  Pathways to Work, from the Minister for Social Protection, is about identifying those who are disadvantaged in the labour market and seeking to support them to give them an opportunity to take up employment.  It involves many Ministers other than me but that is the basic approach.</p>

In the three years prior to taking office, over 300,000 jobs were lost.  The collapse of the property bubble brought our banking system to a point of collapse and employment in the construction sector fell by 60%.  The surge in unemployment is the direct consequence of these failed policies.  A huge task of economic transformation is necessary to reverse these trends and get employment growing.  <br><br>  There are two major elements to the Government&#8217;s response to unemployment &#8211; Pathways to Work and the action plan for jobs.  The aim of the action plan for jobs is to create a supportive environment for enterprise to create and sustain new jobs.  We have set an ambitious but realistic target of creating 100,000 jobs by 2016.<br><br>  The aim of Pathways to Work is ensure that as many opportunities as possible go to people who are currently on the live register, particularly those who are long-term unemployed.  It has an objective of ensuring that at least 75,000 of those currently long-term unemployed will move into employment by 2015.  It also aims to reduce the average time spent on the live register from 21 months to less than 12 months by the end of 2015.<br><br>  The establishment of the new integrated national employment and entitlements service will transform the nature and level of engagement between our employment services and those who are unemployed.  It will also provide better targeted services to both job seekers and employers.  The labour market activation measures outlined in Pathways to Work include over 85,000 job placement and work experience places to be delivered this year by the Department of Social Protection, and over 450,000 training and education places to be delivered by the Department of Education and Skills.  In addition, the financial supports available to employers who recruit a person who is long-term unemployed have been improved.  These include Revenue&#8217;s job assist scheme and the employer&#8217;s PRSI exemption scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection.  The Government has been actively promoting these schemes to employers in recent months, with the support of business representative bodies.  We must continue to do all we can to facilitate the return to work of those who have lost their jobs.  I am currently preparing the 2013 action plan for jobs on behalf of the Government and will be exploring further measures which can be taken to transform our economy and support job creation.</p>

Since the Government has taken office, we have moved from 50% of those who are unemployed being long-term unemployed to 60%.  The activities the Government has been involved in have had a negative effect.  Long-term youth unemployment in Ireland is at the highest level in Europe.  The Government is tinkering around the edges.  This Government and the last Government have taken €24 billion out of the economy and at the same time the private sector has taken €30 billion out of the economy.  Sucking that level of money out of the economy leads to the economy collapsing.  The Government has been involved in a pro-cyclical policy, making the trough deeper.  By these policies, the Government has taken a kango hammer to the Irish economy and it is in disorder as a result.</p><p><a name='N8'>  There are obvious solutions, and not just those proposed by Sinn Féin.  There are internationally recognised counter-cyclical policies of investment.  The country has two major strategic objectives for the next 15 to 20 years.</p>

It includes, for example, the establishment of Irish Water and its development as a professionally run utility that will become a major asset in the long term.  At present, we are losing €500 million from water leaking into the ground from a system that is under-performing.  That is a major investment which will also improve our infrastructure.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, recently announced his plans to achieve a broadband spread across the country.  Deputy Tóibín might take up this issue with Deputy Rabbitte.</p><p><a name='N5'>  The intention of the Government is to achieve financial consolidation, which is essential.  We inherited public finances where spending was exceeding tax by about 50%.  That is not sustainable.  The Deputy is advocating expansionary policies with a heavy level of reliance on borrowing when we can only borrow from one source, having been locked out of the lending markets.

Meanwhile, 306,000 people are unemployed, of whom 60% are long-term unemployed.  We cannot have a skills shortage on the one hand and a serious unemployment problem on the other.</p><p><a name='N9'>  Can the Minister not look at the Fianna Fáil proposal to put a scheme in place similar to the one the Minister established when he was in his Department in a previous Administration?

Deputy Bruton is the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.

That will involve initiatives such as Springboard which will provide short-term conversion courses, as well as increasing the longer term outputs from the colleges.  There are acute skills shortages in key areas.  There are shortages of programmers, for example, in the ICT area.  There are also shortages of people with combinations of IT and language skills.  There are gaps in those areas and we will be seeking to focus initiatives there.  There is scope for improvement in those areas.</p><p><a name='N12'>  We need to focus on job creation activities.

He has twice mentioned Irish Water.  The work that will be transferred to Irish Water is currently being done by local authority workers.  The contracts he referred to are short-term contracts for the installation of water meters to privatise the service and will be fulfilled by companies such as Sierra or SiteServ.  There is no proper State-led investment to repair leaks and develop a proper infrastructure.</p><p><a name='N17'>  The policies the Minister identified as dealing with the unemployment issue are being used to add to the problem.  The Minister mentioned activation measures.  Schemes such as JobBridge are being exploited by the private sector, not to employ people but to take them on in cheap internships.  Unless the Government recognises its over-reliance on the private sector, which has been on strike for the past number of years, and addresses that problem, the chronic and long-term unemployment that citizens are faced with will continue.  </p>

This year, we had 95 high potential start-up companies.  They were set up by predominantly young entrepreneurial people, men and women, who are setting up businesses that have the potential to grow to significant scale.  We are backing those enterprises with preference shares, supports and mentoring.  They are the new companies of the future that will create a strong new economy.</p><p><a name='N19'>  It takes a blinkered view not to see Irish Water as a new proper State-led investment.  This is a State company, set up as a subsidiary of Bord Gáis Éireann.  It is dealing with an asset of strategic long-term importance.  Water is a hugely important asset and we are squandering it.  We have a system that is not fit for purpose and is losing water into the ground.  We need to build the system.  We have given leadership in that regard.  The work will involve employment in the rebuilding of the infrastructure and will be a win-win for the Irish economy.  It is a wholly appropriate thing to do at this time.</p>

That country worked its way out of it by applying the philosophy of John Maynard Keynes.  The top priority was the creation of employment which led to growth and eventually to a balanced budget.</p><p><a name='N21'>  I know the Minister is focused on job creation, but does he not think the Government is putting budget balancing ahead of job creation and that its priority is to balance the budget and get the figures right?  I do not say that is the Minister's priority but it seems to be the overall priority of the Government.</p><p><a name='N22'>  The failure to fix the leaks in the water infrastructure was not due to the lack of Irish Water.  There was a State decision not to deal with the problem.  I hope Irish Water fixes the leaks before it installs meters.  One would not need to be a rocket scientist or a businessman to see that if we are losing almost 45% of our water it would be a very good business decision to stop the leaks before the meters are installed. </p>

Keynes was long an advocate of appropriate policies which included, during his time and which are still relevant, getting stability and confidence in a currency and having a system in which people will have confidence.  That was not there during his time and, clearly, it is problem we must tackle at present.  Equally, getting banks to lend was another obsession of Keynes.  He wanted to get the system which had become broken repaired and back in action.  That is absolutely true.</p><p><a name='N3'>  We need a growth strategy from Europe, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, is continually pursuing this at European level to complement, as Keynes would say, the stability of the currency and better banking policies.  That is the trio that must be implemented if we are to get out of this recession.  However, Ireland does not have the ability to deploy all those tools.  Many of them require collective action across the 27 member states and that is extremely difficult to secure, as everybody knows from observing what is happening.  There are huge challenges but we must ensure that the pieces we are working on are effective, and that is what I am seeking to outline.</p>

If one considers the cut in capital expenditure in the budget last year, which will obviously continue for the next number of years, the balance is that the Government stimulus adds €800,000 over six years.  The idea of a stimulus is to impact the State with such a large investment that it radically changes the gear of the economy and points it in a new direction.  As has been said, much of the investment that will be put into Irish Water will go on the metering of houses.  What change in productivity will that bring to Irish society and its economy?  It will bring none.</p><p><a name='N5'>  The Minister mentioned that the current ideas of stimulus were somehow simplistic.  That is incredible because Joseph Stiglitz, Paul Krugman and John Maynard Keynes, who were Nobel Prize winners, said the best time to make an investment is when the economy is down.  It does not make sense to have a stimulus investment when the economy is up.  A stimulus investment only makes sense in this scenario.</p><p><a name='N6'>  With regard to there not being opportunities, the National Pensions Reserve Fund has billions of euro that are available to the State.  The private pension industry is looking for an area in which to invest and has told me that the Government has not approached it with proper investment opportunities.  We are in a critical situation and this is a burning issue throughout society.  The Government must step up to the plate.</p>

It happened before we took office but the country reached a point where, effectively, it could not borrow in the lending markets.  There was only one place we could borrow and that was under the most strict conditions, of which the Deputy is aware.  The conditions are about hitting key budgetary targets each year and the Government must do that.  Our stimulus is about how, even within those targets, one can generate imaginative thinking that can create a stimulus package.  Everything we are doing is of the type the Deputy has mentioned.  It is about identifying new revenue streams, such as in the water sector, so we can have an investment programme to upgrade the key infrastructure.  It is about taking funds in the National Pensions Reserve Fund and setting up, for example, the small and medium enterprises, SME, equity and lending fund which we are doing.  That is the way in which we seek to drive a stimulus even though we are constrained by the international agreements we had to enter into to hit certain key borrowing targets.  We are operating under severe constraints but, within that, we are producing the type of innovative strategies that can make a difference.  The Deputy pretends those constraints are not there.</p>

Promoting entrepreneurship, attracting inward investment, helping indigenous companies grow and facilitating the key infrastructural needs of Irish enterprise are key policy instruments for building the competitive advantage of regions and promoting regional growth.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 is a whole of Government national strategy aimed at creating and sustaining jobs across all regions of the State.</p><p><a name='N13'>  All of our agencies work to promote regional growth opportunities.  The IDA has a specific target of delivering 50% of its projects outside Cork and Dublin.  Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise board structure have a strong regional base of companies and active policies to promote their growth.  The objective of balanced regional development is supported by the EU Commission’s regional aid guidelines, which recognise that some regions can face significant structural disadvantage.  The guidelines permit member states to grant higher investment aid to these areas.  Under Ireland’s current regional aid map, the highest rates are afforded to the Border, midlands and west, BMW, region.  Under the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, the establishment of a one-stop-shop to provide micro-enterprise support through the dissolution of the existing county enterprise board, CEB, offices and the creation of a new network of local enterprise offices, LEOs, will ensure an enhanced delivery of support to micro-enterprises across all regions.</p><p><a name='N14'>  With regard to the question on the Border region, the agencies’ network of offices includes Sligo, Letterkenny and Dundalk.  Significant IDA projects in the Border region in the past 12 months include 175 jobs in Abbott in Sligo and 1,000 jobs in PayPal in Dundalk.  There have been specific initiatives in the Border region, including the competitive start-up fund, enterprise development programmes, first-time exporters programme, new frontiers in Sligo and Letterkenny and supports provided by InterTradeIreland.</p>

Undoubtedly some successful things are happening but, on balance, the Government is failing disastrously.  Areas such as Offaly, Wexford, Carlow, Laois, Longford, Roscommon, Cavan, Westmeath and Monaghan have experienced the highest increases in unemployment in the State.  Those areas are really badly serviced in respect of key communications infrastructure such as broadband and so forth, but many of them have had no IDA visits in the past two years.  While it is easy to identify a handful of opportunities, the reality is that these areas are suffering significantly due to unemployment and emigration.  A more proportionate response is required to redress this.  How many IDA visits have these counties received since the Minister was appointed?  I hope he will not dance around the question but give figures or, at least, appropriate estimates.</p>

From the recent CSO statistics, we know between 26% and 30% of the working population of Donegal is out of work.  That is a shocking statistic.  In some electoral districts up to 40% of all age groups are unemployed and emigration is rampant across the county.  The Government not only focused foreign direct investment on one location in the county, Letterkenny, it then planned to withdraw the IDA offices from the town.  It withdrew funding from the A5 road, a critical project to help Donegal, and there is no plan that might improve on what came before.

They will also work with the third level institutes to facilitate the private sector.  Innovation vouchers are available to help those with an idea to commercialise it.

All those offer potential employment.  This is a challenging job but the focus of Government is to attract foreign direct investment into Ireland.  There have been a number of overseas trips by Ministers and delegations and they are making a difference.</p>

It comprises 64% of Enterprise Ireland-supported jobs and over 50% of IDA-supported jobs in 2011, and 194,490 persons were employed in agency assisted manufacturing companies in 2011.<br><br>  The Action Plan for Jobs includes measures aimed at exploiting sectoral opportunities, including those in the manufacturing and services sectors.  I have established a<i>&nbsp;</i>manufacturing development forum to set out a strategic vision for 2020 aimed at increasing employment in the sector.  Its membership comprises key industry players and I have instructed the forum to identify impediments to job creation in manufacturing areas and opportunities for immediate job creation.  High value production is the future of indigenous manufacturing, and growth sectors are pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agriculture and food, medical technology and ICT.  A number of steps have been taken to enable indigenous manufacturing firms to specialise, develop skills and value and scale up, including the launch of the new potential exporters division, Enterprise Ireland&#8217;s lean business offer, the new development capital scheme and improvements to the research and development tax credit scheme.<br><br>  Forfás data show that manufacturing employment grew by 1.1% in 2011, an increase of 2,198 jobs.  This reverses a trend of four continuous years of job losses, when almost 45,000 jobs were lost in manufacturing.  The bulk of the growth was in foreign-owned industry but indigenous manufacturing also increased slightly, with 92,507 employed by Irish-owned companies.  Employment growth in Irish manufacturing companies has been especially strong in the medical device, food and ICT sectors.</p>

She gave a very revealing interview on the Marian Finucane radio show at the weekend in which she confirmed everything we have been saying in this House over recent months about work on primary care being blocked and poor management of the health budget, so much so that we are now facing the most appalling cuts because of the Minister's failure to tackle these issues.</p><p><a name='N12'>  The Taoiseach might recall that I asked three weeks ago whether the delegation of ministerial orders had been laid before the House on the former Minister of State's functions.  The Taoiseach did not seem to know if they were or not and said he would get back to me.  I checked and they were laid before the House in September 2011.  What is most revealing is that while they cover medicinal products and the poisons Bill, among other things they excluded completely any reference to primary care.  Despite appointing the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, saying she would have special responsibility for primary care, there is not a mention of primary care.  Was it not then the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and their Cabinet colleagues ditched and isolated the Minister?  She was not given statutory delegation for primary care and despite knowing from freedom of information requests that she had sought it on a number of occasions, it fell on deaf ears.  Who excluded primary care from her delegated statutory authority as Minister of State?</p><p><a name='N13'>  The Minister of State met the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach during the summer to resolve this issue, and the suggestion was that a summer holiday might sort it out.  We know the Minister of State had deep reservations about the Minister's performance that went beyond the added primary care centres.  They went to the core of the implementation of the programme for Government itself.</p>

He is aware that all statutory instruments refer to a legal base.  There is no legal base to a primary care Act, so in terms of statutory instruments they refer specifically to narrower confines.  However, primary care, no more than public transport or any other issue, covers a range of activities.</p><p><a name='N9'>  I can confirm to Deputy Martin that the position is that issues which were raised in recent days about the pharmaceutical industry and the cost of drugs, insurance claims and the issue concerning consultants being re-rostered and the substantial savings that will accrue over the coming years have all been the focus of pretty intense negotiations with conclusion in areas of these in the past period and with more to come.  In respect of the primary care centres, when I addressed this matter last week, I told Deputy Martin they were in different sectors, in that leases were involved in some, direct Exchequer funding was involved in others and, in some cases, the primary care centres would be provided under a public private partnership, PPP, system.  This is all part of the stimulus package of more than €2.5 billion brought forward by the Government which covers the areas of transport, health, justice and education, as well as the major development at Grangegorman.  The entire seamless package was announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and, obviously, was approved by the Government.</p><p><a name='N10'>  From his own experience, the Deputy is aware of the value of primary care centres and how fundamental they are to providing a proper health system and health structures nationwide.

I do not buy his answer in respect of the statutory order.  However, I asked him specifically whether he approved of the adding of the 15 centres.  This pertains to public private partnerships, which, as I noted last week, have a strong commercial dimension to them because they involve the State entering into a contract with individuals, a company or an entity.  Therefore, there must be a transparent and open process.  It is almost equivalent to a tender situation.  It is a commercial contract.  Consequently, one cannot simply fudge it and this has been a major problem since this issue first arose.  Moreover, the story keeps changing all the time.  The Taoiseach might indicate what 15 sites were displaced by the 15 that were added, given the list that Deputy Shortall had put together.  The more I consider this saga from the outset-----</p>

Last week, the HSE put in place a public consultation process to consider options for the future of the Cottage Hospital, Drogheda.  At the same time, a statement from two Government party Deputies, Deputy Nash and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, claimed they had agreed a conclusion to this process with the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  By so doing, they totally undermined the process, the rights of concerned citizens, the elderly themselves, their families and local representatives.  In the programme for Government, the Taoiseach promised an end to the old politics.  He promised to honour the trust of the electorate and to break from the corruption of Fianna Fáil.  Tá sé go han-soiléir, áfach, go bhfuil an Rialtas mar Fhianna Fáil.  Tá sé ag déanamh na rudaí céanna agus níl an córas sláinte ag obair ar son saoránaigh.

We have already heard about the slashing of child benefit and I dare say this is only the tip of the iceberg over the next eight weeks of rumours and so-called leaks.  I would like to remind the Taoiseach of one thing before the Government begins its next round of imposing penalisation on the people.  Last year's budget has proved to be one of the most regressive in the history of the State, disproportionately affecting those already struggling.  As the Nobel Laureate, Joseph Stiglitz, has said, austerity never works to resolve economic downturns.  He said that austerity instead turns downturns into recessions and plunges recessions into depressions.  A succession of budgets dragging down domestic demand and delaying recovery is not the answer.  There are other options if only the Government would consider them.</p><p><a name='N26'>  Increasing the effective tax rate for high earners by just 1.5 percentage points would generate an extra €650 million in additional revenue.  A wealth tax could also generate more than €200 million.  The Government would effectively get €850 million just by a moderate targeting of high earners.  Those are just two proposals the Nevin Economic Research Institute has published in its strategy for an alternative adjustment which would lead to the same deficit outcome of 7.5% of GDP but also provide for the protection of front line services and social protection.</p><p><a name='N27'>  The Government's plans will result in the loss of 29,000 jobs next year, whereas this costed proposal would save 21,000 of those.  While there is no way to fast-track economic recovery, the path the Government is taking is the wrong one.  There is an alternative to penalising people while still generating the revenue required.  Does the Government intend to continue to burden those who cannot take any more or will it ensure that those can pay do?</p>

The Commission on Taxation and Social Welfare produced a report on child benefit.  I have not seen this report nor has it come to Government.  Matters of a budgetary nature are a matter for consideration by the Cabinet collectively and that is what the Cabinet will do in regard to the very challenging preparation work the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has to do for 2013.  The Deputy seems to forget the country is in a bailout programme and we do not have money to throw around as happened in years gone by.</p><p><a name='N31'>  The Deputy's quotation from Professor Stiglitz is incorrect.  He said that austerity rarely works.  I happened to be there to welcome 5,500 members of the International Bar Association to our country.  They will be here for a week or longer, which will have a dramatic impact on the economic spend locally and give people from throughout the world a flavour of the personality of Irish people.</p><p><a name='N32'>  As we prepare for the Presidency of the European Union on 1 January, our focus is on growth and jobs because that is where the future of the country, and countries of the eurozone and European Union, lies.  We have already made it clear that in our preparations for this Presidency that is where the focus will be - on the development of the Single Market and the continual opening of opportunities for jobs and business.  I invite the Deputy and others to come to the House the week after next in order to participate in the economic debate that has been requested a number of times, taking into account the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council report, the IMF report and others.</p>

I believe they will stand up to scrutiny.  We must achieve a balance between cuts and revenue.  The Government's agenda is one of cuts to the income of people who cannot afford them, many of whom are going to the wall.  One of the proposals which I put forward today would generate extra revenue through the targeting of people who can afford to pay extra.  As per that proposal, people earning €100,000 would pay an extra €1,500 in tax.  Surely these people can afford to carry that burden.  We should not be targeting cuts to child benefit at people on low incomes and those in receipt of social welfare benefits who cannot afford that hit, or be forcing them into having to go cap in hand to secure an increase.  We should be targeting the people who can afford to pay.  The Taoiseach should consider and take on board my proposals, thus targeting the people who can afford to pay and protecting those who need our help.</p>

The Government has since hosted receptions in Farmleigh for the Olympic and Paralympic athletes, their coaches, families and friends.</p><p><a name='N23'>  The UK Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, invited me to attend an event on &quot;hunger&quot; which he was hosting prior to the closing ceremony.  A small group of countries with a high profile in the area of nutrition were invited to participate in this global event, along with representatives of international organisations, the private sector and civil society.  The event aimed to raise the level of political commitment to combat the problem and to stimulate the development of new products and services to improve nutritional levels in developing countries.  I was invited to contribute on the overall challenge of under-nutrition and had an opportunity to emphasise the priority Ireland will attach to building further political commitment to address hunger and nutrition during our forthcoming Presidency of the EU in 2013.  I stated that the eradication of hunger is a cornerstone of Ireland's foreign policy and that we are determined to play our part in putting solutions into practice.  I informed the group that Ireland spends 20% of its Irish Aid budget on programmes that directly address hunger and nutrition and that we will continue to meet this target.</p><p><a name='N24'>  Following the global nutrition event, I had a meeting with Mr. Ertharin Cousin of the World Food Programme.  I congratulated her on her recent appointment as executive director of the WFP.  I reiterated Ireland's priority in eradicating hunger and achieving global food security and said that I looked forward to working with the WFP to deliver the international conference on hunger, nutrition and climate justice during Ireland's EU Presidency.</p><p><a name='N25'>  I have no immediate plans for a meeting with the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron.  I do expect, however, to see him at the forthcoming European Council meeting on 18 and 19 October.</p>

I will reflect upon the letter sent by Deputy Adams.  It is important to have as comprehensive a background to these meetings as is possible.  As Deputy Adams is aware, I met Mr. Black, the survivor of the Kingsmill massacre, and the families of the victims.  I also intend to meet a group from west Fermanagh who will soon come down with the Minister, Ms Foster.  These events are an important opportunity to speak for survivors and next of kin who have lost loved ones.</p><p><a name='N6'>  This morning I raised the issue of Marian Price with the Secretary of State when we met shortly after 8 a.m.  It is an issue about which we are concerned and I understand from background information that her health has improved somewhat.  It is of interest in respect of her as a person and I took the opportunity to raise the issue this morning.</p><p><a name='N7'>  We also discussed the question of dissident groups and the importance of keeping a focus on community development.  The covenant centenary march went off without any great disruption, although there were aspects of sectarianism in some incidents.  It is important to keep in perspective that the decade of centenary commemorations will be overseen sensitively and in an understanding and comprehensive way by both Governments and we have a keen interest in this.</p><p><a name='N8'>  For the Deputy's information, we also discussed having a strategy for involvement in working with our colleagues in Northern Ireland.  Co-operation can be enhanced in the areas of health, hospital care, education and tourism.  We have appointed some personnel to the permanent representation in Brussels as we prepare for the Presidency of the European Union which will be of interest and assistance to our colleagues in Northern Ireland.  Work is being done by both Governments on licensing diesel suppliers and the capacity of both Governments, through research which is being done, on putting a marker into diesel which cannot be washed out, which would deal with the extraordinary level of cross-Border activity.  I commend the customs service and the Garda for their confiscation in recent days of substantial equipment.  This activity does down the local economies of people who go about their business perfectly legitimately.</p><p><a name='N9'>  There is a great deal of cross-Border involvement.  The next meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council is to be held in Armagh.  I hope to build on further involvement in visits to Northern Ireland.</p><p><a name='N10'>  When we signed the strategic partnership agreement with Prime Minister Cameron it was suggested that as is appropriate, I as Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister would visit on an alternate basis to show interest in the work of the Executive and the Assembly and also with regard to communities in Northern Ireland.  I have met a number of people in the course of normal business here who have expressed views and proposals which in some cases are worthy of following up.  I invite Deputy Adams to put forward his views on which we might follow through.  It is not true to say we do not have a strategy, interest or involvement in building on the foundations of the Good Friday Agreement for the betterment of all communities.  I hope over a period of time to demonstrate this.</p>

I very much welcome his assertion that the Government will continue to improve co-operation across the island on a range of issues.  Like the Taoiseach, I join in commending the customs service and the Garda Síochána on the arrests and confiscation of equipment in diesel laundering plants.  It always strikes me, including with regard to what happened last night, that those arrested are almost immediately released.  Not only are both states denied a tax intake but environmental damage is caused by the huge amount of sludge that is dumped, not least in counties Louth and Monaghan.  I have met the PSNI and Garda Síochána on this issue.</p><p><a name='N12'>  There is much in what the Taoiseach said with which I agree.  I was in Belfast at the weekend and I very much welcomed that the big parade went off peacefully, apart from a few unsightly sectarian examples.  No one was injured or killed and this is something to be glad about in such a charged atmosphere.</p><p><a name='N13'>  I will return to the point I made earlier.  I am not convinced, and more importantly the families of Pat Finucane, the Ballymurphy victims and others are not convinced, that the British Government wants to deal with these issues.  David Cameron is not responsible for them; he was not there and he may not have even been born.  The only way the British Government can be brought to deal with these issues is if the Government gives Mr. Cameron a case which is absolutely and totally undeniable.  The Government has the wherewithal to do so because such a case exists.  The people of Ballymurphy will co-operate.  When Deputy Martin was the Minister for Foreign Affairs he visited the site, walked the ground and met the people.  The same thing happened with regard to other instances.  The Finucane family has a proven track record on the issue affecting it and those involved in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings also deserve support.</p><p><a name='N14'> With respect, what I suggest is logical.  The Taoiseach should take some of his very fine civil servants and set them to deal with the information aspect.  Then, if the Taoiseach is satisfied the case is made, he should send it to Mr. Cameron so when he next meets him it is on his desk and he cannot dodge it, and it is more than something mentioned at a meeting but is something in which the Government is involved.  If the British do not deal with it then the Taoiseach should arm the consular and diplomatic services, our friends in the United States and in the diaspora and other governments which praise the peace process but want to see it brought to completion.  They are allies in this task.  Once again I commend this approach to the Taoiseach.</p>

What new ideas came forward from the British Prime Minister in respect of the alleviation or, preferably, elimination of hunger and malnutrition across the world?  What new ideas, if any, did the Taoiseach bring to the conference?  Were the results of a major study by a non-governmental organisation called Tax Justice Network, written by James Henry, formerly of McKinsey & Co and an expert on tax havens, that an incredible $21 trillion are salted away by the super-rich global elite in offshore accounts, trusts, etc., relayed there?  In view of that stunning information, how does the Taoiseach justify joining with the British Prime Minister in opposing even a modest transaction tax on the vast billions circulating through the world and European financial markets on a daily basis?  Even a modest wealth tax on this elite is opposed, which in Europe and elsewhere refuses to invest in the productive economy and is instead facilitated by the ten top private banks, including the likes of Goldman Sachs - the great vampire squid, as it was famously alluded to in an American magazine - sucking up the resources for its services to big business and the super-rich internationally?  Is it not very clear that on the basis of this information, emergency action, taxes and levies on these elements of wealth need to be introduced on a European and world basis?  Why, for example, will the Taoiseach not lead a move within the European Union in this regard?  This morning and just now, he professed a willingness to put on his wellington boots and wade through the toxic sludge to end diesel laundering, which I agree should be ended.</p>

It does not just apply to the area mentioned by Deputy Higgins.  For example, the Hunger Task Force report of 2008 called on Ireland to prioritise three particular areas.  The first was to improve small-holder agricultural productivity in Africa, particularly among women farmers.  The second was to target the prevention of maternal and infant under-nutrition and the third was to promote governance and leadership to reduce global hunger at both national and international level.  The Deputy is aware of Ireland's long tradition of involving itself in these matters over the years, from the concerts organised by well-known Irish musicians from Bob Geldof to the campaign by U2 for the elimination of debt in the Third World.  These people are all part of that programme.</p><p><a name='N15'>  The event took place in Downing Street and included a number of leaders, political personnel and organisational personnel from non-governmental organisations, with particular reference to Africa and North Africa.  Contributions were made by these people at the event called by the Prime Minister.  One thing that struck me was the impact of nutrition being made available and dealt with for children from birth to two years of age who suffer from stunted growth, which carries through to other families.  For example, a British entrepreneur has a foundation dealing with the provision of nutritious foods through peanut butter and such additions.  The impact it can make in a few short weeks is extraordinary.  There was a good deal of discussion about that and where it could lead.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, equality and mental health, Deputy Lynch, pointed out, the Step Up Nutrition or SUN concept is of importance as well.</p><p><a name='N16'>  The Deputy is also aware of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the William J. Clinton Foundation and the impact they have made, particularly in Africa with regard to related matters there.  Small-holder agricultural productivity, particularly among women farmers in Africa, is of particular interest to Ireland.  </p>

For a small country, we have a disproportionate impact, as has been evident in our involvement in Lesotho and other regions.</p><p><a name='N3'>  The meeting lasted for an hour or an hour and a half and was based in particular on contributions from African personnel.  One of those present was the Somalian runner Mo Farah, who received this year Olympic gold medals in both the 5,000 m and 10,000 m.  Also present was the former world record holder, Haile Gebrselassie, an ambassador and proponent of the work that is under way.  Mo Farah, the Olympic double champion, spoke with great feeling about his homeland and other countries in the region.  He referred to the impact of credible, commonsense action to deal with malnutrition and under-nutrition and to the agri-sector in particular.</p><p><a name='N4'>  The proposition made by Ireland, based on its involvement over the years, was recognised by the leaders present at the meeting.   We intend to maintain expenditure under our Irish aid programme at 20%.  Ireland is the only country in the world to have made and delivered upon such a commitment.  This has been the case over the years and it is commendable.  The Tánaiste recently announced that it is our intention to maintain expenditure at its current level in dealing with these particular areas.</p>

They should receive every support.  The point I am making to the Taoiseach, however, is that the resources deployed in this regard are a fraction of what could be brought to bear in a concerted way if we had a very different financial system internationally and a different order of priorities.  Does the Taoiseach not see any contradiction between his wish to end suffering and the fact that European and other world leaders, among whom he mixes so effortlessly and who slap him on the back as the best of friends, deploy significantly more resources to areas such as armaments production than to the resolution of human problems such as hunger, whose solution is crucial?</p><p><a name='N6'>  The Taoiseach mentioned in his reply two billionaire so-called philanthropists.  The poverty-stricken and hungry are dependent on the kindness of people who make billions, using all kinds of tax havens in the process to maximise the profits of their corporations.  Does this not strike the Taoiseach as obscene in reality?  The wealth these people have created, including the €15 trillion that has been salted away, is created by human labour, by hundreds of millions of people.  Should it not be taxed in an emergency fashion through transaction and wealth taxes?  With his friend Prime Minister Cameron, why does the Taoiseach not open up a new front in this regard rather than apply the Band-Aid which, unfortunately, will not in any way resolve the crisis of world hunger?</p>

The Deputy asked me our view on the financial transaction tax.  I have answered this in the House on many occasions.  We have not supported a financial transaction tax because it would place our financial services centre and, as a consequence, our economy at a disadvantage.  Were it to be applied on a global scale, or throughout the European Union, we would have a different perspective.  It is not applied globally and, for that reason, Ireland has a very clear view.  It will retain such a view during its Presidency.  It will run its Presidency as competently as it can but it will not become an advocate of a measure that could place our economy and, as a consequence, our people at a serious disadvantage.</p><p><a name='N8'>  Partly through the programmes adopted by Ireland, the Union and many other countries, the region in question will expand enormously economically in the coming 20 years.  Many countries in north Africa are expanding at a rate of 6%, 7% or 8% per year.  Clearly, there is enormous potential in this regard.  When one speaks to those affected directly by the Irish aid programme and expenditure thereunder, one notes that they value the aid very much.  They commend the NGOs and the Irish Aid assistance programme.  I am sure they feel this way about other countries also.  We continue to keep on that path development.  It is in the interest of Ireland and the African peoples.  I am sure the Deputy supports that.</p>

From the replies to questions on the meeting with Prime Minister Cameron, we do not get a sense of any detailed face-to-face discussions on the European Union, for example.  Instead, we are hearing accounts of small encounters or encounters exaggerated by the Taoiseach's spin doctors; it seems the real work is left to others.<br><br>  At the weekend, the Taoiseach made a seemingly strong statement demanding that Germany and other countries keep to his understanding of the June deal.  This had more than a hint of <i>The Skibbereen Eagle</i> about it because, in reality, the Taoiseach indicated he had serious bilateral talks with leaders of only one of the three countries implicated in the statements of last week.  The Taoiseach met the Chancellor well over a year ago.  Since June, there has been no sense of there being any engagement with any leaders on the EU issue and the follow-through from the June meeting.<br><br>  Did the Taoiseach discuss with Prime Minister Cameron the ongoing eurozone crisis?  Did he endeavour to enlist support for Ireland's position on the separation of bank debt from sovereign debt?  Did he discuss the European position thereon?  He stated last week in the House that he felt his only role is to attend and speak at the summits.  It is time to end that policy and have a series of substantive bilateral talks with the countries that matter in respect of following through on the June meeting, including Finland, Holland and Germany.  He should keep pushing our case because it has been drifting since June.  We know what has happened.<br><br>  What was Prime Minister Cameron's perspective on the European Union?  Was there any sign of change in terms of his having opted out of the important negotiations?  Was there any sense of his becoming more involved or coming back within the fold?  While we welcome the bilateral funding from the United Kingdom, made available some time ago, we must acknowledge a very important issue arises in terms of the role of the United Kingdom in the unfolding eurozone crisis and the resolution thereof.  The United Kingdom could have a significant role to play and could offer significant support for Ireland.<br><br>  Very little has happened over the past year and a half on any of the issues pertaining to the North that we discuss here week in, week out, be it the Finucane case or the prisoners in Maghaberry.  We are receiving the same replies week in, week out, and one does not have any sense of a new initiative.</p>

<!-- Snippet ref: U00200 type: 1 --> <a name='U00200'></a> <p><span class="speaker">The Taoiseach:</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=&HouseNum=&MemberID=580"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Enda Kenny"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=580&pid=EndaKenny&year=2012&month=10&day=02"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Enda Kenny"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N4'>I disagree fundamentally with Deputy Martin when he says that we have a reluctance to engage on any substantive issue about the EU.  He is aware that not only did I introduce the opportunity to report to the House before European Council meetings, but also after.  The Deputy's question reads: "...asked the Taoiseach the matters he raised during recent contacts with Prime Minister Cameron."  I have answered the question for Deputy Adams, who has tabled three questions.  Deputies Higgins, Boyd Barrett and Martin each have one question.  The last occasion when I met Prime Minister Cameron face to face was as a result of his inviting me to attend Downing Street at a meeting he had called during the course of the Olympic Games to deal with the issue of hunger and under-nutrition in Africa.  There was nothing else on the agenda but that.  There was no opportunity to raise matters such as Northern Ireland, the EU, the eurozone, financial transaction taxes, the relationship between Ireland and England or sterling versus the euro.  That is the situation.</p><p><a name='N5'>  I am quite prepared to have discussions here about the EU as often and as long as Deputy Martin wants.  Suffice it to say that every Minister who goes abroad on EU business has a full programme and sees it through fully.  The Deputy is aware of the intense level of negotiation that has gone on between Department of Finance officials and others with their counterparts in France, Spain, Germany and so on, the Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF.  The Deputy is aware of the Minister for Finance following through with his counterparts in Paris, Rome and Berlin before he went to the informal meeting in Cyprus.  I also reported to the House last week on my own direct meetings with Prime Ministers Samaras, Rajoy and Monti.  We fixed a date for a meeting with President Hollande.  Tomorrow, I have a meeting with President Barroso of the Commission, President Van Rompuy of the Council and other leaders who are there.  These discussions will obviously centre around the eurozone crisis and our priorities for the Presidency, which will reflect dealing with that crisis.  As I told Deputy Adams earlier, I discussed a range of issues with Secretary of State Villiers this morning in regard to Northern Ireland.</p><p><a name='N6'>  It seems as if Deputy Martin thinks that I should spend my time travelling around Europe.  I am much more interested in results.  The last big result was on 29 June when the Council of the Heads of Government decided to break the link between sovereign and bank debt, that Ireland's debt sustainability issue would be looked at and that we would get equal treatment.  Commissioner Rehn, who has been very supportive, has said that he would like to see that completed by the end of October.  I do not think that is feasible, but what I am interested in, and what the Minister for Finance is taking very skilfully down the line, is getting the best deal for the Irish people and the Irish taxpayer in this regard.  I will say that very clearly during the course of face-to-face meetings tomorrow, including with Mr. Barroso, and to the other leaders when I meet them at the next European Council meeting, as I did last week.</p><p><a name='N7'>  Deputy Martin seems to think that we should be travelling all of the time and having meetings.  We have a very big team in the permanent representation and Ministers engage directly with officials on a constant basis.  I would like to think that we could have a conclusion to this, but it is not that simple, as the Deputy is well aware.  The difficulty is compounded by electoral prospects in other countries, which are always part of this mix, as the Deputy is well aware.</p><p><a name='N8'>  The interpretations that can be put on the future of the banking union, whether it should be on a stepped approach for the systemic banks in the first instance or all of the banks together, and other issues are for discussion.  They arise from a very clear decision that was made.  The statement last weekend merely reiterates the fact that the Heads of Government made a very clear decision and I want to see that followed through and concluded.  What it means is that the link would be broken, banks could be recapitalised directly by putting a structure in place to do that, this country's capacity to meet our debt repayments would be reviewed and, in the context of deals for others, Ireland would get equal treatment.  That is the decision and that is what I want to see implemented, as I am sure Deputy Martin does.  While I am sure that elements - the promissory note and the sustainability of the bank debt - can be very technical and complex, the decision as a foundation is very clear and we want to see that followed through.</p>

The same applied in the case of Greek Prime Minister Samaras, who spoke to us at some length about the current position in Greece, the pending assessment of the troika, what the Greek Government proposes to do in respect of the latest programme of reductions in current spending in Greece, and the latest analysis of how the Union might react to this.</p><p><a name='N3'>  The Deputy should tell me if he believes those face-to-face meetings with prime ministers are not worthwhile, as I certainly found them worthwhile, and so did the leaders.

Perhaps that should have been an opportunity to ask slightly broader and deeper questions about the priorities in the world and how well governments are dealing with the issues facing humanity.  The Taoiseach would probably agree that big international events like that allow us to think about what is happening in the world and for humanity.</p><p><a name='N58'>  The import of Deputy Higgins's question is whether the Taoiseach, Prime Minister Cameron and the others attending the summit questioned why we have such an extent of hunger in the world, when the hunger is evident in a world of plenty.  We do not have hunger today as we did 300 years ago because there is not enough food in the world.  The irony is that millions of people are starving and go hungry when there is more food in the world than the world's population could possibly eat.  Therefore, leaders like the Taoiseach, Prime Minister Cameron and other European leaders must consider the issue of the fair and civilised distribution of food, wealth and resources in our society.  Our economic system is failing disastrously in that regard and moving in precisely the opposite direction.  Rather than moving to greater equality and better distribution, it is moving the other way.</p>

It is in that context that the financial transaction tax arises.  It was proposed specifically to deal with the impact of globalisation and the unequal distribution of wealth, including world poverty.</p><p><a name='N61'>  The Taoiseach has met Prime Minister Cameron, the major objector to a financial transaction tax in Europe, so why did he not challenge him on the issue?  Why does the Taoiseach not publicly challenge Prime Minister Cameron and offer leadership and example by stating that it is a moral and humanitarian imperative for Ireland and Britain, Europe as a whole and the world to impose some kind of tax on the enormous wealth of financial and multinational corporations?  They have all the wealth while millions of people in the world starve and go hungry.  Why has the Taoiseach not offered leadership on that issue rather than simply using excuses such as that Britain's objections mean we cannot do it or we must wait for others to act?</p>

There are reports clearly indicating a loss of up to 15,000 jobs in the European Union if a financial transaction tax were imposed.  That is a matter of opinion.  There are other countries in Europe with a very strong objection to a financial transaction tax.  We object to this on the basis of it being discriminatory, and if it had a severe impact on our economy, it could be disastrous.  If it were applied in a global sense, we could have a very different perspective.  Our membership of the European Union and eurozone allows in some cases for those who want to pursue the area of enhanced co-operation to do so.  We have indicated that clearly while arguing the issue at European Council meetings.</p><p><a name='N63'>  At the meeting in Downing Street during the course of the Olympic Games, which dealt with hunger, under-nutrition and malnutrition, there were contributions from a number of representatives from African non-governmental organisations, as well as African leaders.  They reported on the activities ongoing in their individual countries and suggestions for dealing with malnutrition in that sense.</p>

I made the suggestion that because we will hold the Presidency of the European Union until June of next year, and the British Government will hold the presidency of the G8, we should co-operate at both those leadership levels to further pursue proposals to deal with hunger elimination, malnutrition and under-nutrition.  I found the conclusions of the meeting in that regard were very satisfactory and we will build on that during the course of our Presidency with our British colleagues who will have the presidency of the G8.</p><p><a name='N3'>  The contribution made by the double Olympic champion, Mo Farah, spoke for itself.  As a refugee from Somalia, he noted the appreciation and consequence of the food aid programme, the efforts to eliminate hunger and deal with the malnutrition and under-nutrition were very strong.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett is aware, the European Union has the strongest and most comprehensive food aid programme in the world, and Ireland has been an outstanding contributor to many causes over the years.  We are at 20% in terms of the spend of our Irish Aid programme on the elimination of hunger, malnutrition and under-nutrition and the Tánaiste has confirmed that we will maintain that.</p>

I know many of the people who avail of the service on a constant basis and they appreciate the excellent and reliable service of those operators that has been in place in the area over many years.<br><br>  Last week, Councillors Sean Smith and John Paul Feeley spoke to me about the need to outline clearly to Bus Éireann and to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport the absolute anger of the local community at this further attack on rural Ireland.  Not alone does this service facilitate people from west Cavan, but many others availing of the service are from south Leitrim and south Fermanagh.  People of all age groups use the service, including students, workers, elderly persons and people needing to travel to Cavan General Hospital or to Dublin hospitals.  Councillor Smith detailed to me the exact difficulties that will be faced by so many people who spoke to him in recent days, who need this public transport and who are not in a position to hire taxis.  Many individuals do not have immediate family members to bring them to hospital appointments or on other necessary journeys.  Individuals and representatives of different groups have spoken to the local newspaper, <i>The Anglo-Celt </i>, and to the local radio station, Northern Sound, outlining the major setback this practical cessation of these services will mean for so many families.<br><br>  To my knowledge, the route has attracted good customer numbers over the years.  Indeed, a proposal was put forward by Ballinamore Community Council to extend the service.  Such an extension of service would provide a direct route to Dublin for a large part of County Leitrim as well as for that important part of west Cavan and south Fermanagh.</p>

I want to record my condemnation of the decision by Bus Éireann to withdraw completely the bus transport services from the towns of Elphin, Roosky and Dromad.  I also echo the comments of Deputy Brendan Smith regarding the provision of services in Ballinamore.  It makes no sense, in time or distance travelled, to change either Route 22 between Ballina and Dublin or Route 23 between Sligo and Dublin from the current route that services these towns to the route proposed by Bus Éireann, with two weeks notice.</p><p><a name='N4'>  Services cannot be removed completely from communities.  We are told the public service obligation, PSO, does not cover this decision, but we are also told the National Transport Authority, NTA, has responsibility to allocate funding under the PSO.  Surely it makes more sense for the NTA to provide financial assistance to Bus Éireann to continue to provide these services to the communities involved rather than remove a service completely.</p><p><a name='N5'>  These communities lost their local hospital in the past 14 months and are now to lose the alternative bus service to the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar which could help to provide an alternative for hospital appointments.  We were promised a streamlining of the budget of more than €200 million for rural transport and the PSO, along with funding for HSE non-emergency transport and school transport services.  That streamlining has not been done although it could provide savings and assistance to Bus Éireann, not only to continue to provide existing services but to enhance them.  We are also told there will be a tendering for bundles of services which could include profitable and non-profitable routes.  That has not happened either, although it could help to address this situation and provide a service to the communities involved.</p>

I ask the Minister or Bus Éireann what savings will be made by the bus taking the new route.  It is nearer to travel from Charlestown via Carracastle to the N4 than the proposed new route.  The new route will increase the distance travelled.  I have been contacted by a number of people who use this service and who do not have transport to the nearest pick-up points in Charlestown or Ballaghaderreen.  They have said that there was no consultation on these changes.  I am asking that the changes be deferred until the communities are consulted and provided with an opportunity to increase the usage, if that is a problem.  We all understand that savings must be made.  I would like to hear the Minister's response to this question.</p>  
<!-- Snippet ref: Z00400 type: 1 --> <a name='Z00400'></a> <p><span class="speaker">Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Leo Varadkar):</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=&HouseNum=&MemberID=2192"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Leo Varadkar"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=2192&pid=LeoVaradkar&year=2012&month=10&day=02"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Leo Varadkar"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N8'>I thank the Members for raising this important issue.  First, it must be stated that I have no personal or ministerial power when it comes to bus routes and route frequencies operated by Bus Éireann.  The provision of bus services and the routes they take are operational matters for the company management in conjunction with the National Transport Authority, NTA, which is the licensing and regulatory body for public transport.  However, as the Government is the sole shareholder in the CIE companies, the re-design of this and other Bus Éireann routes is something of which I am aware and in which I am interested, so I have made inquiries with the company on the matter.</p><p><a name='N9'>  Bus Éireann operate a mix of services. Some of these services are commercial.  These include school transport and Expressway which competes on the open market with private operators.  The company also operates public service obligation, PSO, services.  This PSO payment is made for the company to carry out important and necessary bus services which would not be viable were they to rely on commercial revenue alone.  Expressway services do not receive a subsidy, either directly or indirectly.  Bus Éireann's services are not as direct as their competitors and, due to that and the recession, Expressway has lost passengers and revenue as customers have opted for private providers who operate a faster service by bypassing smaller population centres. In order to gain competitiveness and achieve a break-even position, Bus Éireann had to re-design its Expressway services.</p><p><a name='N10'>  I appreciate that changes to the bus services will inconvenience some passengers.  Given the financial position that Bus Éireann and the CIE companies are in, however, there is no alternative for the companies but to ensure that commercial operations operate on a commercial footing, and that means following the routes that most passengers want.</p><p><a name='N11'>  Rural transport is a critical component of public transport services and it is vital for the development of a fully inclusive society, both from a social and economic perspective.  In January last, the Government approved new arrangements for the development and implementation of integrated local and rural transport services.  It was decided that the NTA would be assigned national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the rural transport programme, RTP, and this has been effective since 1 April 2012.  This new role for the NTA coupled with its existing national remit for securing the provision of public passenger transport services will enable the development of better links between local and rural services and scheduled bus and rail services. This is something which is fundamental to a wholly integrated transport network.</p><p><a name='N12'>  Local integration working groups have been established in some areas while in others RTP groups have been working informally with potential partners to identify transport integration opportunities.  Work has commenced on the inclusion of the RTP services in the national journey planner and on the inclusion of RTP and school transport services in reviews of public transport services being undertaken by the NTA in the South-Eastern Regional Authority area, in the Border, Midland and West area and in the South and Mid-West area.  Consideration of RTP services in these reviews will serve to highlight transport needs and offer opportunities for integration.</p><p><a name='N13'>  The integration process is set to achieve the efficiencies required in the face of the challenging fiscal climate in which the country finds itself.  Some of the challenges involved in the integration process are quite complex, involve multiple players and involve matters not always within our control.  Integration can deliver a more complete and cost-effective transport service in local and rural areas that better meets the transport demands of all users.</p><p><a name='N14'>  As I have indicated, Bus Éireann must ensure it meets the customer demand for limited stop services with quicker journey times in order that Expressway services are commercially viable.  Failure to react to this market demand would result in a loss of Expressway services altogether.  I appreciate the concerns of Deputies with regard to the impact on certain passengers arising from the re-design of certain Expressway routes and I have asked the chief executive of Bus Éireann to meet Oireachtas Members and brief them personally on the changes to services in the north-west.</p><p><a name='N15'>  I will also direct the NTA, in its ongoing reviews of the PSO services, to take account of those places that will no longer be served by commercial services.  It should be noted that future cuts to the level of subvention for PSO public bus services will limit the scope for any new or additional services.</p>

I recall the Minister speaking eloquently and properly in Enniskillen about cross-Border co-operation and the real progress that has been made in the province of Ulster, especially since the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.  The route I have spoken about is Enniskillen, Swanlinbar, Bawnboy, Ballyconnell and on to Cavan.  The service is part of south Fermanagh and it has the potential to service an even bigger area in south Leitrim, as Deputy Naughten agreed, as well as west Cavan.  Bus Éireann said in a reply to local media that it was due to low customer usage, but it refused to detail the records about the numbers travelling.  To my knowledge, that route is very well used in the area.  The reply given by Bus Éireann is unacceptable.</p><p><a name='N3'>  I appreciate the Minister making arrangements for Members of the Oireachtas to meet the chief executive of Bus Éireann but will the Minister put a direct request to Bus Éireann on my behalf that this route be considered a public service obligation?  It is an addition to the Dublin to Donegal Expressway service.  If necessary, we could avail of a very small amount of the large public funding that is given to Bus Éireann.  Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal do not have access to rail services but I have read recently of new rail services that are not being utilised being provided in counties where there are both bus and rail services.</p>

I cannot see the justification for a situation where all the bus routes being developed are to bypass communities across the middle of the country.  Services are being withdrawn in communities throughout the midlands.  It appears to be a case of Expressway services from one side of the country to the other and forget about the people in the middle.  I estimate that approximately 20,000 travel passes are being misused either fraudulently or otherwise each year.  That is a significant amount of revenue lost to both Bus Éireann and the Exchequer.  Surely it makes far more sense to focus on that than on the communities involved in this case.  Does the Minister not agree that the provision of bus shelters along many of these routes would increase the number of people using the services?  Bus Éireann has failed to consider the provision of bus shelters along many of these routes.</p>

I ask him to instruct those executives to tell us what savings are being made through the withdrawal of certain routes.  As I stated with regard to the Carracastle route, Bus Éireann will be travelling farther with the proposed new route.  Also, will he instruct the executives to outline what alternative they will provide for people who have no other form of transport aside from public transport in those rural areas?  I appeal to the Minister to instruct the executives to defer this decision until more consultation takes place.</p>

I realise this is extremely inconvenient for the 20 people or so affected but there are probably as many people, if not more, who are not using this service because of the route it currently takes.  That is the type of decision Bus Éireann must make when providing a commercial service.  The chief executive officer of Bus Éireann met the Wicklow and Wexford Deputies today about a similar issue, and I will use my offices to ensure the Deputies meet the chief executive officer and senior management directly to discuss this.  The Deputies know the area and the local issues far better than I, and ultimately Bus Éireann is the decision maker in this regard.</p><p><a name='N7'>  Expressway services do not receive any subsidy from my Department.  Therefore, I do not have the power to instruct the company to defer or change its decision.  Solutions can be found, however, albeit partial solutions.  There was a similar issue in the midlands a few weeks ago and it was possible to identify public service obligation, PSO, alternatives for people.  They might not be able to get the bus they wish but they can at least get a PSO bus to somewhere that is served by an Expressway service.  In another case, it was possible to give a licence to a private operator on a no-subsidy basis to provide a feeder service to a bigger town where passengers could then take the Expressway service.  They might not be able to get it in the town in which they live, but they at least have a service.  Those are the types of options that can be explored.</p><p><a name='N8'>  On Deputy Naughten's question about fraud and travel passes, that budget comes from the Department of Social Protection.  There is a working group of officials from my Department and the Department of Social Protection examining those issues.  Given the scale of the deficit and the losses occurring across the CIE companies, like the budget we must do in December it will not be a case of either-or but a series of measures, including fare increases and service reductions, that will be required to allow us to continue to have public transport in the State.</p>

In that context, it makes sense to award any State work available, where possible, to people on the live register.  While I accept the guidelines issued by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to returning officers throughout the country advise that consideration be given to unemployed people, it is clear from past experience that these guidelines, weak as they are, are being largely ignored and flouted.<br><br>  Many of our returning officers have not even set up websites, although there is a common website format available to them.  Of those who have, only a few have application forms available for election work.  To my knowledge, none of these returning officers has made any attempt to advertise the fact that people can apply for these jobs.  If a person is motivated enough to find these secret jobs, what happens next?  The applicant fills in a form which asks for contact details and a personal public service, PPS, number.  The only other information actively sought is an applicant's current employment status and whether they have worked previously in the role.  There is a blank section to fill in other details but the form does not specifically ask about work experience, qualifications, information technology skills, administration skills and so forth.  Why would our returning officers not seek this information from prospective employees?<br><br>  I believe this so-called application process is largely a worthless and cosmetic exercise and that the jobs will be filled the same way they always have been, from the ranks of retired civil servants and the student children of those who are in the know.  I do not believe I am being cynical in saying this.  At least the returning officer in Wicklow, for example, is honest enough not even to pay lip service to this farce.  A message on the Wicklow website about the employment of polling and count staff, dated 20 September 2012, states:<ul style="margin-left:20px">All jobs are offered first to people who have worked successfully with me in the past.  Due to a nationwide revision of the number of voters assigned to each polling station, there will be fewer stations in this constituency for future polls.  There are fewer jobs available and a surplus of experienced staff.  For the moment, therefore, I will not be accepting any new applications.</ul>  This is a disgrace and must be rectified.  The generous payment on offer to polling clerks and count centre officials could make a difference to a child's Christmas for an unemployed family, whereas for a retired civil servant on a State pension it means Christmas in Lanzarote.  I know which I would prefer to prioritise and I hope the Minister will agree with me and introduce transparent and rigorously enforced requirements for the hiring of election staff, beginning with the forthcoming referendum.</p>

Within that framework, local returning officers are responsible for all matters in connection with the actual conduct of elections and referenda, including the selection, appointment and training of polling station staff in accordance with the relevant provisions of electoral law.  To assist returning officers, the Department issues guidance to them in advance of each election and referendum.  In that guidance, it is emphasised that the smooth conduct of polls is dependent on maintaining a cadre of sufficiently skilled and experienced people.  Having regard to the overall objective of the smooth conduct of the polls, returning officers are advised to employ competent and efficient persons as polling staff.  They are also asked to give consideration, wherever possible, to employing suitable persons who are unemployed.</p><p><a name='N11'>  The approach taken in the Department's guidance strikes the right balance.  However, I agree with Deputy Nash that it might not always have been the case that it was implemented in the spirit in which the guidance was issued to the returning officers.

We are in a time of national crisis and we as Government have always attempted to prioritise the needs of the unemployed or underemployed.  As I said earlier, €400 would mean a world of difference to those experiencing unemployment.  It would help to pay the mortgage or for groceries and bills.  We must use every opportunity and tool at our disposal to ensure those who are unemployed get the opportunity to earn a few extra euro to help with those bills in these difficult circumstances.</p><p><a name='N5'>  We all appreciate the work carried out by polling clerks and count centre staff.

The training is rudimentary but those who go through it gain a lot from it, along with access to local authority staff and returning officers.  It gives them a unique opportunity to engage in the democratic system so it is vital we use every tool at our disposal to ensure returning officers in the upcoming referendum on 10 November, in so far as is practicable, employ as many people from the live register as possible and at subsequent polls.</p>

I understand the presiding officer must have a greater level of training and supervisory experience to run a poll smoothly but the post of poll clerk does not require a lot of training and the responsibilities of the post can be fulfilled under the guidance of the presiding officer.

I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this issue.  My predecessor, the former Deputy P.J. Sheehan, used the oft-quoted line that there would be nothing left in west Cork but bachelors, briars and bullocks.  I am returning to that theme today, particularly to the issue of briars - I am not that concerned about the bachelors or bullocks.  The former Deputy used to refer to the briars shaking hands in the middle of the road and I am here to inform the Minister that in many cases in west Cork, the situation has got worse since it was first brought to the attention of the House by my former colleague.</p><p><a name='N8'>  The current position of Cork County Council according to a recent reply is that it is not in a position due to resource constraints to patrol all roadside hedges and issue notices on a systematic basis.  Nevertheless, notices are regularly issued, particularly when a specific problem is brought to the attention of staff.  It is an objective of the roads directorate to follow up assiduously on any cases of non-compliance with such notices.</p><p><a name='N9'>  Essentially, if a person reports to the council that a particular landowner has overgrown hedges, the council will issue the landowner with a notice but those who are out walking or driving do not have the wherewithal to write down each landowner's details.  It goes against the grain for many people to report on their neighbours or to set neighbour against neighbour by writing to the council seeking legal directives for people to cut their hedges.  Under the law the Roads Act 1993 passes responsibility for this duty to the landowner but the council undertook this practice until 2009 and maintained the roadside hedges.  Since 2009, it has abandoned that duty and left it to the law to take its course.  The reality, however, is that the system is not working.  To be fair to rural dwellers, when we canvass such areas, they do not make many demands of their elected councillors, and I have had the privilege of running in two local elections, but one issue of annoyance to them is that of overgrown hedges and I am anxious councils would take on board the responsibility to deal with this.</p><p><a name='N10'>  I live in the real world and I am not looking for Exchequer funding but I ask the Minister to speak to his officials and come up with a national policy whereby the Department would take the lead in the matter and instruct the councils to be more proactive.  At a time when we are trying to achieve a greater level of compliance with the household charge, and people in rural areas have in general paid the charge with no difficulty while making few demands of the council in return - they do not get waste services or water - one issue that is very important to them is that the hedges are trimmed.  People have shown goodwill by paying the household charge so a greater policy response on behalf of councils would go a long way towards addressing this problem rather than the abandonment that has taken place to date.  As matters stand it is a matter for individual landowners and if they are reported, the council will follow up.</p>

Under the Roads and Road Vehicles (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2007 all remaining matters pertaining to the Roads Act 1993 were transferred to the Minister with responsibility for transport.  Consequently, this matter is one which comes within the policy remit of my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Perhaps the Office of the Ceann Comhairle might take note of that.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has a wide range of functions related to roads, including the legal framework for the provision and maintenance of roads, funding of the roads programme and promotion of road safety.  The Department states that its overall objective is to provide, within the framework of a balanced and integrated transport policy, for the safe, efficient and cost effective movement of persons and goods by road.  Specific objectives include those to ensure, as far as possible, the provision of a safe and efficient network of national, regional and local roads, and to ensure the optimum and safe use of the public road network.</p><p><a name='N14'>  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each road authority.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the road authority.</p><p><a name='N15'>  It is also the case that section 70 of the Roads Act provides that the owner or occupier of land must take all reasonable steps to ensure that a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation on the land is not a hazard or potential hazard to persons using a public road and that it is does not obstruct or interfere with the safe use of a public road or the maintenance of such a road.  Where a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation is a hazard or potential hazard to persons using a public road, or where it obstructs or interferes with the safe use of a public road, a road authority may serve a notice in writing on the owner or occupier of the land in question requiring the preservation, felling, cutting, lopping, trimming or removal of such tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation within the period stated in the notice.</p>

Were the figures to be broken down, the Minister would find them to be highly impressive.  Notwithstanding that, I do not appreciate being pushed around from one Department to another, of being obliged to deal with the intricacies of the matter and of trying to find out who is responsible.  I wish to bring the matter to the attention of the House and in particular, to the attention of the Executive running the country at present to get it dealt with.</p><p><a name='N4'>  I would greatly welcome an opportunity to have an input into the scheme proposed by the Minister.  I proposed such a scheme to the previous Administration numerous times, when I referred to the social employment scheme and the number of people who were willing to partake in community projects and who would love to have something for which to get up in the morning but who unfortunately do not have a job to attend.  Consequently, I would be anxious to see something like this because ultimately, an area like west Cork relies heavily on tourism and on the appearance of the countryside.  In addition, there also is a leisure, health and safety aspect and while people are being encouraged to walk, it is not possible on many roads.  Consequently, at a time like this of disappearing revenues, which many Members appreciate and understand, one can be creative, imaginative and more proactive in one's determination to get more for less.  Basically, this is what I seek in this regard.</p>

The scale of the problem was identified and at least 10,000 home owners are in ownership of what essentially are valueless properties.  At the time, the Minister assured Members the stakeholders involved, namely, the insurance industry, the construction industry, banking, HomeBond and so on were being given until the end of September to come up with solutions to fund the remediation works and to this problem and that if they did not do so voluntarily, he would impose a solution on them.  It is now 2 October and I note that last week, the Construction Industry Federation's spokesperson, Tom Parlon, was highly voluble in stating that he, as a spokesperson allegedly for the stakeholders, has no solution to this problem.  Consequently, the ball is firmly in the Minister's court with regard to telling Members the status of the fund to implement plan B, as he assured them at the start of the summer.  Moreover, I might add this is required now both because of the failure of the stakeholders and because the State cannot shirk its responsibility for its role in this scenario.  I refer to the fact that evidence existed for decades about the problem of pyrite in other countries such as Britain and Canada, as well as in the geological formations of the land around us.  In addition, the fact the building regulations were changed in December 2007 and the HomeBond structural guarantee was changed in 2008 is indicative that both these schemes were defective and deficient in the first place.  The State stood over a lack of regulation, a lack of testing and an inadequate guarantee system through HomeBond.  Therefore, the State must take responsibility now.  These home owners cannot wait any longer and a long-overdue requirement now exists for the Minister to tell Members from where the fund will come and what is the plan B to finally solve this problem.</p>

Slightly more than 10,000 homes were identified, 850 of which needed immediate attention and repairs.  I note this does not include paths, streets or even some of the boundaries.  There may be many thousands more, as problems with pyrite may not become manifest until later.  This is not to mention the local authority housing projects, schools and community buildings in which pyrite has been discovered but which are not mentioned in this report.  It is very disappointing that the agencies, including HomeBond for the insurance industry, the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation and even the Law Society of Ireland did not engage with the Minister or his Department.  I note HomeBond would not even engage with the committee as set up and some of the aforementioned bodies would not even engage with the pyrite action groups set up to pursue this matter.  It is not good enough to state it is not the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and that it is a private matter.  While this happened to private houses, there is an onus on Members to deal with this matter.  There is an onus on the State, on the Minister and his Department to deal with this problem because people's homes are falling apart.  Some of those affected are in negative equity and some have huge mortgages.  The living standards of people have gone downhill and many are suffering from depression and other side-effects.</p><p><a name='N8'>  I also wish to flag the plight of five families in my constituency who are living in caravans at a site in Finglas.  They are waiting for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to provide funding to repair their houses, which contain pyrite.  While they await that funding, I appeal to the Minister to look into this matter because these people have spent two years in these caravans in the most appalling conditions and this cannot be allowed to continue.</p>

However, I believe the State has a role and a duty to assist home owners to find a resolution to the problem.  This was one of my key objectives in setting up the independent pyrite panel, on which Deputies Clare Daly and Ellis have been briefed on a regular basis by those involved with the panel.  Indeed, the panel follows the same theme in its report, identifying the State as having an important role in ensuring that responsible parties engage constructively in processes to deliver solutions for home owners.  I note there are not 10,000 homes which are ready to fall down but that 850 require urgent remediation.  The panel's report identified 10,000 home owners with a potential liability for pyrites.  The cost for the remediation of pyrite-damaged dwellings must fall on those responsible and I welcome the report of the panel, which has a clear view on this matter.  It was unambiguous in its view that the parties with direct or indirect responsibility for the pyrite problem should face up to their responsibilities and provide solutions for home owners and that the State is not responsible for the pyrite problem and consequently, not liable for the cost of remediation.</p><p><a name='N12'>  On receiving the pyrite report in June and reflecting on the panel's recommendations for stakeholders to provide solutions to home owners, I immediately began a series of discussions with the stakeholders with a view to securing a voluntary industry-led solution for home owners.  I asked the stakeholders to give urgent consideration to the relevant recommendations in the report and revert to me with their proposals by the end of September.  I have received responses from all the stakeholders in the last couple of days and am now in a position to give urgent and careful consideration to the content of these responses.  I am not in a position at present to give a considered view but seek a few more days in which I will be in a position to read those responses in great detail to ascertain whether any meaningful input into the resolution of this problem has been given to me by the stakeholders.</p><p><a name='N13'>  I previously made it clear that in the absence of workable solutions from the stakeholders, I will consider an imposed solution along the lines recommended in the pyrite report.  Recommendation No. 14 in the report recommends the establishment of a resolution board, which could be funded by the construction, quarrying and related insurance sectors.  I do not believe it is a sustainable viewpoint that the taxpayer should be made liable for the costs associated with the remediation of pyrite-damaged dwellings and the panel noted its report the potential for those responsible readily to pass responsibility to the State.  It would not be appropriate to allow this to happen.</p>

Moreover, the figure probably is far in excess of 10,000 and many more than 850 require immediate works.  In the same way as the Government and the Housing Finance Agency took over bad loans from county councils, there is a precedent for the State providing money upfront and then going after those responsible.</p>

If he is trying to tell us that the CIF has come in with something different from what Mr. Tom Parlon has said, then we would be very grateful to hear that.  If the response is as outlined by him on the airwaves, then the Minister has a serious problem because the State is responsible for standing over poor building regulations, inadequate insurance and bad standards.

If we need to consider levies to get the money from the different industries and agencies, it will take a long time to accumulate through that method.  Therefore we definitely need to put the money up front.  I am concerned that we might need legislation in dealing with some of this.</p><p><a name='N6'>  We have seen something similar with the IMF and EU when it comes to interpretation.  Will this be backdated?  We do not want to get into an argument that this only applies from now and not retrospectively and I hope that does not happen.  I also hope measures will be introduced to deal with this in the future with proper monitoring and proper accountability by all the industries concerned.  We need to have a way of keeping an eye on this.  We have not had accountability, which is something we need to address.</p>

This is a relatively short technical Bill, with 20 sections in total.  The Bill proposes to amend the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 to provide for the enhanced and effective functioning of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and the registration boards established under the Act.  It will also amend the Act to better provide for the assessment and recognition in Ireland of qualifications obtained outside the State and to ensure compliance with the relevant EU instrument.</p><p><a name='N27'>  The 2005 Act provides for the establishment of a system of statutory regulation for designated health and social care professions.  The regulatory system comprises a registration board for each of 12 designated professions, a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system, and a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters.  These bodies are collectively known informally as CORU.  CORU is responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals in Ireland.  It promotes high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among the registrants.</p><p><a name='N28'>  The Health and Social Care Professionals Council was established in 2007.  Its functions include the governance and co-ordination of registration boards and the provision of administrative support and secretarial assistance to registration boards and their committees.  Although the annual cost of running the council is currently being funded by the Exchequer in the main, the intention is that the regulatory system will, in time, be fully self-funding through the annual fees payable by registrants as is the case with all other health professional regulators.</p><p><a name='N29'>  The following 12 health and social care professions are designated under the Act: clinical biochemists; dietitians; medical scientists; occupational therapists; orthoptists; physiotherapists; podiatrists; psychologists; radiographers; social care workers; social workers; and speech and language therapists.  In addition, the decision of the previous Government to rationalise the Opticians Board into the Health and Social Care Professionals Council will see another two professions, optometrists and dispensing opticians, being regulated under the Act in 2013.</p><p><a name='N30'>  Under the Act, I, as Minister for Health, may designate other health and social care professions if I consider it is in the public interest to do so and if the specified criteria have been met.  I am conscious that some professions, currently not designated, made a case to be regulated under the Act.  However, my immediate priority is to proceed with the establishment of the registration board for the professions designated under the 2005 Act.  Then and only then can consideration be given to the registration of other professions.  That is not to say that work cannot be ongoing in that regard.  To date two registration boards, the Social Workers Registration Board and the Radiographers Registration Board have been established.  The Social Workers Registration Board has established its register, has held elections, and has made the necessary by-laws on education and training qualifications.</p><p><a name='N31'>  The board has also adopted a code of professional conduct and ethics, which was subject to public consultation.  When the statutory transition period ends two years after the establishment register next May, the professional social worker will be fully regulated under the Act.  The Radiographers Registration Board will soon be in a position to open its register and commence its two-year transition period.  This will also facilitate the commencement of the fitness to practice provisions of the Act.  The Act provides for grandparenting - a transitionary period of two years during which existing practitioners must register on the basis of current specified qualifications.  After this only registrants of a registration board, who will be subject to the Act's regulatory regime will be entitled to use the relevant designated title.</p><p><a name='N32'>  While progress in establishing all 12 registration boards has been slower than expected, this is due in the main to unforeseen legal technical and resourcing issues.  However, the learning obtained in establishing these two registration boards has been immense and is informing the work under way on the establishment of a further four registration boards before year end.  These are occupational therapists; speech and language therapists; dieticians; and physiotherapists.  The remaining boards in respect of those professions designated will be established by 2012.</p><p><a name='N33'>  In line with the Government's decision on transparency in board appointments, my Department sought and received expressions of interest from professionals and laypeople for appointment to these boards over the summer months by public advertisement via the public appointments system.  My intention is that these boards will be established in coming weeks with the exception of the physiotherapists registration board which would be closer to year end.</p><p><a name='N34'>  The Bill has three main purposes.  The first is to amend the Act to allow the Minister for Health to continue to appoint professional members to the council until each of the registration boards has been established in respect of the 12 professions designated under the Act, has held elections and is in a position to nominate one of its elected members.</p>

These relate to items such as fees payable to members of the council, registration criteria and the updating of fines for offences under the Act.  </p><p><a name='N3'>  I will now briefly explain the technical difficulty that has arisen with the appointment of professional members to the council.  The Act provides that the council consists of a chairperson and 24 ordinary members, with each of the 12 registration boards nominating one of their elected members for appointment.  As is usual in such cases, because no registration boards will have been established, the Act empowers the Minister for Health to directly appoint these 12 professional representative members.  The phased establishment of the 12 registration boards and the resulting lapse of time have, however, meant that in the absence of registration boards which can then nominate council members, professional representative members cannot be appointed to the council to fill the vacancies arising from the completion of the terms of office of the original members.  Currently, 12 professional members are attending council meetings in an observer capacity with my consent so that the perspective of the professionals can be maintained.  This is an interim measure.  Those attending do not have voting powers and cannot fulfil the requirements of a quorum.  The Bill, therefore, proposes an amendment to the Act to allow the Minister for Health to continue to appoint professional members to the council until such time as the registration boards have been established, have held elections and are in a position to nominate elected members for appointment to the council.</p><p><a name='N4'>  The Bill also takes account of the provisions of Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications, which was enacted following enactment of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  This directive is an internal market measure aimed at facilitating the free movement of persons within the European Economic Area, EEA, space.  While health professionals are the largest single professional category availing of its provisions, the directive applies to any regulated profession.  The Department of Education and Skills, in light of its role in qualifications, has overall responsibility for the directive in Ireland.</p><p><a name='N5'>  Deputies may be aware that discussions are currently taking place at EU level to modernise the directive.  These are expected to conclude during the Irish Presidency of the EU.  It is necessary, in the meantime, to give effect to certain aspects of the current directive in this Bill.  The directive makes it easier for qualified professionals, including certain health and social care professionals, to practise their professions in European countries other than their own, while providing appropriate safeguards to ensure public health and safety and consumer protection.  This means that applicants' qualifications and post-qualification work experience are assessed to ensure that they meet the qualification entry requirements to that profession in Ireland.</p><p><a name='N6'>  As qualification recognition is the first step in a statutory registration process, it was always the policy intention that the registration boards would assume responsibility for the qualification recognition function under the directive.  The Bill, therefore, provides that each registration board will be designated as a competent authority under Directive 2005/36/EC for its designated profession.  Currently, the Minister for Health is the competent authority for most of the health professions designated under the Act and qualification recognition currently is for the purpose of eligibility for recruitment to the publicly-funded health sector.  The introduction of statutory registration will mean that all persons with non-Irish professional qualifications who seek to exercise their profession in Ireland must have their non-Irish qualification recognised under the directive.  The amendments contained in the Bill will also provide a legal basis for the assessment and recognition of qualifications obtained outside the State, which are outside the scope of the directive, namely, the non-EEA qualifications of EEA nationals and the qualifications of non-EEA nationals.  The Bill provides that the processes for the assessment of these qualifications are the same as provided for under Directive 2005/36/EC, including the provision of explicit appeal mechanisms.</p><p><a name='N7'>  The main provisions of the Bill can be summarised as follows.  Section 1 sets out that the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 is the principal Act.  Section 2 inserts a number of definitions into the principal Act.  Section 3 provides that the Minister for Health will continue to appoint representatives of the designated professions to the council until such time as all registration boards are established and are in a position to nominate elected members.  Section 4 provides a legal basis, when the council is self-funding, for payments to members of the council and its disciplinary-fitness to practise committees, subject to the approval of the Minister for Health and with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Section 6 permits each registration board to prescribe certain practise and training requirements for professionals who have not practised for a designated period of time.  </p><p><a name='N8'>  Sections 11 and 13 increase the maximum fines for offences committed under the principal Act.  Sections 15 and 16 provide for some changes in relation to &quot;grand parenting&quot; and in respect of the use of professional titles during the transitional period in which practising professionals may apply for registration.  Sections 17 and 18 give the Minister the power to appoint members of the council and registration boards for a period of up to four years rather than the current fixed term of four years.</p><p><a name='N9'>  Amendments are also proposed to the principal Act in sections 5 to 12, inclusive, and 14 and 15 to provide for the assessment and recognition in Ireland of qualifications obtained outside the State.  Section 5 inserts a new section 27A to provide that, when their registers have been established, registration boards will be designated as competent authorities under Directive 2005/36/EC, empowered to act as competent authorities for their designated professions under Directive 2005/36/EC and empowered to assess qualifications obtained outside the State, which are outside the scope of this directive.  This section also provides for necessary transition arrangements in relation to applications under the directive.</p><p><a name='N10'>  Section 6 amends section 31 to provide that a registration board may make by-laws relating to procedures for the assessment of professional qualifications, training, experience, aptitude tests or adaptation periods of applicants for registration whose professional qualifications have been obtained outside the State and are outside the scope of the directive.  Section 7 amends section 38 to update and simplify the approved qualifications criteria in section 38(2) so that there are three categories: Irish qualifications; qualifications approved under Directive 2005/36/EC and other qualifications; and to insert new definitions and remove others no longer necessary.</p><p><a name='N11'>  Sections 8, 9 and 10 relate to procedures and appeals for non-Irish qualifications.  Section 12 relates to the use of title in the provision of services on a temporary and occasional basis.  Sections 14 and 15 amend the registration process for existing practitioners to comply with the processes of Directive 2005/36/EC, which provide for the assessment of formal professional training and post-qualification professional experience.  Section 19 provides a minor clarifying amendment to the list of optional qualifications required by an existing practitioner-radiographer in order to register during the transitional period.</p><p><a name='N12'>  This Bill will enable the health and social care professionals council to continue to fulfil, in a more effective way, its objective, namely, to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among registrants of the designated professions.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

However, one would be obligated to recognise the qualifications of medical and care professionals of that state even though one's ability to check out the individuals may be somewhat diminished.  In such a situation it is very important to have oversight and monitoring at EU level of directives passed by the Council and European Parliament and transposed by member states.  I am not necessarily concerned about this with regard to the Bill but it may arise in future.</p><p><a name='N3'>  Previously, we spoke about Indian and Pakistani doctors coming here.  It is important we welcome them and that they are treated with dignity and respect.  Unfortunately, this has not always happened.  In certain cases they were put up in boarding houses and given less than what I would consider appropriate accommodation.  It took some time to assess their qualifications and competencies and in the meantime they were left in limbo.  We wanted and welcomed them, but when they arrived we were unable to deal with them in the manner to which they were entitled.</p><p><a name='N4'>  If oversight in any member state or country is questioned or diminished in any way, it brings into question the integrity of everyone who comes from there.  We must ensure, therefore, that any country, inside and outside the EU, which provides excellent professionals who come here to dig us out of a hole, so to speak, engages in monitoring to ensure the continued integrity of those who are welcome here and that people cannot question the suitability of individuals.  This can happen if the robustness of oversight, training, education, qualifications and standards is diminished.  For all these reasons, this is a critical aspect of the directive, the broader internationalisation of medical professionals, and the transfer and freer of movement of people and services throughout the European Union.</p><p><a name='N5'>  Not necessarily related to the Bill is the issue of the PIP implants.  Who is responsible for medical devices?  The Irish Medicines Board is not responsible.  We are told the European Union has an oversight role.  At the same time, women throughout Europe who had received the PIP implants which were made of low-grade industrial silicone-----</p>

The point I am making is that people are entitled to protection against fraudulent use of material which is then put into a person's body.  The difficulty is that while the Irish Medicines Board may have oversight within the State, if something happens outside the State, people may have difficulty seeking redress afterwards.  In fairness, the Minister and the Department responded in a very humane and passionate way when the issue arose to address the concerns of the many women who received the implants.  However, there is no form of redress for the many people who were implanted with industrial grade silicone.  The implants were approved in Germany or somewhere else at some stage - the company was in France but I believe the patent was German - after which they arrived in Ireland.  The Minister, the chief medical officer and others moved swiftly to try to address the concerns of these women, but we cannot pursue anyone and it will be very difficult to seek redress for the fraudulent use of silicone.</p><p><a name='N8'>  With European integration comes obligations for the European Union.  It is fine to agree a directive and for member states to transpose it into national law, but oversight is very important and it must be supported at European level in terms of resources and cost.  It is unacceptable that a situation such as the PIP implants can arise or that a member state could have diminished ability to oversee the domestic competency of qualifications, training and education.</p><p><a name='N9'>  The Minister stated four councils will be established by the end of the year and that others will be rolled out.  Considering the medical and care professionals included in the scope of the Bill, it is important we have oversight and that the councils are established to ensure proper training, education, qualification assessment and continual monitoring.  The Bill deals with high level qualifications including clinical biochemist, dietician, medical scientist, occupational therapist, podiatrist, physiotherapist, psychologist, radiologist, social care worker, social worker and speech and language therapist.  The difficulty we have had in recent years is recruitment and attracting highly qualified people in the various professional categories outlined in the Bill to work in Ireland.  Now our highly trained professionals are beginning to drift abroad to seek opportunities in other countries.  This is a disturbing development.  We all say the fees, salaries and remuneration of general practitioners and consultants should be addressed, but we must be conscious of encouraging people to enter these professions and keeping a percentage of them in the country after they are trained for our own health and social care services.</p><p><a name='N10'>  We welcome the experience that people gain and bring back when they go abroad, and high-end professionals will always move in and out of the country.  However, we have a difficulty if there is only one-way traffic and everyone is moving out.  The Department of Health, the HSE and the various professional bodies which oversee their membership must be very conscious of this and monitor it to ensure the people who go abroad and gain experience bring it back to this country.  During the 1980s the most able people drifted away and it caused difficulties.  They returned in the 1990s and the first decade of this century and had a major impact through bringing new ideas and procedures, especially in medicine.</p><p><a name='N11'>  I will not delay the House much longer.  The establishment of the various oversight councils is to be rolled out and I would like the Minister to make a commitment that this will happen.</p>

People may sometimes have a view that there could be a conflict of interest in self-assessment, self-regulation and self-monitoring.  I believe the legislation is robust enough in terms of ensuring that is not the case and that, in general, there is no major conflict.</p><p><a name='N3'>  The Health and Social Care Professionals (Amendment) Bill before us is a follow-on from the 2002 report entitled Statutory Registration for Health and Social Professionals: Proposals for the Way Forward and the 2005 Act that flowed from it.  In bringing this legislation to the Dáil, which is an obligation, we continually upgrade the oversight of health and social care professionals in every way to ensure it is flexible in dealing with the changing environment that exists.  We should ensure there is flexibility, opportunity, oversight and strong regulatory powers in terms of sanction if there are breaches of professional conduct or what can flow from an internal inquiry which may find a person to be in breach of professional conduct.  That is critical but what is as important is that if there is a view held by the State or individuals that there is no proper oversight or disciplinary procedures by one of the quora, there is a mechanism in place for the State to step in and have a fully independent inquiry if there is a serious breach by a individual professional under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 and the amending legislation.</p><p><a name='N4'>  It is important to do this to give people confidence and belief in the quality of the people providing health and social care.  Deputy Ó Caoláin has raised this issue numerous times, such as, for example, the Dr. Neary case and many others that have flowed from that.  That, in itself, is an issue of concern.  We had the debate in this House on symphysiotomy and there was all-party agreement.  People will debate the rights and wrongs of symphysiotomy but there are many whose lives have been destroyed because of this barbaric act.  We heard at first hand stories that were very emotionally told and felt by those who listened to the impact it had on their lives.  I am not saying that the people who carried out symphysiotomy were doing something that was illegal at the time.  However, when there is clearly an evolving technology and change of practice, it is important there is continual training and re-evaluation of what is considered the norm in medicine and social care.  Let us be quite clear, many practices carried out in psychiatry for a number of years would now be considered almost barbaric.  There has been a changing and evolving ethos about how we deal with people with mental health and psychiatric issues and in general medicine itself.</p><p><a name='N5'>  It is for those reasons that there is an obligation on the various quora under this legislation to ensure that, as the Minister referred to, there would be training, continuing evaluation, upskillling and professional development.  We see it in many other areas and I believe it should be in the medical and care profession as well.  What can very often happen is that individual professionals are very competent and eminently qualified but may not continue to evolve and train themselves in the most up-to-date techniques, procedures and thinking in whatever profession they are involved in.  That can have disturbing effects for people down the road.  I have cited a number of cases, with symphysiotomy being the very obvious one.  This was practised in this country up to the 1970s, after which it was considered to be a procedure that should not be visited on anyone except in the most exceptional circumstances.  Even at that, there was a strong body of medical evidence in this country, across Europe and especially in the UK that it should never be used and that a caesarean was the way to deliver a child if there were huge difficulties in delivery.  We have had discussions on this issue and I am not sure whether the individuals said this was the right procedure based on the ethos of the hospital or a religious ethos or whether they just did not continually upskill in the most modern techniques and changes in practice in the medical profession.  The same is true of social care and psychiatry, with the move from institutionalisation to dealing with and treating people in their immediate home and community environment.  That is very welcome but there are still people within the professional community who would say that perhaps we might look at that again.  Continually training and upskilling and continuing personal development are very important in the quora overseeing the qualifications of people.</p><p><a name='N6'>  Those are my thoughts with regard to this Bill before us and the 2005 Act.  In other fora over the years, I have raised the issue of how oversight and governance at European level should be resourced at European level and the need for a centralised system to ensure all countries play by the same rules in respect of scrutiny of professionals' training and qualification.  This is something about which I feel very strongly because all we need is for one or two people from other countries to be found not to be eminently qualified or to have done something wrong in their professional conduct and straight away it will be used by bigoted people and racists to undermine people who are here for a good reason, namely, to assist us in the delivery of our health care.  This is why I have always said, as I did at the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, that people who have come from abroad are welcome and must be welcomed with open arms and that we must insist on the highest standards, not just for ourselves but for their integrity in order that people would have absolute confidence in them.  If not, the sinister element in society could jump on a particular incident and use it to further their own narrow-minded, bigoted agenda.</p><p><a name='N7'>  I welcome the Bill and hope the Minister moves expeditiously in establishing the various councils of the professions and that we would continually upgrade and monitor things to ensure there are additions and the ability to add quora to oversee varying professions.</p>

We are told in the explanatory memorandum that the Minister has been unable to appoint professional members to the council on the completion of the terms of office of the 12 members appointed when the council was first constituted.  We are told this was due to &quot;unforeseen circumstances&quot;.  In the interest of clarity, I ask that the Minister explain those circumstances.  We should have a detailed explanation of the reason he has not been able to proceed as initially intended.<br><br>  This Bill is being introduced in very different times from those that saw the principal Act introduced.  In 2004 and 2005, the years in which the Health and Social Care Professionals legislation was processed in the Oireachtas, there were unprecedented opportunities to transform health services and create a truly equitable and efficient system.  Instead of availing of them, there was bureaucratic change, with the establishment of the HSE.  The two tier system remained firmly in place and was reinforced by the privatisation policy of the former Minister, Ms Mary Harney, and the rest of the then Government.  We are now in dire economic straits.  Cruel cuts are being imposed by this Government on public services and the privatisation policy remains in place.  What does this mean in practice?  It means that a system that should be wholly designed to allow patients to receive the best care and to allow health and social care professionals to provide that care is instead built around the HSE bureaucracy and the private profit motive.<br><br>  The system values professional expertise more for the profit it can generate than for the good health outcomes it can help to bring about.  As a result, our public health services are short in all of the 12 professions listed in the Bill.  Public patients struggle to gain access to the expertise that is readily available.  It would be readily available only if access were assured.  The recruitment embargo denies patients access to timely care and qualified young people the opportunity to work.<br><br>  The speech and language therapy profession is one of those listed in the Bill.  Let me quote from a letter, dated 29 May 2012, from the Irish Association of Speech &amp; Language Therapists to the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, a paper I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, reads given her roots in a certain part of the island.<ul style="margin-left:20px">There is huge demand for speech and language therapy for adults and children in services across Ireland.  There are significant numbers of unemployed fully qualified therapists.  The recruitment embargo has meant that services cannot recruit for vacant posts and few new posts are being created.<br><br>Some graduates are working in volunteer positions and these can vary in terms of content.  These can provide excellent opportunities for skills maintenance and professional development.  However, they are not equivalent to working as an autonomous speech and language therapist under professional supervision and are not considered under the competencies framework for full membership of the professional body. <br><br>[T]here is both a supply of qualified, highly skilled therapists and a demand for their services, but in the current situation there is a gap between the two, such that children and adults wait unacceptable durations for access to the fundamental human right to communicate.</ul>That is a very measured, thoughtful and accurate description of the reality faced by health professionals and patients today.  This reality is not peculiar to speech and language therapists.  We can all relate to it because I am sure every Deputy in this House knows of examples of children and adults with special needs who have not received the professional speech and language therapy they need.  It is shameful, especially in the case of children.  Children's most vital language learning years pass so rapidly that the system put in place by successive Governments fails to match patient need with professional service provision.  The same could be said of the other listed professions, including that of social workers.  We are very conscious of this in the context of the referendum Bill we passed in this House last week.<br><br>  I wish to raise the issue of cross-jurisdictional recognition of qualifications and cross-jurisdictional working of professionals.  That is addressed in sections 11 to 15 of the Bill which implement EU directives and are especially relevant to Ireland given the continuing existence of partition.  The North-South feasibility study on cross-Border co-operation in health care provision, which was carried out jointly by the two Departments, North and South, and on whose publication and content we had to wait for such a long period, addresses this issue.  I wish to cite the report extensively because I believe absolutely that there are powerful gains to be made and real progress to be achieved by turning around two back-to-back health delivery systems on this small island and having them face each other and work together in the common interest and good.  The study states:<ul style="margin-left:20px">  5.19 Both jurisdictions face significant challenges in terms of sustaining high quality, highly specialist tertiary services normally only provided in centres servicing large populations.  The availability of appropriately qualified and skilled staff for such specialist areas is key and for populations of either jurisdiction, the small number of hospital consultants providing care in these areas inevitably means that services are inherently vulnerable.<br><br>  5.20 In a number of service areas, increased sub-specialisation is evident and in newly developing services it is inevitable that the expertise will reside among a small clinical team.  For such highly specialised services the population based in either jurisdiction may not be sufficient to sustain a team of appropriately trained skilled clinicians and the longer term sustainability of a high quality service may only be possible if considered on an all-island basis.  Where patients have to leave both jurisdictions for treatment, the impact on individuals and their families is very significant in terms of patient well-being and accessibility for the family in sometimes very traumatic circumstances.  Combining resources for the provision of such services on a North-South basis makes sense.<br><br>  5.21 The development of new highly specialist acute and certain other services and the changing pattern of increased specialisation in existing acute services provides a unique opportunity for both jurisdictions to work together.  In principle, both jurisdictions should consider developing these services in a collaborative manner, particularly where low patient throughput makes it difficult to sustain highly specialised services and for health professionals to maintain their skills.</ul></p>

However, there are some obstacles to workforce mobility, which can be effectively dealt with provided there is a clear focus on tackling such issues.  These aspects include indemnity for staff working out of jurisdiction and mutual recognition of qualifications between professional bodies in both jurisdictions as well as registration and pension issues associated with working in both jurisdictions.<br><br>  5.47 While great progress has been made, further work needs to be undertaken to extend the facilitation of cross-border working for health and social care staff.  Furthermore access to an effective resource, which sets out procedures and protocols, to facilitate work across jurisdictions, would be advantageous.</ul>These recommendations are not from a Sinn Féin election manifesto, nor are they taken directly from the health policy that I anchored and published with colleagues in 2005 for my party.  I have just cited a jointly commissioned report.  For all the same and practical benefits that it recounts, I again commend to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to impact with her senior Minister, if that is at all possible, and to acknowledge this as an area of neglect.  There is little evidence of focused endeavour, North or South, to bring about the promise of such an agreed report.  However, a willingness clearly exists.  It is a significant step forward and should be seized in the interests of ordinary people the length and breadth of this island.  All that holds us back is a nervousness of a new step forward and a sense of ownership over whatever part of the island on which we live.<br><br>  At the end of the day, if the Minister and the Department do not take the initiative to give life to the promise of that particular report, including the section I have just cited on the record, it will be lost again and the report will be left to gather dust on a shelf.  I urge the Minister of State not to allow that to happen and to help ensure health professionals on this island can provide the best possible service to patients, which is what they are trained to do and is what the overwhelming number of them want to do.  It is the reward of their lives' choice that they get the opportunity to deliver their skills on a continuous basis and have the prospect of development within their chosen career paths.  I commend the report strongly to the Minister of State and I am happy to record that I will support the Bill.</p>

Ten of the disciplines have not been properly established on the council, yet the Minister has no power to extend the terms of the council's appointees.  Given the fact that the Health and Social Care Professionals Act was enacted in 2005, why have these disciplines not been properly constituted yet?  Not all of the period in question was a time of financial stress or cutbacks.  Since 2005, everyone has learned what can occur when there are regulatory failures.  The idea behind the council is to put proper regulation in place.  It is not just in terms of finance that we need regulation.  We need systems that can anticipate developments and work in co-operation with and deliver services to the public.</p><p><a name='N5'>  The explanation of &quot;efforts have been made&quot; offered by the Minister and the Bill's digest is anodyne.  What efforts have been made?  Has an onerous obligation that cannot be met been placed on the individuals coming forward?  Is there a campaign of not co-operating?  Why have the other disciplines not been established?  Do they view the council as unnecessary?  What dialogue has been held to determine why the council has not been properly constituted, something that has made it necessary for the Minister to intervene and introduce this legislation?</p><p><a name='N6'>  The disciplines in question, including occupational therapy, physiotherapy, psychology, social work and speech and language therapy, are the primary care areas with which we have been engaged for the past two weeks.  In many cases, the quality of the service they deliver, especially in the public system, depends on one's address.  Some parts of the country might have no waiting lists while other parts could have two year waiting lists.  Deputy Ó Caoláin referred to speech and language therapy.  There is a world of difference between diagnosing a three year old, delivering the therapy then and sending him or her to school at five years of age and making him or her wait two years for that therapy.</p><p><a name='N7'>  The option of a multidisciplinary approach is being missed because the council has not been properly constituted.  The commitment of the specialties must be questioned.</p><p><a name='N8'>  Although Deputy Ó Caoláin was referring to Northern Ireland and the Republic when he spoke of cross-jurisdictional matters, county boundaries being crossed is also an issue.  Children attending a special school in west County Dublin will receive speech and language therapy if they are from the area, but not if their addresses are in, for example, north County Kildare.  This is despite the fact that the same organisation is involved.  The systems failures have progressed past being regulatory.  They have to do with people's locations, the numbers involved and the architecture of the HSE itself.</p><p><a name='N9'>  The Bill is a modest measure to plug a gap, but it will not deliver a vastly improved service to those who need it, which is what is urgently required.  We cannot say that often enough.  The stupidity of the situation is that the five year old who starts school without having received therapy must be picked up by the education bill if he or she fails in school later.</p>

There is a certain element of economic stupidity about how this is handled and seen within a so-called silo philosophy.</p><p><a name='N3'>  I also wish to speak to the elements that are not included.  Perhaps they are not appropriate to this Bill but I should highlight them anyway.  For example, medical devices and the practitioners using them are not covered.  There was a significant failure in regulation with the PIP implant case, and in the US in 2000, a failure in the licensing system in France was identified with regard to the company in question.  The process involved the company being regulated by a German-licensed organisation.  The problem could have been identified much earlier if the published material had been picked up by the professions.  We can see how that played out for people.</p><p><a name='N4'>  The private clinic area, including those dealing with cosmetic surgery, is not taken in with these regulations.  Where there is a failure and no one to pick up the problems, the State ends up picking up the issue through the public health care system.  Regulation of areas not included in this measure is required urgently.  I understand the European regulatory system is being considered, although individual member states have been warned that this may take some time to flow through by means of directive and legislation.  It will be necessary to act on an interim basis in order that we can learn from those mistakes and ensure they are not repeated.  There is a similar case with invasive implants like DePuy's hip replacements, which have also failed.  These failures have caused individuals to have to endure pain and concern arising from another big operation.  This is one of a range of other areas that must be tackled through regulation.</p><p><a name='N5'>  I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on this when he wraps up the debate.  I share the concerns of Deputy Ó Caoláin about the Minister not being present.  I respect the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, who will give a report to the senior Minister.  Nevertheless, the Minister should have stayed in the Chamber to deal with this legislation and at least listen to the opening statements.  It is very important for the Minister to revert to us on these issues.  Not all of the problems occurred under his watch and the legislation dates from 2005.  It is important to understand what is going on and why there is disengagement by these professions.  The only person who can tell us is the Minister because he has been having the dialogue for the past 18 months.  It is vital that he tells us about the dialogue and why there has been a failure that prevented a board being set up without this sort of intervention.</p>  
<!-- Snippet ref: KK00200 type: 1 --> <a name='KK00200'></a> <p><span class="speaker">Deputy Mattie McGrath:</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=&HouseNum=&MemberID=2197"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Mattie McGrath"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=2197&pid=MattieMcGrath&year=2012&month=10&day=02"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Mattie McGrath"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N6'>I am delighted to be able to contribute to the debate on the Health and Social Care Professionals (Amendment) Bill 2012.  Although I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, I am also disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, left the Chamber so swiftly after making his opening speech on this Bill.  The Act has been in force since 2005 but the Minister has only been in power 18 months.  Nevertheless, we should have a proper debate and there are questions to answer.  The Minister should try to explain some of these issues.</p><p><a name='N7'>  The Minister indicated that the Act provides for grandparenting, or a transitional period of two years during which existing practitioners must register on the basis of current qualified specifications.  The Taoiseach, if he has the chance to appoint his next Cabinet, might insert a grandparenting clause to keep the likes of the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, under control so as not to allow what we read about every day in the Department to happen.</p><p><a name='N8'>  I compliment the new Minister of State, Deputy White, at the Department of Health but I also pay tribute to the former Minister of State, Deputy Shortall.  I served with her on the last Oireachtas committee dealing with social welfare and know her to be a tireless worker and advocate of the underprivileged.  She is a champion for fairness and equity.  She was forced into a position where she had to resign from office, which is both scary and disappointing.  The Taoiseach has already lost two Ministers of State in 18 months, which is a concern.  Nevertheless it is not my business but a matter for the Taoiseach to run his Government.  While I would not dare to lecture him on how to do it, a small bit of common sense and mutual respect would go a long way.</p><p><a name='N9'>  As I noted, this legislation is originally from 2005, when a system of statutory regulation was designated for health and social care professions.  We all know this to be badly needed.  The regulatory system comprises a registration board of 12 designated professions and also allows the Minister to make 12 appointments.  This begs the question as to why there has been a delay in getting these bodies up and running.  There is plenty of expertise and legal advice around so we should have been able to foresee whatever problems may have been down the road with this legislation, which is less than seven years old.  I know the Minister is only in office 18 months but the fact remains that the legislation has not worked, so I must ask why there is a delay.</p><p><a name='N10'>  Does this arise because it is part of the dysfunctional organisation of the HSE?  There are many thousands of excellent staff in the HSE, both office and front-line workers, including all kinds of health care professionals.  Nevertheless, there is a significant deficit and much baggage and administration, red tape and bureaucracy.  We must tackle that problem.</p><p><a name='N11'>  The bodies involved in this issue are collectively and informally known as CORU, and they are responsible for protecting and regulating health and social care professionals in Ireland.  CORU promotes high standards of professional conduct, education, training and competence among registrants.  That is something everyone in this House and the wider country wants and demands.</p><p><a name='N12'>  CORU covers some delicate areas, including biochemists, dieticians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, psychologists, radiographers, social workers and speech and language therapists.  Many of these people have made a career choice arising from career guidance and family or peer advice.  They have dedicated time in third level institutions, doing research and masters degrees, ending up in a highly qualified position after a massive cost to the State and the individuals or families, which may have struggled to help the people achieve the qualifications.  Deputy Murphy, on the other hand, referred to the people in many disadvantaged areas, waiting for treatment.  Every Deputy knows of many cases of people waiting for orthodontic treatment, speech and language treatment and access to many similar such services.</p>

That is a huge cost on the family and a huge social pressure on the individuals who badly need the treatment.  Whether it is speech therapy or dental treatment, they need it.  They were recommended by health care professionals to have it and they applied for it.  As was mentioned, some people have worked as volunteers.  There are many people waiting for such treatment and there is a high demand for it, but many of our highly qualified people are emigrating and we are losing that valuable resource to other countries.  Many of those people do not even work their chosen profession in the countries to which they emigrate.  It is a disgrace.</p><p><a name='N3'>  I said during the debate on the children's referendum Bill that it is pointless passing laws and amending this legislation if we do not have the wherewithal, the resources and, most importantly, the vision and the passion to follow through on these measures.  There is no point in amending Acts, putting them on the Statute Book and filling up the law libraries.  We must make sure we are able to provide for what we legislate.  I know we are in a deep dark recession but this legislation has been hanging around since 2005 and during the peak boom years of the Celtic tiger, but it is still not up and running.</p><p><a name='N4'>  I was interested to hear the research Deputy Ó Caoláin quoted.  On an island the size of Ireland and having regard to the peace process and people coming together, the Administrations in both parts of the island must come together, pool, unite and share expertise for the benefit of all the people.  This is still a small island even when one includes the populations of both jurisdictions relative to the size of our neighbours.  My late brother could not understand how we had 13, or whatever is the correct number, health boards at the time and Manchester where he was working, which had a population of 3 million had one body looking after this area.  When we consider many such cases, we can see where bureaucracy has got a grip.  The health boards were disbanded because we wanted openness, transparency and accountability but we got the gigantic monster that is the HSE and no job was lost at the time.  I am not blaming the current Minister for that but it happened and it got more unwieldy, entangled and bureaucratic and, worse than that, it operates at arm's length from ordinary people.</p><p><a name='N5'>  On the other hand, there are the private practitioners, some of whom are accounted for in the legislation, who have set up their own systems.  I go back to the time of Barry Desmond and I saw him in the Dáil trying to break the grip the consultants had on the public hospitals.  I have often said that if one is a veterinary practitioner, one must provide one's own specialist designated research, operating theatre and whatever.  Why should consultants have access to public facilities and beds if they are not playing ball?  Such access should be removed from them.  They should get their own house in order if they do not play ball, cutting out the waiting lists and work longer hours.  I cannot understand how there have been so many commitments to change this but it has not been changed.  It is the stark naked fact that big powerful lobby groups in this country are the tail wagging the dog and they are refusing to budge.  It is a long time since Barry Desmond - I think he is alive and well and I hope he is - stood in this House and as Minister tried to break that cartel and he failed.  Successive Ministers have also failed to do so but it must be broken.  What we, this Bill and all other legislation are about is service to our people and not to any particular sections or elite group of our people.  These people have excellent qualifications and worked hard to gain them and they must be recognised for having done that and paid appropriately but not for having a logjam and a closed shop.  We saw what happened with the pharmacists - young pharmacists could not become practitioners.  Now there is the issue of the price of generic drugs.  We have to deal with this matter.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Labour Party promised that they would deal with it but they have not.  It is not easy to do so: they cannot simply wave a magic wand and have it dealt with but they have to deal with it because the public are tired of it.  We are all tired of it because it has gone on for too long.  In the recession we must examine the pooling of resources North and South on this island.</p><p><a name='N6'>  We must not allow a situation where racism against foreign national practitioners could be encouraged.  They were encouraged to come here and we needed them.  Unfortunately, most of them were working junior doctors.  It was 18 months ago when the Minister, Deputy Reilly, embarked on a crusade abroad to recruit these people, whom I am sure were suitably qualified, but we found they were staying in bed and breakfast accommodation and all kinds of places and they could not operate.  There were queues for procedures.  I would not want anybody who does not have proper qualifications and certification working in our hospitals but they were recruited abroad to a set of standards, must have been interviewed and must have got the nod to come over here at great expense to the State, I might add, and then they were kept here in abeyance as if they were in some kind of quarantine.  Then we had to do some kind of a cleansing in respect of them before they could work.  It was horrible for those people to have been put in that situation plus the fact that we did not have them working at the front line where we needed them.  That was another case of bureaucracy gone mad.  I do not know who was keeping the door closed, keeping them out or did not want them here but that is what happened and it was not that long ago.  I am sure it will happen again but it should not happen.  Those eminently qualified people, regardless of their colour or creed, are entitled to work here and they have worked here.  We cannot discriminate against them because some people are anxious, as others have said, to jump on the bandwagon and discriminate and denigrate people because of their colour, race or because of where they come from.  That should not be allowed or contemplated anywhere.</p><p><a name='N7'>  Where does health and social care and the HSE fit into all this?  It is all about health and social care but that is not being meted out to ordinary people who are trying to access ordinary, simple, basic treatments.  In many cases when people get into the system they are very well treated but such access is not made available to many people.  It is the preserve of those who are able to go private and access the system.  I read in the newspaper today that VHI health cover will increase again.  The minute any changes affect these people they pass on the cost to the insurers.  We have to question the cost of treatments and bed nights in terms of insurance cover.  They are too high.  The rackets must be stopped.  The cartels must be broken.  Health and social care must be delivered to people.  It is part of their civil right under the Constitution.  That must be recognised and we must set out to deliver that.  The delay from 2005 to 2012 in getting this legislation up and running and the need for it to be amended now to enable its unfolding is patent nonsense because that should have been identified at the time the legislation was introduced.  I am not saying we are infallible but there are legal people who understand if there are legal pitfalls and blockages in the context of legislation.  If there are, there should be a back-up model in order that the blockages can be cleared and dealt with and the legislation, as enacted, can be put into practice.  It is all fine to hear pious platitudes but we must be mindful if there are various reasons legislation cannot be implement or is not workable.  Do we ever in the Oireachtas test if legislation is fit for purpose before we pass it?  That applies to all legislation.  One wonders if some legislation passed was ever tested to establish if what it proposed was sane, realistic or achievable or if it was all in deep chapters, which no one could unravel or implement.  I thank the Minister for introducing this legislation now but why is there a need for it and why did it take so long to introduce it?  Will he answer those questions?  I know the Minister of State might attempt to and that the Minister is not present.  I think he is one of the 11, like the Flight of the Earls, who will be flying off.  It is important to be prepared for taking over the EU Presidency.  I remember when I was on the opposite side of the House a few years ago Ministers being criticised for travelling abroad for St. Patrick's Day celebrations.</p>

The delivery of this registration process is central to ensuring those providing services under various professional banners are qualified to do so; the provision of their services is regulated by an appropriate authority, adequately equipped to ensure the patient receives a professional service and delivered by a person appropriately qualified to do so; and the delivery of that service is regulated by a reputable authority, which has the power to enquire into, and adjudicate on, contentious issues arising from the delivery of the service.</p><p><a name='N5'>  A total of 12 health and social care professions are designated under the original Act but only two have established registration boards and this is causing a delay in the delivery of this system, which seeks to safeguard the delivery of professional services from the targeted areas to the patient.  This scenario cannot be allowed to prevail and, accordingly, we must ensure this legislation, which empowers the Minister to make the necessary appointments required to bring effect to the system, is passed in the interest of delivering a safe and efficient care to the patients involved.</p><p><a name='N6'>  Registration with whichever of these 12 boards is applicable to the profession they intend to practice is required before the professional persons can use the relevant title and the original Act provided for the establishment of the Health and Social Care Professional Council, which would implement the Act and bear overall responsibility for regulation.  The problem has arisen whereby the Minister for Health has no provision to fill vacancies that have arisen in the remaining ten disciplines for which boards have not been established.  This is causing the system to stall and it is essential that this legislation be put in place and that there is no further delay in the implementation of this process, as the adequate registration of professionals and the establishment of a regulatory authority authorised to examine the qualifications of professionals offering their services and capable of ensuring those practising are qualified to do so is essential to the confidence of the public in the services offered.</p><p><a name='N7'>  We are becoming a more cosmopolitan society and, with the influx of people from other jurisdictions, it is imperative that we have this process in place in order that professional people who present themselves and offer their services can be appropriately adjudicated regarding their qualifications and their fitness to practise.  The Bill addresses the requirements of the professional's qualifications directive, Directive 205/36/EC, establishing rules for the mutual recognition of professional qualifications between EU member states and also provides for the recognition of qualifications obtained outside the EU.  This is such an important area that I fail to understand how the original legislation, which resulted in the appointment of the first council in 2007, still remains in limbo in 2012.  That is a gap of seven years and this reflects either complacency on behalf of those charged with the implementation of the legislation or an unwillingness on their behalf to implement it.  Whichever is the case, any further delay must not be tolerated and I commend the Minister on pushing ahead with this Bill to break the logjam.  I urge him to proceed speedily with the establishment of the registration and regulatory authorities provided for in the Bill and ensure that, on this occasion, those involved are not afforded the opportunity to frustrate the implementation of this system and that the safety of the patients is placed before professional sensitivities.</p><p><a name='N8'>  I have no doubt whatsoever that is what the Minister will do because bringing change to a health service that had become dysfunctional and incapable of delivering the service the public wants is a task that was bravely accepted and undertaken by him and he is actively engaged in it.  I am becoming weary of listening to those on the Opposition benches complaining every step of the way.  These departmental cuts were coming regardless of who occupied the ministerial chair because those on the Opposition benches, who are complaining, left the till open and let everybody help themselves.  They blew the money like drunken sailors and left their mess for the Minister to clean up.</p><p><a name='N9'>  Why was this legislation, which was passed in 2005, not brought into effect until the Minister came along?  Why is it necessary to introduce a new Bill in order that he be authorised to appoint new members to the ten professions that failed to adhere to the legislation?  It was not given effect because the Government that introduced the legislation comprised the same people who are attacking the Minister at every opportunity and who had a blueprint for dealing with the introduction of difficult or unpopular procedures.  That blueprint was to ignore them and to let those adversely affected by them ignore them.  That appears to be the only reason ten of the 12 identified professions failed to form registration boards.  They were simply allowed the indulgence of proceeding on their merry way, totally ignoring the 2005 legislation.  The then Minister did absolutely nothing about it.  That way of governing has no place in a modern democracy and the Government and the Minister of Health will take the difficult path - the path which wins few friends - that will deliver the change so badly needed in the way we deliver health care to those relying on us.</p>

Connaughton:</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&HouseNum=31&MemberID=2311"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Paul Connaughton"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=2311&pid=PaulConnaughtonJnr&year=2012&month=10&day=02"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Paul Connaughton"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N10'>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  As health and social care becomes increasingly specialised, it is only proper that professionals working in these areas are correctly registered and this is the rationale behind the Bill.  A few short years ago, only five professions were subject to statutory registration: doctors, dentists, nurses, opticians and pharmacists.  At the time, that was sufficient as that was the extent of specialisation within the profession.  However, as scientific knowledge increases, so too does the need for registration and among the health and social care professionals covered by the Bill are dieticians, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, psychologists, social workers and speech and language therapists.</p><p><a name='N11'>  The legislation will have the benefit of giving much-needed clarity to consumers wishing to purchase the services of some of these professionals.  For example, a person procuring the services of a speech and language therapist for a child can be assured that if he or she is registered with the necessary board governing that profession, that he or she have the proper qualifications and that those qualifications have been checked and independently verified.  Equally, if people let a social worker into their home or are engaging with a psychologist, they deserve to be assured that the person involved has achieved the necessary competence and that this has been independently verified.  The registration process will protect the public but will also protect the professionals involved in that proper entry requirements will be established and there will be a proper mechanism to oversee entry into the profession and ensure this is restricted to people who have the necessary qualifications.</p><p><a name='N12'>  At European level, the introduction of the professional qualifications directive set out the rules for recognition of qualifications between member states, an important consideration for the many professionals of Irish origin working abroad, and the Bill also provides for the recognition of qualifications obtained outside the State, which are outside the scope of the directive that was transposed into domestic law in 2009.  The fact that the boards established under this Bill will determine fitness to practise complaints for each of the 12 listed professions is another important consideration.  This was provided for in the 2005 Act, but had not commenced to date and the passing of this Bill will facilitate the speedy introduction of proper complaints procedures.  For students currently in second level education, greater clarity will be provided in terms of career paths as a result of the legislation because one of the functions of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council is the approval of education and training courses.</p><p><a name='N13'>  I am concerned, however, about the slow nature of progress to date in the establishment of the various boards.  For example, only two of the 12 registration boards proposed have been established.  The first of these, the Social Workers Registration Board, was appointed in August 2010 and the register for social workers opened in May 2011.  All practising social workers must be on the register by the end of May 2013.  A total of 2,700 social workers are expected to be on the register by the end of May next year and much work relating to this process remains to be done.</p><p><a name='N14'>  Another concern must be the payment of an application fee and, subsequently, of an annual retention fee.  This is a cost of going to work and should be recognised as such, perhaps with these fees being offset by tax credits.  The procedures involved in the appeals system must be fair and it is only right and proper that applicants for registration who are dissatisfied with the outcome have the right to appeal and the list of grounds for appeal are listed in the Bill.  I also welcome the fact that under the current Act, and also under the provisions of this Bill, applicants will have the right to appeal a registration board decision to the High Court to ensure their rights are safeguarded.  As medicine and social care becomes increasingly specialised, it is fitting that a proper system be put in place to recognise emerging specialties and ensure all professionals claiming membership of a particular medical or social care profession have their competence independently verified and have complaints against them arbitrated on by a professional and independent body.</p><p><a name='N15'>  I welcome the provisions of the legislation in the context of the clarity they bring to the use of the 12 professional terms listed and the safeguards they provide both to the professionals involved and the users of their services.</p>

The Bill proposes necessary technical amendments to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, which introduced a State regulatory regime for the designated health and social care professions not previously regulated.  The main purpose of the Bill is to amend the Act to allow the Minister for Health to continue to appoint professional members to the council until each of the 12 registration boards established under the Act has held elections and is in a position to nominate one of its elected members.  The 12 registration boards were established following the 2005 Act, which provided for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for 12 health and social care professions.</p><p><a name='N3'>  The system comprises a registration board for each of the 12 designated professions, a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system, and a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters.  In time, as each register completes its transitional period, only a registrant of a registration board will be entitled to use the relevant designated title.  The Health and Social Care Professionals Council was established in March 2007.  Its mission is to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence through statutory registration of health and social care professionals.</p><p><a name='N4'>  I have witnessed at first hand some of the great work carried out by carers throughout my constituency of Louth and east Meath.  Whether it is nursing, midwifery, occupational therapy or radiography, the standard of care provided in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda or Louth County Hospital in Dundalk is outstanding.</p><p><a name='N5'>  Social care is a profession where people work in partnership with those who experience marginalisation or disadvantage or who have special needs.  Social care practitioners work with children and adolescents in residential care, as I have experienced in the setting of St. John of God's, Drumcar, County Louth.  Other services include those for people with learning or physical disabilities, like the great work done by St. Brigid's Special School in Dundalk.  I have seen support provided to homeless people in Dundalk by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  I have seen people with alcohol or drug dependency being supported by the Simon Community in Dundalk and Drogheda.  Other organisations support families in the community and I have witnessed the support provided for older people by Older and Bolder in Dundalk and Drogheda.</p><p><a name='N6'>  To date, only two registration boards, the Social Workers Registration Board and the Radiographers Registration Board, have been established.  This is the difficulty the Bill addresses.  The current provisions of the Act do not allow for the Minister to make nominations for vacancies which have arisen subsequently, since the Act specifies that these should be elected members of, and nominated by, registration boards.  The Bill, therefore, provides that the Minister may appoint members to the council in various circumstances, including where a registration board has not been established or has not yet held an election.  This is one of the key benefits of the Bill and why I have no hesitation in commending it to the House.</p>  
<!-- Snippet ref: NN00300 type: 1 --> <a name='NN00300'></a> <p><span class="speaker">Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor:</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&HouseNum=31&MemberID=2284"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Mary Mitchell O'Connor"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=2284&pid=MaryMitchellOConnor&year=2012&month=10&day=02"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Mary Mitchell O'Connor"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N7'>New and innovative therapies are being developed and internationally recognised all the time.  I wish to draw attention to dance movement therapy, art therapy, drama therapy, music therapy and play therapy.  All of these therapies have merit.  As a former school principal, I have seen wonderful outcomes for children with emotional needs who have participated in play therapy led by qualified play therapists.  Any therapy delivered by professional therapists that cuts down on medication and improves quality of life must be welcome.</p><p><a name='N8'>  I have particular regard for music therapy, which I have seen used in the children's unit of our National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire.  Music therapy is based on the understanding that all human beings are able to respond to music, irrespective of disability or injury.  Music has always been a powerful tool of expression.  It can touch our emotions deeply and allows for a freedom of communication that needs no words and often no movement.  Music therapy is an evidenced-based profession.  A growing body of research demonstrates the benefits and importance of music therapy as part of rehabilitation treatment programmes.  Music therapy is the planned and intentional use of music-based methods to meet an individual's emotional, social, physical, psychological, behavioural and communication needs.  Irish music therapists works closely with other professionals within the interdisciplinary paediatric teams using music-based methods to facilitate the children to achieve their rehabilitation goals.  Music therapy is available as a core therapy in many international rehabilitation units and is an established part of interdisciplinary treatment within health, education and social care settings.</p><p><a name='N9'>  On 26 July I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health asking for statutory registration and recognition of these four therapies.  Many Irish people have invested years qualifying in these areas.  They have also invested significant amounts of money and they are professionals.  However, there are many other rouge traders, such as people presenting themselves as qualified dance movement therapists, art therapists, qualified drama therapists and music therapists.  It is confusing for people and leaves vulnerable people in a more vulnerable position.  The present position is unsatisfactory for our citizens and for the therapists.</p><p><a name='N10'>  The object of the principal Act associated with this Bill is to protect the public.  This will be achieved by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among the registrants of the 12 health and social care professions designated under the Act.  In the principal Act, 12 professionals are listed and, in time, only registrants will be entitled to use these titles and the public will have confidence in the professions.  This must be greatly welcomed.  The answer to my parliamentary question of 26 July, which asked for statutory recognition for dance, art, drama and music therapists, indicated that the Minister for Health has power to include them if he considers it appropriate and in the public interest.  When the regulatory frameworks in respect of the 12 designated professions are fully in place, I ask the Minister to incorporate these additional therapies - drama, art, dance, music and play therapy.</p>

It is very important that the designated professions are regulated.  I was closely involved in the debate on the original Bill in 2004.  My contribution is based on the debate that took place at that time in respect of one profession that was excluded.  The profession of psychotherapy and counselling was excluded specifically because the organisations involved in regulating the professions could not agree how it was to be regulated.  That was the sole reason for the exclusion and the Minister of State at the time, Tim O'Malley, accepted that they should be included.  He hesitated to include them while divisions existed among the various professional organisations on how to regulate.  He asked the professions to agree on an approach.  In 2008, the professions presented to the Minister a document on public protection entitled Submissions on The Statutory Regulation of Counsellors & Psychotherapists in Ireland.  Tomorrow, I will outline and develop the reasons psychotherapy and counselling are not regulated at present.  Anyone can practise and charge for psychotherapy or counselling in this country.</p>

It is the zombie-like drug addict we see on the streets or the alcoholic who is staggering home or falling off the bar stool, drunk.  The private face presents differently.  Not all addicts fit the stereotypes I have mentioned.  Addiction affects many people in our society.  For every person in addiction, at least six or ten other people are affected by it, often very seriously.  We know the economic cost.  It is more than &#8364;3 billion, considering the crime related and health related matters.  I move this Private Members' motion to bring this matter onto the floor of the House and to look at the scale of the problem, what is being done to address the matter and what is lacking in tackling these issues, and to ensure the issue does not end up on the cutting-room floor of the budget.<br><br>  It is also important to look at the changing nature of addiction.  We are now in the area of polydrug use of lethal combinations, including alcohol.  Services must be able to keep up with these changes in use.  Many of the statutory services are focused solely on heroin use.  We must also consider the use of the Internet in sourcing substances.  In acknowledging the scale of the problem, the point must be made that it is not confined to Dublin.  It is a national problem.  Alcohol was always there, but now the towns and villages of Ireland are seeing heroin, cocaine, head shop products and so on.  We must also consider other addictions, such as gambling, food, sex and the Internet.<br><br>  We know there is gangland crime.  It is one part of the problem.  The horrific recent killings, particularly in front of young children, were especially gruesome.  I hope the other aspects of addiction will get the same attention and resources as the gangs are getting.<br><br>  I am hoping for an honest, thoughtful and thought provoking debate.  The motion calls for addiction to be prioritised as a health issue and not primarily a criminal issue.  It is good to see drugs are now the responsibility of the Department of Health.  That is a positive step.<br><br>  Heroin first appeared in the late 1970s and 1980s in Dublin's inner city, where cynical operators and dealers targeted poor communities.  The drugs were dispensed like sweets until the teenagers were hooked.  I saw so many lovely young people taken over by heroin.  Their families were devastated and their communities held to ransom.  The lone voice of the late Tony Gregory brought the issue into the Dáil Chamber, where it was not taken seriously because officialdom had no real interest in tackling the issue then.  The flat complexes in the inner city were known as heroin supermarkets at the time.  Tony Gregory continued to make drugs a major issue in the Dáil and in Dublin City Council.  This debate is so that the issue will not be off the agenda.<br><br>  Currently, we are seeing a rise in heroin use.  It is interesting that it is coinciding with another economic depression.  Again, there are no geographic bounds.  At a meeting this morning we were told of increases in seizures of heroin for personal use and supply in Dublin city.  The European monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction places Ireland top of the table of EU countries for heroin use.  This is compounded by polydrug use, including alcohol use.<br><br>  We are also seeing an alarming emergence of grow houses in suburbia, in rural areas and in rented apartments.  It is not confined to poor communities.  The growers' expertise is considerable.  They are producing higher strength cannabis.  The main psychoactive chemical, THC, is several times higher in grow house skunk than in hash.  Project workers working with young people are concerned about this.  It is being confused with the more benign name of hash which, whether we agree or not, has a different effect on people.  I will not be like various Presidents of the United States or Ministers and admit to smoking the odd joint when I was in college.  I did not.  This is irrelevant, but I thought I would put it out there.<br><br>  I have seen the long-term effects of significant use of cannabis.  It is not good to see.  However, we should open the debate on cannabis use and look at the arguments for and against.  Ireland is the only EU country not to regulate the medical use of cannabis.  The Netherlands is looking at classifying this high potency cannabis with cocaine and ecstasy.  More young people are using skunk in Dublin.  At one of the projects young people talk about paranoia and panic attacks.  Other substances are mixed with skunk and young users, in turn, mix it with Benzodiazepine and alcohol.  There is great pressure on some drug projects because they are dealing with a broader array of drugs, rather than cannabis or heroin on their own.  There is also crystal meth, crack cocaine and tablets.<br><br>  It may be because the heroin epidemic began there that Dublin's inner city has become associated with drugs.  The response in the inner city has been remarkable.  We have excellent projects and services in the voluntary and community sector.  There is SAOL, Soilse, Chrysalis, HOPE and Crinan, to name a few.  They are taking on these challenges.  The SAOL project produced the Reduce the Use booklet which is being used in Ireland and throughout Europe.  There are other interesting initiatives on harm reduction.  I was at the north inner city drugs task force today.  I used to chair it when I was a teacher and I am now back as a public representative.  I listened to project workers talking about their work, how they are coping with funding cuts and with their terror of the effect of further cuts to front-line services.<br><br>  The late Tony Gregory once said, &quot;Follow the money&quot;.  That eventually led to the setting up of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, was Minister for Finance at the time.  It took the murder of Veronica Guerin to get people moving.  That is not good enough for all the other people who are involved in the addiction area.  In 2007, Tony Gregory also spoke about the middle rank of dealers, and called for a mini-CAB for those areas where young people see dealers with extravagant lifestyles and no visible means of income.  The motion calls for some of the assets of drug related crime acquired by CAB to go back into communities most negatively affected and used for treatment, rehabilitation, prevention, education and family support services.  The money could also be used to deal with the intimidation and fear that families must deal with because of drug debt.<br><br>  We know about death from overdose, lethal mixing and suicide.  We have innovative programmes that are seriously at risk of being cut.  I am talking about ASIST training, particularly for those dealing directly with vulnerable people.  Statutory agencies sometimes send people to do this training and then do not use it, while community projects whose workers would use the training might not have the funding for it.  Mindfulness also has a programme.  It is a proven strategy for those in recovery.  The Oasis Deora counselling centre in North Wall, Dublin, is one of the few that will deal with people in addiction.  So many programmes wait until people are in recovery.<br><br>  Between 20,000 and 50,000 are affected by hepatitis C but effective treatment is available.  We know that injecting drug use, especially the sharing of injecting equipment, is the leading risk behaviour for the transmission of hepatitis C.  The national strategy has set out a clear plan.  The Government amendment refers to the expansion of needle exchange services.  Will this include the provision of injecting rooms which are in some other cities but not in Ireland?  This is controversial, but we need that debate.<br><br>  We also need the debate on decriminalisation.  We need to have a reasoned debate looking at the research.</p>

With regard to the methadone protocol, methadone has certainly had a stabilising effect on drug users.  There is no doubt about that, but the problem is that people are being left on methadone for too long.  There is a need to address this.  It is much cheaper to have somebody on methadone than to have them in a rehabilitation or residential centre.</p><p><a name='N4'>  My final point is about the alcohol strategy.  A national substance misuse strategy was launched last February but the Government will have to take on a very powerful lobby, that is, both the drinks industry and the sporting organisations that accept sponsorship from the drinks industry.  We have seen all the problems and we know the facts and figures about the effects of alcohol.  I could use an extreme case.  We could ask one of the drug barons in Dublin, Cork or Limerick if they would like to sponsor an event.  We ask it of the drinks industry, which is also responsible for a drug.  It is a much more harmful drug at times because more people are dying from alcohol related illnesses than are dying from all the other drugs combined.</p><p><a name='N5'>  I will conclude as I do not wish to take time from the other Members in the Technical Group.  I will have more time to speak tomorrow night.</p>  
<!-- Snippet ref: PP00300 type: 1 --> <a name='PP00300'></a> <p><span class="speaker">Deputy Thomas Pringle:</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&HouseNum=31&MemberID=2324"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Thomas Pringle"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=2324&pid=ThomasPringle&year=2012&month=10&day=02"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Thomas Pringle"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N6'>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this motion.  I congratulate Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on drafting the motion and apologise to her for encroaching on her time.  She was in full flow and could have continued.  I also welcome the new Minister of State with responsibility for primary care, Deputy Alex White.  I hope he has a successful tenure, at least more successful than his predecessor.</p><p><a name='N7'>  This Private Members' motion is very important because addiction is a serious problem throughout the country.  I received a call from my local radio station today.  It related to just one phrase in the motion which refers to opening a debate on the decriminalisation of drugs.  I will address that issue later in my contribution.  It is a pity that this single phrase has been picked on by some Members on the Government side as the important message of the motion, because the motion covers all aspects of addiction.</p><p><a name='N8'>  The biggest addiction problem in this country is addiction to alcohol and alcohol abuse.  It is the number one issue in Ireland today.  In 2010 a HSE report estimated the cost of alcohol related problems at €3.2 billion annually.  That is a huge figure when one considers the costs of the HSE and the overruns it is dealing with at present.  Addiction, particularly alcohol addiction, is the cause of that financial cost, as well as further problems.  Alcohol related crime is estimated to cost approximately €1.2 billion every year.  We really have a major problem with alcohol and alcohol addiction in this country and it must be dealt with as comprehensively as possible.</p><p><a name='N9'>  In the case of alcohol related crime, 97% of public order offences are due to alcohol, according to the Garda PULSE system, while in over 50% of murders committed in this country the perpetrators had consumed alcohol.  For 76% of rape defendants, alcohol was a factor in the rape.  One can see it is a huge problem.  Financially, we must deal with it, quite apart from the cost to society and the cost to families and young people who are damaged and abused as a result of alcohol abuse.  One of the biggest problems with alcohol is its availability.  It is in every corner shop and supermarket.  We just cannot get away from it.  When I was young, parents complained about the fact that the sweets were always on display beside the checkout in the shops.  Now, it is the off-licence that is on display beside the checkout, to encourage people to buy drink when they are paying for their groceries.  We must deal with that.  The previous Minister was putting together proposals and hoping to put measures in place to deal with it, so I hope this Minister will continue that work.</p><p><a name='N10'>  We talk every day about the reductions in the health budget and the cutbacks that are due to take place in forthcoming years.  Consider that in the context of the cost of alcohol abuse at over €3.2 billion each year.  If we could deal with that and make real inroads, we could ease a great deal of the pressure on our health budget and have a more reasoned debate about it.</p><p><a name='N11'>  Drug abuse is a problem not only in the inner cities but throughout the country, including in rural areas.  There is a complete lack of support and services for addicts in rural areas.  There is a heroin problem in a number of areas in County Donegal, with many addicts in the local communities.  Indeed, over the last year or so there were a number of deaths related to drug use in rural areas.  Addicts in rural areas who wish to get on a methadone programme or who wish to deal with their addiction must wait six weeks for an appointment for a methadone programme.  They must then travel to Dublin to get approval to attend the methadone clinics.  That is unacceptable when drugs are available throughout the country.  Young people's lives are being destroyed from drug abuse and the lack of support services for them.</p><p><a name='N12'>  This motion proposes a number of actions to be carried out by the Government.  It calls for the assets seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, to be made available to fund drugs projects.  That is vital.  They should also be used to offset the cuts that are being imposed.  It calls for no further cuts to community employment, CE, schemes that are dealing with addiction services.  That must be implemented.  In the last number of weeks cuts have been made to child and adolescent mental health services in the HSE west area.  This means that young vulnerable people and the many families suffering as a result of alcohol abuse and addiction problems cannot avail of the services they require to help them to cope with their daily lives.  Those services must be reinstated to ensure young people will be able to cope and talk to somebody who could help them to live through their difficult situation.</p><p><a name='N13'>  It is vital that we have a debate on the decriminalisation of drugs in this country.  In 2002 Portugal decriminalised the possession of drugs for personal use.  Reports I have read show that this has reduced addiction and crime related to drug use.  We must have that debate and it must be done without hysterical reactions.  We must look at these models to see if there is anything we can transpose to Ireland which could help to reduce addiction.  Anything that would lower the level of addiction and the problems people have with it must be welcomed.</p><p><a name='N14'>  The motion is comprehensive and I congratulate Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on producing it.  It is vital that we maintain services as well as putting them in place.  If we could move away from a system of year to year budgets and think in the long term, we could make a real impact, reduce our costs and reduce the level of the problem in our society.</p>  
<!-- Snippet ref: PP00400 type: 1 --> <a name='PP00400'></a> <p><span class="speaker">Deputy Clare Daly:</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&HouseNum=31&MemberID=2296"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Clare Daly"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=2296&pid=ClareDaly&year=2012&month=10&day=02"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Clare Daly"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N15'>This is an incredibly diverse motion which contains some excellent ideas for dealing with addiction in Irish society.  In fact, any specific aspect of the motion could be a single motion in itself.  I will use the short time available to me to deal with drug addiction as it pertains to prisons.</p><p><a name='N16'>  Any meaningful policy for dealing with drugs must take a particular approach to prisons for a number of reasons.  First, there is the fact that crime is the central reason for so many drug addicts ending up in prison.  Obviously, the individuals themselves are victims.  In addition, on a purely economic basis, there are benefits to society in terms of saving money from ending a revolving door by dealing with the issue of addiction when people are caught by the system, as it were.  When people are taken out of society and incarcerated with plenty of time on their hands it should be an opportunity to rehabilitate them.  Instead, it is a training ground to get more people hooked on and involved with drugs.  Unless we deal with this issue, we are deceiving ourselves.</p><p><a name='N17'>  There are two issues involved.  The first is the number of prisoners who have addiction problems and end up in prison as a result.  A survey carried out on the psychiatric status of Irish prisoners in 2005 revealed that almost 60% of male prisoners sentenced had a drug dependency problem and 45% had an alcohol dependency problem.  Only 26% of sentenced prisoners did not have an addiction problem of any nature.  Other shocking surveys were carried out in the late 1990s and early in the last decade which showed that 21% of intravenous drug users first injected drugs while they were in prison.  Our prisons are introducing people to a life of drugs rather than dealing with the issues while prisoners are in prison.  This is despite the fact that there has been a huge shift in policy, with airport style searches being introduced since 2008 and a hard-nosed attitude being employed.</p>

That is an embarrassment when we look at the policy pursued by the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell.  It was based on increasing the resources to deal with searches and surveillance, amending the rules regarding visitors and contraband, mandatory drug testing, increased punishment for prisoners who were drug offenders and a much more hardline approach but the reality is that it has been a complete failure and we must now consider a different way to work.</p><p><a name='N4'>  It is completely wrong that we have a scenario where such resources are spent on security when we only have 24 full-time drugs counselling posts spread over 14 Irish prisons, with 4,000 Irish prisoners reliant on nine detox beds.  It is completely back-to-front.  I had the misfortune to spend a month in prison in the Dóchas centre ten years ago where I got to see at first hand many of the antics that went on and again the approach was the wrong way around.  While I was there a young woman was released, took an overdose and died that weekend.  It was a normal conversation in the prison.  This young woman had been in and out of prison all her life.  The prison wardens would report young people coming in and for a while they are getting steady meals, their skin is improving and they are starting to deal with their issues if they can keep them off the drugs.  Suddenly, however, they are back out into the same conditions on the outside that led them into addiction in the first place, they take a hit and end up dead.</p><p><a name='N5'>  We need joined-up thinking.  I was appalled that while I was in the centre, there was not a single counsellor to deal with all the issues, stresses and strains faced by those young women and mothers as a result of a life inside.  There was a hairdressing unit that could have taught them a skill that could get them a job when they were released but no one tried to deal with the training aspect of rehabilitation.</p><p><a name='N6'>  Every society that places an emphasis on rehabilitation in such places sees it work because it is not just illegal drugs that are the problem, it is the pro-drug culture that exists in the prison.  In 2010 we spent approximately €3 million on prescription drugs in the prisons.  When I was there I was the only person in the prison who was not on drugs of some sort.  People were either doing the illegal stuff or at night they queued for the tranquilisers and sleeping tablets that keep people sedated.  It was scandalous that this should have been happening instead of proper intervention.  We must look at this.</p><p><a name='N7'>  I fully support the idea being pushed by the Jesuits in particular about developing custodial treatment centres instead of sentencing, that people would agree to be sent to a treatment centre instead of a prison, perhaps with a reduced sentence on the basis that they get treatment.  It would cost a fraction of what it costs now, would stop the revolving door and society would win.  Unless we deal with this how we are deceiving ourselves.</p>  
<!-- Snippet ref: QQ00200 type: 1 --> <a name='QQ00200'></a> <p><span class="speaker">Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett:</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&HouseNum=31&MemberID=2285"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Richard Boyd Barrett"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=2285&pid=RichardBoydBarrett&year=2012&month=10&day=02"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Richard Boyd Barrett"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N8'>Like the other speakers, I pay tribute to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan for bringing this comprehensive motion forward and highlighting the many important issues it raises.</p><p><a name='N9'>  It is timely that such a motion should come forward because alcoholism and drug addiction, particularly heroin addiction, have blighted our society for many years.  We are now in an economic recession, with mass unemployment, austerity and cuts being visited in a serious and severe way on our society.  We are recreating the conditions which have given rise to these problems at a serious level since the 1980s, and even further back with alcohol.  We are now at a moment when we will create the conditions for all of these problems, which are already very serious, to get much worse if we do not take them seriously and deal with them in a sensible and rational way.  More lives, families and communities will be devastated by these problems if we do not ensure it does not happen.</p><p><a name='N10'>  We do not need to quote statistics, although there are many, to know of the enormous overlap between alcohol addiction and heroin addiction and issues such as poverty, homelessness, poor quality housing and high levels of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment.  We might add to that list the issues of suicide and mental illness.  All of these are complex, multifaceted issues but there is unquestionably a huge correlation between them all.  They must be dealt with if we are to make any serious effort to deal with heroin addiction, alcoholism or other forms of addiction.</p><p><a name='N11'>  It is no coincidence that the heroin epidemic first arose in this country in the 1980s during the last period of recession and mass unemployment.   It ravaged lives, families and communities and we are still dealing with the legacy of the problems that developed then.  Many of those problems have been passed down through the generations from parents to children and even to grandchildren.  If we made any headway in trying to deal with those problems, it was because the communities most affected by them, the families and the rehabilitated addicts themselves, fought back, demanded resources, set up community initiatives, worked through community employment schemes to cope with and manage those problems and forced some sort of serious policy response from Governments over the last 20 years to a point where we did not resolve the problems but we were beginning to get a handle on how to address them.</p><p><a name='N12'>  Now, however, there is a threat that all that work could be undone if cuts are imposed on CE schemes that provide counselling services, drug rehabilitation schemes and outreach services to young people who are vulnerable.  These CE schemes are holding together some of the most disadvantaged communities that are most affected by alcoholism and drug abuse and every cut to those services threatens to exacerbate the problem of heroin addiction.</p><p><a name='N13'>  It is rarely said, particularly about heroin, but there is an important distinction between heroin and many other drugs.  It is almost a misnomer to talk about heroin getting people high, as if it is a fun drug.  Heroin is a pain-killer; people take it to kill the pain.  It is more akin to tranquilisers and legally prescribed drugs, which are also about sedating people with serious mental health and other problems.  We must understand that it is the underlying problem of poverty, with many of those who have fallen into heroin addiction being the same people who went through industrial schools, sexual abuse and neglect and ended up in prison.  We must deal with the problems at the root cause.</p>

In addition, as previously noted, there must be a serious debate on decriminalisation, not in some sort of hippie way of thinking one should let it all hang out and let drugs be taken because it is cool but rather because criminalising the problem has not worked.  It does not work and one must deal with it as a serious health and social problem.  Moreover, one must ensure the provision of the resources and services necessary to deal with that problem and the underlying social causes, such as poverty and unemployment that create the conditions under which such problems can flourish.</p>  
<!-- Snippet ref: RR00200 type: 1 --> <a name='RR00200'></a> <p><span class="speaker">Deputy Joan Collins:</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&HouseNum=31&MemberID=2292"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Joan Collins"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=2292&pid=JoanCollins&year=2012&month=10&day=02"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Joan Collins"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N3'>As previous speakers have stated, this is an important debate and I thank Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan for tabling this comprehensive Private Members' motion.  As the budget will be announced within eight weeks of this debate and given the amount of kite flying that has been taking place in other areas regarding cuts, it is of particular importance to have a real debate on this subject over the next two days.  In stating the obvious, there is a massive crisis.  There must be urgent action on the part of the State and a real discussion on the problem because the measures taken thus far, while having some effect, really have made little progress or have had little impact.  As my colleague has noted, the drug problem developed in Dublin's inner city in the 1980s and mainly manifested itself as a problem with heroin addiction.  However, we now are faced with a national problem involving polydrug use, including alcohol, as well as a massive increase in gang activity around the issue, which is a major element to have developed recently.</p><p><a name='N4'>  I represent the constituency of Dublin South-Central, which is the most disadvantaged urban constituency in the country.  While its people are very proud and well organised in their efforts to organise their community, that is the legacy of the Celtic tiger in my constituency.  I refer to the poverty levels, unemployment and youth unemployment levels and the high numbers of early school leavers in that area.  Moreover, there is serious drug and alcohol abuse within the community, as well as gang activity.  An informed source told me the areas of Dublin 10 and 12 have the highest levels of drug seizures and highest drug use and supply in the entire country.  There is an epidemic of hashish, which is not like it was in the 1970s but which is a potent, powerful and very expensive drug.  It costs approximately €50 to buy a bag, from which one might get four joints.  In addition, another dangerous drug, crystal meth, is beginning to make its appearance in the community.</p><p><a name='N5'>  The constituency has experienced a vicious feud between two gangs in the Dublin 12 area that has resulted in 29 murders, the most recent of which was the vicious shooting of a gang member in front of his child.  There is a major problem of intimidation which must be addressed, although I acknowledge it has been addressed by some of the local task forces.  During the past two years, I have been approached by community groups, such as Addiction Response Crumlin, ARC, and individual families with regard to the intimidation in the area.  For example, one family was driven out of their home by gang activity recently.  Only yesterday, I spoke to a woman who is being extorted of €10,000 by the gangs in the area.  These are people who are in receipt of social welfare and this has been going on daily.  For €40, they are willing to put in one's windows unless one pays up.  This is the level of activity within the community that people are facing and it is not an exception but is widespread.  The gangs in my area usually are based around criminal families, which groom troubled teenagers and children, some as young as ten, to expand their operations.  These children and teenagers are used to target families on behalf of those gangs and this cannot be ascribed to antisocial behaviour but constitutes organised crime in the community.</p><p><a name='N6'>  As a member of the local policing forum, my perception is there is a lack of urgency in dealing with such issues.  I am sure the position is the same in other areas and I note Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan made particular reference to the inner city local policing forum.  This must come from the top, that is, there must be a Government-driven strategy to deal with this issue.  I recall that a special drugs policing forum operated in the inner city.  It intervened in the community and did a very good job until its disbandment after a number of years of being in place.  However, one is told the Garda cannot do much because families are not coming forward.  There is a reason families do not come forward, which is they are afraid that their houses might be burned, petrol bombed or pipe bombed.  They fear that their windows could be put in or, in some exceptional circumstances, that they could be shot dead.  Anyone with any local knowledge knows who is involved in this gang war.  There must be a strategy to target such serious criminals.  There must be constant surveillance, raids, searches and constant arrests in respect of these criminal gangs.  There must be CAB investigations to let them know they cannot act with impunity, which is what they are doing at present in many communities.</p><p><a name='N7'>  I also wish to address the issue of services.  The Addiction Response Crumlin centre is a highly successful community response to the drug crisis.  Working with more than 550 individuals and families, it runs a total of eight projects, which include three community employment schemes and family support for 80 families with an under-18 project.  However, since 2008 the centre has had its funding cut by 22.7%.  Its training allowance has been cut by 50%, its material grant cut by 53% and its administrators must juggle things around skilfully.  A citywide estimate of community drug services in general indicates they have had their funding cut by 29% since 2008.  The dial to stop drug dealing initiative, which built up local knowledge and had been introduced highly successfully by all accounts, was abolished in January of this year without consultation.  The cuts have devastated and undermined the community's response to the drugs crisis and another round of cuts in the forthcoming budget would be disastrous.  Perhaps someone in government should explain this to the troika.  Our communities are being devastated and we cannot take any more from that perspective.  Finally, I fully support the point made about opening up debate in respect of legislation to legalise certain drugs at least, thereby removing organised crime from the scene.  International experience shows the war on drugs is a complete and absolute failure.</p>

I wish him all types of success and hope he will be successful in an extremely difficult, demanding and tough role.  I really mean this and wish him good luck.  I sincerely thank the Technical Group.  This is an unusual situation in that I appreciate the great work done by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and am thankful to the Technical Group for allowing me time even though its members did not know I am not fully in support of the motion before the House this evening.  Their willingness to give time to a person who does not support fully the motion demonstrates just how open and understanding they are.</p><p><a name='N9'>  I have a number of issues and I wish to use the time allocated to highlight my concerns.  First, if one considers our history regarding the abuse of substances, one must acknowledge our experience nationally with alcohol, for instance, is not good.  If one takes the motion's call to &quot;prioritise addition as a health issue and not primarily as a criminal issue and ensure the necessary allocation of resources&quot; and to &quot;open the debate on decriminalisation of illegal drugs and safer consumption&quot;, I must reiterate that as a nation, our record with regard to consumption is not good.  This is the reason I genuinely cannot fully support this motion.  As for decriminalising some of the drugs that are illegal at present, it could make it easier.  I acknowledge great arguments can be made on both sides and I listened attentively to previous speakers but when it comes to maintaining addictions, it could result in it being easier for people to sell drugs that would then be classified as being legal.  Moreover, selling such drugs over the counter could lead to a false notion that consumption of such drugs was safe.  It could mislead drug users and, in particular, young people into thinking that if it is legal, it must be okay.  When one considers cigarettes, for instance, it is perfectly legal to buy cigarettes over the counter but at the same time, there is a massive industry in the illegal sale of cigarettes at present.</p>

I have real concerns and even though Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan is motivated for all the right reasons, it is just we do not always agree on everything at all times.</p><p><a name='N3'>  I return to the damage being caused by drugs.  It is a major problem facing the Government and all of us, and should be our top priority.  The incidence of suicide is very high in the country and I believe many suicides are as a result of poly-drug use, which is in the majority of cases illegal drugs or even legal drugs being taken in conjunction with alcohol.  I believe this is a contributory factor to the enormous increase in the incidence of suicide.  From our constituencies and from being involved with communities and knowing so many people, sadly we all recognise the enormous increase in the incidence of suicide.  This wreaks devastation upon families, parents, children and neighbours.  Communities are being torn asunder from this.  There is not a family, townland, village or town that is not affected by suicide on a regular basis, which is terribly sad.</p><p><a name='N4'>  It is incumbent on the Government and all of us to ensure we do everything we can to tackle illegal drug use.  I have reservations about opening the debate on decriminalising some illegal drugs on the basis that it might allow for safer consumption.  I am not convinced of that argument which is why I am not in a position to support the motion before us tonight.  The Government should be concentrating on sorting out the existing addiction problems we have such as alcohol rather than making other substances legally available.  I do not believe the timing is right for that at present.  It is no harm to have tonight's debate on the floor of the House allowing everybody to make contributions.  Whether for or against, everybody's contribution is valuable and important.  We need to get the message from both Government and Opposition that we are serious about taking on the crime lords who are wreaking such havoc.  Because of their greed for money they are willing to take people's lives and tear lives asunder by importing and making freely available illegal drugs on the streets of our towns and villages.</p>

I welcome the debate and I congratulate Deputy Maureen O Sullivan and her colleagues on tabling the motion.  There is considerable agreement between us although not total agreement and therefore I believe it is appropriate to ask the House to support the Government's amendment in this regard.<br><br>  At the outset I wish to recognise the very considerable work in which Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has been involved over many years with her colleagues and collaborators - if I may describe them as such - back to the involvement of the former Deputy, the late Tony Gregory, who did such extraordinary work not just in promoting the debate and discussion, but in taking a very fearless attitude and public stance over much of what was happening in his constituency and indeed throughout the country.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan may be aware that I have some involvement in one of the organisations she mentioned in the course of her speech, the SAOL project, with which I am very glad to have been associated over a number of years.  I acknowledge the work she mentioned that the SAOL project and others are doing.<br><br>  There is a high degree of agreement among us particularly on the harms caused by addiction, be it drugs, alcohol or other forms, to individuals, their families and friends and society in general.  There are approximately 14,500 known opiate users in Ireland.  Current figures indicate that more than 12,500 are in receipt of drug treatment, of whom more than 9,300 are in receipt of methadone treatment.<br><br>  Alcohol plays a complex role in Irish society.  Unfortunately, its consumption for enjoyment and sociability - along with its economic benefits - is overshadowed by the harm and health problems it causes when it is misused or consumed in a harmful and hazardous way.  The National Drugs Prevalence Survey 2010-2011 indicated that 87% of adults aged between 18 and 64 years are classified as current drinkers.  Some 58% of current drinkers, representing half of the State's population, are classified as consuming alcohol in a harmful manner.  These are stark figures.<br><br>  The Government is committed to maintaining the impetus in tackling the drugs problem through the full implementation of the national drugs strategy.  It sets out a series of actions to deal with the drugs problem under the five pillars.  I accept this requires a multifaceted and multifactorial approach and it cannot be reduced to one approach or another whether in the important criminal justice area or any other area - all of the areas must be brought together.  Those five pillars are supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research, each of which is important.<br><br>  Co-operation and interagency working between the statutory, voluntary and community sectors is crucial to the success of the national drugs strategy.  Expenditure on drugs services by Departments, State agencies and others is in the region of &#8364;250 million per year.  As I will outline, significant progress is being achieved across the five pillars of the strategy I mentioned.<br><br>  On supply reduction, I can assure the House that drug law enforcement remains a key priority area for An Garda Síochána and the Government.  An Garda Síochána continues to proactively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug crime.  The Garda national drugs unit, works closely with divisional and district drug units and other national units, including the organised crime unit, as well as the Criminal Assets Bureau, in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.<br><br>  The association between the drugs trade and the use of violence and intimidation, as adverted to by some earlier speakers, remains a significant problem and the State will continue to utilise all resources at its disposal in pursuing those involved.  The recent brutal murders have shown the callous disregard some people have for human life and the Garda is determined to do everything it can to bring the perpetrators to justice.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner about all aspect of serious crime.  The Garda will continue to bear down heavily on the activities of those involved in gangland crime including drug crime.<br><br>  The use of intimidation in the pursuit of drug-related debts is a matter which is being treated as a priority by the Garda.  A framework is being developed between the Garda national drugs unit and the Family Support Network to assist persons who may be subject to the threat of drug-related intimidation.<br><br>  In targeting those involved in drug trafficking a number of strategies have been put in place by An Garda Síochána to address the sale, supply, importation and distribution of illegal drugs.  This approach is continuing to result in significant drug seizures and the related arrests of those involved in this trade and other forms of criminality.  Provisional Garda figures for the period January to August 2012 indicate that 11,263 drug offences were detected, with 9,743 related arrests made.  Based on figures provided to An Garda Síochána by the Forensic Science Laboratory, it is estimated that drugs with an approximate street value of &#8364;59.3 million were recorded as seized during the first six months of the year.  The seizure data do not include a number of significant seizures made at the end of the first six-month period which remain the subject of further analysis and which will be reflected in later Forensic Science Laboratory returns.  For example, in June as part of an ongoing intelligence-led operation targeting organised crime, the Garda national drugs unit, working with colleagues from the Revenue's Customs service, seized in excess of 400 kg of cocaine following searches in west Dublin and Kildare and arrested a number of key players involved in the drugs trade.  I commend An Garda Síochána and the customs authorities on their ongoing work in this regard.</p>

Since the middle of 2010, more than 260 psychoactive substances have been declared controlled drugs under the misuse of drugs Acts.  In addition, the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010, made it a criminal offence to sell or supply substances which have psychoactive effects on humans.  This combination of initiatives has had a huge effect on the availability of new psychoactive substances that were in the main being sold through head shops.  The Garda report that the number of head shops operating here has been reduced from more than 100 to three.  The Garda continue to monitor retail outlets involved in the sale of equipment that can be used to cultivate cannabis and investigate any incidents involving the availability of psychoactive substances through retail outlets.<br><br>  As stated by colleagues earlier, under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is prohibited for a person to supply a prescription medicine by mail order, including over the Internet.  Furthermore, it is an offence to produce, import, export, sell, supply or possess substances controlled under the misuse of drugs Acts and regulations, except in accordance with a licence.  The Department of Health is currently reviewing the misuse of drugs regulations, to introduce additional controls on benzodiazepine medicines which are known to be traded illicitly.  The new measures will require import and export licences and create an offence for persons who possess these substances without a prescription, licence or other authority.<br><br>  The strategy recognises the vital importance of promoting a greater awareness and understanding of the dangers of problem drug and alcohol use.  Prevention measures are in place, focusing on those most at risk as well as on the general population.  National media campaigns are undertaken by the HSE and include the development and-or support of information websites such as <i>www.drugs.ie</i>, <i>www.yourdrinking.ie</i>, <i>www.healthpromotion.ie </i>and regional awareness raising events such as drug awareness week.<br><br>  The Government is particularly focused on ensuring that there is an increased emphasis on moving people from drug treatment to a drug-free life, where this is achievable.  The report of the working group on drugs rehabilitation, published in 2007, sets out the framework for a multifaceted approach to the delivery of rehabilitation.  Considerable progress has been achieved, with an increased number of places in the opiate substitution programmes, more detox beds and more places in rehabilitation programmes.  For example there are currently 142 beds available for medical and community-based detoxification and 642 residential rehabilitation beds for those suffering from addiction of various types, the majority of which are being utilised by people with problems relating to alcohol.  Additional detox beds were recently provided at a number of locations, including in Bruree, County Limerick; Farnanes, County Cork; Tullow, County Carlow and Ballyragget, County Kilkenny.  The HSE continues to prioritise treatment and is currently assessing demand for residential services, reviewing funding arrangements and standardising service level agreements.  There has also been an increase in the availability of needle exchange services, with the roll-out of the pharmacy needle exchange programme, in which more than 40 pharmacies are participating.  The programme is being expanded over a three year period.  <br><br>  The HSE provides a wide range of services in respect of alcohol related harm.  These include health promotion activities and campaigns, outreach and counselling services, addiction services, family support, treatment of patients presenting with alcohol related harm in acute hospitals and support of voluntary organisations.  A review of the methadone treatment protocol in 2010 made a number of recommendations, including the involvement of more GPs in the methadone service, more emphasis on moving clients towards recovery, more opportunities for detoxification with appropriate follow-up and greater use of alternatives to methadone.  Implementation of these recommendations is overseen by the HSE's social inclusion governance group.<br><br>  The Irish Prison Service continues to implement its drugs policy and strategy, entitled &quot;Keeping Drugs out of Prison&quot;.  This drugs strategy was launched in May 2006 and significant progress has been made to date.  The strategy seeks to reduce the demand for drugs within the prison system through education, treatment and rehabilitation services for drug-addicted prisoners.  Initiatives include the provision of detoxification, methadone maintenance, education programmes, addiction counselling and drug therapy programmes.<br><br>  Any person entering prison with a history of opiate use and testing positive for opioids on committal is offered medically assisted symptomatic detoxification.  Patients can, as part of the assessment process, discuss with health care staff other treatment options which may include stabilisation on methadone maintenance for persons who wish to continue on methadone while in prison.  Methadone maintenance is available in nine places of detention, accounting for more than 80% of the prison population.  The Prison Service often engages with patients who have not accessed community-based treatment services.  The drugs treatment policy has also led to a reduction in the incidence of post release overdoses, since there is a strong emphasis on continuity of care between prison services and the community services.<br><br>  As part of the Government commitment to deliver focused services to people in rehabilitation, 1,000 CE drug rehabilitation places have been ring-fenced within the community employment sector.  The drug rehabilitation places operate as CE schemes but with a special remit around rehabilitation and training to prepare participants to progress to employment.  The line between rehabilitation and recovery on the one hand and employment and training on the other is often blurred.  In the world of recovery from addiction, labour market participation is one of the surest ways to enhance self-esteem and reinforce stability and recovery.  This balance between rehabilitation and training has been at the core of community employment on drug task force projects and is reflected in the national drugs strategy.  In June 2012, there were 807 participants in CE drug rehabilitation projects.  The CE drug rehabilitation projects are working with the Department of Social Protection to ensure that there is adequate funding for the continuation of the valuable work undertaken by such schemes.<br><br>  The role of the family in drug rehabilitation cannot be overstated.  The national drugs strategy states that families should be seen as service users in their own right; that service providers should actively seek the participation of families in the rehabilitation process and the reconciliation of families, if that is necessary.  The HSE works with a number of agencies to support prevention measures with families.  Some examples of these initiatives include roll-out of the strengthening families programme and delivery of a comprehensive concerned persons programme in support of family members who experience significant difficulties arising from alcohol and substance misuse.  The strengthening families programme is a 14 session, evidence based parenting skills, children's life skills and family life skills training programme aimed at preventing and reducing alcohol and drug misuse and anti-social behaviour and crime among young people.<br><br>  The drugs task forces play an important role in tackling the drug problem in local communities.  They support more than 400 community-based drugs initiatives, which operate a range of interventions covering treatment and rehabilitation, drug awareness and prevention, community safety initiatives and support for families of problem drug users.  This year, the Department of Health is providing almost &#8364;31.5 million in funding to the drugs initiative, which primarily supports the activities of community-based drugs projects in drugs task force areas.  A review of the drugs task forces and associated structures has taken place and recommendations will be considered by the Government shortly.  The core objectives of the review are to strengthen the effectiveness of the drugs task forces, improve accountability for their activities and expenditure and streamline the funding arrangements to<i>&nbsp;</i>the community drugs projects.<br><br>   I would now like to return to the question of alcohol and its place in our society.  The misuse of alcohol is responsible for a wide range of health and social harms in society.  A significant burden is placed on the resources of the State in dealing with the consequences of alcohol misuse.</p>

Alcohol misuse was responsible for at least 88 deaths every month in 2008.  It is a contributory factor in half of all suicides and in deliberate self-harm.  It is associated with the occupation every night of 2,000 beds in Irish acute hospitals and one quarter of injuries presenting to emergency departments.  Alcohol abuse is estimated to be associated with 16% of child abuse cases.  It was a trigger in a third of domestic abuse cases in 2005.  In 2007, alcohol related illness cost the health care system €1.2 billion and alcohol related crime cost an estimated €1.19 billion.  The cost of lost economic output in 2007 owing to alcohol was estimated to be €427 million.  In addition to the terrible human loss and suffering involved, alcohol related road accidents cost an estimated €530 million in 2007.</p>

The time has come for us to rethink our relationship with alcohol.  Irish people drink in a more dangerous way than people in almost every other country.  Irish adults drank 11.9 litres of pure alcohol <i>per capita</i> in 2010.  This equates to 482 pints of lager, 125 bottles of wine or 45 bottles of vodka.  Ultimately, 1.5 million Irish drinkers drink in a harmful pattern.<br><br>  It is imperative that as a society we reduce the overall level of alcohol consumed in our society and tackle the problems of alcohol misuse.  The report of the national substance misuse strategy steering group was published last February.  It made a number of recommendations focusing on the supply, pricing, availability and marketing of alcohol, along with measures for the policy areas of prevention strategies, treatment, rehabilitation, alcohol and substance dependency research and information.  For example, it recommended an increase in the price of alcohol so it becomes less affordable, and the introduction of a legislative basis for minimum pricing and a social responsibility levy on the drinks industry.<br><br>  The extent of alcohol misuse warrants such policies to address this pervasive threat to Irish public health.  Minimum pricing is ultimately a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels for alcohol products that must be legally observed by retailers.  The primary function of this measure is to reduce at-risk levels of alcohol consumption, especially by those who drink in a harmful and hazardous way.  It would also have a greater impact on discouraging children and young adults to drink.  In turn, this should diminish the effect of the misuse and over-consumption of alcohol on public services, crimes and public health, along, of course, with productivity in the economy.<br><br>  The national substance misuse strategy sets out the future direction of policy to deal with the use and misuse of alcohol.  The Department of Health is preparing a concrete set of proposals on the basis of the national substance misuse strategy report, and it is intended to submit these to Government for consideration and approval as soon as possible.<br><br>  The Government is fully committed to addressing the drugs problem, and as a Minister of State with responsibility in this area I intend to continue to drive the implementation of the drugs strategy and ensure that tackling the problem of addiction throughout Ireland remains very high on the Government's agenda.  I acknowledge the progress achieved by my predecessor, Deputy Róisín Shortall, in advancing the national drugs strategy.  I look forward to bringing proposals on an alcohol policy to the Government in the very near future, and in this regard I am confident my colleagues in government will support the timely finalisation and subsequent implementation of the national substance misuse strategy.</p>

I wish the new Minister of State, Deputy White, well in his role.  I have no doubt the experience he brings from his work prior to being elected to the Dáil will be of huge assistance, particularly in the area of drugs and substance misuse.  To repeat what previous speakers said, it is undoubtedly a scourge on society.  The country has faced a drugs problem for generations and more recently we have seen the obvious effects of the misuse of alcohol.  I pay tribute to the staff at Cuan Mhuire in Bruree, County Limerick, in my constituency who work in this area on a daily basis.  They do sterling work in assisting people on their road to recovery.  I find myself in the position of agreeing with Deputy Healy Rae, which is a first for me, as I am concerned about the blanket decriminalisation of certain drugs because I do not believe it is the path to take.  Various jurisdictions have had mixed experiences of this.</p><p><a name='N4'>  We need greater co-operation, and the Minister of State's experience in a previous guise may help with this.  This is not an issue for one Department; it is multifaceted requiring the Departments of Justice and Equality and Defence to play a major role.  We saw the role of the Naval Service in the seizure of illegal substances off the west coast of Cork.  It is important that naval services in Europe and elsewhere share information on the traffic into and out of our territorial waters.  The availability of naval ships in Ireland is limited for the very good reason of budgetary constraints.  However, one would not put a west Cork garda in a Ford Fiesta with only first gear to patrol the entire country.  This is what we expect of the Naval Service.  The time has come for us to look to our neighbours, particularly our nearest neighbour which has a far greater maritime capability than we do, and ask for the collection and sharing of information on traffic into and out of our territorial waters in certain instances for this purpose.</p><p><a name='N5'>  An issue raised with me recently is mail-order drug dealing.  A parent spoke to me about the damage being caused by benzodiazepines to families throughout the country.  This issue is gaining momentum.  I call on the Departments of Health and Justice and Equality to consider the effective programme put in place to deal with the scourge of child pornography and the use of the credit card details of those who solicited such information from websites.  Some of the websites selling drugs are hosted in countries where the law of the land is not the number one priority, but every one of these websites is dependent on an Irish bank or financial institution conveying information on the credit card details being used to make purchases.  We need a code of practice or stronger legislation put in place to go after the banks and credit and debit card companies which allow this to happen.  To a certain degree, an onus of responsibility should be placed on the sharing of information between those who transit the material into and out of the country, in particular couriers or post workers who bring large packages - these do not come in small packages - on a routine basis to the same people.  Perhaps there is also a role for the State agencies in information sharing, but certainly the credit facilities offered by banks to purchase these drugs online should be examined.  The work done to deal with child pornography was very effective.</p><p><a name='N6'>  The Minister of State is correct that the scourge of alcohol abuse has been well documented.  However, there is another side to the alcohol and drinks industry.  It is very easy for Members of the House to be critical of the industry, and I agree that to a certain extent it has gone out of control, but in towns, cities and villages throughout the country we have responsible family-owned pubs which are good houses run by people who are part of the community.  They have been waiting for years for something to be done about the unregulated side of the market and I would welcome any measures taken in this regard.  In doing so, the Minister of State needs to level the playing field and engage with the responsible end of the industry.  These are ordinary people who pay their rates and exorbitant rates of tax on which we depend.  No contribution made so far this evening referred to the amount of money raised by the Exchequer from the alcohol industry.  A side of the industry is willing to engage with the Minister of State and wants to help address this problem.  It is important not to tar all of the drinks industry with the same brush.  I encourage the Minister of State to sit down with the representatives of the manufacturers, retailers and publicans.  They are in communities throughout the country and provide employment.  They do not want to act irresponsibly but, by the same token, they do not want pot shots to be taken at their industry every night.  Not all publicans or nightclub owners are bad; there are a few rogues who need to be rooted out.  I wish the Minister of State well and I support the amendment he has tabled.</p>

The motion is very timely given the recent tragic events in the city linked to drugs and gangland activity.  I hope in the coming months the Minister of State takes the opportunity to put his own stamp on this very important issue.  The people at the heart of this issue are the addicts, their families and children and their communities.  We need to focus on those struggling with addiction, whether to alcohol or illegal drugs.</p>

We need to move forward with a methadone programme that does not keep people sustained on methadone but rather weans them off drugs altogether.  We need to help them access proper rehabilitation services and counselling and not be left waiting on long waiting lists to go into rehabilitation.  I welcome the review which has gone ahead, although I am not too sure what is in it.  This comprehensive review of task forces is vital to assess the work being done on the ground and to ensure projects and services funded through the task forces are connecting with the people they are serving.  There is a genuine need for accountability and responsibility.  Those projects that do the most must be recognised for their commitment to the provision of vital services for addicts.  Last month, I visited the Star Project in my own area in Ballyfermot where I met many of the participants, many of whom have been there for the past two years while others have been participating for a short period of time.  I heard one person describe how she had lost five family members through addiction.  This issue needs to be tackled urgently.</p><p><a name='N3'>  I cannot talk about drugs and addiction without taking alcohol abuse on board.  Here in this country, the levels of alcohol consumption is frighteningly high.  It is tolerated and socially accepted.  Young people now top up before they even go out on the town.  It is seen as our tradition in some people's eyes, which is a very sad reflection on our country - the drunken Irish.  Last week saw Arthur's Day, which was a great day but, by the evening, the city was in turmoil.</p><p><a name='N4'>  The drugs crisis in this country has existed for many years.  I have lived and worked in an area where drug addiction has devastated communities.  People were not allowed to go to their local shop and post offices closed down.  One particular pharmacist was allowed to treat 500 people per day on methadone.  Thank God those days are gone and people have taken on the responsibility of dealing with them.  The mindless violence and unlawful killing we have seen appear to have become the norm.  Criminals have taken the law into their own hands. This tit for tat killing in broad day light no longer shocks us, at least not until last week when innocent children saw their parents shot in front of them.  What is happening to our country and what was once a civilised society?  These are very worrying times for our communities and families.  People are frightened.  I met people from my area who will not even go to the local authority if they believe people are involved in drugs and gangland crime because they are afraid.  I commend the Garda Síochána and the national drugs strategy on the work they have been doing to try to deal with criminal activities.  People should contact the Garda, ring the helpline and not be intimidated because the people living there are the eyes of the community.  They know what is happening every day and they are the people with whom the Garda needs to connect.</p><p><a name='N5'>  The local drugs task forces and the local police forums are excellent in every community and well worth attending.  Some of the task forces are working very well but some of them are not working at all.  When the Minister of State puts his stamp on this portfolio, he will be able to weed out the ones that are not doing the work and support the ones that are.</p>  
<!-- Snippet ref: VV00300 type: 1 --> <a name='VV00300'></a> <p><span class="speaker">Deputy Billy Kelleher:</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&HouseNum=31&MemberID=565"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Billy Kelleher"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=565&pid=BillyKelleher&year=2012&month=10&day=02"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Billy Kelleher"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N6'>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this very important debate.  I thank the Technical Group for moving this motion, especially Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, who has campaigned on this issue for many years, and her predecessor, the late Tony Gregory.  In the early 1980s when I was growing up, even though I was from a rural part of Cork but one which was near the city centre, I was unaware of the tragedies unfolding in the inner city in Dublin.  It was because of the campaigning of people like the late Tony Gregory and Deputy O'Sullivan that the drugs issue was brought to the fore.</p><p><a name='N7'>  I believe the reason it was not to the fore was simply because it was affecting people who did not have a voice.  It was affecting inner city Dublin and people who were underprivileged and did not have a political voice.  It was not until such time as it spread out and started to infest other communities that it became an issue of national prominence.  It was a very sad reflection on ourselves as parliamentarians, political parties and a society that we ignored what was a serious blight on a generation of people in inner city Dublin.  That had a devastating impact on the community, families and individuals in that area.  We saw it culminating in many deaths, the arrival of vigilantes and all that flowed from that, such as the evolving criminality and paramilitaries moving into organised crime.  The proceeds of that are, unfortunately, visiting our streets regularly in Dublin and elsewhere.</p><p><a name='N8'>  I congratulated the Minister of State and wished him the best of luck today in his absence.  I wish him well and hope he has success in delivering on what is a very important portfolio in the Department of Health and Children.  If I were the Minister of State, I would go back to the office, write out the delegation of ministerial functions order and get the Minister for Health to sign it tonight to make sure he has full authority and control over his destiny in delivering on primary care and all that flows from that.  In essence, primary care is critical in respect of what we are talking about because GPs and social workers are at the heart and to the fore in addressing drug addiction and abuse in our communities, along with law enforcement and trying to cut off the supply.</p><p><a name='N9'>  I have gone through this motion and while there could be a difference of opinion with regard to one or two areas, we decided we would not move any amendment to it simply because it is a very detailed and thought-provoking motion before the Dáil.  We can have the debate and we have a free parliamentary democracy where we can talk about decriminalisation and the opening up of that debate.  I would have concerns about it even though I know that in respect of the Netherlands or Portugal, where they decriminalised all illegal drugs in 2001, reports from the Cato Institute and others show the issue should at least be discussed.  Perhaps there are parts of it that are positive and which we could bring into our own system.  I am not sure, however, that as a society we could cater for the complete opening up and decriminalisation of illegal substances, but I am willing to listen to all sides of the argument from those at the coalface, such as the professionals and those who, unfortunately, have substance abuse issues, feel criminalised and withdraw from support services for fear of conviction and being criminalised.  Why not have this debate?  My instinct would be that we may not be ready for it.</p><p><a name='N10'>  The one drug that is legal in this country is alcohol and is the cause of huge difficulties and social upheaval - domestic violence, child abuse and suicide.  It is something we must address right across the board.  Alcohol abuse is a key issue for the Government.  It is having a devastating impact on society.  These are not criticisms of the Minister of State and the Government, they are just observations as a Deputy, father and person who is interested in promoting health within our society.  The Minister of State will know when I want to criticise.  The issue of alcohol has been around for too long without us making any serious inroads into addressing the underlying problems and drift from alcohol use to alcohol abuse to drug abuse and all that flows from that.  There is a body of evidence in reports, surveys and research that is clearly evidential and shows quite clearly that there is a strong link and that it has a detrimental effect on our society and individuals.</p><p><a name='N11'>  For all those reasons, the national substance misuse strategy steering group report and its recommendations must be acted upon very quickly because we are beginning to lose a generation of people again.  We saw it in respect of the Swedish House Mafia concert in the Phoenix Park and we see it every night of the week, particularly at the weekends, in our provincial towns and cities.  We know the consequences and causes of it.  We know that too much alcohol is being consumed in a binge drinking type atmosphere and we know about the drift towards illegal drugs as well, such as Benzodiazepines, opiates, alcohol and barbiturates.  When all these are mixed together, they can become a lethal cocktail.  We see it too often in coroners' reports with details of alcohol and polydrug mixes causing death.  Daily and weekly our accident and emergency departments are full.  In his speech, the Minister of State said that 2,000 beds per night were being used in acute hospitals because of alcohol related incidents.  I know we must broaden it out to talk about the other issues as well.</p>

Teachers tell us that children in national schools are experiencing difficulty because of alcohol abuse and use.  Therefore, we must not put our head in the sand any longer and decide that alcohol is a bit of craic and part of what we are; we must not decide to park the problem in the belief that the next generation will not be affected.  The problem is cyclical and ongoing.  Something needs to be done.</p><p><a name='N4'>  The 14 drugs task forces did some ground-breaking work on rehabilitation, training, community employment schemes and getting people back into the labour market.  The difficulty is that our labour market is very much diminished and, consequently, it is harder to make progress.  We will, therefore, need more supports in the supported labour market area.  We do not have the safety net that existed heretofore.  If there are not more supported labour market initiatives, there will be a backlog among people on rehabilitation programmes who used to use illegal drugs.  It is critical that we provide the supports.  I am not making criticisms but observations.</p><p><a name='N5'>  Let us consider the use of methadone as a substitute for heroin.  We know approximately 9,000 people are on methadone programmes at present.  If one hands out methadone continually without putting in place very serious supports, drug users drift back towards heroin use.  Evidence exists to support this view.  While we can set up treatment programmes and offer rehabilitation, we will not succeed without a multifaceted, streamlined approach.  Let us be honest: most of the drug users are very vulnerable and are under huge pressure.  They are addicted to a substance and may not have family or community supports.  They may have low self-esteem and all that stems therefrom.  Therefore, there ought to be a conveyor-belt system of supports available to them.  Any break in this process means one can slip back into drug abuse very quickly.</p><p><a name='N6'>  This area must be prioritised, for a number of reasons, if cuts to resources are being made.  If we talk about drug abuse, we must acknowledge it is contributing to homelessness, self-harm and suicide.  The figures in this regard are alarming.  This ought to be a priority for the Government.  All the supports should be built around the drugs task forces and made available at the coalface in communities, thereby giving people ownership of their destinies and the ability to deal with their community problems.  Prescriptive diktats from Departments or Governments do not always filter down as intended to communities.  The local drugs task forces are important in giving communities ownership and the resources needed to face their challenges.  I support this approach.  The fruits of it are to be seen.  Deputy O'Sullivan and others referred to the good work being done by the drugs task forces.  Politically, this matter may have fallen off the priority list.  I hope the Minister of State will reinvigorate it and put it back at the centre of Government policy, making sure that scarce resources are provided for those who need them most.</p><p><a name='N7'>  In noting the motion’s acknowledgement of the good work being done by the drugs task forces and through the implementation of various strategies, we must acknowledge that resources to deal with the difficulties are key.  We must consider whether there are sufficient resources available to An Garda Síochána, the Customs and Excise, the Navy and Defence Forces to stop supply.  Having a land border with another jurisdiction and a vast coastline, we realise it is very difficult to cut off supply.  However, all the necessary resources must be made available.  X-ray machines are kept in Dublin Port for a few days and then driven to Rosslare for a few.  The drug smugglers wait in Britain until they find out the location of the X-ray machine and when they find it has been moved from a particular port they send their containers there.  We must use the technology available to us in conjunction with Interpol and the British authorities to deal with this problem head-on.</p><p><a name='N8'>  Let us be clear: some of the drug finds were accidental.  One of the biggest drug finds, which was off west Cork a couple of years ago, occurred when someone put diesel into a petrol boat.  It was a complete accident that the vast quantity of cocaine was found in the region.  If this was by accident, we must ask what is coming in unknown to us and under our noses.  We must provide resources to combat smuggling.</p><p><a name='N9'>  It is not a criticism of those who are on the high seas daily to state there are more resources devoted to chasing a few fishermen around west Cork than to chasing smugglers coming from Colombia in yachts and catamarans to the Irish coastline, from where they move farther on into Europe.  We must, therefore, get our priorities right if we are to be serious about cutting off supply.  Cutting off half or quarter of the supply is no good because all this does is inflate the cost of the products coming in.  This increases criminality, resulting in a circular problem.  We must deal with the problem head-on on a number of fronts.</p><p><a name='N10'>  I urge the Government to prioritise surveillance and co-operation with Interpol and other agencies on a pan-European basis and globally, particularly with the United States and other countries that have good intelligence on where drugs come from - South America and Africa, for example.  It should be within our gift to cut off the supply of major imports of drugs.</p><p><a name='N11'>  The criminal element and the activities of former members of the IRA, who are now moving into criminality and using their paramilitary experience in the process, are having a devastating consequence on cities.  Drug dealing is lucrative and will continue without appropriate sanctions.  To this day, the sanctions are not tough enough.  If one is caught with over €14,000 of illegal drugs, one receives a mandatory ten-year sentence.  I raised this in the House time and again.  I wrote to the President of the High Court and President of the Supreme Court stating we must have a sentencing policy that puts suppliers away for a very long time.</p><p><a name='N12'>  Those who are using drugs should not be criminalised.  We should regard drug use as a health issue.  It is a health issue for those who are addicted to substances, be it alcohol, illegal drugs or, in some cases, legal drugs.  We should have a good debate on decriminalisation but I have yet to be convinced that it would address the underlying problems in our society.</p><p><a name='N13'>  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy White, to put this matter centre-stage.  He should make a name for himself.  I know he will on the basis that he has done so already; that is why he is where he is.  He should make a bigger name for himself by ensuring that the alcohol and drugs strategies are central to everything he does, not only with the Department of Health but also with the Departments responsible for justice and education and those with lead roles in combating this insidious cancer in society.</p>

Tallaght has the highest rate of reported burglaries in the State, and Rathfarnham has the fourth highest.

Previous Governments had become too dependent on a small number of sectors to support economic performance – an approach that was neither wise nor sustainable. </p><p><a name='N9'>  This Government has set about transforming the economy, firstly by making fiscal and bank consolidation more job friendly, including through tax changes, asset sales and the creation of a stimulus package.  We have introduced the annual Action Plan for Jobs to support employment creation by the enterprise sector based on innovation, entrepreneurship and exporting.  We have also developed the Pathways to Work initiative to transform our engagement with those who are unemployed.</p><p><a name='N10'>  The Action Plan for Jobs has an ambition of supporting an extra 100,000 jobs in the economy by 2016.  The Plan contains 270 measures for delivery across all Government Departments, as well as 36 State agencies.     </p><p><a name='N11'>  In spite of very difficult domestic and external economic environment, we are beginning to see the positive impact of the Government’s policies.  2011 saw an increase of 6,000 jobs in IDA-supported companies, compared with net losses of 15,000 jobs between 2008 and 2010.  So far this year, the IDA has announced investments with the potential to create more than 6,000 further jobs as these projects come on stream.  </p><p><a name='N12'>  Similarly, jobs in Enterprise Ireland companies started to grow again in 2011, for the first time in three years.  In the first eight months of 2012, a total of 4,669 job commitments over the next three years, linked to Enterprise Ireland approvals to client companies, have been secured.</p><p><a name='N13'>  In spite of continued job losses in more traditional sectors such as Construction, and Financial, Insurance and Administrative activities, we are seeing a stabilisation in the level of private sector employment, particularly in areas targeted by the Action Plan for Jobs.</p><p><a name='N14'>  It is particularly encouraging that exports from indigenous companies have been growing even faster than FDI and reached €15.2 billion in exports in 2011 – the highest level ever.  </p><p><a name='N15'>In spite of continued job losses in more traditional sectors such as Construction, and Financial, Insurance and Administrative activities, we are seeing stabilisation in the level of private sector employment.   However, the downgrading of growth forecasts in most of our trading partners will create a particularly challenging environment for the next 12 months.</p><p><a name='N16'>  We are now working on the preparation of proposals for the Action Plan for Jobs 2013. I have had a number of constructive meetings and invite submissions for consideration.</p>

Comparative figures from Eurostat show that Ireland had a youth unemployment rate of 30.5% at the end of last year.  The EU average was 22.1%, with several countries having a higher youth unemployment rate than Ireland.      <br><br>  The Government is tackling unemployment generally through the twin strategies of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work.  The aim of the Action Pan for Jobs is to support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016, while the objective of Pathways to Work is to ensure that as many of those jobs as possible go to those who are currently unemployed.  Many young people will benefit from the opportunities provided through these initiatives. <br><br>  The 2012 Action Plan for Jobs contains over 270 measures to be delivered across all 15 Government Departments and 36 State agencies.  Pathways to Work includes various training, education and work experience initiatives delivered by the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Social Protection.  <br><br>  Under Pathways to Work, the Department of Social Protection is committed to supporting over 85,000 job placement, work experience and Back to Education beneficiaries this year, including through the JobBridge internship programme.  To date, over 10,500 participants have commenced JobBridge placements, which by its nature, is very amenable to participation by young people.  Preliminary statistics compiled by the Department of Social Protection indicate that in the region of 40% of interns have secured jobs following their participation on JobBridge.  This number can be expected to grow as more interns finish their placements and more detailed data is gathered on outcomes from the programme. <br><br>The latest Quarterly National Household Survey, published by the CSO on 19 September, indicates that 66,500 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 years were unemployed in the second quarter of 2012. Under the National Employment Action Plan process, 35,400 people under 25 years of age were referred to the Employment Services last year. Of those referred, 62% of clients had signed off the Live Register by the end of the year.<font color="#004080">  </font>For the first eight months of this year, there were 23,700 referrals affecting 18,300 young jobseekers.    Over 18,000 persons aged 25 and under also completed a training course with FÁS in 2011.<br><br>  The Department of Education and Skills will provide over 450,000 education and training places this year under Pathways to Work, across the range of provision in the higher education, further education and training sectors. These places will include provision for school leavers.  The new &#8364;20 million Labour Market Education and Training Fund operated by the Department of Education &amp; Skills will also include specific provision for those under 25 years of age.</p>

The system that developed over the last sixty years had become unwieldy and complex; it lacked consistency, involved long delays and in some cases proved expensive for users. <br><br>  In short the system was no longer fit for purpose and it was for this reason that I committed to delivering a root-and-branch reform with the objective of establishing a world-class Workplace Relations Service.  <br><br>  Significant progress has been made to date and I am happy to report that in the last year:<ul style="margin-left:20px">·  Two public consultation processes were completed<br><br>·  Two policy documents were published <br><br>·  A new single contact portal has replaced the five separate entry points<br><br>·  Complaints are now acknowledged, on average, within a week of receipt.

Again this was taking up to eight months in some cases<br><br>·  There are now no backlogs for Rights Commissioner hearings<br><br>·  A Single Complaint Form has replaced the 30 forms previously in use <br><br>·  A new workplace relations interim website is in place<br><br>·  A pilot Early Resolution Service is now seeking to resolve disputes at an early stage without the need for adjudication.</ul>  In addition the Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill has been prepared and Government Approval for priority drafting of the Bill has been secured.<br><br>  I intend to progress the reform programme to the next stage with the same determination that has delivered the achievements to date.  I am working towards delivery of the new two-tier Workplace Relations structure so that from next year two statutorily independent bodies will replace the current five. <br><br>  In the meantime I intend to continue to progress the reform and bring about further enhancements for users of the services on an administrative basis in the coming months. </p>

This number has been increasing continuously over recent years having been under 100,000 up to the start of 2009. Part-time underemployed people now account for over one-third (35.6%) of all people working on a part-time basis. </p><p><a name='N28'>  Opportunities to access full-time jobs and up-skilling and further career development are essential to overcome involuntary part-time work and to provide individuals with the necessary means to maintain their employability and make transitions work.  </p><p><a name='N29'>   It will be through transitioning the economy onto a competitive and sustainable path that greater employment opportunities will be created for those that are currently underemployed. The policies to address underemployment are not dissimilar to wider employment strategy. Assisting companies to win new markets, to innovate and grow are essential to overcome underemployment.  The Action Plan for Jobs concentrates on implementing changes to help promote entrepreneurship, improve access to finance, the capacity of our companies and educational institutions to innovate and build new sectors of opportunity.</p>

For this reason, the Enterprise Development Agencies, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Shannon Development operate an early warning system, which has been in place for over ten years. When triggered, this mechanism brings the full capacity of the agency concerned to bear on whatever situation has arisen within the client company. This involves engaging closely with those client companies reporting difficulties or potential job losses to determine what appropriate proactive measures can be put in place by the Agency to prevent or minimise the job losses. <br><br>  Supporting SME&#8217;s in the current difficult economic climate is a key Government priority. Government actions to relieve pressure on small and medium sized businesses in the domestic economy are set out in the Action Plan for Jobs published in February 2012 and reported on quarterly.  <br><br>  In addition to the wide-range of programmes being delivered by the Enterprise Agencies, the Government is also focusing on other measures to address the challenge of access to finance being faced by SMEs. Last Thursday, my colleague Minister Richard Bruton launched the new Microfinance Loan Fund and we will shortly be launching the Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme.<br><br>  We are also ensuring that Enterprise Ireland progresses the Development Capital Scheme and the Innovation Fund.  This is real evidence of Government getting involved in filling gaps in the market and supporting viable businesses. <br><br>  We are making solid progress on this crucially important agenda and have already put place a number of measures that will make a practical difference in making it easier for businesses to grow and create jobs.   We will redouble our efforts in the coming year with the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 to ensure that we put in place policies that respond in a meaningful way to the many challenges faced by business on a daily basis.</p>

It is employment-intensive and covers every community in the country.  Combined with wholesale, the sector employs 258,000 people in Ireland – that is almost 15% of our total workforce.  Recognising its importance to the economy, the Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of specific measures aimed at supporting employment in the retail sector in 2012.  These actions are for delivery across a number of Departments and agencies and include a renewed focus on prompt payments, an assessment of the potential for future development of the retail sector, the introduction of a statutory code of practice for grocery goods undertakings and the provision of support to retail firms seeking to internationalise.  Other more general measures in the Action Plan which will also help to support employment in the retail sector include improved access to finance for businesses, the enactment of legislation to reform the statutory wage setting mechanisms and the acceleration of the programme of revaluation of commercial premises, which will provide a basis for the adjustment in commercial rates.  Other initiatives which the Government introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative in May of last year will also continue to help support employment in the retail sector.  These include the halving of employer’s PRSI on earnings up to €356 per week and the reduction in the 13.5% VAT rate to 9% on certain goods and services.  I regularly meet representatives of the retail sector to hear about the challenges they face, including in relation to the costs of doing business.  My officials have also held separate discussions with retail representatives.  These engagements will assist us in implementing the commitments in the Action Plan for Jobs and in identifying any further actions that can be taken to support the retail sector.</p>

In its most recent National Skills Bulletin, which was published on 25 July last, the Expert Group stated that it considers "skills shortages" to refer to a situation where there are an insufficient number of individuals who have the required qualifications, skills set, and/or experience to fill a particular post.  The Expert Group considers that current skills shortages almost entirely have third level qualification requirements, coupled with experience and a specific skills mix.  The National Skills Bulletin found that the magnitude of shortages is unlikely to be greater than several hundreds in terms of headcount for the overall economy, with the exception of IT skills where the demand is greater especially for experienced personnel who are in demand and short supply globally.   Job vacancies were most frequent for sales and related occupations, including marketing (especially digital marketing) and customer services roles.  Vacancies also arose for IT professionals, science and engineering professionals, business professionals, administrative occupations, IT associate professionals, and personal care occupations.  Language skills continue to be important, particularly for sales and customer service roles but also at a professional level (e.g. ICT, engineering and finance).</p><p><a name='N8'>  The conclusions of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs with regard to the incidence of shortages in specialist skills categories that require a specific skill mix, and also in relation to the persistence of some difficult to fill vacancies, concur with my own experience based on continuing discussions with employers and their industry level representatives.  The Government has brought education and training to the heart of its Action Plan for Jobs.  Initiatives such as Springboard, the ICT Conversion Programme and the target to double the annual number of honours degree ICT graduates to 2,000 by 2018 are aimed at delivering the skills needed by enterprise. n Graduates from these programmes are available to industry and increasing numbers will qualify over the next 18 months.  We will continue to depend on inward migration for highly experienced specialists in ICT who are in short supply globally.  While these are small in number; their recruitment is linked to the additional hiring of a team of graduates and professional staff.  In the area of multilingual skills requirements, I met exporting companies when I launched the Expert Group Report on Key Skills for Enterprise to Trade Internationally.  I am working with the Minister, Deputy Quinn, in the context of the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 to address the specific recommendations in relation to sales and foreign language skills development as identified by companies.  My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Education and Skills to ensure our workforce is well aligned with the skills that employers need now and into the future.</p>

Negotiations regarding the sale of the MBNA Ireland portfolio have culminated in its recent sale by BOA to Apollo Global Management, a leading global alternative investment manager headquartered in New York.   Apollo has more than US$75 billion in assets under management in private equity, credit-oriented capital markets and real estate funds invested across nine industries where the group has considerable knowledge and resources.  This transaction involves approximately 250 employees in Carrick-on-Shannon currently supporting the Irish portfolio transferring to Apollo, under Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations, in 2013 following a transitionary period for the remainder of 2012 and early 2013.  Apollo and BOA are currently finalising the sale contract.  BOA has not yet sold the UK MBNA portfolio which is the other business supported out of Carrick-on-Shannon.  IDA Ireland continues to monitor the situation closely and is providing relevant input into the process as it moves forward.  IDA is in regular contact with Bank of America management in Carrick-on-Shannon and Dublin and at corporate level to monitor developments and is also in contact with Apollo.  IDA last spoke with BOA MBNA management in Carrick-on-Shannon on 27 September 2012 and is scheduled to meet with the local management again in the first week of October.  IDA’s understanding is that while BOA does not now expect to sell this UK MBNA portfolio in the short term, the process remains ongoing and a potential deal could materialise at any time.</p>

To this end, there is ongoing dialogue between the relevant Ministers North and South in all areas to promote economic development in the Border region.  From my own perspective, I attend meetings in the trade and business development sectoral format of the North-South Ministerial Council which are held twice a year.  I also attend two meetings each year of the North-South Plenary which are hosted by either the Taoiseach or the First and Deputy First Ministers.  At these meetings, there is full engagement with Northern Ministers, particularly at the sectoral meetings where I have face-to-face discussions with my NI counterpart, Ms Arlene Foster MLA, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, on issues around cross-Border trade and on the work of InterTrade Ireland, the North-South Implementation Body whose remit is to "exchange information and co-ordinate work on trade, business development and related matters in areas where the two administrations specifically agree it would be in their mutual interest".  InterTrade Ireland is co-funded by my Department and its counterpart in Northern Ireland.  I look forward to meeting Minister Foster again at the next trade and business development sectoral meeting scheduled to be held on 28 November 2012.</p><p><a name='N17'>  My officials engage in ongoing dialogue with their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and keep me informed of all key North-South related issues including the North-South activities of the enterprise development agencies.  In fact, there is a long history of co-operative action between North-South enterprise agencies to achieve mutual benefits.  The enterprise development agencies North and South of the Border have for many years co-operated where this has added value to their activities, and this collaboration has greatly increased in recent years.  Enterprise Ireland, which stimulates the development of indigenous enterprise, has extensive contact with its Northern counterparts and works with them on a range of programmes.  IDA Ireland collaborates with Invest Northern Ireland, for example, in the Northwest Now initiative.  More recently, there have been very positive developments where a wide range of agencies and institutions now co-operate on science and technology issues, including participation in the EU Research Framework Programme.  In addition, my Department provides funding support for enterprise-themed Interreg projects jointly approved with the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.  Through Interreg, my Department has supported a number of North-South projects, including enterprise networking for the Border counties and Northern Ireland, capacity-building initiatives and several other enterprise development projects.   The process of assessing further Interreg projects for joint funding is ongoing.  The Government, along with the enterprise development agencies, will continue to work diligently with the Northern Ireland Executive and its agencies to increase the economic benefits accruing from cross-Border co-operation.</p>

To date, Irish researchers have won ERC awards totalling &#8364;34 million.  While this is not insignificant, there is certainly scope for improvement and I am confident that we will see more success in ERC grants by the end of FP7.  To get a better appreciation of Irish researchers' performance in securing EU funding one has to look at the success rate across FP7 as a whole.  Funding from the ERC is only one part (14.87%) of the overall FP7 budget of &#8364;50 billion over the 2007-13 period.  Since the commencement of FP7 in January 2007 to June 2012, Irish researchers have won awards under the Programme totalling &#8364;438 million, representing a success rate of 21.78%.  This is above the EU average success rate of 20.72%.  This shows that overall Ireland continues to perform very creditably <i>vis-à-vis</i> other EU Member States and that we remain on track to secure our target of &#8364;600 million from FP7.</p>

The obligation to provide a Sunday Premium is derived from Section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 (OWT).  In summary, while the OWT Act specifies the means by which an employer should provide a premium for Sunday working, the nature and value of the premium rate is a matter for negotiation and agreement between the employer and trade union(s) representing employees or between the employer and employees who are affected by Sunday trading, in circumstances where employees are not unionised.  Thus, under section 14 any employee who is required to work on a Sunday, and his or her having to work on that day has not been taken account of in the determination of pay, shall be compensated by the payment to the employee of a reasonable allowance having regard to all the circumstances; or by increasing the employee’s rate of pay by a reasonable amount having regard to all the circumstances; or by granting the employee reasonable paid time off from work having regard to all the circumstances; or by a combination of two or more of the above.</p><p><a name='N22'>  Prior to the High Court ruling in the Grace Fried Chicken case that resulted in the striking down of all Employment Regulation Orders, many EROs had provided premium payments to those required to work on Sundays.  Where EROs had made provision for a Sunday premium, they had only prescribed the level of monetary compensation (e.g. double time; time plus one-third) and had excluded the possibility of the use of the other options under section 14 of the OWT Act.  These provisions were a source of significant concern to employers in sectors in which Sunday is a normal working day.  In some cases, such as the hospitality sector, it is the day of greatest demand for the services provided.  The Duffy-Walsh report accepted that there was validity in the argument that the arrangements in place in JLC sectors with regard to Sunday working were unduly burdensome, particularly in sectors in which Sunday is a normal working day.  In its decision, the High Court had particular regard to the absence of consistency across sectors in relation to such matters as to the requirement to pay a Sunday Premium and a confusion between what had been established in statute for universal application and what was being imposed through EROs.</p><p><a name='N23'>  In this context, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 provides for a new definition of &quot;remuneration&quot; for the purposes of formulating proposals for EROs.  The proposed new statutory definition will ensure that JLCs will no longer set Sunday premium rates or any other conditions of employment already covered by universal standards provided for in existing legislation.  Workers' entitlements to a Sunday Premium will, of course, continue to be reserved under Section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  To complement the removal of the Sunday Premium from the purview of JLCs, I have requested the Labour Relations Commission to develop a Code of Practice on Sunday Working in those sectors covered by JLCs.  The development of this Code will complement the provisions at Section 14 of the OWT Act and ensure that best practices are operated by all employers for those employees who are currently covered by JLCs and who work in sectors where Sunday working is widely practised.</p>

CSO figures show that the strong export performance is continuing.  On a seasonally adjusted basis, goods exports in July increased by 6% on the June figure.  The statistics also show that the seasonally adjusted trade surplus, at just under &#8364;4 billion, increased by over 12% in July as compared to June; and that exports in July 2012, at almost &#8364;8 billion, showed a 13% increase over the July 2011 figure.  This is the latest in a growing list of positive signs in the international environment.  I am determined, through continued implementation of the Government&#8217;s Action Plan for Jobs, to ensure we can accelerate the transition to a sustainable economy, keep growing our exports and create the jobs we need.  <font color="#212100">Central to the Action Plan is ensuring greater access for Irish companies to real opportunities to break into new markets, grow their exports and create much needed jobs for this economy.  In 2011, jobs in exporting companies started to grow again for the first time after three years of contraction,</font> with 21,800 gross gains in full time jobs in Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland supported companies.  <font color="#212100">The Government is determined to build on this in 2012 by improving supports like the establishment of the new Potential Exporters Division in Enterprise Ireland.  Its role is to stimulate greater activity within companies across all regions and to reorient those demonstrating real growth potential from the domestic to the international market place.</font><br><br>  Enterprise Ireland&#8217;s 29 overseas offices and international networks have an important role to play in the internationalisation of its established and start-up client companies, through positioning them to meet the needs of specific international market and guiding them in the right direction regarding market contacts and introductions to potential buyers.  <font color="#212100">On 17 September last, I launched Enterprise Ireland's Annual International Markets Week.  This event is Enterprise Ireland&#8217;s single largest client event and a significant part of Enterprise Ireland&#8217;s strategy to drive Irish exports to support business growth and jobs in Ireland.  During the course of the week, 697 client companies held 2,273 meetings with export advisers to discuss their international growth strategies and help them break into export markets.  This event gives Irish companies the opportunity to discuss and explore their international growth strategies with Enterprise Ireland's team of overseas market advisers and agree specific actions, which Enterprise Ireland will undertake on their behalf in international markets.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#212100">Government policy is to build on the strength of our existing markets and diversify into new ones.  Ministerial-led Trade Missions are an integral part of this process, particularly in countries where government-to-government contracts are a prerequisite for doing business and I have first-hand experience of the importance of these Trade Missions for Irish companies seeking to win overseas contracts.</font></p>

The Annual Rate of Valuation (ARV) is decided by the elected members of each Local Authority in their annual budget.  Conscious of the need to minimise the costs that impact on business, the Minister earlier this year asked all Local Authorities to exercise restraint in setting their 2012 ARVs.  Local Authorities have responded positively.  All but one Local Authority froze or reduced its rate this year.  The one Local Authority that increased its ARV was legally required to do so following the extension of a town boundary.  In order to help businesses to be competitive, we must strive to keep all other costs on businesses as low as possible.  The Action Plan for Jobs contains a range of measures designed to achieve cost reductions across the whole of Government and to support business.</p>

Supporting new and existing indigenous and foreign-owned businesses, across all regions, is central to our plans for recovery, growth and jobs.  The Action Plan for Jobs contains a number of measures which are aimed specifically at the facilitation and incentivisation of national enterprise development from start-ups to growth companies.  The action plan is a whole-Government plan with a national focus across all regions.  The Enterprise Development agencies will be at the forefront of implementing the Action Plan for Jobs across all regions and will ensure enterprises can maximise their contribution to economic and jobs growth.  IDA Ireland’s strategy document, Horizon 2020, sets out the agency’s targets for the 2010-14 period.  These targets include creating 63,000 new jobs in Ireland over that time and securing 50% of these investments to locations outside Dublin and Cork.  The agency has invested heavily in the provision of property solutions tailored to meet the requirements of investors and has developed a network of high-quality Business Parks in locations throughout the Midlands and West regions.  There are a total of 120 IDA-supported companies employing over 17,500 people between both regions reflecting the considerable success that has been achieved in attracting high quality investment to both regions.</p><p><a name='N30'>  A total of nearly €15 million was paid to Enterprise Ireland client companies in the Midland and Western regions in 2011, supporting more than 18,000 jobs.  Of the 92 High Potential Start-ups assisted by Enterprise Ireland throughout the country in 2011, four are based in the Midlands region and eight in the West.  As part of our support for early stage entrepreneurs, I announced an investment of €50,000 by Enterprise Ireland in each of four start-up companies in the West Region on 25 September 2012.  In addition, the Taoiseach announced the €200,000 Competitive Feasibility Fund for the West Region.  Support of up to 50% of eligible expenditure up to €25,000 per project is available and 17 October is the application deadline.  Following Exporting Awareness Events last March and May in Athlone and Galway respectively, further Get Export Ready Workshops were held in Athlone in April and in Galway in June and July 2012, with another event planned for 23 October 2012 in Tullamore.  Community Enterprise Centres located in both regions were approved funding under the Community Enterprise Centre Business Development Funding.  This programme supports funding of the creation of, or maintenance of, a business development function within the enterprise centres concerned.  </p><p><a name='N31'>  In 2012, County and City Enterprise Boards in the Midlands and Western regions have allocated approximately €900,000 in support of over 100 Micro Enterprise Projects.  The Micro Finance Loan Scheme, which was launched last week, will initially facilitate €40 million in additional lending to businesses employing not more than ten people over the next five years, with provision for the scheme to be extended to provide an additional €50 million of lending over a further five years at that point.  Start-ups, sole traders and existing micro-enterprises will be eligible to apply for a loan under the Scheme.  In addition, the Credit Guarantee Scheme will also facilitate €150 million per annum in additional lending for SMEs who, because of a lack of collateral or because of the sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing traditional bank credit.  I am confident that the activities and initiatives being delivered by the Enterprise Development agencies and the County and City Enterprise Boards in both regions will continue to promote investment and employment opportunities among the communities concerned.  These will be kept under review as part of the Action Plan for Jobs of 2013.</p>

Investment aid is intended to promote the economic development of certain disadvantaged areas within the European Union in order to redress regional disparities.  The current Regional Aid Map for 2007-13 was drawn up in accordance with the Commission&#8217;s Regional Aid Guidelines.  The details of the support in terms of aid intensity for each county are available on my Departments website.<br><br>  Under the approved map, Kerry, Limerick, Clare, North Tipperary and the Cork Urban Regeneration area retained entitlement to Regional Aid from 2007 to 2013 for small and medium sized firms at the higher aid rates permitted for such firms under the Regional Aid Guidelines. <br><br>  The process of Member States agreeing the 2014-2021 Regional Aid Guidelines has begun. The Commission is due to forward proposals to Member States in the coming months documenting the structure and provisions that will form the basis of the revised Guidelines. My Department is leading an interagency group that is currently examining issues around the new guidelines, including which counties could be included in the next map.  The group will be examining all counties without prejudice as to their status in the revised group. <br><br>  In accordance with its Horizon 2020 Strategy, IDA Ireland is aiming to create 63,000 direct jobs in 640 investments over the period 2010 to 2014, with 50% of these investments located outside of Dublin and Cork.  The Agency has pointed out that, as it competes for high quality foreign direct investment (FDI), the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services. Ireland has only one Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area, so, in order to achieve regional economic development, IDA prioritises the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass (i.e. sufficient scale of population, skills, infrastructure, companies, business services etc.) and highlights the opportunities provided by other locations on an opportunistic basis, which are within commuting distances of these Gateways. The Gateways in the Mid-West and South West Regions include Limerick and Cork.  With continuing enhancement and improvements in physical and digital infrastructure, an FDI project secured for one Gateway Economic Region has a positive impact on other Gateway Economic Regions and their surrounding areas.<br><br>  At the end of 2011 there were 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  employing in the region of 1,300 people. IDA Ireland has assured me that it will continue to promote Kerry in response to specific client queries and on an opportunistic basis. Approximately 70% of all FDI secured for Ireland is from the existing base of multinationals.  Accordingly, IDA Ireland has retained strong relationships with its existing client base across the country and will continue to work closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and the broadening of their mandate with a view to continuing re-investment in their sites. <br><br>  When IDA becomes aware that one of its client companies is considering downsizing or closing down its activities in Ireland, IDA engages with senior management in the company is question, both at local and corporate level, in an effort to persuade that company to alter its decision.  However, in all cases it is the company who makes the final decision.</p>

This report benchmarks business costs against a range of Ireland&#8217;s key competitor countries in a number of key areas, such as labour costs, property costs, utility costs and business and professional services.  The report also provides an analysis of cost profiles of the manufacturing and services sectors.  <br><br>  In its most recent Cost of Doing Business report, published in 2011, the NCC identified improvements in Ireland&#8217;s competitiveness, particularly in relation to labour costs and property costs.  However, the NCC also advised that further progress is required to ensure that Irish enterprises can compete internationally. <br><br>  Some operating costs for business are largely outside the control of Government.  For example, fuel and energy prices are primarily driven by external factors such as global fossil fuel prices.  However, the Government&#8217;s approach has been to identify those areas of policy it can influence to bring about cost reductions or provide supports to business.<br><br>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 includes an extensive range of measures across Government which will help to reduce costs and support job creation.  These include:<ul style="margin-left:20px">·  Reforming the statutory wage setting mechanisms;<br><br>·  Reducing the administrative burden on business;<br><br>·  Placing downward pressure on insurance costs through the enactment of the Legal Services Bill;<br><br>·  Encouraging all professionals to supply quotes in advance to business customers; and <br><br>·  Encouraging local authorities to exercise restraint in the setting of commercial rates.</ul>  The Government is making good progress on implementing the Action Plan for Jobs.  All of the 160 measures for delivery in the first half of the year have been implemented.  <br><br>  The Government will continue to deliver on its commitments in the Action Plan for Jobs, to work towards the objective of supporting an extra 100,000 jobs in the economy by 2016 and making Ireland the best small country in which to do business. </p>

A number of sectors have potential to progress clustering, particularly in the guise of collaborative industry-led networks which seek to identify mutual objectives which if tackled collaboratively, can have a positive impact on the capability of companies to grow and create employment, wherever they are located. Clustering can be geographically focused, but with advanced technologies and communications, it can be sectorally focussed and operate across regions.  Collaboration between companies is a proven method of enhancing economic performance. Benefits of collaboration include: enhanced productivity and income; increased market share; increased innovation and knowledge transfer; and enhanced capability.</p><p><a name='N9'>  One of the Action Points (2.4) in the Plan is to support industry-led clustering in key areas of opportunity, based on new models, industry proposals, and newly developed niche market strategies and in July last, I announced a new €2m pilot Clustering Programme designed to promote cooperation between businesses and create more jobs.  The Programme is a joint agency initiative, involving Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Forfás.  The goal of this Programme is to support time limited collaborative projects that will achieve measurable benefits to members of the group by addressing the needs of participant companies e.g. sectoral/sub-sectoral development initiatives, supply-chain optimisation, realising economies of scale, exploring export market opportunities and potential convergence opportunities.</p><p><a name='N10'>  Projects must involve a minimum of five companies.  The initiative is aimed at a broad range of businesses serviced by the Enterprise Development Agencies.  Clusters will also be encouraged to seek to find members from other jurisdictions, including Northern Ireland.  </p><p><a name='N11'>  Clusters are proven catalysts of change and companies engaging in collaborative activities can improve their productivity and compete more effectively in domestic and overseas markets, thereby sustaining and creating much needed jobs across the economy.</p><p><a name='N12'>  This pilot programme offers two phases of funding support: Phase 1 Feasibility and Phase 2 Facilitation.  29 applications were received in the first call, which closed on 18 September, of which 22 were for Phase 1 support and 7 were for Phase 2 support. The applications received represent a broad range of companies from across different regions, industry sectors and State Agencies.  Applications are currently being reviewed, by a committee comprising of officials from EI, IDA and Forfás, and funding will be awarded to successful applicants in October/November.</p>

EI maintains a network of offices to ensure it reaches out to support entrepreneurs and established companies throughout the country.   A dedicated unit within Enterprise Ireland - the Potential Exporters Division - holds responsibility for responding to the development needs of such companies; promoting and advocating the export agenda; proactively promoting a range of tailored services, initiatives and grants; helping companies easily access EI services and financial supports; proactively identifying and stimulating companies that demonstrate the potential to grow and establish a developmental agenda with those particular companies.  In addition, the Government’s recently announced €2.25bn infrastructure stimulus package should provide significant opportunities for job creation in the Construction sector.</p>

Enterprise Ireland’s proposals for 2013 are currently under consideration by the agency and have not yet been finalised. Once finalised Enterprise Ireland will submit these proposals to me and to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, reflecting the close involvement of both our Departments in trade-related matters. The proposed schedule will take account of Ireland’s Presidency of the EU that will place particular demands on Ministerial time during the first half of 2013.   For the remainder of 2012, a number of trade missions are planned that will include emerging markets such as Brazil, South Africa, India and Malaysia/Vietnam as well as to Italy, Japan, the UK and Canada where our exporters are already well established. Their purpose is to bring Irish businesses into direct contact with business opportunities abroad.  Such missions are a valuable support to Irish businesses, in terms of establishing their credibility with and gaining access to the business community in the target market. This is particularly the case in countries where government-to-government contacts are a prerequisite for doing business. These trade missions are an integral part of the work of relevant Government Departments and Agencies to develop and expand Ireland’s exports to existing and new markets. They raise Ireland’s profile as a world–class supplier of goods and services and contribute to the generation of incremental sales to foreign markets over the long-term. </p>

Whole of economy data in relation to overall employment by sector and average pay by sector is available from the CSO&#8217;s website in the Quarterly National Household Survey and the Earnings and Labour Costs releases respectively.<br><br>  The data on full-time agency supported employment in respect of jobs created and lost in the period 2008-2011 is set out on the table below by broad industrial sector.  <br><br>  The data indicates that after three years of heavy job losses in the period 2008-2010, the situation improved significantly in 2011 with a net overall increase of 4,439 full-time jobs in agency-supported employment.  This improvement is apparent across all sectors.  However, the International Services sector in particular shows a net increase of 3,752 in the numbers employed in 2011.  It is also worth noting that the net change in the Manufacturing Sector showed only a slight reduction in numbers employed in 2011 in comparison to losses of almost 38,000 sustained in the previous three years.<br><br>  The Action Plan for Jobs identifies a number of key targeted sectors in the Manufacturing and Services areas with the potential to create significant sustainable employment.  The Action Plan identifies the challenges facing each sector and sets out the measures required to ensure these sectors achieve their potential.  Ensuring that all of the measures in the 2012 Action Plan - and in the Action Plans for subsequent years - are implemented will provide the best means of ensuring that employment opportunities are maximised in each sector.   <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Full-Time Job Gains and Job Losses in Enterprise Agencies assisted companies</b><div align="center"><table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"

This Advisory Group chaired by Mr John Perry, T.D., published the Voice of Small Business Report in November, 2011.  This report contained fifty-seven actions across twelve broad policy areas.

This scheme will facilitate €40 million in additional lending over the next five years to businesses employing up to 10 people.  I also intend to announce the formal launch the Temporary Partial Loan Guarantee Scheme in the coming days.  In addition, Government is making sure that Enterprise Ireland continuous to administer the Development Capital Scheme and the Innovation Fund.  This is real evidence of Government getting involved in filling gaps in the market and supporting viable businesses. </p><p><a name='N33'>  We are making solid progress on this crucially important agenda and have already put place a number of measures that will make a practical difference in making it easier for businesses to grow and create jobs.   We will redouble our efforts in the coming year with the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 to ensure that we deliver all possible support to business and relieve as much pressure as possible from business at this difficult time.</p>

The quality of transitions will determine the quality of a worker's career and the smooth functioning of the labour market. <br><br>  Ireland has a comprehensive body of employment rights legislation which has among its objectives the protection of employees and the quality of transitions between different contractual arrangements. Specific areas covered by employment protection legislation include: <ul style="margin-left:20px"><ul style="margin-left:20px"><ul style="margin-left:20px">·  Protection of part-time work<br><br>·  Protection of fixed-term work <br><br>·  Protection of temporary work<br><br>·  Protection of persons engaged by temporary work agencies. <br><br>·  Working time;<br><br>·  Payment of Wages;<br><br>·  Holidays;<br><br>·  National Minimum Wage;<br><br>·  Unfair Dismissal;<br><br>·  Redundancy Payments;<br><br>·  Protection of Young Persons;<br><br>·  Transfer of Undertakings.</ul></ul></ul>  In general, Irish legislation mirrors the broader EU social protection framework in this area. The increase recorded in the August Live Register in the movement of unemployed persons into casual or part time work does facilitate labour market entry.  Opportunities for up-skilling and further career development are essential to advance the inclusive growth objective and to provide individuals with the necessary means to maintain their employability and make transitions work. </p>

I travelled to Waterford in June last to meet the members of the South-East Forum and I was heartened to hear of the progress being made.   <br><br>  Foremost amongst these has been that Enterprise Ireland has supported the establishment of the <i>Eishtec</i>   Call Centre in Waterford city, where employment had reached 230.  This is a very significant achievement and other recent initiatives by Enterprise Ireland in the region included the approval of 14 high quality projects under their competitive feasibility fund, 12 companies being been approved for Graduate Placement. 5 Community Enterprise Centres having been approved for funding for full-time business development managers and a high take-up of the Enterprise Ireland Innovation Voucher scheme in Waterford.<br><br>  The two local County Enterprise boards, in the city and county, have created 59 new jobs and the South East Regional Authority has secured EU funding for a number of enterprise and innovation-focussed projects.<br><br>  FÁS training services having provided training for about 5,000 people and that Agency is also undertaking a wide range of other training initiatives.  Several tourist initiatives are underway in the region and Science Foundation Ireland has funded 8 research awards to Waterford Institute of Technology.<br><br>  Other developments include the first phase of the &#8364;23 million Belview Strategic Water Supply Scheme which was officially opened in February 2012. This will facilitate industrial development and job creation in Kilkenny and the South East. The total investment for this phase of the scheme is &#8364;13m. In March 2012, McDonald&#8217;s Ireland and Dawn Meats announced that Dawn Meats had been awarded a 5 year &#8364;300 million contract to process up to 18,000 tonnes of Irish beef annually for McDonald&#8217;s. The deal has led Dawn Meats to invest &#8364;14.5 million in a new purpose built, state of the art, beef processing facility in Carroll&#8217;s Cross, Co Waterford, creating 65 new jobs. This investment is supported by Enterprise Ireland. <br><br>  I look forward to on-going co-operation and collaboration between all the various stakeholders across the South East region to pursue the Action Plan recommendations. </p>

This legislation provides for certain statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions. </p><p><a name='N44'>  The State provides a number of mechanisms through which these statutory employment rights can be vindicated and enforced. These are provided through the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), The Rights Commissioner Service, The Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT), The Equality Tribunal and the Labour Court.</p><p><a name='N45'>  NERA seeks to secure compliance with employment rights legislation through the provision of education and awareness as well as through routine and complaint driven inspection of employers’ employment records.  NERA also undertakes enforcement activity.  Where an employer has been identified as being in breach of the legislation NERA will request that the employer rectify the breach.  Where such a breach involves underpayment of wages due to an employee NERA will seek rectification for the employee by seeking payment of the monies due. Where an employer fails or refuses to rectify the breach or repay monies due NERA may initiate a prosecution. </p><p><a name='N46'>  Where people have concerns that workers may be exploited or are receiving less than their statutory entitlements the matter should be reported to NERA for investigation.</p><p><a name='N47'>  In other cases complaints may be made to Rights Commissioner Service, the EAT, the Equality Tribunal or the Labour Court depending on the nature of the complaint and the relevant legislation. The relevant body will convene a hearing where both parties will be afforded the opportunity to present their case and the relevant body will issue a determination or recommendation.</p><p><a name='N48'>  It has to be acknowledged that the system that has developed over the years has become complex and in some cases involves long delays. However, I have commenced a root-and-branch reform with the objective of establishing a world-class Workplace Relations Service.  I am happy to report that significant progress has been made to date in that regard.  </p><p><a name='N49'>  In addition to reforming the structures and processes, I also intend to provide for enhanced compliance measures and a new mechanism for enforcing awards of the Adjudicators and of Labour Court Determinations. </p><p><a name='N50'>  The mechanisms I have outlined above relate to people who are legally entitled to work in the state. A situation where an individual, whose immigration status prohibits him or her from working legally in the State, takes up employment and is thus working illegally is different. In such cases both the employer and the employee may be committing an offence.  As the Deputy will be aware, from a recent High Court case, this may prevent a worker in such circumstances from seeking to benefit from the rights laid down in statute. </p><p><a name='N51'>  While NERA, and other authorities, could pursue convictions regarding an employer in breach of certain employment legislation and employment permits legislation, in cases where the employment is illegal, and may succeed in securing penalties on the employer, they are not in a position to seek redress for the employee in such circumstances.  This is because a contract may be unenforceable if it is drawn up for an illegal purpose or in an illegal manner, or if the contract is prohibited by statute whether expressly or implicitly. </p><p><a name='N52'>  On Friday 31st August 2012, Mr Justice Gerard Hogan of the High Court reversed a Labour Court award on the basis that person concerned had no standing to invoke the protection afforded by employment legislation since any contract of employment was an illegal one in the absence of an employment permit which he did not have. Justice Hogan therefore held that the Labour Court could not lawfully have made the awards as the employment contract was substantively illegal.</p><p><a name='N53'>  The issue raised by the High Court judgment is one which has important policy and legal implications in the area of Employment Permits and also in terms of Employment Rights.</p><p><a name='N54'>  As Justice Hogan noted in his judgement, “the Oireachtas must, of course, regulate the labour market by specifically deterring illegal immigrants from taking up employment, as failure to do so could have serious medium term implications for both employment and immigration policy”. The relevant provisions of the Employment Permits Acts of 2003 and 2006 hold that where an employee, who was required to hold an Employment Permit, has failed to do so then he or she is guilty of an offence. Furthermore, while an employer may also be guilty of an offence in this matter, Justice Hogan points out that the legislation provides for a defence with regard to an employer but fails to do so with regard to an employee.</p><p><a name='N55'>  As I understand it, this lack of defence affects the Courts’ scope to interpret the statutory provisions and compels the Court to hold that the legislation has created an absolute offence so far as an employee is concerned. Importantly, Justice Hogan found that it must therefore be taken that the Oireachtas intended that a such a non-national employee automatically commits an offence if he or she does not have a work permit irrespective of the reasons for that failure and that this has implications so far as the civil law is concerned, in that such a contract of employment must also be taken to be void.</p><p><a name='N56'>  The question which now arises is to what extent illegal immigrants should be dissuaded from working illegally in Ireland by virtue of there being a statutory offence to do so, versus, to what extent certain employment rights shall protect vulnerable migrants who find themselves unwittingly in such employment positions. </p><p><a name='N57'>  The Deputy will recognise that this question requires careful consideration as the applicability of rights in one context can have far reaching consequences beyond that originally intended.</p><p><a name='N58'>  I wish to assure the Deputy that I am very concerned by the facts of this case and I will be meeting the individual concerned this week. My Department is treating the matter with the utmost importance and various policy options are currently being considered with a view to an early response.</p>

However, the latest CSO Business Demography returns for 2010 were released on 22 June 2012 and the tables below provide data on business start ups and closures. <br><br>  The terms used in this release are &quot;enterprise birth&quot; which refers to a new business start up, and &quot;enterprise death&quot;, which is a business closure. <br><br>  The CSO identifies enterprise births and deaths by using available economic indicators from administrative data (Revenue Trading returns in Corporate, Income, Employment and VAT activity). Data for 2011 is not yet available as it is dependent on the receipt of administrative data which are not filed until 2012 and are not fully available to CSO until 2013. Similarly, data for years prior to 2006 are not available as the related administrative data are unavailable. <br><br>  The CSO Business Demography Statistics covers the whole business economy as classified by the standard European classification of economic activity i.e. NACE Rev2 B-N excluding activities of holding companies; K 64.20.<br><br>  Table A contains the relevant data concerning enterprise births for 2006-2010 inclusive.<br><br>  Table A: Enterprise Births for 2006-2010 inclusive.<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center" border="0"><tr valign="top"><th width="252" class="tbr"><div align="center">Enterprise Births</div></th><th width="61" class="tblr">2006</th><th width="60" class="tblr">2007</th><th width="59" class="tblr">2008</th><th width="64" class="tblr">2009</th><th width="64" class="tbl">2010</th></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="252" class="r">Business economy excluding activities of holding companies.</td><td width="61" class="lr">16,696</td><td width="60" class="lr">13,461</td><td width="59" class="lr">11,954</td><td width="64" class="lr">13,810</td><td width="64" class="l">11,237</td></tr></table>  Regarding enterprise deaths, the Deputy should be aware that two types of data are available.

Regular meetings of the Transport Sectoral Council are held, where transport issues, including investment, are discussed. The next Transport Sectoral is due to take place on 5 October 2012.</p><p><a name='N4'>  In relation to the A5 cross-border roads project, as the Deputy will be aware in 2006 the previous Fianna Fáil led Government gave a commitment to co-fund the construction of the A5.  However, they made no provision to meet the costs of the A5 post 2012 in either the Four Year Plan or the Infrastructure Investment Priorities Plan 2010 to 2016.  Given that £400 million sterling was due to fall between 2013 and 2016 and given the current state of the country’s Exchequer, it was not feasible to provide this level of funding in the coming years.</p><p><a name='N5'>  Therefore at the NSMC Plenary meeting on 8th November 2011, Ministers noted that the provision of further funding by the Irish Government for the A5 road was being deferred but that the Irish Government will provide £25m per annum in 2015 and 2016 towards the project.  At the subsequent June 2012 NSMC Plenary meeting, it was noted that the N.I. Executive had announced an investment package of major roads including two sections of the A5 project.  In addition it was noted that the Irish Government remains committed to the completion of the co-funded A5 project which is of strategic importance to the North West Region and the island as a whole, but that the Government is not in a position to making funding commitments for the period past 2016 in advance of its consideration of the next capital review framework.  The NSMC Plenary did approve a funding implementation plan for the A5 project to the end of 2016 which incorporated the £50m committed by the Irish Government.</p>

Because the COLA is linked to salary and notional net take-home pay it has been reduced in line with salary reductions in the civil service and with increases in taxation in recent years.<br><br>  Local Post Allowance (LPA) provides assistance towards the additional indirect costs arising from the representative role of officers.  This allowance, which varies according to marital status and grade, is payable at all locations abroad.  Officers serving in designated &#8220;hardship&#8221; posts may also be entitled to a hardship allowance as part of their LPA.  Where payable, this hardship element takes account of factors such as personal security and political tension, health, environmental factors, climate and isolation.  Children&#8217;s Foreign Allowance (CFA) compensates officers for additional costs incurred with regard to their children aged under 18, or under 21 and in full time education. <table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center" border="0"><tr valign="top"><th width="203" class="tbr"><div align="center">Allowance</div></th><th width="146" class="tblr"><div align="center">Number of recipients (excluding staff seconded from other Departments)</div></th><th width="127" valign="bottom" class="tblr"><div align="center">Estimated total cost per annum </div></th><th width="97" class="tbl"><div align="center">Taxable Y/N</div></th></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="203" class="r">Cost of Living Allowance</td><td width="146" class="lr">325 approx at any one time</td><td width="127" class="lr"><div align="right">&#8364;2,394,000</div></td><td width="97" class="l"><div align="center">N</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="203" class="r">Local Post Allowance</td><td width="146" class="lr">as above</td><td width="127" class="lr"><div align="right">&#8364;5,557,000</div></td><td width="97" class="l"><div align="center">N</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="203" class="r">Child Foreign Allowance</td><td width="146" class="lr">Approx 128 officers in respect of 224 children (January 2012)</td><td width="127" class="lr"><div align="right">&#8364;709,000</div></td><td width="97" class="l"><div align="center">N</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="203" class="r">Foreign Service Allowance Other</td><td width="146" class="lr">Approx 16 officers at any one time</td><td width="127" class="lr"><div align="right">&#8364;156,000</div></td><td width="97" class="l"><div align="center">N</div></td></tr></table><br><br>  In addition, the following additional allowances may be paid to officers in particular circumstances, usually in the form of refunds for vouched expenditure or paid directly on behalf of officers:<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center" border="0"><tr valign="top"><th width="203" class="tbr"><img width="1" height="1" src="/icons/ecblank.gif" border="0" alt=""></th><th width="146" class="tblr"><img width="1" height="1" src="/icons/ecblank.gif" border="0" alt=""></th><th width="127" class="tblr"><img width="1" height="1" src="/icons/ecblank.gif" border="0" alt=""></th><th width="97" class="tbl"><img width="1" height="1" src="/icons/ecblank.gif" border="0" alt=""></th></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="203" class="r"><div align="center">Allowance</div></td><td width="146" class="lr"><div align="center">Number of recipients<br><br>(excluding staff seconded from other Departments)</div></td><td width="127" class="lr"><div align="center">Estimated total cost per annum </div></td><td width="97" class="l"><div align="center">Taxable <br><br>Y/N</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="203" class="r">Rent Allowance</td><td width="146" class="lr">265 approx at any one time</td><td width="127" class="lr"><div align="right">&#8364;7,937,000</div></td><td width="97" class="l"><div align="center">N</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="203" class="r">Furniture Allowance</td><td width="146" class="lr">Approx 50 in 2011</td><td width="127" class="lr"><div align="right">&#8364;97,773</div></td><td width="97" class="l"><div align="center">N</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="203" class="r">School Fees Assistance (payable only where local state education is not accessible or of a suitable standard, in order to provide for the child&#8217;s Constitutional right to education)</td><td width="146" class="lr">Approx 46 officers in respect of 76 children<br><br>(January 2012)</td><td width="127" class="lr"><div align="right">&#8364;1,062,000</div></td><td width="97" class="l"><div align="center">N</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="203" class="r">Representational Allowance</td><td width="146" class="lr">Payable at all Missions in relation to vouched expenditure on official representative or promotional activities -

These will be outlined in detail in the Irish Presidency programme that will be published in December 2012.

This will be delivered through high-level political engagement and dedicated work to reinforce the EU legislative agenda.</p><p><a name='N21'>  Our Presidency will be about delivery and implementation.  The Government will seek agreement on those aspects of the Multiannual Financial Framework that remain outstanding following the Cypriot Presidency and will take forward the necessary implementing legislation to cover the 2014-2020 period.

We will work to ensure that.</p><p><a name='N22'>  It will be critically important for Ireland and for the future development of the EU that reform of the Common Agriculture Policy and of the Common Fisheries Policy is advanced.  Progress should also be made on initiatives such as Horizon 2020 (the EU's future framework programme for research and innovation) which will be crucial for the EU's economic development.  This week the Government will meet the College of Commissioners in Brussels to discuss Ireland's Presidency programme and how priority issues across a range of sectors will be advanced.</p>

Furthermore, the Government has equally and consistently been clear in advocating with EU and international partners that it is only through the path of diplomatic negotiations that the serious issues arising from Iran’s nuclear programme can be resolved. It is regrettable that thus far Iran has not been willing to engage in negotiations on the issue with the necessary seriousness and commitment. We hope very much that this will change.</p>

Under this concept, each individual State has the primary responsibility for the protection of its citizens.  It must ensure their safety and security and work to prevent atrocities such as genocide, ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity and war crimes – atrocities which have caused the concept of “responsibility to protect” to be developed in the first instance.  Any objective appraisal of what has occurred in Syria over the past eighteen months will conclude that the Syrian Government has failed utterly in this basic responsibility.  I pointed out in my address to the UN General Assembly on 28 September that the Assad Government is guilty of wholesale slaughter of its own people.  I also made clear that, while the violence is indiscriminate and on an appalling scale, it is not confined to one side.</p><p><a name='N28'>  If the concept of “responsibility to protect” is to have any meaning or relevance for the Syrian people, it is incumbent on the UN Security Council, as the body charged with the maintenance of international peace and security under the UN Charter, to act with one voice in seeking to promote the earliest possible ceasefire and initiation of a political process leading to transition.  That is why I also made clear in my address to the General Assembly that what is now needed, above all else, is a strong Security Council resolution which will authorise targeted sanctions.  This must include a comprehensive arms embargo, against all those who are responsible for violating the human rights of the Syrian people.  That is what the Syrian people want from us, and what they have a right to expect.</p><p><a name='N29'>  There must also be full accountability for human rights abuses.  To prevent further atrocities now, and to save lives now, we must make it clear that atrocities will not go unpunished.  That is why Ireland supports the call by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, by Switzerland and others for the Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.  We will continue working to build up strong cross-regional support within the UN context for such a referral.</p><p><a name='N30'>  The Government will continue to work closely with the UN and international partners to bring about the earliest possible end to the suffering which the Syrian people have endured for too long and to ensure that there will be accountability for the many crimes and atrocities which have been perpetrated against them.</p>

Where it occurs, retired staff are usually re-hired on a pension abatement basis, which means in effect that they continue to receive their pensions and are paid correspondingly reduced salaries by the Department.

Any estimates provided are calculated on the basis that each change mentioned in the question is taken in isolation.  <u>Reducing tax relief on pension contributions to the standard rate.</u><br><br>  I assume the Deputy is referring to individual pension contributions, the tax relief on which is allowed at the taxpayer&#8217;s marginal tax rate &#8212; the standard or higher rate of income tax as appropriate in each case.  A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level.  An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans &#8212; retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts &#8212; by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers.<br><br>  There is, therefore, no statistical basis for providing definitive figures.  However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, it is estimated that the full-year yield to the Exchequer from confining tax relief to the standard rate of 20% in respect of pension contributions to occupational pension schemes, retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts and confining tax relief for the Public Service pension related deduction to the standard rate of 20% would be approximately &#8364;560 million.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Reducing the Standard Fund Threshold from &#8364;2.3m to &#8364;622,500</u><br><br>  The Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) is the maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes which was introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2006 to prevent over-funding of pensions through tax-relieved arrangements.  The SFT was reduced in Budget and Finance Act 2011 by over 50% to a level of &#8364;2.3 million with effect from 7 December 2010 with transitional arrangements to protect the capital values of the pension rights of individuals where these exceeded the reduced SFT on that date.<br><br>  There is currently no underlying data available to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners on which to base reliable estimates of the savings from a further reduction in the SFT to the level indicated in the question.  Information on the numbers and values of individual pension funds or on individual accrued benefits are not generally required to be supplied to the Revenue Commissioners by the administrators of pension schemes and personal pension arrangements.  For these reasons, the estimated savings included in respect the Budget and Finance Act 2011 change in the SFT were quite conservative, based as they were, on incomplete data and using very broad assumptions.<br><br>  My Department has been engaging with representatives of the pensions industry with a view, among other things, to gathering private pensions-related data which may be of value into the future in estimating the costs of potential changes in the pensions&#8217; tax area.  These engagements are ongoing.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Reducing the annual earnings limit from &#8364;115,000 to &#8364;75,000</u><br><br>  I assume that the Deputy is referring to the current annual earnings cap of &#8364;115,000 which operates to limit the level of tax-relieved personal pension contributions in any one year.  The annual earnings cap acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits of annual earnings, to put a ceiling on the annual amount of tax relief an individual taxpayer can obtain on pension contributions.  A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level.  An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans &#8212; Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) &#8212; by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers.  There is, therefore, only a limited statistical basis for providing definitive figures.<br><br>  However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, the Revenue Commissioners inform me that the combined estimated full year yield to the Exchequer from reducing the current annual earnings cap of &#8364;115,000 to &#8364;75,000 in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, RACs and PRSAs would be about &#8364;113 million.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Reducing the maximum tax-free lump sum payment allowable at retirement to &#8364;122,500</u><br><br>  The following arrangements currently apply to retirement lump sums paid under pension arrangements approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  Lump sum amounts up to &#8364;200,000 are paid free of tax.  They are also paid free of USC. The portion of a lump sum between &#8364;200,001 and &#8364;575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%.  This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum.  No USC is chargeable.  Any amount of a lump sum in excess of &#8364;575,000 is taxed at the individual&#8217;s marginal rate of tax (credits and other tax reliefs are available).  In this instance, USC is chargeable on the excess.  These amounts are lifetime amounts with prior lump sums aggregating with later lump sums.<br><br>  I assume from the Deputy&#8217;s question that he is proposing that retirement lump sums in excess of &#8364;122,500 be taxed as outlined above.  As there is no general requirement for data on the number of persons who are receiving payments of retirement lump sums of less than &#8364;200,000 to be returned to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners, I am not in a position to provide definitive figures on the Exchequer impact of reducing the tax-free retirement lump sum amount from &#8364;200,000 to &#8364;122,500.<br><br>  As an exercise that might provide some indication of the scale of the savings involved, it is estimated that just under 10,500 individuals in the public service would be on salaries of over &#8364;82,000 and less than &#8364;133,500 which, under existing pension scheme arrangements generally applying across the public service, would deliver retirement lump sums of between &#8364;122,500 and &#8364;200,000.  If it is assumed that these individuals would retire in line with retirement trends from the public service in a normal year (about 2.5%), then the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums in excess of &#8364;122,500 at 20% could be approximately &#8364;2m in a full year.  I have no data on which to provide a similar estimate in relation to the private sector.  I should point out, however, that one significant difference between public sector and private sector pension schemes is that private sector schemes invariably allow scheme members the option of commuting part of their pension fund for a tax-free lump sum. This option is not available to members of public sector schemes.  Depending on the impact of any tax charge on retirement lump sums, the option to commute part of a pension fund may no longer be exercised by private sector pension scheme members or may be exercised in a manner that reduces the value of the lump sum taken to minimise or avoid any immediate tax charge.</p>

Therefore it is not possible to introduce measures which will direct insurance companies to price in a particular way in response to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) Test-Achats ruling prohibiting gender-differentiation in insurance.   The background to this matter as you are aware is that in its decision of 1st March 2011 the ECJ declared invalid, with effect from 21 December 2012, Article 5(2) of the council directive 2004/113/EC of 13 December 2004.  The effect of this ruling is that all private insurance contracts concluded for the first time from 21 December 2012 as well as any  agreements between parties to extend contracts from that date are prohibited by law from differentiating by gender on price or benefits. </p><p><a name='N6'>  The Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for making the necessary legislative amendments to the Equal Status Act to ensure that they reflect the judgement of the European Court of Justice. The Minister for Justice and Equality expects to announce shortly the details of legislation to amend the Equal Status Acts to reflect this ruling.</p><p><a name='N7'>  In practice, the impact of unisex insurance premium rates may vary depending on the product, reflecting the take-up by each gender and the corresponding risk profile.  However, the exact movement in premiums after 21 December 2012 is difficult to predict.</p><p><a name='N8'>  The Government is aware of the concern of many people that insurance premium costs may increase and as a result the Government agreed on 5 June 2012 that the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation would consider what actions their respective Department might take to address the potential adverse consequences of this ruling. This matter is still being examined as always. In the meantime the best advice to the customer is to shop around.</p>

I have received Government approval to bring forward an amendment, at the Committee Stage of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011, to provide for a regulatory regime for debt management and debt advice companies.</p>

The data show that in 2011 Irish consumer price levels were around 17% higher than the EU27 average.  Price levels in the UK were 2% higher than the EU average, implying that, broadly speaking, price levels in Ireland last year were around 15% higher than in the UK. This, however, compares with a gap of around 30% in 2009, so the situation is improving.  Data in for the year to date point to a continuation of this trend. </p><p><a name='N16'>  In terms of actions to reduce the price difference for consumers, the Deputy will be aware that there has already been significant deregulation in the utility sector, with these prices now set by independent regulators.  Furthermore, the Government is introducing a series of structural reforms, to bring down the cost of doing business, which should also help reduce consumer price inflation.</p>

Relationship Frameworks have been specified that define the nature of the relationship between the Minister for Finance and the banks.

Neither the Central Bank nor the Department of Finance has a statutory function in relation to interest rate decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time. <br><br>  However, notwithstanding that, I have received the following input from the covered banks in response to your question:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>PTSB:</b><br><br>  I am informed by PTSB that it does not have a significant amount of business loans and therefore this question has little relevance to that institution. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>AIB:</b><br><br>  AIB doesn&#8217;t wholly fund itself via the ECB and so reductions in ECB rates don't necessarily lead to a reduction in funding costs for the bank. As part of the restructuring of the bank AIB is required to reduce its levels of ECB funding in exchange for retail / business deposits and historical wholesale market funding. In the case of business loans, most business loans in AIB reference EURIBOR or a form of EURIBOR (e.g. AIB's Business Loan Rate (BLR) is an average of 3 month's historic 3 month EURIBOR fixings). A liquidity premium and margin to cover cost of risk, operational costs and funding costs, is then added to this reference rate to arrive at a total interest rate for the customer. AIB keeps these rates under constant review.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>IBRC:</b><br><br>  The majority of IBRC&#8217;s commercial loan book references money market interbank offer rates &#8211; for Euro based loans, rates are set at a margin above EURIBOR and for sterling based loans interest rates are set as a margin above LIBOR.  Changes in money market Interbank offer rates (i.e. LIBOR or EURIBOR) are applied to individual loan accounts in accordance with the contractual interest reset dates agreed with the borrower. Typically interest rates on IBRC commercial loans are scheduled to reset every month or every three months.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BOI:</b><br><br>  Business lending by Bank of Ireland (BoI) is not linked to ECB rates and therefore BoI has not passed on recent ECB rate reductions on its standard variable rate small business loans. BoI sets interest rates on standard variable rate business loans with reference to BoI&#8217;s cost of funding.  <br><br>  Prior to 2008, the Bank&#8217;s cost of funding was directly linked to official interest rates (e.g. Euribor). When official interest rates moved, it was appropriate to pass on the benefit or cost of that movement to borrowers through the banks standard variable rate. Since 2008, BoI&#8217;s cost of funding has become disconnected from official market interest rates due to:<br><br>  &#8211;the intense competition for customer deposits: as a result deposit rates have not reduced in line with reductions in official interest rates, and;<br><br>  &#8211;the increased cost of issuing stable term wholesale funding, reflecting distressed market conditions, the reduced credit rating of BoI and the Sovereign and heightened concerns regarding the overall euro area.<br><br>  The result of this disconnection is that the Bank&#8217;s cost of funding is no longer directly linked to official interest rates.</p>

I would also like to make the Deputy aware that my Department is currently updating its macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts and these figures will be published in mid-October.   The Deputy might like to know that the data for Net Debt Service up to 2010 are contained in my Department&#8217;s Budgetary &amp; Economic Statistics publication, the most recent edition of which was published in September 2011. The September 2011 and earlier editions of the BES are available on my Department&#8217;s website. I would also like to make the Deputy aware that my department will be publishing the 2012 BES within the next few days. The Net Debt Service figure for 2011 is taken from the accounts of the NTMA.<br><br>  The figures for interest payments on the Promissory Notes are not accounted for as part of national debt servicing and are therefore shown separately in the table.<br><br>  The figures supplied in the table indicate that the annual cost of servicing the National Debt is expected to continue to rise in the coming years as a result of the Debt increasing.

The 30% rate of mortgage interest relief for those who took out their first qualifying home loan between 2004 and 2008 came into effect with the enactment of the Finance Act 2012. The regulations provide for the granting of the relief due to the borrower by the lender within the tax year.   </p><p><a name='N4'>  The mortgage lenders provide mortgage interest relief at source to relevant mortgage holders, which are facilitated by on-going electronic data file transfers between Revenue and each of the 132 individual qualifying lenders. To apply the new 30% rate, specific technology developments were required to Revenue’s and to each of the lenders’ computer systems. Revenue's systems were upgraded to implement the 30% rate last December and Revenue has since been communicating with the various lenders in regard to their IT enhancements, but the speed of upgrading has not been uniform across all lenders. To date, the IT upgrades required to give effect to the 30% rate have been completed by all but one of the lenders and these lenders have either implemented the rate or will do so with effect from next month.  </p><p><a name='N5'>  Revenue is currently in direct contact with the remaining lender to ensure that the additional 5% due to borrowers is paid within the current year and applied retrospectively. Revenue has received commitment from the lender that the rate will be implemented within the current tax year.   </p><p><a name='N6'>  In January 2012, as an interim relieving measure, Revenue advised lenders to grant tax relief at the rate of 25% to those entitled to the new 30% rate of relief, given that the 25% rate was already a feature of the first time buyer mortgage interest relief regime and was not dependent on new IT upgrades taking place.</p>

In the case of the World Bank this amount was USD 36 million; for the IMF it was USD 274 million.

We have also worked with our partners in our programme countries to help ensure that the additional money from debt relief has been spent on programmes that benefit the poor.</p>

The research found that customers whose accounts go into an unauthorised overdraft position pay the highest fees. The highest current account costs occur when consumers have high numbers of out-of-order transactions occurring on their account such as unauthorised overdrafts, unpaid direct debits and over-limit or referral fees. Savings can also potentially be made by using electronic transactions in place of manual transactions, where possible, as manual transactions tend to incur higher costs.<br><br>  If customers are not satisfied with their current account provider for any reason, including cost of fees, they have the right to switch to a different provider.

Where a NEPS psychologist is not assigned to a school, authorities therein may access psychological assessments through SCPA. Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. </p><p><a name='N28'>  It should also be noted that in common with many other psychological services, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for a pupil's initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. I have made enquiries in respect of this case and can inform you that, to date, no request has been made to the assigned NEPS psychologist in relation to the assessment of the child referred to in the Deputies question.</p><p><a name='N29'>  It is the responsibility of the school Principal in the first instance to identify and prioritise pupils for assessment under the process described above. I would suggest that the parents of the child in question should discuss the matter with the school Principal who will advise them as to the appropriateness of a referral to or intervention by the school's assigned NEPS psychologist in this instance.</p><p><a name='N30'>  Should school authorities have specific difficulties with regard any of the foregoing I would suggest that they contact the relevant local NEPS Office (in this instance NEPS Naas Office, Tel: 045-848504) to discuss the matter.</p>

To qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant for the 2012/13 academic year, an applicant must qualify for the standard rate of maintenance grant. In addition, total reckonable income must not exceed €22,703 in the 2011 tax year.  Finally, as at 31st December, 2011, the reckonable income must include one of the eligible long-term social welfare payments prescribed in the Student Grant Scheme.  Supplementary Welfare is considered to be a short-term payment.  Therefore, it is not included as an eligible payment for the purpose of qualifying for the special rates of grant.</p>

To ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of projects to meet the increasing demographic demands will be the main focus for capital investment over the next 5 years, particularly in those areas where it has been identified that most future demographic growth will be concentrated.  Due to competing demands on my Department's capital budget, imposed by the need to prioritise the limited funding available for the provision of additional school accommodation to meet those increasing demographic requirements, it was not possible to include the project referred to by the Deputy in the 5 year construction programme.  Schools, including the one referred to by the Deputy, which have not been included in the five year construction programme, but which were announced for initial inclusion in the building programme will continue to be progressed to final planning stages in anticipation of the possibility of further funds being available to my Department in future years.</p>

Central measuring points, such as post offices, are used where a number of schools are located in an education centre.  Bus Éireann has advised that the student referred to by the Deputy is ineligible for school transport as he not attending his nearest school, having regard to both the central measuring point and actual school locations.  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for school transport on a concessionary basis subject to a number of terms and conditions which are detailed in the scheme.  Bus Éireann has reported that transport on a concessionary basis can be availed of by the student in question on payment of the school transport charge.  The changes to the Post Primary School Transport Scheme are being applied equitably on a national basis.</p>

The new collaborations recommended by the international panel will mean that a smaller number of centres for ITE exist, but that they offer education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education.  These centres for teacher education will also possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity which is not always possible in smaller institutions.  The new configurations will mean strong research bases can be created in each centre.</p><p><a name='N37'>  I have asked the HEA to submit a detailed report, before the end of the year, on how to implement the recommendations of the Panel.

While the purchase price of the land is nominal, the development of the land for use as car parking/set down area will incur significant costs.  In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet significant demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years.  The five year programme announced this year is focused on meeting those demographic needs.  In that context, the purchase and development of lands for purposes other than the provision of additional classrooms and other educational accommodation, is not a priority and cannot be considered at this time.  However, this does not preclude the school authorities from acquiring the land and carrying out the development works concerned.</p>

This Government does not plan to review the decision to end the modern languages in primary schools initiative.</p><p><a name='N42'>  As the Deputy is aware the decision to end the scheme took account of a 2008 Report by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).  The report identified serious issues with curricular overload at primary level.  The NCCA's advice recommended for the present modern languages should not be part of the Primary School Curriculum as an additional and separate subject.  The advice in relation to curriculum overload predated the wake up call on literacy and numeracy triggered by the PISA results.  I am taking that advice on board and with particular regard to the demands on time in school that will result from a heightened focus on literacy and numeracy.</p><p><a name='N43'>  The primary curriculum is currently being reviewed by the NCCA in the context of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy.  The €2.5million in savings from this measure will go towards the cost of implementing the new National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy.  The 17% of primary schools at present in the Initiative, who have had even more time demands than others in a crowded curricular space, should as a result be better placed to deliver under the strategy.  Given the priority of literacy and numeracy, I have acted on the 2008 advice about overload and could not justify either the continuation of the initiative in the existing schools or its expansion to all schools even if funding was not an issue.</p>

Allowances are not payable to new entrants from 1 February 2012. The only exceptions to this prohibition are principal and deputy principal allowances and, subject to certain restrictions, the assistant principal allowance.  These decisions were taken due to the upward pressure on the cost of teacher allowances. These provisions are outlined in Circular 70/2011 and Circular 3/2012.

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department. All schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012. All schools have now been advised by the NCSE of their SNA staffing allocation for the coming school year. Details of the allocations which have been made to each school are available at www.ncse.ie. In making allocations for SNA support for schools, the NCSE considers all of the applications made by schools for  children who have been identified in medical reports as having care needs. The NCSE also reviews any existing SNA provision. In cases where children have diminishing care needs, the NCSE may reduce SNA support for those children.  Where schools have enrolled new pupils with special educational needs who were not considered at the time that the allocations for the 2012/13 school year were made, or where schools are in a position to demonstrate that they cannot cater for the care needs of qualifying children from the level of SNA support which has been  assigned to them, they may apply to the NCSE for additional SNA support or for a review of their SNA allocation.   </p>

At primary level, the Department's policy in relation to languages, as detailed in the Government's National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy (2011), is that pupils will learn two languages, English and Irish. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is currently developing an integrated language curriculum for primary schools in the context of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy. While the focus of this curriculum will be on English and Irish, the integrated approach should help children to transfer skills acquired in one language to other languages and so establish a sound foundation for the learning of a foreign language in post-primary school.

All contracts under the Schools Broadband Access Programme were recently re-tendered. As a result of this the number of service providers has been expanded from 6 to 13 and this should lead to improvements in the quality of services available to schools.  These contracts were signed in July and August 2012 and the migration of schools onto the new services is currently underway.  In most instances contracts were awarded for a two year period with a provision to extend to three years. Where the only solution bid for a school was below optimum levels, such as a satellite connection or a slow DSL connection these contracts were awarded for a one year period to allow the Department to return to the purchasing framework next year to see if an improved service can be procured for these schools.  This is the case in relation to Dromleigh National School where the only viable bid was for a satellite service. </p>

However, the budget measure that requires schools to manage the provision of guidance from within their standard staffing allocation must be seen in the context of the major challenges we have as a Government in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent that we can in these exceptional times. The net impact on overall teacher numbers in our schools has been minimised to the greatest extent possible. Teacher allocations to post primary schools for the 2012/13 school year have effectively been settled at this stage and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. Decisions on how this is done are taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.</p><p><a name='N35'>  A key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target available funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage. All 195 second-level school in DEIS have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools. My Department also provided some limited short-term support to schools through curricular concessions in order to help them manage within their approved teaching allocation. </p><p><a name='N36'>  It is established policy that guidance is a whole school activity and under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students. While the school's guidance planning should involve the guidance counsellor(s) in the first instance, other members of school staff and management also have key roles to play. Parents and students must be seen as an essential part of the process. Through this process schools can, for example, consider the following options for maximising the use of their available resources for the provision of guidance: Optimise the delivery of personal educational, career and vocational guidance in class group settings; Enable students to use directly the extensive range of guidance tools available through the internet from relevant websites (e.g. Qualifax, Careers Portal); Enable some of the curriculum elements of the planned guidance programme to be delivered through other teachers such as SPHE staff; Maximise the role of the pastoral care team in schools; and, Ensure that the guidance counsellor has 1:1 time towards meeting the counselling needs of students experiencing difficulties or crisis. </p><p><a name='N37'>  Psychologists from my Department's National Educational Psychological Service ( NEPS ) also provide a range of supports to schools.

<!-- Snippet ref: WRJ03200 type: 7 --> <a name='WRJ03200'></a> <p><span class="speaker">Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn):</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&HouseNum=31&MemberID=985"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Ruairí Quinn"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=985&pid=RuairiQuinn&year=2012&month=10&day=02"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Ruairí Quinn"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N39'>The Government recently approved a number of measures relating to public service allowances for new beneficiaries.  This follows a public service-wide review of allowances and premium payments conducted by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The main measure affecting teachers is the withdrawal of qualification allowances for new entrant teachers.  The Government has decided that the payment of allowances for the basic qualifications required for entry to the teaching profession is no longer appropriate or necessary.  This allowance goes back many years to the time when a distinction was made between teaching colleges and university qualifications.  It is not considered justifiable to incur a permanent cost to the public service pay and pensions bill where a public servant acquires an additional qualification.  The payment of allowances, such as the Gaeltacht and island allowances, are being withdrawn or altered for all new beneficiaries in the public service, including new teachers. These allowances are no longer considered the most appropriate way to meet the business needs of public service employers or the service delivery needs of Irish language speakers.  The Government was mindful of the impact of the abolition of the qualifications allowance on new teachers given that the allowances have come to be viewed as an element of basic pay.  It therefore sought to ensure broad consistency of impact across sectors. In this context, it has been agreed that new entrant teachers will no longer receive qualification allowances but will start on a salary of €30,702 which is equivalent to the fourth point of the existing salary scale.  They will also have the option of being paid a pensionable allowance of €1,592 for supervision and substitution, thereby bringing their starting salary to €32,294.</p>

The stimulus package comprises two elements: <ul style="margin-left:20px"> ·1.4 billion euro to fund the proposed new Public Private Partnerships (PPP) programme.  This will come from the European Investment Bank, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, domestic banks and other potential sources of funding.  The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) and the Department of Finance are leading on sourcing this funding and are liaising with my Department in this regard. <br><br>  ·850 million euro coming from the proceeds of the sale of State assets and from the new licensing arrangements for the National Lottery, to be used as a project preparation facility for the new PPP programme and to fund additional Exchequer capital projects and other commercial and publicly needed projects.  </ul>  The 1.4 billion euro investment will be directed towards projects that meet key infrastructural needs and are in line with the priorities in the Government's Investment Framework.  These projects will form the first phase of a new programme of PPP's designed to stimulate economic growth and create employment.  As the Phase 1 projects are progressed and as funding permits, projects that could be delivered as part of further phases will be considered.<br><br>  Job creation is a critical priority for Government.  This stimulus will help sustain jobs in the construction sector which has been very badly hit during the recession.  The investment in this Phase 1 package is expected to generate significant numbers of jobs: previous analysis of each sector indicates that the investment will generate around 13,000 jobs.  It will also create much needed social and economic infrastructure and aid economic recovery.  The projects selected are from the education, health, transport and justice sectors.  Further information about the stimulus package and about the PPP projects is available on the website <u><font color="#0000FF">www.ppp.gov.ie</font></u>. <br><br>  My Department and the NDFA are closely engaged with the relevant line Departments and their agencies to ensure that their projects are progressed promptly.  It is expected that tenders will issue across the sectors in 2013 and 2014.</p>

The Deputy may be aware that the Commission on Public Service Pensions examined the issue of compulsory pension scheme membership in its Final Report on Public Service Pensions in 2000.  It did not recommend any change either in the rules providing for automatic membership of the spouses' and children's schemes or in the refund arrangements for membership contributions.  </p><p><a name='N32'>  Public Service spouses' and children's schemes are generally structured on a group insurance basis and the member contribution rates take account of the fact that payment of benefits will not arise in respect of all members.  It is also to be noted there is now a wider range of scheme beneficiaries under the schemes than heretofore.  The Revised Spouses' and Children's Schemes, introduced in most parts of the Public Service in 1984 or shortly afterwards, provide cover for marriages and children born after retirement.  Section 99 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 provides that a benefit under a pension scheme that is provided for the spouse of a person is deemed to provide equally for the civil partner (as defined in the Act) of a person.</p><p><a name='N33'>  If contributions to the scheme were to be made voluntary – or indeed if full refund of contributions was to be permitted if a person was single at retirement, as had been the position before 1984 this would weaken the integrity of the schemes and could undermine fundamentally the financing of the scheme.</p>

Usually, the rehiring of retirees is related to completion of a specific task where their particular skill or experience is required in the short-term.  Situations can arise where a particular issue requires a short-term specialist input in order to complete a task. In many instances the most appropriate and cost-effective way of solving a short-term problem is to bring in someone who has worked in the area and understands the background.  In the vast majority of cases these re-hires are very short-term and project specific. </p><p><a name='N36'>In all cases the salary of a retired civil servant rehired by a Department is subject to the pension abatement rules.</p>

The total net Exchequer capital spend to end September amounted to €1.7 billion.  This represents 47% of the total net capital estimate (€3.6 billion) for the year, which means that €1.9 billion remains to be spent.  For the same period last year, capital expenditure of €2.2 billion accounted for 50% of the 2011 net provisional outturn figure of €4.4 billion.  Individual Departments are responsible for the projects and programmes in their areas and further details about spending on projects and programmes can be obtained directly from the relevant Departments.  Given the uncertainties about precise issues of timing, and given the over-arching requirement to manage both capital and current expenditure within the overall allocations, it is too early at this stage to say what the final capital outturn for 2012 will be for each area.</p><p><a name='N42'>  As the Deputy will be aware, capital spending has general characteristics which influence the allocation drawdown pattern.  Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year.  Obviously, this affects the phasing and profiling of capital expenditure.  In addition, public financial rules require that payments are only made on foot of matured liabilities, so payments made in the later parts of the year are made on foot of work that has already been satisfactorily completed.  The trend is therefore that the bulk of capital expenditure takes place in the final quarter of the year.</p>

The stimulus package comprises two elements: 1.4 billion euro to fund the proposed new Public Private Partnerships (PPP) programme.  This will come from the European Investment Bank, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, domestic banks and other potential sources of funding.  The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) and the Department of Finance are leading on sourcing this funding and are liaising with my Department in this regard; 850 million euro coming from the proceeds of the sale of State assets and from the new licensing arrangements for the National Lottery, to be used as a project preparation facility for the new PPP programme and to fund additional Exchequer capital projects and other commercial and publicly needed projects.  </p><p><a name='N32'>  The 1.4 billion euro investment will be directed towards projects that meet key infrastructural needs and are in line with the priorities in the Government's Investment Framework.  These projects will form the first phase of a new programme of PPP's designed to stimulate economic growth and create employment.  As the Phase 1 projects are progressed and as funding permits, projects that could be delivered as part of further phases will be considered.</p><p><a name='N33'>  Job creation is a critical priority for Government.  This stimulus will help sustain jobs in the construction sector which has been very badly hit during the recession.  The investment in this Phase 1 package is expected to generate significant numbers of jobs: previous analysis of each sector indicates that the investment will generate around 13,000 jobs.  It will also create much needed social and economic infrastructure and aid economic recovery.  The projects selected are from the education, health, transport and justice sectors.  Further information about the stimulus package and about the PPP projects is available on the website www.ppp.gov.ie. </p><p><a name='N34'>  My Department and the NDFA are closely engaged with the relevant line Departments and their agencies to ensure that their projects are progressed promptly.  It is expected that tenders will issue across the sectors in 2013 and 2014.</p>

The Deputy may be aware that the Commission on Public Service Pensions examined the issue of compulsory pension scheme membership in its Final Report on Public Service Pensions in 2000.  It did not recommend any change either in the rules providing for automatic membership of the spouses' and children's schemes or in the refund arrangements for membership contributions.  </p><p><a name='N37'>  Public Service spouses' and children's schemes are generally structured on a group insurance basis and the member contribution rates take account of the fact that payment of benefits will not arise in respect of all members.  It is also to be noted there is now a wider range of scheme beneficiaries under the schemes than heretofore.  The Revised Spouses' and Children's Schemes, introduced in most parts of the Public Service in 1984 or shortly afterwards, provide cover for marriages and children born after retirement.  Section 99 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 provides that a benefit under a pension scheme that is provided for the spouse of a person is deemed to provide equally for the civil partner (as defined in the Act) of a person.</p><p><a name='N38'>  If contributions to the scheme were to be made voluntary – or indeed if full refund of contributions was to be permitted if a person was single at retirement, as had been the position before 1984 this would weaken the integrity of the schemes and could undermine fundamentally the financing of the scheme.</p>

Situations can arise where a particular issue requires a short-term specialist input in order to complete a task.

The total net Exchequer capital spend to end September amounted to €1.7 billion.  This represents 47% of the total net capital estimate (€3.6 billion) for the year, which means that €1.9 billion remains to be spent.  For the same period last year, capital expenditure of €2.2 billion accounted for 50% of the 2011 net provisional outturn figure of €4.4 billion.  Individual Departments are responsible for the projects and programmes in their areas and further details about spending on projects and programmes can be obtained directly from the relevant Departments.  Given the uncertainties about precise issues of timing, and given the over-arching requirement to manage both capital and current expenditure within the overall allocations, it is too early at this stage to say what the final capital outturn for 2012 will be for each area.</p><p><a name='N47'>  As the Deputy will be aware, capital spending has general characteristics which influence the allocation drawdown pattern.  Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year.  Obviously, this affects the phasing and profiling of capital expenditure.  In addition, public financial rules require that payments are only made on foot of matured liabilities, so payments made in the later parts of the year are made on foot of work that has already been satisfactorily completed.

The new standardised leave arrangements will facilitate the creation of a more mobile public service by having personnel across diverse sectors and organisations with harmonized conditions of employment. In addition the new arrangements address annual leave anomalies which may have existed in certain sectors of the public service. These standardised leave arrangements are being implemented at sectoral and organisational level across the public service. These arrangements include for example: <ul type="disc"><li>  The abolition of historically based local leave arrangements such as for example festivals and race meetings<li>  Bringing all public service grades with a current leave allowance in excess of 32 days within that maximum (i.e. 32 days) commencing from 1 January  2012<li>  Placing all public service personnel, on recruitment or promotion, on a new standardised annual leave band ranging from a minimum of 22 days to a maximum of 30 days with immediate effect [i.e.14 December 2011]. </ul>  Any issues that might arise in relation to the implementation of the agreement will be dealt with through the procedures laid down in the Croke Park Agreement where appropriate. It is a matter for the relevant Minister to provide further more specific details in relation to the arrangements that have existed in the past in particular sectors.</p>

This plan identified procurement reform as a key instrument that can assist the public service to deliver services in an efficient manner. </p><p><a name='N14'>  The National Procurement Service (NPS) has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service’s buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service. These national arrangements have benefits that include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency; and enhanced service levels. In some instances the take up of the NPS arrangements has been low. In order to increase the usage of the NPS arrangements and thereby secure best value for money, the Government decided that it should be mandatory for public service bodies to use specified national procurement arrangements.  </p><p><a name='N15'>  Circular 06/12 implements the Government decision by making it a mandatory requirement that public service bodies avail of specified national arrangements put in place by the NPS. The list of categories subject to national procurement arrangements includes: electricity; natural gas; stationery and office supplies; paper; ICT consumables; managed print services; print media advertising;  and, motor vehicles. These national arrangements will secure best value for money and facilitate contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints. </p><p><a name='N16'>  In relation to the issue of whether public service bodies have scope to purchase goods and services locally at prices lower than those under national arrangements - the position is that a public service body making such a purchase will need to explain the rationale for not using the NPS arrangement and provide a value for money justification that takes account of the full costs incurred in managing its own procurement process. </p><p><a name='N17'>  While the key purpose of Circular 6/12 is to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money, it is worth noting that such aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal negative impact, or indeed a positive impact, on SMEs. While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, it should not be taken that single supplier frameworks are to be accepted as the norm. The greater use where appropriate of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring ongoing cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions. </p><p><a name='N18'>  In relation to managed print services (MPS), the value of this national arrangement is estimated to be €100 million over two years. Given the potential value of contracts under the national arrangement and the fact that suppliers are required to provide all of the print and imaging devices upfront, from their own resources, the view was taken by the NPS that the €10 million minimum turnover requirement was proportionate.  Furthermore, in order to facilitate SMEs, tenderers who did not have the required turnover in their own right were invited to partner with other entities to satisfy this requirement.</p>

The aim of Pathways to Work is to ensure that, as the economy recovers, as many of those new jobs as possible are filled by people who are on the Live Register.</p><p><a name='N34'>  Pathways to Work places a particular emphasis on supporting those who are long term unemployed.  It has an objective of ensuring that at least 75,000 of those who are currently long-term unemployed will move into employment by 2015.  It also aims to reduce the average time spent on the Live Register from 21 months, to less than 12 months by the end of 2015.</p><p><a name='N35'>  The establishment of the new integrated National Employment and Entitlement Service under Pathways to Work will transform the nature and level of engagement between our employment services and those who are unemployed.   It will also provide better targeted services to both job seekers and employers.  </p><p><a name='N36'>  The labour market activation measures outlined in Pathways include over 85,000 job placement and work experience places to be delivered this year by the Department of Social Protection, and over 450,000 training and education places to be delivered by the Department of Education and Skills.  </p><p><a name='N37'>  There are also financial supports available to employers who recruit a person who is long term unemployed.  These include Revenue’s “Job Assist” scheme and the Employer’s PRSI Exemption scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection.  As part of the Action Plan process, I have been actively promoting these schemes to employers in recent months, with the support of business representative bodies.  </p><p><a name='N38'>  We must continue to do all we can to facilitate the return to work of those who have lost their jobs.  I am currently preparing the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government and will be exploring further measures which can be taken to transform our economy and support job creation.  </p>

Reducing administrative burdens   has the potential to deliver cost savings and efficiencies for businesses which will assist them in growing employment. This is a key focus for my Department and its Offices and Agencies.</p><p><a name='N41'>  Significant progress has been made by my Department, with a reduction in administrative burdens of 24.8% already achieved in the areas of Employment Law, Company Law and Health &amp; Safety Law; this amounts to annual savings for business of almost €207 million.  Details of all the initiatives making up this total are available on my Department’s website www.djei.ie.</p><p><a name='N42'>  Successful initiatives resulting in significant savings include:</p><p><a name='N43'>§	  In Company Law, savings of €82 million per annum have already been realised, more than €33 million of which are due to the work of the Companies Registration Office (CRO), as companies can submit their annual returns online via the CRO website and can now use digital signatures for the B1 Form and Accounts. </p><p><a name='N44'>§	  The audit exemption threshold has been increased to the maximum level permitted under EU law.  This will achieve potential additional savings for Irish SMEs of approximately €2.8 million annually.</p><p><a name='N45'>§	  In Health &amp; Safety Law, a total of €123 million in annual administrative savings for business has been delivered by the HSA via two key projects: the BeSMART online tool for preparing the Risk Assessment and Safety Statement (€59m), and the SMP20 Guidelines (€64m), which assist construction firms with fewer than 20 employees in establishing and maintaining an effective safety management system.</p><p><a name='N46'>  The reform of the State's Workplace Relations Services, that I set in train last year, will, among other matters, deliver a simplified two-tiered structure comprising a single body of first instance, the Workplace Relations Commission, and a single body of appeal, in effect an enhanced Labour Court. This new structure will provide a better service for both employees and employers, with fewer delays and reduced administrative burdens. Already there has been some significant early progress, including the development of a single complaint form for all workplace relations complaints, the establishment of a single contact portal, Workplace Relations Customer Services, to handle all complaints and enquiries, the launch of a single website, www.workplacerelations.ie, containing all relevant information on employment rights and industrial relations and the commencement of a Pilot Early Resolution Service which will seek to resolve disputes without recourse to adjudication or inspection. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to this new structure.</p><p><a name='N47'>  My Department also coordinates the cross-Government measurement and reduction of administrative burdens towards the 25% target by the end of 2012.  A project to measure the burden imposed by regulation under the responsibility of seven Departments and Revenue was initiated in September 2011.  Following completion of its measurement exercise, each participating Department must then set out how it will achieve the remaining reductions necessary to reach the target and report to Government with its Simplification Plan. Revenue’s report on its administrative burden reductions, which has reached the 25% target, has been published on its website.</p><p><a name='N48'>  The current overall reduction is just over 15% which includes the 24.8 % achieved by my Department, the 25% achieved by Revenue and a 30% reduction achieved by the CSO.</p><p><a name='N49'>  A further initiative, which will be of benefit to small businesses, in particular, has been the launch of businessregulation.ie.  This new website provides a single online source of information on regulations and how to comply with them. Business will no longer have to search multiple Government websites to find out their obligations.  </p><p><a name='N50'>  Work is continuing to identify new areas where administrative burdens on business can be reduced and in this regard the High Level Group on Business Regulation has prioritised a number of areas for attention in its 2012 Work Programme. These areas are currently being considered and will be published in the Group’s annual report later this year.</p>

This is a very significant achievement and other recent initiatives by Enterprise Ireland (EI) in the region included the approval of 14 high quality projects under its Competitive Feasibility Fund, 12 companies being approved for Graduate Placement, 5 Community Enterprise Centres having been approved for funding for full-time business development managers, and, a high take-up of the EI Innovation Voucher scheme in Waterford.<br><br>  The two local County Enterprise boards, in the city and county, have created 59 new jobs and the South East Regional Authority has secured EU funding for a number of enterprise and innovation-focussed projects.<br><br>  Other bodies had also made considerable progress, with FÁS training services having provided training for about 5,000 people and that Agency also undertaking a wide range of other training initiatives.

The following business cases were submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure &amp; Reform in respect of two of these allowances:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Industrial Relations Officer Allowance  </b><ul style="margin-left:20px">(1)  <b>What does the employer receive in return for the allowance?</b></ul>  The role of an IRO is to interact directly with employers, employees, Trade Unions and Employer representative organisations in the Public and Private Sectors in an effort to conciliate solutions to Industrial Relations disputes. The role involves extensive out of hours working and a high degree of individual responsibility for decision making in an often unsupported environment. The nature of industrial dispute intervention by an IRO is a dynamic and unpredictable activity, not amenable to structure in the normal sense of working time organization. The employer receives a commitment on the part of the officer to prioritise his / her work demands, often at short notice, over any other aspect of their time. The employer receives delivery of extensive additional hours working without additional remuneration. It is considered that the degree of individual responsibility undertaken by HEO&#8217;s in the role exceeds that normally undertaken by officers of the grade.<ul style="margin-left:20px">(2)  <b>Is the allowance cost effective/represent value for money?</b></ul>  It is not practicable to envisage the delivery of a conciliation system based on overtime working or on the basis of a &#8216;time in lieu&#8217; arrangement. The operation of an allowance based system ensures maximum productivity from available resources and removes issues around availability of officers from the challenge of providing a responsive service to parties in dispute. In the view of the Commission, the allowance at current rates represents good value for money.<ul style="margin-left:20px">(3)  <b>Other Pertinent Issues (e.g. why duties cannot form part of grade/post; impacts/risks if duties/responsibilities not undertaken) </b></ul>  The Industrial Relations Act, 1990 commits the State to the provision of a Conciliation Service. That service consistently resolves 80% of all disputes referred to it. Access to the service is on a voluntary basis and the parties demand and expect that service delivery will be structured in a manner that responds to the pressures under which the parties operate. Conciliation Service delivery is consistently acknowledged by the Minister and the parties as fundamental to the effective working of our industrial relations system and any diminution or restriction of the service would have significant impacts in terms of dispute activity leading to days lost due to industrial action in the economy. The nature of service delivery requires that the HEO officers are willing and mandated to make decisions and take responsibility for the trajectory of dispute negotiations in an often unsupported environment. It is considered that the degree of such responsibility demanded of HEO IROs is beyond what would normally be demanded of officers in the HEO grade.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Labour Inspector Allowance</b><ul style="margin-left:20px">(1)  <b> What does the employer receive in return for the allowance?</b></ul>  The Labour Inspectorate of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. <br><br>  Labour Inspectors deliver an enforcement and information service in relation to employer obligations and employee rights/entitlements/protections falling due under a wide-ranging body of employment legislation and under Employment Regulation Orders and Registered Employment Agreements. The enforcement authority and powers in this regard, in respect of which the Inspectors are warranted and certified, are provided for in various legislative enactments.<ul style="margin-left:20px">(2)  <b>Is the allowance cost effective/represent value for money?</b></ul>Yes. Inspectors conduct comprehensive audits/inspections of employers to check their compliance with relevant legislative requirements. Such audits/inspections involve the interviewing of employers and of employees at places of employment and detailed examination of employer records. Inspection activity is organised and<b><i>&nbsp;</i></b>performed in line with policy objectives and targets as set down in the NERA Business Plan.  <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><ul style="margin-left:20px">(3)  <b>Other Pertinent Issues (e.g. why duties cannot form part of grade/post; impacts/risks if duties/responsibilities not undertaken) </b></ul>The allowance sanctioned for &#8220;Out of Working Hours&#8221; obligations is in respect of additional hours worked, i.e. Labour Inspectors are required to work up to 17% additional hours outside of normal working hours <b>of which 10% will be out of normal working hours and the remaining 7% will be reckonable activity </b>  and will include, by way of example, -<ul style="margin-left:20px"><ul style="margin-left:20px">  &#8226;Statement Taking<br><br>  &#8226;Remaining with tasks beyond normal finishing time (this does not relate to travelling time)<br><br>  &#8226;Commencing tasks before normal starting time (this does not relate to travelling time)<br><br>  &#8226;Appointments in the exceptional circumstances when an Inspector feels that an employer or employee can only meet with an Inspector outside of normal working hours.</ul></ul></p>

The latter two premises were surplus to State requirements and have been sublet for many years.</p><p><a name='N61'>  Carrisbrook House was acquired by AnCO in 1969 on a 65 year full repairing lease commencing on 1st August 1969 and expiring on 31st   July 2034.  There is no provision for lease breaks and the rent is due for review every seven years. </p><p><a name='N62'>  The Industrial Development Authority acquired assignment of the lease in 1976. Since the relocation of IDA to Wilton Park House in 1985, the Carrisbrook House offices were leased to a number of tenants on a cost-neutral basis to the Exchequer until early 2008 when a major tenant exercised a lease break and vacated the premises.  The Israeli Embassy is currently the only occupant of the premises, on a sub-lease which expires in 2025, with lease break provisions in 2015 and 2020.  Since the departure of the major tenant in May 2008, six floors in Carrisbrook House have been vacant. The total cost of vacant space in Carrisbrook House in 2012 is estimated at €1.3 million, inclusive of rent, rates and service charges.</p><p><a name='N63'>Forfás also holds the lease on Knockmaun House, Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2, which the agency inherited on its establishment.  This lease, which was negotiated by the IDA, commenced on 6th July 1979 and expires on 5th   July 2014.  The premises is held on a full repairing lease for 35 years, with no provision for lease break and is subject to a five yearly rent review. </p><p><a name='N64'>  These premises were sublet on a cost-neutral basis to the Exchequer until April 2009 when one of the tenants availed of a lease break and surrendered their portion of the building amounting to half of one floor. The remainder of the building (4.5 floors)  remains occupied.   The total cost of vacant space in Knockmaun House in 2012 is estimated at €200,000, inclusive of rent, rates, and service charges.</p><p><a name='N65'>  Forfás has been actively seeking to market the vacant space in both Carrisbrook House and Knockmaun House since they became vacant.  Due to the downturn in the property market and a surfeit of vacant office accommodation in Dublin, these efforts have proven unsuccessful to date.  However, Forfás continues to market the availability of the offices. </p><p><a name='N66'>  The Secretary General of my Department has also written to the Office of Public Works, advising them of the availability of this office space.  The IDA have also been asked to bring the availability of this accommodation to the attention of prospective clients. To date, neither body has identified a requirement for the accommodation. </p>

In implementing this Strategy, the Agency has pointed out; however, that as Ireland competes for high quality investments, the concept of scale is crucial. Leading global corporations require a significant population, a pool of qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services. Ireland has only one Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area, so, in order to achieve regional economic development, IDA Ireland prioritises the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the areas of critical mass (i.e. sufficient scale of population/skills/infrastructure/companies/business services/etc.) and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways. <br><br>  The East Region has one Gateway (Dublin) and a number of large towns including Arklow in County Wicklow. IDA Ireland has assured me that, in addition to continuing to seek new foreign direct investment opportunities in Wicklow and the East Region, it will continue to work with existing clients in encouraging them to broaden their mandate and to continue to re-invest in their sites within Wicklow. <br><br><b>Table showing the number of IDA client companies located in County Wicklow in the three year period 2009 to 2011 inclusive, together with the total numbers employed in those companies and the number of new jobs created in each of those years</b><table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center" border="0"><tr valign="top"><th width="204" bgcolor="#EEECE1" valign="middle" class="tbr">Year  </th><th width="89" bgcolor="#EEECE1" valign="middle" class="tblr"><div align="right">2009</div></th><th width="71" bgcolor="#EEECE1" valign="middle" class="tblr"><div align="right">2010</div></th><th width="90" bgcolor="#EEECE1" valign="middle" class="tbl"><div align="right">2011</div></th></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="204" bgcolor="#EEECE1" valign="middle" class="r">No. of Companies</td><td width="89" bgcolor="#EEECE1" valign="middle" class="lr"><div align="right">19</div></td><td width="71" bgcolor="#EEECE1" valign="middle" class="lr"><div align="right">19</div></td><td width="90" bgcolor="#EEECE1" valign="middle" class="l"><div align="right">17</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="204" bgcolor="#EEECE1" valign="middle" class="r">Permanent Employment</td><td width="89" bgcolor="#EEECE1" valign="middle" class="lr"><div align="right">2,328</div></td><td width="71" bgcolor="#EEECE1" valign="middle" class="lr"><div align="right">2,167</div></td><td width="90" bgcolor="#EEECE1" valign="middle" class="l"><div align="right">1,990</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="204" bgcolor="#EEECE1" valign="middle" class="r">New jobs created</td><td width="89" bgcolor="#EEECE1" valign="middle" class="lr"><div align="right">42</div></td><td width="71" bgcolor="#EEECE1" valign="middle" class="lr"><div align="right">5</div></td><td width="90" bgcolor="#EEECE1" valign="middle" class="l"><div align="right">65</div></td></tr></table></p>

Subsequently, the European Standardisation Bodies, CEN-CENELEC and ETSI, following a mandate from the EU Commission, developed harmonised standards for the manufacture of data-enabled mobile phones compatible with a new common charger. This voluntary European standard (EN 62684) was published in December 2010 and was subsequently adopted as an Irish Standard, I.S. EN 62684, in March 2011. The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) contributed to the development of these standards through its representation at the European Standardisation Bodies and as the national standards body. It is important to highlight that these are voluntary standards and the NSAI has no role in monitoring or enforcing them.</p><p><a name='N4'>  I further understand that this sector is regulated the Radio Equipment and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment Directive 1999/5/EC of 9 March 1999 which was transposed into national legislation by the European Communities (Radio Equipment and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment) Regulations 2001 (S.I. 240 of  2001). This legislation falls under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and is enforced in Ireland by the Commission of Communications Regulation (ComReg). The broad aim of the legislation is to ensure safety and free movement of radio and telecommunications equipment throughout the EU.</p>

She was recently invited by the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection to outline the business of the forthcoming EPSCO and to brief the Committee on her priorities for the forthcoming EU Presidency in the first half of 2013. </p><p><a name='N7'>The main topic of political discussion at Employment and Social Affairs Council on 4 October will be the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy and the need to strengthen attention to employment issues within economic governance. The focus will be on lessons learned from the second European Semester cycle in 2012. </p><p><a name='N8'>  Discussion at the EPSCO Council this week will be on the basis of a paper prepared by the Cypriot Presidency as well as the input provided by the Council’s preparatory bodies – the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee. The Commission has also made proposals for more regular and structured contacts with Member States to take place following its presentation in November of the 2013 Annual Growth Survey. </p><p><a name='N9'>  A strong EU employment agenda represents a pathway towards economic recovery and a way out of the current social crisis. The EU institutions, governments, trade unions, employers, and civil society interests need to work together to build this pathway. This calls for stepping up coordination, surveillance and peer pressure to deliver on National Job Plans. Whilst labour market, skills issues, and social policies are a Member State competence within the EU, other Member States in the Union have an interest in ensuring that deficiencies are tackled, and reforms implemented. </p><p><a name='N10'>  The discussion on the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy at the EPSCO Council on 4 October will be complemented by a parallel discussion at the ECOFIN on 9 October. It is anticipated that refreshed arrangements for the conduct of the third European Semester cycle will then be reflected in a Presidency Roadmap which is likely to be adopted by the General Affairs Council in December.</p>

An official from my Department chairs the <i>Interdepartmental Committee on Science, Technology and Innovation, </i>  which reports to the Cabinet Committee and has overall responsibility for driving implementation of Government policy on STI.<br><br>  I chair the <i>Research Prioritisation Action Group</i>, which was convened to drive implementation of the recommendations arising from the Research Prioritisation Report and to ensure that future public investment by research funders is aligned with the 14 areas of opportunity identified in the Report. My Department also chairs the <i>Technology Ireland </i>  group, which allows representatives from the key research funding agencies to ensure maximum complementarity in their activities.<br><br>  Officials from my Department are members of the <i>Health Research Group</i>, established to coordinate health research policy at a national level and of the <i>Marine Coordination Group</i>  , which brings together representatives of Departments with an involvement in maritime issues including STI Policy issues.<br><br>  I, Minister Bruton, and officials from my Department regularly attend a range of EU meetings concerned with STI policy including the European Council's Competitiveness configuration, which ensures an integrated approach to the enhancement of competitiveness and growth in Europe. <i>Scientific Research and Technological Development</i> is one of the three strands of this configuration. My Department represents Ireland on the Councils of the <i>European Molecular Biology Conference (EMBC)</i> and the <i>European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)</i> as well as on the senior officials group of <i>COST</i>, a framework which supports cooperation between scientists and researchers across Europe.

Some missions may include initiatives or the signing of agreements relating to joint venture collaboration with Ireland on a range of activities such as research, innovation, or the provision of education services. Participation on missions is arranged so that the interests of those travelling relates with the individual mission objectives.      In a substantial number of trade missions, representatives from the scientific community are represented in the form of Science Foundation Ireland or other research/educational establishments (e.g. SFI is travelling to Brazil for the trade mission in October). Enterprise Ireland notifies all relevant Government Departments and state agencies of upcoming trade missions and always seeks to involve parties relevant to each trade mission based on the specific trade mission market and sector focus. Individual institutions, such as third level colleges and universities, can opt to participate where this would be of benefit to them.  </p>

It will also provide better targeted services to both job seekers and employers.  </p><p><a name='N22'>  Pathways to Work includes the objective of ensuring that at least 75,000 of those who are currently long-term unemployed will move into employment by 2015.

This report benchmarks business costs against a range of Ireland’s key competitor countries in a number of areas, such as labour costs, property costs, utility costs and business and professional services.  The report also provides an analysis of cost profiles of the manufacturing and services sectors.  </p><p><a name='N33'>  In its most recent Cost of Doing Business report, published in 2011, the NCC identified improvements in Ireland’s competitiveness, particularly in relation to labour costs and property costs.  However, the NCC also advised that further progress is required to ensure that Irish enterprises can compete internationally. </p><p><a name='N34'>  Some operating costs for business are largely outside the control of Government.  For example, fuel and energy prices are heavily influenced by external factors such as global fossil fuel prices.  However, the Government’s approach has been to identify those areas of policy it can influence to bring about cost reductions or provide supports to business.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 includes an extensive range of measures across Government which will help to reduce costs and support job creation.  </p><p><a name='N35'>  A range financial and non-financial supports and incentives are also available from Government Departments, Offices and Agencies to support employment creation in all sectors. These include schemes such as Revenue Job Assist, the Employers' Job PRSI Incentive Scheme and the Job Expansion Fund.  Details of financial supports for business are available on my Department’s website, www.enterprise.gov.ie.</p>

<!-- Snippet ref: WRM02100 type: 7 --> <a name='WRM02100'></a> <p><span class="speaker">Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton):</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&HouseNum=31&MemberID=119"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Richard Bruton"></a>&nbsp;<a href="../zoomin?readform&chamber=dail&memberid=119&pid=RichardBruton&year=2012&month=10&day=02"><img src="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Richard Bruton"></a>&nbsp;<a name='N37'>The main reasons for job losses throughout the country have been well flagged and include a lack of consumer demand, difficulties accessing certain business finance, cost competitiveness issues and the impact of the global economic downturn on the Irish economy.  Also, recent jobs losses which have occurred in the FDI sector in Ireland are largely the result of the continuing restructuring process that is on-going in Ireland and other developed economies, driven by competitive pressures and technological change.  This can result in jobs at the lower end of the value added scale being either phased out completely or relocated to lower cost locations.<br><br>However, the most recent report from the National Competitiveness Council, <i>&#8220;Ireland&#8217;s Competitiveness Scorecard 2012&#8221;</i>  , has pointed out that Ireland has become significantly more cost competitive. In terms of international measures, the World Economic Forum (WEF) rankings showed Ireland&#8217;s position improving two places to 27th last September, while the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook released in May showing Ireland&#8217;s headline position recovering back into the top 20 (up from 24th) and 8th out of the 24 EU countries featured.  <br><br>  Our current policies are geared to bring about a transformation of the Irish enterprise sector to ensure that we are in a position to avail of the opportunities that will arise as the global economy returns to growth.  <br><br>  The Action Plan for Jobs aims to transform the operating environment for business in order to support enterprise growth and job creation.  The Government will achieve this objective by systematically removing obstacles to competitiveness, putting downward pressure on business costs, promoting innovation and trade, supporting new and existing businesses to develop and expand, and by deepening the impact of foreign direct investment in Ireland.  The Government has identified, in the Action Plan, a number of key sectors where Ireland can gain competitive advantage in global markets.  The Plan has also set a target of supporting the creation of 100,000 net new jobs over the period 2012 to 2016, with the longer term objective of having two million people at work by 2020 as part of our goal of making Ireland the best small country in which to do business.  <br><br>  We are reforming supports to small businesses, we have published the National Research Prioritisation Exercise, and we have launched the Succeed in Ireland scheme to help identify and encourage companies that might set up in Ireland.   <br><br>  In addition to the wide-range of programmes being delivered by the Enterprise Agencies, I am also focusing on other measures to address the challenge of access to finance being faced by SMEs.  Last Thursday, I launched the new Microfinance Loan Fund and I will shortly be launching the Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme.<br><br>  We are making solid progress on this crucially important agenda and have already put place a number of measures that will make a practical difference in making it easier for businesses to grow and create jobs.   We will redouble our efforts in the coming year with the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 to ensure that we put in place policies that respond in a meaningful way to the many challenges faced by business on a daily basis.</p>

The international economic environment is therefore a key influencing factor in our economic performance.</p><p><a name='N40'>  Notwithstanding a difficult trading environment last year, Enterprise Ireland client companies achieved €15.2 billion in export sales last year – the highest level ever recorded.  This demonstrates the strengths that Irish companies possess when it comes to selling their goods and services abroad.    </p><p><a name='N41'>  At a domestic level, we need to continue to build on the competitiveness gains we have made in recent years and build a strong foundation to support employment creation and retention.  </p><p><a name='N42'>  Through the Action Plan for Jobs, the Government is systematically removing obstacles to competitiveness, putting downward pressure on business costs, promoting innovation and trade, supporting new and existing businesses to develop and expand, and deepening the impact of foreign direct investment in Ireland. The Government has also identified, in the Action Plan, a number of key sectors where Ireland can gain competitive advantage in global markets.The positive impact of the Government’s policies on job creation are beginning to show.  2011 saw a net increase of 6,000 jobs in IDA-supported companies and a number of major foreign direct investments have been announced so far this year which have the potential to support a further 6,000 jobs as the projects come on stream.  Employment in Enterprise Ireland’s client companies stabilised in 2011 after 30,000 job losses in the period 2007 to 2010.  In the first eight months of 2012, a total of 4,669 job commitments over the next three years have been secured, linked to Enterprise Ireland approvals to client companies.</p><p><a name='N43'>  Overall, we are seeing a stabilisation in the level of private sector employment, particularly in areas targeted by the Action Plan for Jobs.  For example, employment in the tourism sector increased by 6,300 in the period June 2011 to June 2012.  Employment also increased in Agriculture and the ICT sectors, underscoring the shift in our activity away from the old, failed economy based on property, banking and debt, to a new sustainable economy based on enterprise, exports and innovation.</p>

For strategic skills or labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors, Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand. The various schemes that give effect to such policies were introduced following enactment of the Employment Permits Act, 2006.<br><br>In early 2009, the Department undertook a review of employment permit arrangements to ensure their continuing relevance to the needs of the Irish labour market. As an outcome of this review, more stringent eligibility criteria were implemented for prospective new entrants to the work permit schemes from 1 June 2009 onwards. The main features of the new measures included:<ul style="margin-left:20px"><ul style="margin-left:20px">§  expanding the ineligible list of occupations for which permits can be issued;<br><br>§increasing by 50% the fees charged at renewal stage for new permits issued after 1 June 2009, and<br><br>§  reduction in the number of occupations for which Green Cards are issued.  </ul></ul>  The Employment Permits Act 2006 allows for regular review of Ireland&#8217;s economic migration policies and my Department keeps these policies under review, in line with the emerging needs of the labour market, on an on-going basis.<br><br>  Other EU countries may also review their policies in this regard depending on the factors pertaining to their respective economies.</p>

However, while upward only rent reviews are one of a number of factors which are causing pressure on the commercial and retail sectors at the present time, there are other factors influencing decisions of individual retailers to cut jobs.  The retail sector has seen a disproportionate fall in activity due to the fall in consumer confidence and a reduction in discretionary spending by the Irish consumers. <br><br>  The Government recognises the importance of the Retail sector to the economy.  It is employment-intensive and covers every community in the country.<br><br>  Combined with wholesale, the sector employs 258,000 people in Ireland &#8211; that is almost 15% of our total workforce.  Recognising its importance to the economy, the Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of specific measures aimed at supporting employment in the retail sector in 2012.  These actions are for delivery across a number of Departments and agencies and include a renewed focus on prompt payments, an assessment of the potential for future development of the retail sector, the introduction of a statutory code of practice for grocery goods undertakings and providing support to retail firms seeking to internationalise.<br><br>  Other more general measures in the Action Plan will also help to support employment the retail sector including:<ul style="margin-left:20px">·  improved access to finance for businesses;<br><br>·  the enactment of legislation to reform the statutory wage setting mechanisms; and<br><br>·  acceleration of the programme of revaluation of commercial premises, which will provide a basis for the adjustment in commercial rates. </ul>  Initiatives which the Government introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative in May of last year will also continue to help support employment in the retail sector.  These include the halving of Employer&#8217;s PRSI on earnings up to &#8364;356 per week and the reduction in the 13.5% VAT rate to 9% on certain goods and services.</p>

As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I have set-out an approach which is focused on economic recovery, by delivering improvements in competitiveness, ensuring companies have access to the finance they need to grow and by prioritising innovation as a key driver of success which will lead to jobs and export growth.</p><p><a name='N61'>  My Department and the relevant State Agencies under its remit, have a clear focus on the potential and opportunities that exist and can be created. Enterprise development Agencies, Enterprise Ireland, IDA and Science Foundation Ireland,  provide a spectrum of innovation and technology development programmes that deliver  financial, technical and experiential support to help companies become more innovative, encourage and support competitiveness, and help them grow their sales and exports in order to create a climate in which  sustainable employment will grow and expand. It is my view that Innovation and the use of technology will be among the core drivers of job creation in Ireland’s key sectors during 2012 and into the coming years.</p><p><a name='N62'>  A wide range of programmes are being delivered by the Enterprise Agencies - Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland  and Science Foundation Ireland, to promote research &amp; development and innovation and give Irish enterprise a competitive edge in the global market place.</p><p><a name='N63'>  Enterprise Ireland, the agency responsible for the development and promotion of the indigenous business sector, is focused on the growth of world-class Irish companies to achieve strong positions in global markets. Enterprise Ireland provides research, development and technological innovation support relevant at all stages of company development, enabling companies to progress from undertaking an initial research project to higher level innovation and R&amp;D activities. Enterprise Ireland funds the undertaking of R&amp;D to support significant in-company projects which have the potential to develop new processes, products and services.</p><p><a name='N64'>  Enterprise Ireland has a range of programmes and soft supports focusing on research, development and innovation to facilitate and support businesses to compete sustainably in international markets. Information on all supports for research and development is available on the websites of Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards.</p><p><a name='N65'>  In addition, Enterprise Ireland is engaged in efforts to extract maximum value from Ireland’s research system – the objective is to work with companies to secure commercial purpose, leading to jobs and sales, for technologies and ideas developed in Irish research institutions. Enterprise Ireland also operates a range of supports to help companies engage with third level researchers to undertake collaborative research for the benefit of the company. Larger collaborative research projects involving groups of companies are also supported.</p><p><a name='N66'>  Enterprise Ireland are engaged in a number of specific opportunities to assist the SME sector to avail of its support programmes.</p><p><a name='N67'>  For example, through the Enterprise Europe Network which includes Enterprise Ireland and the Chambers of Commerce of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Sligo and Waterford, Enterprise Ireland produced a new on-line directory of innovation supports to assist companies and their advisers in sourcing the various forms of support required to promote innovation and R&amp;D.  This new directory was promoted through a series of workshops and seminars held in the various regions.  The new directory is now available through the internationally co-ordinated Enterprise Europe Network website.</p><p><a name='N68'>  Enterprise Ireland has appointed a panel of 38 Advocates whose role is to assist companies in formulating projects to develop their business through innovation and R&amp;D.  This follows on from previous successful Advocate programmes which have assisted companies to identify their best options for development of new products, processes and services in order to grow sales into new international markets.</p><p><a name='N69'>  The Industry Research &amp; Development Group (IRDG) Innovation Network, supported by Enterprise Ireland, has been undertaking a range of successful seminars around the country including seminars on R&amp;D Tax Credits (including a workshop on Audits), an event devoted to Services Innovation in Waterford and promotion of collaboration through the “Supporting Business In The Mid-West” seminar held at the University of Limerick.  This seminar was designed to highlight the benefits of collaboration with Higher Education Institutes for businesses in the Mid-West.</p><p><a name='N70'>  The Irish Software Innovation Network (ISIN), funded by Enterprise Ireland and managed by the Irish Software Association (ISA), offers a free matchmaking and knowledge-brokering service to help software companies to identify and engage with relevant third-level research institutes.</p><p><a name='N71'>  The Construction Information Technology Alliance (CITA), funded by Enterprise Ireland, aims to leverage Building/Business Information Modelling (BIM) to facilitate integrated project delivery and reduced costs in construction industry.</p><p><a name='N72'>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs Enterprise Ireland is actively working with IDA Ireland to attract companies to avail of R&amp;D tax credits for the first time.  The preliminary work involves the development of an updated R&amp;D tax credit brochure, which will be jointly issued by the two agencies later this year. The next stage will involve a series of agency workshops which will promote an understanding and use of “R&amp;D tax credits”.</p><p><a name='N73'>  Research and development support programmes and initiatives will continue to be delivered by the enterprise agencies in support of Irish businesses in order to drive growth, sustainability, exports and job creation.  My department and its enterprise agencies will continue to promote the application of research &amp; development and innovation to gain competitive advantage and to build on the strengths that have emerged from the investment to date in Science Technology and Innovation.</p>

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice. The first two involve the enhancement of the website <a href="http://www.keepingyourhome.ie"><u><font color="#0000FF">www.keepingyourhome.ie</font></u></a>   and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears. <br><br>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders. This advice will be provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main recognised accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.<br><br>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower&#8217;s choosing for the provision of this advice.<br><br>  An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main recognised accountancy bodies and the lenders. The general scope of the advice will be limited to the borrower&#8217;s principal private residence. <br><br>  The advisory framework has commenced with practising accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.  <br><br>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as requested by borrowers. While the advisory framework will be monitored on an on-going basis, it is not intended to conduct a formal review of the scheme before the due date of  2013. At this time, other interested parties who meet the criteria in terms of qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc., may be considered for inclusion.   <br><br>The accountancy bodies have notified their members about the new service and a panel is available on a county by county basis on the website <a href="http://www.keepingyourhome.ie"><u><font color="#0000FF">www.keepingyourhome.ie</font></u></a><u><font color="#0000FF">.</font></u></p>

QCIs are paid as supplements to weekly social welfare benefits and allowances in recognition of the need for greater incomes among benefit-dependent households with dependent children. The current full rate of payment is &#8364;29.80 per week per dependent child having increased in recent years after a considerable period of being frozen in value. The estimated expenditure on qualified child increase in 2012 is around &#8364;675 million. <br><br>  QCI payments do not of themselves constitute a specific social welfare scheme and entitlement to the appropriate primary adult payment must be established in the first instance.  <br><br>  Social welfare payments consist of a personal rate with increases for qualified adults and children depending on the household composition. In order to be regarded as a qualified child the child must be ordinarily resident in the State (except where EU rules provide otherwise), not be in legal custody, satisfy the age condition attaching to the particular payment and normally reside with the claimant. Where children continue in full-time education, payment of the QCI can continue up to 22 years of age or up to the end of the academic year in which the child reaches 22 in the case of long-term payments as well as short-term payments that have been in payment for at least 156 days.  A full rate QCI is payable where a qualified adult increase is also awarded or for those claimants who are parenting alone.  A reduced rate QCI is payable for children in cases where the claimant&#8217;s spouse/partner&#8217;s income exceeds a certain limit. The upper income limit is currently set at &#8364;400 a week.  <br><br>  Child benefit is a universal payment that assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty. The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &#8364;2 billion. Child benefit payment is non means-tested and non-taxable and is payable to the parents or guardians of children. There is no specific requirement for an applicant to be in receipt of child benefit payment in order to qualify for payment of a qualified child increase.<br><br>In cases where the circumstances so warrant, arrangements may be made for a qualified adult, or another person, to receive a specified amount of a social welfare payment, including the amount payable as a qualified child increase, on behalf of the claimant, most usually where it is likely that the amount of benefit payable would not otherwise be used for the subsistence of the family unit. Details in relation to calculating a split payment are included in DSP operational guidelines available on the DSP website at this address <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/OperationalGuidelines/Pages/seppayments.aspx"><u><font color="#0000FF">http://www.welfare.ie/EN/OperationalGuidelines/Pages/seppayments.aspx</font></u></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>  The application of the guidelines allows for the investigation of specific circumstances and if the Deputy wishes to have a particular case considered, he can arrange to have it brought to the attention of my Department for consideration.</p>

A breakdown of the customers per affected area is provided in the following tabular statement.<br><br>  Any person continuing to experience hardship as a result of the floods in Cork should contact their local department representative administering the supplementary allowance scheme who may be able to offer assistance.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Number of Individuals who received assistance in Cork 2012 following flooding:</b><table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center" border="0"><tr valign="top"><th width="47%" valign="middle" class="tbr"><div align="center">Location</div></th><th width="53%" valign="middle" class="tbl"><div align="center">No. of Individuals</div></th></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="47%" class="r"><img width="1" height="1" src="/icons/ecblank.gif" border="0" alt=""></td><td width="53%" class="l"><img width="1" height="1" src="/icons/ecblank.gif" border="0" alt=""></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="47%" valign="middle" class="r"><img width="1" height="1" src="/icons/ecblank.gif" border="0" alt=""></td><td width="53%" valign="middle" class="l"><img width="1" height="1" src="/icons/ecblank.gif" border="0" alt=""></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="47%" valign="middle" class="r"><div align="center">Blackpool</div></td><td width="53%" valign="middle" class="l"><div align="center">28</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="47%" valign="middle" class="r"><div align="center">Ballyvolane</div></td><td width="53%" valign="middle" class="l"><div align="center">16</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="47%" valign="middle" class="r"><div align="center">Glanmire</div></td><td width="53%" valign="middle" class="l"><div align="center">25</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="47%" valign="middle" class="r"><div align="center">Clonakilty</div></td><td width="53%" valign="middle" class="l"><div align="center">14</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="47%" valign="middle" class="r"><div align="center">Commons Road</div></td><td width="53%" valign="middle" class="l"><div align="center">2</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="47%" valign="middle" class="r"><div align="center">Douglas</div></td><td width="53%" valign="middle" class="l"><div align="center">3</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="47%" valign="middle" class="r"><div align="center">Gurranabraher</div></td><td width="53%" valign="middle" class="l"><div align="center">2</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="47%" valign="middle" class="r"><div align="center">Inishannon</div></td><td width="53%" valign="middle" class="l"><div align="center">2</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="47%" valign="middle" class="r"><div align="center">Kilnap</div></td><td width="53%" valign="middle" class="l"><div align="center">2</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="47%" valign="middle" class="r"><div align="center">Rathcormac</div></td><td width="53%" valign="middle" class="l"><div align="center">1</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="47%" valign="middle" class="r"><div align="center">Dripsey</div></td><td width="53%" valign="middle" class="l"><div align="center">1</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="47%" valign="middle" class="r"><div align="center">Farranree</div></td><td width="53%" valign="middle" class="l"><div align="center">1</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="47%" class="r"><img width="1" height="1" src="/icons/ecblank.gif" border="0" alt=""></td><td width="53%" class="l"><img width="1" height="1" src="/icons/ecblank.gif" border="0" alt=""></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="47%" class="r"><img width="1" height="1" src="/icons/ecblank.gif" border="0" alt=""></td><td width="53%" class="l"><img width="1" height="1" src="/icons/ecblank.gif" border="0" alt=""></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="47%" valign="middle" class="r"><div align="center">Total</div></td><td width="53%" valign="middle" class="l"><div align="center">97</div></td></tr></table></p>

The employer referred to in this instance does not meet the definition of insolvency for the purposes of the scheme.     </p><p><a name='N54'>  The entitlements covered by the scheme include wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice due under the Minimum Notice &amp; Terms of Employment Acts, 1973-2001, and certain pension contributions.

For means test purposes, account is taken of the income and assets of both the claimant and his or her spouse/partner including the earnings of the spouse.

When determining the assessable income from employment, the average weekly earnings, are determined by reference to the earnings received in the 13 weeks preceding the date of claim or such other period the deciding officer may consider appropriate having regard to the circumstances of the case.  There is no provision for discretion where a person&#8217;s means exceed the threshold appropriate for that family. However, if the claimant&#8217;s spouse/partner&#8217;s earnings have decreased (even to a very limited extent) since the original assessment, the claimant should contact the local office and seek to have his or means re-assessed.</p>

The scheme, which is means tested, is available to people whose homes were damaged in the flooding and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair as a result of the flooding damage.</p><p><a name='N6'>  The counties mainly affected by the autumn 2011 flooding were Dublin and Monaghan. Payments to the value of €865,444 have been paid in respect of 945 claims in Dublin and €28,767 in respect of 46 claims in Monaghan. The average value of total payments made is €902. </p><p><a name='N7'>  The humanitarian assistance scheme is a non-statutory scheme and is not covered under social welfare legislation.  It is one of a number of social welfare schemes which operates on an administrative basis. Administrative schemes are not appealable under social welfare legislation. However, where a person is dissatisfied with a decision they can request to have their case reviewed by another officer.  This review will be carried out by an officer not involved in the original decision.</p><p><a name='N8'>  Any person who may experience hardship as a result of flooding should contact their local department representative administering the supplementary allowance scheme who may be able to offer assistance.</p>

There are approximately 33,500 customers in receipt of a basic weekly SWA payment for which the Government has provided &#8364;160 million in 2012. <br><br>  Basic weekly SWA payments are generally paid to customers who are awaiting a decision, or a decision following an appeal for a social welfare payment, or to those who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. While it was never the intention that basic SWA would be paid on a longer term basis there are approximately 9,600 customers in receipt of the payment for more than one year. Customers in this category include asylum seekers who do not have access to primary social welfare payments or those who are ill but do not qualify for a payment under the Department&#8217;s primary illness related schemes.  There is no basis in social welfare legislation to deem this scheme as a long term payment for recipients of the payment for periods in excess of one year.  <br><br>A key objective of the transfer of the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive to my Department on 1 October 2011 was to provide a streamlined, consistent and enhanced service to the customer. This should, over time, reduce recourse to basic SWA.<br><br>  The process of integration is on-going and significant progress has already been made with a unified service, the National Employment and Entitlements Service, now in the process of being delivered in four offices.</p>

The project involved the development of IT functionality and associated business process re-organisation.  Full deployment of the new system for Carer&#8217;s Allowance was completed in June 2012.<br><br>  Following the completion of the modernisation project, an in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project commenced for the carer&#8217;s allowance scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs. The outcome of the review is the division of work into two streams. One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and will be closely monitored and managed to ensure it achieves its objectives.

At the end of September 2012 there were 21,571 appeals on hand.<br><br>  I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that, from about early 2009 the number of appeals received by that Office has increased dramatically and by 2011 had more than doubled from an average of 15,000 pa to. 31,241 in 2011. A further 27,089<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  have been received for the period January to September this year.    <br><br>  By its nature and because of its quasi-judicial nature, the processing of appeals takes time even at the best of times and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one. <br><br>  In an effort to reduce the processing times for all appeals, the Department has appointed 13 additional Appeals Officers since 2010.  In addition, a further 10 Appeals Officers, formerly employed by the Community Welfare Services (CWS) of the Health Services Executive joined the Office as part of the integration of the CWS appeals services into the Social Welfare Appeals Office, bringing the total number of Appeals Officers now serving in the Office to 40.   In addition to this the Office has improved its business processes and IT support.<br><br>  I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review, and that the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the Office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center" border="0"><tr valign="top"><th width="100%" colspan="4" class="tbr"><div align="center">Appeal Receipts during 2011 and 2012 </div></th></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="50%" colspan="2" class="r"><div align="center">2011</div></td><td width="50%" colspan="2" class="l"><div align="center">         2012  (to 30/9/2012)</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%" class="r"><div align="center">Month</div></td><td width="25%" class="lr"><div align="center">Total Appeals</div></td><td width="25%" class="lr"><div align="center">Month</div></td><td width="25%" class="l"><div align="center">Total Appeals</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%" class="r">January</td><td width="25%" class="lr"><div align="center">2,490</div></td><td width="25%" class="lr">January </td><td width="25%" class="l"><div align="center">3,902</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%" class="r">February</td><td width="25%" class="lr"><div align="center">2,428</div></td><td width="25%" class="lr">February</td><td width="25%" class="l"><div align="center">2,492</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%" class="r">March</td><td width="25%" class="lr"><div align="center">3,384</div></td><td width="25%" class="lr">March</td><td width="25%" class="l"><div align="center">3,364</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%" class="r">April</td><td width="25%" class="lr"><div align="center">1,956</div></td><td width="25%" class="lr">April</td><td width="25%" class="l"><div align="center">3,765</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%" class="r">May</td><td width="25%" class="lr"><div align="center">2,396</div></td><td width="25%" class="lr">May</td><td width="25%" class="l"><div align="center">2,928</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%" class="r">June</td><td width="25%" class="lr"><div align="center">2,106</div></td><td width="25%" class="lr">June</td><td width="25%" class="l"><div align="center">2,375</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%" class="r">July</td><td width="25%" class="lr"><div align="center">2,324</div></td><td width="25%" class="lr">July</td><td width="25%" class="l"><div align="center">3,608</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%" class="r">August</td><td width="25%" class="lr"><div align="center">2,807</div></td><td width="25%" class="lr">August</td><td width="25%" class="l"><div align="center">2,811</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%" class="r">September</td><td width="25%" class="lr"><div align="center">2,353</div></td><td width="25%" class="lr">September</td><td width="25%" class="l"><div align="center">1,844</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%" class="r">October</td><td width="25%" class="lr"><div align="center">3,317</div></td><td width="25%" class="lr">October</td><td width="25%" class="l"><div align="center">-</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%" class="r">November</td><td width="25%" class="lr"><div align="center">3,915</div></td><td width="25%" class="lr">November</td><td width="25%" class="l"><div align="center">-</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%" class="r">December</td><td width="25%" class="lr"><div align="center">1,765</div></td><td width="25%" class="lr">December</td><td width="25%" class="l"><div align="center">-</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%" class="r">Total</td><td width="25%" class="lr"><div align="center">31,241</div></td><td width="25%" class="lr">Total</td><td width="25%" class="l"><div align="center">27,089</div></td></tr></table></p>

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than €356 per week, the rate of employer’s PRSI is 4.25%).  </p><p><a name='N50'>  Any changes to the PRSI system to extend the full range of social insurance benefits to self-employed persons would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.   </p><p><a name='N51'>  The recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund as at 31 December 2010 looked at the break-even contribution rates required to provide invalidity pensions and jobseeker’s benefit for self-employed workers.   The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 3.7% effective rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker’s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus the invalidity pension and jobseeker’s benefit is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.</p><p><a name='N52'>  I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year and one of the issues that the Group is currently considering is the issue of providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  The Advisory Group’s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed. </p><p><a name='N53'>  Any proposals to extend additional cover to the self-employed will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed – when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  </p><p><a name='N54'>  Self-employed individuals may, however, establish entitlement to assistance-based payments such as the means-tested jobseeker’s allowance if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for assistance-based payments, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p>

The project involved the development of IT functionality and associated business process re-organisation.  Full deployment of the new system for Carer&#8217;s Allowance was completed in June 2012.<br><br>  Following the completion of the modernisation project, an in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project commenced for the carer&#8217;s allowance scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs. The outcome of the review is the division of work into two streams. One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and will be closely monitored and managed to ensure it achieves its objectives. However, it will take a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level. The allocation of available resources to this task continues to be monitored.</p>

One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and will be closely monitored and managed to ensure it achieves its objectives. However, it will take a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level. The allocation of available resources to this task continues to be monitored.</p>

One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and will be closely monitored and managed to ensure it achieves its objectives.  However, it will take a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.  The allocation of available resources to this task continues to be monitored.</p>

Each week, over 1.4 million people receive a social welfare payment and, when qualified adults and children are included, over 2.2 million people benefit from weekly payments.  Some 600,000 families receive child benefit payments in respect of over 1.1 million children each month.  The day to day activities of the Department included (full year 2011): <ul style="margin-left:20px">·  2.2 million applications processed; <br><br>·  87.6 million scheme payments made; <br><br>·  982,000 control reviews; <br><br>·  6.8 million telephone calls answered; <br><br>·  34,000 social welfare appeals finalised; <br><br>·  153,000 PPS numbers allocated. </ul>  Most of the related schemes and services have been, or will be, addressed under the programme for Service Delivery Modernisation.<br><br>  Each project under the modernisation programme is focused on business process improvements in the relevant business area with major changes to how staff work and interact with customers, and supported through new technology solutions on the department&#8217;s modern integrated technology platform.  Each of these projects is rigorously assessed, governed and implemented based on specific business requirements and its contribution to the overall strategic objectives of the department.<br><br>  Benefits have been achieved over time, not only in improved customer service but in administration of schemes through integrated systems; reduced system &#8216;downtime&#8217; (1.21% in 2011 compared to 2.13% in 2009); agile response to required change including budget changes under the Social Welfare Act; enhanced work flow to maximise resources; integration with payment and reconciliation systems; ability to take on increased workload without commensurate increase in staff resources; more efficient and flexible communication products such as automated customer communications and use of text messaging; use of integrated scanning technologies to support end-to-end processing of claims; authenticated online services; support for major service initiatives such as moving customers from payable orders to electronic payment mechanisms; agile development environment to support introduction of new schemes such as the early child care supplement; robust infrastructure that supports on-going system improvements through a monthly release cycle; parallel project development; enhanced certification processing to support customer communications and control functions such as child benefit Irish residency certificates, and changes to continuing eligibility, residency and employment; improved overpayment and debt management; and ability to deliver new functionality such as statements of customer contributions and a new PRSI refunds application.<br><br>  Examples of benefits achieved include:<br><br>·  There has been a significant increase in claims activity in local offices since mid-2008.  The number of claims processed in 2008 increased by 88% (216,000 additional claims) and a further 43% in 2009 (198,000 additional claims), with activity falling slightly through 2010 and 2011/12.  <br><br>·  In 2011 there was in excess of 500,000 claims processed in local offices nationally &#8211; this was double the level of activity in 2007.  <br><br>·  It should be noted that a similar number of claims (500,000) were also closed in local offices in 2011, giving a total &#8216;claim churn&#8217; of over 1 million customers in 2011.<br><br>·  Average processing times for jobseeker allowance and jobseeker benefit claims have stabilised at 5 weeks and 2 weeks respectively, lower than peak processing times in 2009. <br><br>·  Some 95% of state pension contributory claims are paid by due date.<br><br>·  Average processing times for family income supplement has remained at 17 weeks over the last two years.<br><br>·  The department received 1.4 million claims for various non-weekly schemes such as child benefit (144,386 claims received, roughly half in respect of new births), household benefits, treatment benefits and supplementary welfare allowance.  The average processing time for circa 80% of these claims is now 1 week and almost all of the remainder are processed within a month.<br><br>  There are some schemes which are receiving particular attention. For example, processing times for carers allowance and invalidity pension which amounted to 3% of received claims in 2011 are not acceptable.  Increased demand by individuals for these schemes has put pressure on the administration of the department to service this demand, resulting in a requirement to increase productivity.  To this end major service delivery modernisation projects have taken place in these business areas over the last 2 years to improve the efficiency of their administration.  These projects involve the deployment of information technology solutions and associated business processes.  The new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customers by optimising performance and providing improved customer service.  However, change of this magnitude needs time to build and bed in and it is expected to be a number of months before the backlogs are reduced to an acceptable level.<br><br>  The department&#8217;s modernisation programme is a fundamental part of government&#8217;s public service reform agenda and in this regard the department is currently undergoing another period of major transformation moving from a passive transaction focused model of income support to a proactive model which is customer centric and progressive.  The integration of the community welfare service, and employment and community services of Fás was made possible through the investments in modern technology over the preceding years.  Change on this scale also requires substantive changes for staff and these initiatives are being delivered under the auspices of the Public Service Agreement (PSA) and with significant input from staff who are required to make major changes to how they work.<br><br>  I am satisfied that the investments made in the modernisation of systems and processes represent good value for money and have positioned the department to best meet the needs of customers. </p>

All applicants for carer&#8217;s allowance, regardless of nationality, must satisfy this condition.  In determining whether or not a person is habitually resident here a deciding officer is required to consider all the circumstances of the particular case including;<ul style="margin-left:20px">·  the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country;<br><br>·  the length and purpose of any absence from the State;<br><br>·  the nature and pattern of the person&#8217;s employment;<br><br>·  the person&#8217;s main centre of interest, and<br><br>·  the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.</ul>  These five specified factors have been derived from European Court of Justice case law. <br><br>  HRC legislation is therefore set out in national legislation, not European legislation although our legislation must respect European law.  In particular, EU legislation prohibits discrimination between nationals of EU Member States in the context of freedom of movement of workers and their access to social security or social assistance entitlements.

Subsequently, the <i>Programme for Government</i>   undertook to review the situation with regard to NHAs and the future of turf-cutting on such sites will be considered as part of that review. <br><br>  It is intended that the review will be completed prior to the commencement of the 2014 turf-cutting season.  The outcomes of the review and the proposed approach to the future of turf-cutting within these sites will be discussed as part of the Government&#8217;s ongoing dialogue with the European Commission regarding compliance with EU law in this area. For example, while NHAs are designated under national law, they are recognised as areas of environmental sensitivity for the purposes of peat extraction within the terms of the EU Environmental Impact Assessment Directive. <br><br>  The outcome of the review of NHAs may also be relevant in relation to the possibility of relocating turf-cutters from raised bog Special Areas of Conservation (SACs). <br><br>In relation to SAC raised bogs, my Department is in the process of developing a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan and has recently published a document outlining the proposed approach to the development of the plan on my Department&#8217;s website at <a href="http://www.npws.ie"><u><font color="#0000FF">www.npws.ie</font></u></a>  .<br><br>  There will be no changes to policy in relation to cutting on SAC raised bogs pending the conclusion of the SAC Management Plan, including necessary involvement of the European Commission.<br><br>  I also intend to elaborate an overarching policy on peatlands in a proposed National Peatlands Strategy, which my Department will be preparing in consultation with the Peatlands Council.</p>

The document, which is available on my Department&#8217;s website at <a href="http://www.npws.ie"><u><font color="#0000FF">www.npws.ie</font></u></a>  , outlines how Ireland will meet its obligations under the Habitats Directive to protect and restore its raised bog SACs, while addressing the needs of turf-cutters who are reliant on these sites for their fuel. It represents, in my opinion, the only lawful approach to maximize the flexibility afforded by the Habitats Directive for those few bogs where there are genuinely no alternatives for relocation to undesignated bogs.  I would encourage all turf-cutting groups to engage with me and other affected parties in progressing the preparation of the plan, as outlined in the proposed approach, as quickly as possible.<br><br>  In terms of making publicly available the Commission's reasoned opinion or the State's response to it in regard to turf extraction, the Deputy will be aware that it is not the practice of the State or of the European Commission to release documents of this nature relating to ongoing infringement action.  The Court of Justice of the European Union has considered this issue on a number of occasions and has recognised that such disclosure would undermine the purpose of infringement investigations and procedures, and would breach the confidentiality which the Commission and Member States are entitled to in the context of such investigations and procedures.</p>

He has also been informed that he may request a Departmental review of the decision and, if the decision is upheld, he will be able to appeal the decision to the Peatlands Council.  While it may be anticipated that there will be further instances where applicants do not qualify, current priority is being given to processing payments to those who clearly appear to meet the qualifying criteria on the basis of the information provided in their application forms.</p>

The review will provide the basis for the sustainable grazing of commonages, to avoid both overgrazing and under-grazing. It is envisaged that farmers will be allocated a minimum and maximum stocking level for each commonage townland by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Farmers will be able to farm freely once these stocking levels are observed and the land is maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition.</p><p><a name='N62'>  The carrying capacity of all commonages will be expressed at Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) level and will prescribe the sustainable carrying capacity in ewe equivalents per hectare.  This will reflect any known recovery delivered since the original commonage plans were prepared.</p><p><a name='N63'>  Specifically in relation to Co Galway, 25 farmers in the complex referred to by the Deputy are participants in the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) farm plan scheme, which is managed by my Department.  Compensation for each destocked ewe (below the polluter pays level of 5 ewes/ha over the whole farm) is €39.75.  Off-wintered ewes receive €50 per annum.  In addition, my Department covered the cost of preparing the NPWS farm plan.  Due to budgetary constraints, my Department's NPWS farm plan scheme was closed to new applicants in April 2010.</p><p><a name='N64'>  In the complex in question, my Department is also making top-up payments to REPS and AEOS farmers for these additional restrictions.  These farmers were required to amend their existing plans to reflect additional grazing requirements.  For the five years of the scheme, REPS/AEOS farmers are paid €2,000 by my Department for each year in which they have fully met the destocking and off-wintering provisions of their plans (which will run until the end of 2013).  Application forms for the Year 4 top-up payments will be distributed to farmers in the coming weeks.</p><p><a name='N65'>  In September 2011, I announced an additional compensation measure for out-of-contract REPS farmers in the complex referred to by the Deputy whose plans were completed after the closing date for applications to AEOS 2.  These payments of up to €4,000 per farmer ran until the 15th May 2012.  It is anticipated that out-of-contract farmers in this area will be accepted into the AEOS 3 Scheme announced last week by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>

Each week, over 1.4 million people receive a social welfare payment and, when qualified adults and children are included, over 2.2 million people benefit from weekly payments.  Some 600,000 families receive child benefit payments in respect of over 1.1 million children each month.  The day to day activities of the Department included (full year 2011): <ul style="margin-left:20px">·  2.2 million applications processed; <br><br>·  87.6 million scheme payments made; <br><br>·  982,000 control reviews; <br><br>·  6.8 million telephone calls answered; <br><br>·  34,000 social welfare appeals finalised; <br><br>·  153,000 PPS numbers allocated. </ul>  Most of the related schemes and services have been, or will be, addressed under the programme for Service Delivery Modernisation.<br><br>  Each project under the modernisation programme is focused on business process improvements in the relevant business area with major changes to how staff work and interact with customers, and supported through new technology solutions on the department&#8217;s modern integrated technology platform.  Each of these projects is rigorously assessed, governed and implemented based on specific business requirements and its contribution to the overall strategic objectives of the department.<br><br>  Benefits have been achieved over time, not only in improved customer service but in administration of schemes through integrated systems; reduced system &#8216;downtime&#8217; (1.21% in 2011 compared to 2.13% in 2009); agile response to required change including budget changes under the Social Welfare Act; enhanced work flow to maximise resources; integration with payment and reconciliation systems; ability to take on increased workload without commensurate increase in staff resources; more efficient and flexible communication products such as automated customer communications and use of text messaging; use of integrated scanning technologies to support end-to-end processing of claims; authenticated online services; support for major service initiatives such as moving customers from payable orders to electronic payment mechanisms; agile development environment to support introduction of new schemes such as the early child care supplement; robust infrastructure that supports on-going system improvements through a monthly release cycle; parallel project development; enhanced certification processing to support customer communications and control functions such as child benefit Irish residency certificates, and changes to continuing eligibility, residency and employment; improved overpayment and debt management; and ability to deliver new functionality such as statements of customer contributions and a new PRSI refunds application.<br><br>  Examples of benefits achieved include:<br><br>·  There has been a significant increase in claims activity in local offices since mid-2008.  The number of claims processed in 2008 increased by 88% (216,000 additional claims) and a further 43% in 2009 (198,000 additional claims), with activity falling slightly through 2010 and 2011/12.  <br><br>·  In 2011 there was in excess of 500,000 claims processed in local offices nationally &#8211; this was double the level of activity in 2007.  <br><br>·  It should be noted that a similar number of claims (500,000) were also closed in local offices in 2011, giving a total &#8216;claim churn&#8217; of over 1 million customers in 2011.<br><br>·  Average processing times for jobseeker allowance and jobseeker benefit claims have stabilised at 5 weeks and 2 weeks respectively, lower than peak processing times in 2009. <br><br>·  Some 95% of state pension contributory claims are paid by due date.<br><br>·  Average processing times for family income supplement has remained at 17 weeks over the last two years.<br><br>·  The department received 1.4 million claims for various non-weekly schemes such as child benefit (144,386 claims received, roughly half in respect of new births), household benefits, treatment benefits and supplementary welfare allowance.  The average processing time for circa 80% of these claims is now 1 week and almost all of the remainder are processed within a month.<br><br>  There are some schemes which are receiving particular attention. For example, processing times for carers allowance and invalidity pension which amounted to 3% of received claims in 2011 are not acceptable.  Increased demand by individuals for these schemes has put pressure on the administration of the department to service this demand, resulting in a requirement to increase productivity.  To this end major service delivery modernisation projects have taken place in these business areas over the last 2 years to improve the efficiency of their administration.  These projects involve the deployment of information technology solutions and associated business processes.  The new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customers by optimising performance and providing improved customer service.  However, change of this magnitude needs time to build and bed in and it is expected to be a number of months before the backlogs are reduced to an acceptable level.<br><br>  The department&#8217;s modernisation programme is a fundamental part of government&#8217;s public service reform agenda and in this regard the department is currently undergoing another period of major transformation moving from a passive transaction focused model of income support to a proactive model which is customer centric and progressive.  The integration of the community welfare service, and employment and community services of Fás was made possible through the investments in modern technology over the preceding years.  Change on this scale also requires substantive changes for staff and these initiatives are being delivered under the auspices of the Public Service Agreement (PSA) and with significant input from staff who are required to make major changes to how they work.<br><br>  Expenditure on all the Department&#8217;s SDM related projects in the period since commencement, some eleven years ago, amounts to just over &#8364;82m at the end of 2011.  It is expected that expenditure on the service delivery modernisation programme in 2012 will amount to some &#8364;4.8m. Further information in relation to the Department&#8217;s modernisation programme, including costs, are provided in the department&#8217;s annual report which can be found on the website www.welfare.ie.  <br><br>  I am satisfied that the investments made in the modernisation of systems and processes represent good value for money and have positioned the department to best meet the needs of customers. </p>

The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.<br><br>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&#8217; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.<br><br>  The National Broadband Plan contains a commitment that my Department will undertake a full mapping exercise in respect of high speed broadband deployment.  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including areas such as Fossa and Ballydesmond, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.<br><br>  My Department has already begun some of the necessary preparatory work, and the full mapping will commence as soon as the current spectrum auction being managed by ComReg is completed and final decisions are taken by the ComReg in respect of Next Generation Access regulation.  It is necessary that both these processes are finalised before the mapping exercise begins, as they will critically inform the investment plans for telecommunications service providers over the coming years.<br><br>  I have already emphasised to industry the importance of my Department securing full cooperation from all the commercial operators in completing this aspect of the Plan&#8217;s implementation.<br><br>  As regards current broadband speeds, the Communications Regulator, ComReg, publishes on its website, <a href="http://www.callcosts.ie"><u><font color="#0000FF">www.callcosts.ie</font></u></a>, details of broadband packages available in all counties, including County Kerry.  The Companies referred to by the Deputy may wish to access this information to ascertain if better broadband services than they currently have may be available to them.</p>

In 2011 ICES reiterated its previous advice that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pollution) affecting production and escapement of eels should be reduced to as close to zero as possible until there is clear evidence that both recruitment and the adult stock are increasing.  In 2011, glass eel recruitment has fallen to 5% of their 1960-1979 level in the Atlantic region and less than 1% in the North Sea area, and showed no sign of recovery.</p><p><a name='N26'>  In Ireland, recruitment has been declining at many monitoring sites since the mid-1980s, for example in the 2000-2011 period, the glass eel catch in the Shannon was at 2% of the pre-1980 numbers.  In summary, recruitment of glass eels and elvers remained low during the 2009 to 2011 period both in Ireland and across Europe. </p><p><a name='N27'>  In Ireland it is anticipated that there will be a considerable decline in silver eel production, as indicated by recruitment history, yellow eel stock indicators and modelled projections for index stocks.  As part of Ireland’s eel management regime, every three years, a review of the status of eel stocks is conducted, this coupled with input from stakeholders, supports the decision making process on the future of the commercial and recreational eel fishery.  Inland Fisheries Ireland has just completed a full public consultation on the future of the commercial and recreation eel fishery; the recommendations from this review are being finalised. </p><p><a name='N28'>  Inland Fisheries Ireland has made a number of reports on eel stocks available on its website including The National Eel Stock Recovery Plan, The Status of Eel Stocks in Ireland and The Implementation of the Eel Management Plan for Ireland.</p><p><a name='N29'>  The review of eel stocks in Europe is a shared concern involving many countries on a pan European basis and it is likely that a summary of all European reviews will not be available for some time.</p>

In Ireland’s case only two operators are included.  The methodology used takes the cheapest offer from these two companies and not the cheapest offer in the market.  I am advised that there are currently an estimated 30 pre-paid mobile packages available to Irish consumers, some of which are cheaper and the assessment does not therefore reflect the actual range of pre pay offers available.  In addition to the prepay option, mobile consumers can also avail of post paid options and it should be noted that Irish prices in this basket were below the EU average.</p><p><a name='N33'>  ComReg’s website Callcosts.ie, provides a useful source of information to consumers where they can compare prices of different operators.  Consumers can input their usage requirements and see the cheapest available in the market based on their usage.  I am also aware that ComReg has, in recent months, promoted the ease at which consumers can switch mobile operator and that there is no retail charge for consumers who wish to switch.  Furthermore, the Digital Agenda for Europe scorecard reports that the number of days required to switch between operators in Ireland is among the lowest in the EU.</p>

It is impossible to cover 100% of the population by terrestrial means.<br><br>  In addition to Saorview, RTÉ has developed SAORSAT, a new free-to-air satellite service unique to Ireland to ensure the RTÉ television services are available to the remaining 2% of the population.  RTÉ is not obliged to provide this satellite service and is doing so on its own initiative.<br><br>  SAORSAT launched in March 2012 and provides access to the RTÉ channels including the new RTÉ channels developed for SAORVIEW and TG4. TV3 has not yet made a decision regarding SAORSAT.<br><br>  Further information on SAORSAT is available from SAORVIEW on <a href="http://www.saorview.ie"><u><font color="#0000FF">www.saorview.ie</font></u></a> and on LoCall 1850 222 012 and from RTÉ Networks Limited (RTÉNL) on <a href="http://www.rtenl.ie"><u><font color="#0000FF">www.rtenl.ie</font></u></a>.</p>

The EirGrid project is of strategic national importance in terms of Ireland’s economic infrastructure.</p><p><a name='N40'>  Electricity interconnection improves security of supply, promotes further competition in the electricity market which in turn exerts downward pressure on electricity prices.  Interconnection also facilitates the penetration of wind generation and the East West Interconnector will facilitate export of surplus electricity generation output.</p><p><a name='N41'>  I do not have a statutory function in the setting of energy prices, whether in the regulated or unregulated market.  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  </p><p><a name='N42'>  Prices in the retail business and residential electricity markets are now fully deregulated.  Since 1 October, 2011 residential gas customers supplied by Bord Gáis Energy are the only segment of the electricity and gas markets where prices are still regulated by the CER.  Prices in the electricity and gas markets, with the exception of residential gas customers supplied by Bord Gáis Energy, are wholly commercial and operational matters for the suppliers concerned. Ireland’s electricity and gas markets, both wholesale and retail, are characterised by vigorous competition regulated by the CER.</p><p><a name='N43'>  The domestic retail electricity market is a competitive market and consumers are able to switch their business between suppliers, who in turn purchase their power on the all island wholesale market, the Single Electricity Market (SEM).  Overall electricity prices in Great Britain are lower than those in Ireland and, as might be expected in this situation, there has been strong interest from traders on the interconnector in importing power into Ireland from Britain.  The interconnector in these circumstances is capable of carrying additional power into Ireland from a lower cost market, to the extent of 500MW, with that capacity representing more than that of an average modern power station.  The interconnector therefore means that there can be even greater competition for existing generators operating in the SEM leading to additional downward pressure on the wholesale prices otherwise charged by generators.</p><p><a name='N44'>  It is difficult in the deregulated electricity market to identify the precise impact of the downward pressure on prices brought about specifically by the interconnector, as against the impact of any other factors at play in the wholesale and/or retail market.  Accordingly, the impact on the price charged to any single household customer in the residential segment of the retail electricity market cannot be estimated.</p>

The process allows for the referral to the Circuit Court, by the landowner affected, of a proposal to include a right of way and where the court is satisfied that no right of way exists, the planning authority may not include it in its development plan. Section 14(7) provides that &quot;the inclusion of a public right of way in a development plan shall be evidence of the existence of such a right unless the contrary is shown&quot;.<br><br>  The question of whether a public right of way exists is therefore ultimately a matter for the courts to determine.<br><br>  Ireland's Waymarked trails and the majority of other walking routes are &#8220;permissive access routes&#8221; that have been developed with the landowners&#8217; agreement; they are not public rights of way. Accordingly, the recent ruling regarding rights of way is not expected to have any significant impact on the existing network of permissive access routes currently available to walkers.<br><br>  With regard to access to the countryside, an Expert Group reported to the relevant Minister in May 2007. It did not set out specific recommendations but examined existing legislation and explored the implications of introducing legislation, such as granting a right of access to recreational users. It was determined that the best way forward was to develop permissive access with the agreement of landholders.  The consensus approach adopted is underpinned by the principle of mutual respect between landowners and recreation users, with the acceptance of the rights of landowners regarding access to their land and the need of recreation users to have reasonable access to the countryside. The report by the Expert Group on &quot;Legal Issues of Land Access for Recreational Use&quot; is available on my Department&#8217;s website.<a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Community/RuralDevelopment/FileDownLoad,27109,en.doc"></a><br><br><a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Community/RuralDevelopment/FileDownLoad,27109,en.doc"><u><font color="#0000FF">http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Community/RuralDevelopment/FileDownLoad,27109,en.doc</font></u></a></p>

This was on the recommendation of the independently chaired Expert Advisory Group that was appointed to advise on measures to be included in the current Programme. The prescribed distance of 2 metres is in line with similar requirements in England and Northern Ireland.<br><br>  On the advice of the Expert Advisory Group, exemptions from prescribed buffer distances for the spreading of organic fertiliser or soiled water were also introduced following this review. The Group considered that the fixed buffer zone approach was not the most efficient in achieving the required protection of drinking water sources and that provision should be made for a case by case examination. Setback distances may only be decreased where a local authority has completed a technical assessment of conditions in the vicinity of an abstraction point. The technical assessment must be carried out in accordance with guidelines issued by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>

The Government has recently approved the preparation of legislation to assign the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the metering programme. The objective is to have the Bill enacted by the end of this year. Pending the enactment of the legislation, Bord Gáis is working on the development of the specifications for the water meters and the meter reading technology and I expect the detailed specification to be finalised early next year at the latest.</p>

Any difference between the rent and prevailing interest rate is reflected in the capital outstanding on the property, i.e. if the rent charged in any period is greater than the prevailing mortgage interest due on the local authority’s share the purchase price of the outstanding equity will be reduced accordingly.Local authority mortgage holders – including those who purchased under shared ownership – also benefit from extremely keenly priced interest rates which currently stand at around 1.5% below average variable rates available in the market. This is a very substantial differential.</p><p><a name='N27'>  To take account of the current housing market conditions, the Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. That review is now underway and it is expected to conclude later in the year. Any future changes to legislation governing affordable housing schemes, including shared ownership, will be informed by that review.</p>

For that reason annualised data sets for the period 1992 to 2007 inclusive are not available.<br><br>  However, the Housing Agency&#8217;s Housing Needs Assessment 2008 and 2011 reports break down the categories of housing need, including in respect of homelessness, for all 88 housing authorities nationwide. These are available on my Department&#8217;s website at <a href="http://www.environ.ie/"><u><font color="#0000FF">www.environ.ie</font></u></a>.<br><br>  . This statutory assessment of housing need, carried out every three years by all housing authorities, only counts homeless persons where an application has been made to a housing authority.<br><br>  The extent of homelessness in the Dublin region, where numbers are most pronounced, was reviewed and updated using the now fully operational Pathway Accommodation &amp; Support System (PASS) and crosschecked against each of the Dublin local authorities&#8217; housing management data systems to give an accurate figure of the known homeless population in Dublin. Following extensive cross checking and quality control to remove duplications and ensure accuracy of all data entries, the confirmed extent of homelessness in the Dublin region as at September 2011 was 1,891 persons. PASS, which commenced operation in the Dublin region in 2011, is being extended nationally on a phased basis with work currently underway in other regions. The PASS system will in future provide good quality, timely, data on homelessness nationally as an evidence base for all homelessness services.<br><br>  On 6 September 2012, the CSO published its special Census report, <u>Homeless Persons in Ireland</u> and it indicated that 3,808 persons were either sleeping rough or in accommodation designated for the homeless on the night of 10 April 2011. The rough sleeper count was 64, with 59 of those people located in Dublin.  It is not tolerable that anyone should sleep on the streets but it is important that the homeless figures released are not confused with the number of people sleeping rough.  The vast majority of people classified in the CSO's report as homeless are in long-term or emergency accommodation.</p>

Regeneration seeks to rebuild damaged communities by improving not just the physical environment in which people live but also by investing in the social and economic life of the areas.  This holistic, multi-agency approach ensures that regeneration is sustainable, beyond just the initial construction phases, and generates long-term advantages. The Regeneration Process in Limerick seeks to reinvigorate and revitalise communities that have witnessed considerable neglect and breakdown over decades by acting as a catalyst for more integrated, responsive and effective public service provision and enhanced resident participation in matters that affect them.  Over the past five years, a robust framework has been put in place to facilitate consultation with stakeholder groups including householders, residents’ associations, community organisations etc. on wide-ranging issues relating to the development and implementation of social and physical regeneration strategies.</p><p><a name='N61'>  Supporting Social Inclusion and Regeneration in Limerick (SSIRL) is a collaborative programme of investment in support of social objectives which aims to strengthen social inclusion practice, introduce best practice to improve the quality and impact of services and to facilitate and enable all citizens to participate in and drive regeneration and revitalisation across the city.  It is co-funded by Government Departments/State Agencies, Atlantic Philanthropies and the University of Limerick.  My Department will be working closely with all concerned to deliver this innovative project in Limerick. The outcome of the project will inform policy in relation to, inter alia, the most appropriate consultative arrangements to ensure the successful implementation of regeneration in Limerick.</p>

My Department's role is to ensure that there is an adequate legislative and financial system in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation. </p><p><a name='N6'>  Accommodation for Travellers is provided across a range of options including standard local authority housing, which is financed from my Department's capital allocation for social housing, private housing assisted by the housing authority or voluntary organisations, private rented accommodation and through their own resources.  My Department also provides funding for Traveller-specific accommodation such as group housing schemes and halting sites.</p><p><a name='N7'>  The Government remains committed to meeting the accommodation needs of Travellers.  Since 2005, over €187m has been expended for the provision of new, and refurbishment of existing, Traveller-specific accommodation.  This is in addition to expenditure on standard local authority housing and other housing supports.  The results of this substantial financial commitment are reflected in the significant reduction in the numbers of Traveller families on unauthorised sites, despite continuous increases in the numbers of Traveller families nationally.</p><p><a name='N8'>  The National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee (NTACC) is a statutory body established for the purposes of providing advice on all matters relating to housing for Travellers.  While the matter of a Traveller-led accommodation agency has been examined, no firm proposals have been put forward for consideration by the NTACC.  A proposal for a statutory Traveller accommodation agency, as set out in the 1995 Report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community, was considered by my Department.  However, it was subsequently decided not to establish such an Agency and I have no plans to review the matter at this time.   </p>

Such plans enable stakeholders, including developers, local authorities, financial institutions, NAMA and residents to collaborate in determining how best to pursue resolution of problematic sites.  The process also entails working with stakeholders in identifying the best long-term solution for developments in terms of their configuration, use of vacant buildings and ownership.  Such solutions also take account of the best interests of residents.   </p><p><a name='N24'>  The first Annual Progress Report of the NCC, published by my Department on 5 July, confirmed that, through the use of the SRP process, 211 estates have now been completed and issues are now resolved.  On a further 523 estates, plans are now in place and in many of these cases work has commenced and significant progress will be achieved over the coming months.  I anticipate that this progress will be reflected in the 2012 National Housing Development Survey now underway.

It is their duty to ensure as far as is possible, and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register.   </p><p><a name='N29'>  In the normal course, voter registration is an ongoing process in which those entitled to be registered apply to their registration authority for inclusion in the Register of Electors.  The new register comes into effect each year on 15 February.  The draft register is published in November each year in preparation for the coming into effect of the register on the 15 of February following.  The public is invited to check the draft during this period so that people can make sure that they are correctly registered.  Any errors or omissions in the draft should be brought immediately to the attention of the registration authority.  Claims for the addition or deletion of names are ruled on by the county registrar who is a legally qualified court officer.  The ruling is made in public and any person may attend and give evidence. </p><p><a name='N30'>  Provision is also made in electoral law for inclusion in the supplement to the register.  If a person is not included in the register of electors currently in force but considers that he or she qualifies for registration - for example if they have come of age to register or if they have changed address - the person may apply for entry in the supplement to the register which is open year round subject to certain practical limits in the weeks before a polling day.  The closing date for the supplement to the register for the forthcoming referendum is Tuesday, 23 October 2012. </p><p><a name='N31'>  The detailed requirements regarding the inclusion of persons in the supplement are set out in section 15, and Part 2, of the Second Schedule to the Electoral Act 1992.  An applicant for inclusion in the supplement to the register must apply directly to his or her registration authority.  The application must be signed by the applicant in the presence of a member of the Garda Síochána from the applicant’s local Garda station who must first be satisfied as to the person's identity before signing, dating and stamping the form.  The Garda may request photographic or other identification.  Where the applicant establishes in writing that he is unable to progress the application in this way, the form can be signed by the applicant in the presence of an official of the registration authority who is satisfied as to his or her identity.  Again, photographic or other identification may be required.  If neither option is viable due to physical illness or physical disability, the application form must be accompanied by a medical certificate. </p><p><a name='N32'>  Student campaigns which encourage people to register to vote are to be welcomed.  However, it is important that the requirements of electoral law are met.   </p>

On the basis of a value for money review, it was clearly established that the vast majority of the money allocated to PwDI was being spent disproportionately.  The largest proportion of PwDI’s annual budget was spent on the operation of its office headquarters and on administration rather than on the creation of projects which would directly benefit people with disabilities.  This was an untenable situation that could not be allowed to continue as the conclusions of the VFM report show that people with disabilities were benefiting very little from the allocation in real terms. </p><p><a name='N38'>  It is my wish to ensure that people with disabilities directly benefit from any money allocated to this sector.  With this in mind, I just recently oversaw the finalisation of a major Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in the Department of Health to ensure that existing funding allocated for people with disabilities is spent to best effect.  I am also interested in hearing what people with disabilities have to say on issues affecting them.  I have established and am personally chairing a new National Disability Strategy Implementation Group to develop and progress disability strategy.  The new group includes representation from a number of disability stakeholder organisations, also three former members of PwDI and a number of people with disabilities who are able to bring their lived experience directly to bear on the very important work of this high level group.  This ensures the voice and perspective of people with disabilities will continue to be heard in a more focused and cost effective way.</p><p><a name='N39'>  At my request the National Disability Authority held the first National Disability Forum event in June 2012.  This event, which is hoped will be held on an annual basis, was primarily about listening to the views of individual people with disabilities, their families and carers in relation to the key policy areas and service developments that impact on their lives.</p><p><a name='N40'>  The Government must ensure that funding is allocated for maximum provision of services for people with disabilities, having regard to overall resource constraints which affect all sectors at this time.  Specialist disability services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings.  The integral role of the non-statutory, voluntary and community groups is of particular relevance to the provision of health and personal social services to people with a disability.  These agencies provide a very significant and broad range of services in partnership with and on behalf of the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p>

The various sections of the Charities Act are subject to implementation through commencement orders.  Sections that it was possible to commence in advance of the establishment of the Charities Regulatory Authority, as provided for under the Act, have been commenced. The remainder will be commenced following the establishment of the Authority. </p><p><a name='N43'>  The Deputy will appreciate that the full implementation of the Charities Act, including the establishment of the Authority, had to be examined in the context of the comprehensive review of expenditure, which took place last year.  Arising from this review, and in the context of the need to reduce Government spending, I took the view that it was not possible to proceed with the full implementation of the Act at this time given the likely scale of the financial and staffing resources then envisaged, and that this should be deferred.  In light of this decision my Department is currently examining options for resource efficient ways of making progress towards the objectives of the Charities Act.</p><p><a name='N44'>  It should be recalled that there is, at present, a range of regulatory oversight measures that can apply to charities.  Many charities are already subject to scrutiny by various State Bodies.  The Revenue Commissioners have granted charitable tax exemptions to almost 8,000 charities and have significant powers to ensure that such charities comply with tax law.  A full list of these charities is available to the public at www.revenue.ie.  Many charities are companies limited by guarantee and, as such, are also subject to the provisions of company law and are generally required to provide certain information to the Companies Registration Office under the Companies Acts.  This information can then be accessed by the public.  Such charities would also potentially be subject to scrutiny by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Charities that take the form of a trust are subject to the provisions of trust law. And, of course, any business entity is subject to general criminal and fraud legislation. </p>

I understand there is no blanket policy here in operation in relation to persons classified as Latvian aliens, as the circumstances of each case may be different.  In general, the holder of a Latvian alien passport is treated much in the same way as a non-EEA national.  They do not enjoy the same rights of free movement as the holders of a full Latvian passport.  However, they are not debarred from seeking Irish citizenship and, over the years a number have become naturalised while others have obtained Irish residence and registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</p>

The process also entails working with stakeholders in identifying the best long-term solution for developments in terms of their configuration, use of vacant buildings and ownership.  Such solutions also take account of the best interests of residents.   </p><p><a name='N18'>  The first Annual Progress Report of the NCC, published by my Department on 5 July, confirmed that, through the use of the SRP process, 211 estates have now been completed and issues are now resolved.

I anticipate that this progress will be reflected in the 2012 National Housing Development Survey now underway.  The results of this Survey are expected later this year and will update the position on Site Resolution Plans. </p>

It is their duty to ensure as far as is possible, and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register.   </p><p><a name='N23'>  In the normal course, voter registration is an ongoing process in which those entitled to be registered apply to their registration authority for inclusion in the Register of Electors.  The new register comes into effect each year on 15 February.  The draft register is published in November each year in preparation for the coming into effect of the register on the 15 of February following.  The public is invited to check the draft during this period so that people can make sure that they are correctly registered.  Any errors or omissions in the draft should be brought immediately to the attention of the registration authority.  Claims for the addition or deletion of names are ruled on by the county registrar who is a legally qualified court officer.  The ruling is made in public and any person may attend and give evidence. </p><p><a name='N24'>  Provision is also made in electoral law for inclusion in the supplement to the register.  If a person is not included in the register of electors currently in force but considers that he or she qualifies for registration - for example if they have come of age to register or if they have changed address - the person may apply for entry in the supplement to the register which is open year round subject to certain practical limits in the weeks before a polling day.  The closing date for the supplement to the register for the forthcoming referendum is Tuesday, 23 October 2012. </p><p><a name='N25'>  The detailed requirements regarding the inclusion of persons in the supplement are set out in section 15, and Part 2, of the Second Schedule to the Electoral Act 1992.  An applicant for inclusion in the supplement to the register must apply directly to his or her registration authority.  The application must be signed by the applicant in the presence of a member of the Garda Síochána from the applicant’s local Garda station who must first be satisfied as to the person's identity before signing, dating and stamping the form.  The Garda may request photographic or other identification.  Where the applicant establishes in writing that he is unable to progress the application in this way, the form can be signed by the applicant in the presence of an official of the registration authority who is satisfied as to his or her identity.  Again, photographic or other identification may be required.  If neither option is viable due to physical illness or physical disability, the application form must be accompanied by a medical certificate. </p><p><a name='N26'>  Student campaigns which encourage people to register to vote are to be welcomed.  However, it is important that the requirements of electoral law are met.   </p>

On the basis of a value for money review, it was clearly established that the vast majority of the money allocated to PwDI was being spent disproportionately.  The largest proportion of PwDI’s annual budget was spent on the operation of its office headquarters and on administration rather than on the creation of projects which would directly benefit people with disabilities.  This was an untenable situation that could not be allowed to continue as the conclusions of the VFM report show that people with disabilities were benefiting very little from the allocation in real terms. </p><p><a name='N32'>  It is my wish to ensure that people with disabilities directly benefit from any money allocated to this sector.  With this in mind, I just recently oversaw the finalisation of a major Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in the Department of Health to ensure that existing funding allocated for people with disabilities is spent to best effect.  I am also interested in hearing what people with disabilities have to say on issues affecting them.  I have established and am personally chairing a new National Disability Strategy Implementation Group to develop and progress disability strategy.  The new group includes representation from a number of disability stakeholder organisations, also three former members of PwDI and a number of people with disabilities who are able to bring their lived experience directly to bear on the very important work of this high level group.  This ensures the voice and perspective of people with disabilities will continue to be heard in a more focused and cost effective way.</p><p><a name='N33'>  At my request the National Disability Authority held the first National Disability Forum event in June 2012.  This event, which is hoped will be held on an annual basis, was primarily about listening to the views of individual people with disabilities, their families and carers in relation to the key policy areas and service developments that impact on their lives.</p><p><a name='N34'>  The Government must ensure that funding is allocated for maximum provision of services for people with disabilities, having regard to overall resource constraints which affect all sectors at this time.  Specialist disability services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings.  The integral role of the non-statutory, voluntary and community groups is of particular relevance to the provision of health and personal social services to people with a disability.  These agencies provide a very significant and broad range of services in partnership with and on behalf of the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p>

The various sections of the Charities Act are subject to implementation through commencement orders.  Sections that it was possible to commence in advance of the establishment of the Charities Regulatory Authority, as provided for under the Act, have been commenced. The remainder will be commenced following the establishment of the Authority. </p><p><a name='N37'>  The Deputy will appreciate that the full implementation of the Charities Act, including the establishment of the Authority, had to be examined in the context of the comprehensive review of expenditure, which took place last year.  Arising from this review, and in the context of the need to reduce Government spending, I took the view that it was not possible to proceed with the full implementation of the Act at this time given the likely scale of the financial and staffing resources then envisaged, and that this should be deferred.  In light of this decision my Department is currently examining options for resource efficient ways of making progress towards the objectives of the Charities Act.</p><p><a name='N38'>  It should be recalled that there is, at present, a range of regulatory oversight measures that can apply to charities.  Many charities are already subject to scrutiny by various State Bodies.  The Revenue Commissioners have granted charitable tax exemptions to almost 8,000 charities and have significant powers to ensure that such charities comply with tax law.  A full list of these charities is available to the public at www.revenue.ie.  Many charities are companies limited by guarantee and, as such, are also subject to the provisions of company law and are generally required to provide certain information to the Companies Registration Office under the Companies Acts.  This information can then be accessed by the public.  Such charities would also potentially be subject to scrutiny by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Charities that take the form of a trust are subject to the provisions of trust law. And, of course, any business entity is subject to general criminal and fraud legislation. </p>

I understand there is no blanket policy here in operation in relation to persons classified as Latvian aliens, as the circumstances of each case may be different.  In general, the holder of a Latvian alien passport is treated much in the same way as a non-EEA national.  They do not enjoy the same rights of free movement as the holders of a full Latvian passport.  However, they are not debarred from seeking Irish citizenship and, over the years a number have become naturalised while others have obtained Irish residence and registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</p>

Both systems are under the control of the Property Registration Authority (PRA) which was established on 4 November 2006. <br><br>  When title or ownership is registered in the <b>Land Registry</b>, the legal ownership is entered on folios which form the registers maintained in the Land Registry. Where title is registered in the Land Registry it is referred to as &quot;registered property&quot; and is open to public inspection. <br><br>  The <b>Registry of Deeds</b> provides a system of recording the existence of deeds and conveyances affecting unregistered property (i.e. property which has never been registered in the Land Registry).  The effect of registration of a Deed in the Registry of Deeds is generally to govern priorities between documents dealing with the same piece of land. <br><br>  The Registration of Title Act, 1964 provided that notice of trusts shall not be entered in the Land Register.  The Land Conveyancing and Law Reform Act, 2009 provides that the <b>legal</b> title shall vest in the trustees to be held in trust for the beneficiaries.  Thus, for registered land (i.e. property registered in the Land Registry), the <b>legal</b>   title will be a matter of public record, while the beneficiary interest may be off the register.  </p>

This would apply to mortgage finance as to other forms of finance and it may well have been a key basis for the advance of the loan in the first instance. My understanding is that this is also the normal position in other comparable legal systems so that the insolvency procedure and any discharge of debt has no alleviating effect on the liability of the guarantor to the creditor. <br><br>  This position under existing Irish law and internationally, is reflected in the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012 as currently drafted. A debtor&#8217;s entering into one of the new debt resolution processes does not prejudice the legal right of a creditor to seek payment from the guarantor under the guarantee. However, I am conscious of the difficulties which can arise with respect to guarantees in the context of insolvency processes, for all parties concerned and so I will give this matter consideration as work progresses on the Bill. However, I am sure that the Deputy will agree that this is a complex matter. <br><br>  In relation to the query as to State assistance, if the Deputy is enquiring as to whether some form of assistance, financial or otherwise, might be provided for guarantors, such as family members and others close to an insolvent debtor, who are affected by the debtor&#8217;s financial difficulties because they have personally guaranteed the loan of the debtor, I do not believe that such a proposition arises for the State.</p>

I am further informed that both areas are subject to regular patrols by local uniformed personnel, augmented by uniformed and plain clothes units from the District Headquarters in Ashbourne, together with the Divisional Traffic Unit and the Regional Support Unit as required.</p><p><a name='N42'>  Local Garda management closely monitors such patrols, and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in these areas to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources to provide the best possible Garda service to the public. While the situation is being kept under review, Garda management is satisfied that a full and comprehensive policing service is being delivered to the communities in the areas concerned and that the current structures in place deliver an effective and efficient policing service.</p><p><a name='N43'>  The Deputy be aware that the Garda Commissioner has put Operation Fiacla in place in order to address incidents of burglary, aggravated burglaries and related offences throughout the country. Operation Fiacla is intelligence driven and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda Region to target suspect offenders.  I am informed that over 1,700 persons have been arrested and that almost 1,000 persons have been charged in the first six months of the Operation, reflecting the substantial efforts being made by the Gardaí to tackle those involved in burglary and property crimes.</p><p><a name='N44'>  An Garda Síochána also places great emphasis on the importance of the partnership between An Garda Síochána and the community in preventing and detecting crime, and maintaining a safe environment for everyone.  An Garda Síochána continues to invest time and energy in these partnerships and relationships to the benefit of all. In this regard, last week the Garda Commissioner launched the second national public awareness week this year under the 'Garda Supporting Safer Communities Campaign’. This important campaign highlights a range of key issues, in particular burglary prevention. The primary objective of this Garda Community Safety Campaign is to engage with, and raise awareness within communities of initiatives aimed at preventing crime, reducing the fear of crime and promoting community safety.</p><p><a name='N45'>  Insofar as the number of arrests made in the specific areas referred to are concerned, I am informed that this would require a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources to compile due to the fact that persons arrested in these areas will, in general, be brought to either Navan or Ashbourne Garda Stations, which are both District Headquarters and have full custody facilities. Separate figures for the numbers arrested in the specific areas referred to by the Deputy are not readily available.</p>

It is the Revenue Commissioners who are responsible for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products and they have advised as follows.  Revenue has adopted a comprehensive tobacco strategy which is published on Revenue&#8217;s website <i>www.revenue.ie.</i>    The strategy includes a number of programmes, which are designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for contraband tobacco in Ireland. Key elements include developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, development of analytics and detection technologies, and ensuring optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and within the country, in order to intercept the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.<br><br>  With regard to the level of penalties for illicit importation and sale of tobacco products, the threat to tax revenues from criminal activity in the cigarette market is viewed very seriously, and substantially increased penalties were introduced in the Finance Act 2010 as a deterrent.  The penalties for the smuggling of tobacco products are contained in Section 119 of the Finance Act 2001 as amended and the penalties for the illegal sale of unstamped tobacco products are contained in section 78 of the Finance Act 2005, as amended. In 2012 to date a total of 81.1m cigarettes with a retail value of &#8364;36.6m and 3,338kgs of tobacco with a retail value of &#8364;1.2m have been seized by Revenue. In addition, 41 convictions were secured for cigarette smuggling and a further 52 convictions were secured for illegal selling of unstamped tobacco products. </p>

This year Cosc has provided grants totalling €241,820 to 59 successful applicants throughout the country. In 2011 €298,153 was granted to 58 different groups from the scheme. Guidelines devised by Cosc in 2011 in relation to the grant scheme aim to encourage a shift from a focus on activities only relating to the victim to an inclusion of a focus on the perpetrator and bystander whilst also ensuring that information on support services continues to be made available to victims/survivors.</p><p><a name='N51'>  The bystander approach aims to both engage individual members of society in challenging the social norms that allow sexual and domestic violence to occur and to encourage individuals to assist victims of such violence rather than isolating them. One example of this approach has been a partnership between the Union of Students of Ireland and Cosc over the last two years to increase awareness of domestic and sexual violence among students attending third level institutions. The purpose of this campaign was to make students as bystanders more aware of intimate partner violence in the college setting and to intervene where relevant. There have been three stages to date in this work: an awareness raising art work competition, distribution of colourful wristbands with a slogan and website details for more information, and the circulation of a free postcard, visually based on the winning piece from the art competition, containing information about abusive relationships and the helplines to contact. The theme of the campaign could be summarised by one of the slogans used &quot;If you see something, say something&quot;.</p>

This allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  The Garda Commissioner is currently engaged in an assessment of the potential for improved efficiencies in the structure and organisation of the Garda Síochána as part of the preparation of the draft policing plan for 2013, which under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 is due to be submitted to me by the end of October this year. The objective is to provide the most effective policing service possible, within available resources, across the country, including rural areas such as referred to by the Deputy.  While I expect that the policing plan for 2013 will contain proposals for the further rationalisation of Garda stations and Districts, it would be premature, in advance of its submission, to speculate on specific measures which it might contain.</p>

This, I understand, will be done in compliance with Section 5 of the Solicitors Act 1954 which provides for the Society to make regulations which are necessary for the carrying out of its functions and requires that such regulations be laid by the Society before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made.  </p><p><a name='N12'>  The new regulation has been made by the Law Society on foot of the recommendations made in the &quot;Conveyancing Conflicts Task Force Report&quot; published by the Law Society in July. The Task Force had been set up to review existing guidelines and regulations relating to solicitors acting for both parties in conveyancing transactions. The Report, which is publicly available on the Law Society's website (www.lawsociety.ie), details the arguments that were put forward both in favour of and against the introduction of this regulation and explains the reasons behind the decision to propose its adoption. It sets out how the Task Force undertook extensive consultations with members of the solicitors profession and other relevant interested parties and stakeholders and took account, inter alia, of the November 2012 joint HSE and UCD report concerning the &quot;Abuse and Neglect of Older People in Ireland&quot;. The Task Force also researched and reviewed the regulatory regimes in other jurisdictions and analysed judicial and academic commentary relevant to all issues considered. </p><p><a name='N13'>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 provides, in section 3 (2), that every regulation to be made under the Bill, which will establish a new independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority to regulate both solicitors and barristers, shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas subject to a 21 day period for a possible resolution for annulment. The scope and application of this and other regulatory provisions are among those matters I am considering in preparation for the Bill's Committee Stage.</p>

I am satisfied that there is a robust communication system in place, through my Department’s Conciliation and Arbitration (C&A) Branch, to effectively and speedily address queries from RDFRA.

As such, many organisations request the attendance of this vehicle at various events throughout the country.  Because of its importance, it is necessary to strike a balance between making the vehicle available to the public on appropriate occasions, and ensuring that it is properly maintained and preserved.   When requests for the vehicle’s attendance at community events are received, my Department, following consultation with the Military, will determine whether the application can, or cannot be acceded to and will advise the applicant accordingly.  The following conditions are required as a minimum when evaluating these requests: The event is for a charitable or non profit cultural or community purpose; The event is of regional or national importance; The location / site is acceptable; The attendance of the vehicle at the event would be in the public interest.</p><p><a name='N28'>  The availability of Military equipment and personnel, and the costs involved in transporting and securing the artifact when it is away also have to be considered when deliberating on a request.  In that context, it should be noted that the vehicle must travel with a Military party for transport and security reasons and the Military must remain present for the duration of the event.  The personnel involved have other Military duties which may take precedence over the display of the vehicle.  A list is provided below of the events where Sliabh na mBan has been on display following the completion of its extensive refurbishment in February, 2012  .</p><p><a name='N29'>  I am aware that my Department and the Military are currently drawing up proposals for Sliabh na mBan to be placed on public display for certain periods in the Curragh Museum.  This would provide an opportunity to members of the public to view this artifact with a minimum risk to its maintenance and preservation and at a low cost to the Defence Forces: 6th   May – Vintage Motor Show – Clonmel; 3rd   June –Vintage Motor Show – Longford; 15th   August – Commemorative Coin Launch in Collins Barracks, Cork; 18th/19th   August – Beal na mBlath Commemoration; 8th   September – Newbridge 200 Celebrations.</p><p><a name='N30'>  Sliabh na mBan was also on display in military barracks at a number of official/military occasions and commemorations.</p><p><a name='N31'>  Following prior arrangement, visitors also viewed the vehicle in the Curragh Camp. </p>

In order to make the necessary savings it was proposed to make technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers whose farming enterprises are situated primarily in DAS areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme, which are defined in the governing EU legislation as follows: To ensure continued agricultural land use and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a viable rural community; To maintain the countryside; To maintain and promote sustainable farming systems which, in particular, take account of environmental protection measures.</p><p><a name='N43'>  Processing of high volume application schemes, such as the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and the Single Payment Scheme, require significant hands-on from the management teams and a willingness and ability to focus resources on the varying priorities that arise throughout the process.  One very important element of the process is dealing with the many and varied enquiries from applicants, by telephone, letter, email or on-line.  The 2012 processing campaign is currently well advanced, with the necessary arrangements in place to deal with farmers’ queries.  The record number of applications submitted on-line in 2012 has further contributed to the smoother processing of applications.</p><p><a name='N44'>  While changes were introduced in respect of the minimum stocking density requirements, specific provision was made for those farmers who had a stocking density less than 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to a recognised agri-environmental measure.  The principles of force majeure/exceptional circumstances were also provided for in the process. Provision was also be made for new entrants to farming.</p><p><a name='N45'>  All 10,046 applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, were written to formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in such an agri-environmental measure resulted in the lower stocking density.  The Department is currently working on those applicants who applied for derogation, good progress has been made to date with many already paid.  All applicants are being advised, in writing, of the success or otherwise of their application.  Those unsuccessful applicants are being afforded the opportunity of appeal to the DAS Derogation Appeals Committee.  This Committee, to be chaired by Padraig Gibbons, is to be constituted shortly, to adjudicate on those further appeals from farmers dissatisfied with Department decisions on their derogation applications.</p><p><a name='N46'>  Payments under the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme started issuing, on schedule, on 26 September 2012 and, to date, payments worth in the region of €159 million have issued; these payment levels are very much in line with previous years.  Included in this figure are payments to a sizeable number of farmers who successfully applied for derogation from the revised stocking density requirement, included as part of the range of technical adjustments necessitated by budgetary requirements.  Payments will continue to issue as individual cases are confirmed eligible for payment.</p>

The Egyptian market is also open to fattening cattle under 20 months and slaughter cattle under 30 months.

These rules are designed to protect the welfare of livestock during transport. The process of approval involves an initial detailed documentary check to confirm that certain structural, stability and other standards are in compliance with our legislation. If this documentary check is in order, an on-site inspection of the ship is carried out by a Marine Surveyor and a Veterinary Inspector from my Department. While no ship has completed the approval process to date, two ships have recently been inspected as part of the approval process. </p>

The scheme will build on the success of both the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and both AEOS 1 and 2 in delivering an annual income to farmers in return for farming to high environmental standards. A maximum payment of &#8364;4,000 per annum will apply to individual applicants under the re-opened scheme. As the average payments in the past have been lower than the maximum, I am confident that up to 6,000 new participants can be accepted into the scheme. <br><br>  I received EU approval for the advance payment of the 2012 Single Farm Payment. This will enable payment to issue immediately following 15 October and will represent the early payment of some &#8364;600 million to farmers.  <br><br>  I also fully appreciate the value and importance of the other scheme payments to farmers and I remain committed to ensuring that the maximum numbers are paid at the earliest possible date, mindful, of course, of the over-riding necessity to ensure compliance with the governing EU requirements. Payments worth some &#8364;159 million under the Disadvantaged Area Scheme have been issued since 26th September last. This funding will provide a boost to the rural economy and will benefit all areas of the country. REPS payments in respect of 2011 are up to date. A total of &#8364;64 million has been paid out to-date and these payments are continuing on an on-going basis. AEOS payments are well advanced and are being issued as quickly as possible. To date &#8364;23 million has been paid. My intention is to ensure that payments in respect of 2012 are made on the earliest possible date.</p>

I am providing €20 million for the AEOS scheme which will open shortly for applications. The scheme will build on the success of both the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and both AEOS 1 and 2 in delivering an annual income to farmers in return for farming to high environmental standards. A maximum payment of €4,000 per annum will apply to individual applicants under the re-opened scheme. As the average payments in the past have been lower than the maximum, I am confident that up to 6,000 new participants can be accepted into the scheme. </p><p><a name='N15'>  I received EU approval for the advance payment of the 2012 Single Farm Payment. This will enable payment to issue immediately following 15 October and will represent the early payment of some €600 million to farmers.  </p><p><a name='N16'>  I also fully appreciate the value and importance of the other scheme payments to farmers and I remain committed to ensuring that the maximum numbers are paid at the earliest possible date, mindful, of course, of the over-riding necessity to ensure compliance with the governing EU requirements. Payments worth some €159 million under the Disadvantaged Area Scheme have been issued since 26th September last. This funding will provide a boost to the rural economy and will benefit all areas of the country. REPS payments in respect of 2011 are up to date. A total of €64 million has been paid out to-date and these payments are continuing on an on-going basis. AEOS payments are well advanced and are being issued as quickly as possible. To date €23 million has been paid. My intention is to ensure that payments in respect of 2012 are made on the earliest possible date.</p>

The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure an economically and biologically sustainable fishery. I received over 20 sets of proposals and comments in relation to herring stocks management. It was very clear from these documents that there was no agreement within the industry as to how the future herring fishing opportunities should be managed. I asked my Department to examine the proposals received and to prepare for me a number of options, which as far as practically possible, took the views of stakeholders into account while delivering proper and effective management.  </p><p><a name='N5'>  On 22 December 2011, I published a draft policy document on the matter which I believed meets the objectives to the greatest extent possible. I consulted and met industry regarding the draft policy and again there was no consensus.  Having considered all views and having regard to the sustainability of the fisheries, I came to a decision which I believe provides for the proper and effective management and conservation and rational exploitation of the herring stocks. On 8 June 2012 I published a policy, based on giving access to each of the fisheries to those with recent track record in that particular fishery.  The track record involves vessels having landed a minimum of 5 tonnes of herring in 2009 or 2010 or in 3 of the 5 years during the period 2006 to 2010.  In addition, there are some very limited specified  circumstances where an earlier track record may be taken into account.</p><p><a name='N6'>  These are the criteria under which future herring authorisations will be granted and I believe that these track record criteria are objective, transparent and non-discriminatory.  The only exception to track record relates to small vessels in the Dunmore area for the Celtic Sea fishery where a small scale local fishery is permitted in line with the Rebuilding/Management Plan for the fishery. The policy also provides for a modest restricted quota for smaller vessels without a track record in both the Celtic Sea and Area VIa.</p><p><a name='N7'>  The decision made was based on a clear, detailed and objective assessment of the fisheries in recent years.  This policy is intended to ensure the long term sustainability of the herring fisheries by limiting participation in the main fisheries to those vessels which have participated in the fishery, in the 5 years prior to the commencement of the review, even at a low level.  I set down this fishing boat licensing aspects of this policy in Policy Directive 1 of 2012 which I issued to the Registrar of Sea Fishing Boats on 19 September 2012.</p>

I am very conscious that farmers need money in their hands because of the poor summer and because of cash flow problems that some are experiencing at the moment and I am responding to these pressures within the funds available to me.<br><br>  Last week I announced the re-opening of the Agri-Environmental Options Scheme, AEOS, to new entrants.<i>&nbsp;</i>  I am providing &#8364;20 million for the AEOS scheme which will open shortly for applications. The scheme will build on the success of both the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and both AEOS 1 and 2 in delivering an annual income to farmers in return for farming to high environmental standards. A maximum payment of &#8364;4,000 per annum will apply to individual applicants under the re-opened scheme. As the average payments in the past have been lower than the maximum, I am confident that up to 6,000 new participants can be accepted into the scheme.<br><br>  I received EU approval for the advance payment of the 2012 Single Farm Payment. This will enable payment to issue immediately following 15 October and will represent the early payment of some &#8364;600 million to farmers.<br><br>  I also fully appreciate the value and importance of the other scheme payments to farmers and I remain committed to ensuring that the maximum numbers are paid at the earliest possible date, mindful, of course, of the over-riding necessity to ensure compliance with the governing EU requirements.  Payments worth some &#8364;159 million under the Disadvantaged Area Scheme have been issued since 26th September last. This funding will provide a boost to the rural economy and will benefit all areas of the country. REPS payments in respect of 2011 are up to date. A total of &#8364;64 million has been paid out to-date and these payments are continuing on an on-going basis. AEOS payments are well advanced and are being issued as quickly as possible. To date &#8364;23 million has been paid. My intention is to ensure that payments in respect of 2012 are made on the earliest possible date.</p>

Under the CAP reform proposals, the EU Commission has proposed to exclude from receipt of Single Farm Payment those whose annual direct payments are less than 5% of the total receipts they obtain from all non-agricultural activities or, if their agricultural areas are mainly areas naturally kept in a state suitable for grazing or cultivation, they do not carry out a minimum level of activity to be established by each Member State. The exclusion is not proposed to apply to farmers who received less than €5,000 in direct payments in the previous year.</p><p><a name='N19'>  There is substantial opposition from Member States to the Commission proposals particularly the intention to take account of receipts from non-agricultural activity.  Many Member States have put forward alternative proposals to create a negative list comprising, for example, golf courses and airports, that would be excluded from payment. Other Member States have argued for a definition of active farmers that focuses on farming activity as measured through stocking density, crop production, etc. At this point it is too early to speculate on the final solution that may emerge.</p>

The Deputy may be aware that the Biofeuels Obligation Scheme was introduced in 2010 by the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to contribute to achieving the renewable transport target under the Renewable Energy Directive.  The Scheme currently obliges that the amount of biofuel brought to the market is not less than 4.166% of the relevant disposal of petroleum road transport fuels.  In 2011, the biofuel obligation resulted in 145 million litres of biofuel being placed on the market.  The rate of obligation will increase over time and by 2020 it will require suppliers of road transport fuels to make certain that even higher volumes sold are biofuel.  This will ultimately create a market size approaching 500 million litres of biofuel.</p>

The number of applications in total currently awaiting determination is 618.  The average timeframe for processing individual licence applications varies depending on location, species, scale and intensity of production, statutory status of sites, potential visual impact etc.  Other factors include consideration of any submissions or observations raised during the public consultation period.  The number of licence applications awaiting a decision for more than one year is 528.</p><p><a name='N51'>  The number of licence applications awaiting determination largely arises because the majority of areas for which aquaculture licences are sought are located in areas designated as ‘Natura 2000’ sites.  All applications in ‘Natura 2000’ areas are required to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of environmental compliance with the EU Habitats/Birds Directives.

This data collection programme is substantially complete.  Analysis of the data, together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives by the NPWS, will enable all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  This work represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue.

The Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara are working closely together and with the affected farmers to render as much technical assistance as possible under the circumstances. The Marine Institute already provide a monitoring and forecasting service in relation to these naturally occurring algal blooms. I am also aware that personnel from both agencies have visited the affected sites to help assess and catalogue the impacts of the bloom on the oyster stocks and to gather as much environmental data as possible with a view to gaining a greater understanding of the dynamics of such an occurrence.</p><p><a name='N56'>  They will collate and analyse the data gathered which will hopefully lead towards the development of better future mitigation and management measures in the event of future outbreaks occurring. My Department is working very hard, within the constraints of the relevant EU Directives, to streamline the aquaculture licensing system which in turn will allow operators to spread their stock, and hence their risk, over a greater number of locations so that the detrimental effects of any future blooms might be reduced. </p><p><a name='N57'>  In conclusion, I should point out that the effects of the Karenia mikimotoi bloom have no implications with regard to human health issues and that Irish oysters should continue to enjoy a strong quality reputation in the market place and thus continue to attract premium prices, which in turn should help to mitigate the impact of the stock losses.</p>

While the Department was successful in maintaining all three support programmes despite the budgetary constraints that the Government is facing, it was necessary to revise certain payment rates and subvention levels under each programme. <br><br>  The ECCE programme provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  Approximately 95% of children in the year before school are availing of the free pre-school provision at this time.  The ECCE programme is being maintained on a universal and free basis but a reduction of &#8364;2 per week was made to the capitation rates paid to providers from September 2012.  However, to give some flexibility to childcare services to manage this modest reduction, the staff to child ratio for the pre-school element of childcare will increase from a ratio of 1:10 to a ratio of 1:11. <br><br>  The ECCE programme, which will be evaluated and developed as resources permit, continues to provide a guaranteed source of income, payable in advance of each term, to participating childcare services, and is considered a very beneficial support for the private childcare sector at this time of economic difficulty. <br><br>  The CCS programme enables community-based childcare services to provide childcare at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income families.  From September 2012, the higher subvention rate payable for full day care, under this programme, of &#8364;100 per week has been reduced by &#8364;5 to &#8364;95.  Parents in receipt of a social welfare payment but who do not have a medical card entitlement qualify from September 1, 2012 for a payment of &#8364;50 per week for full day care. <br><br>The CETS programme was introduced in September 2010.   The eligibility criteria under which trainees and students qualify for the programme is determined by FÁS and the Vocational Educational Committees (VECs).  From 1 September 2012, the CETS<b>&nbsp;</b>programme provides &#8364;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places to participating childcare services for qualifying FÁS and VEC students for the duration of their course.  Students on part-time courses are funded on a pro rata basis.  This had been the only category of parents who paid no contribution to the cost of their childcare requirements.  Childcare services providing FÁS and VEC places will, from 1 September, be allowed to charge a weekly fee of not more than &#8364;25 per full-time childcare place. </p>

T he HSE registers and inspects  non-statutory voluntary and private children&#8217;s residential centres against these standards.  A copy of the standards is available on my Department's website at <i>www.dcya.ie</i>.<br><br>  The process of assessing standards of care in the centres is undertaken by a HSE inspector who visits the centre and  gathers information through interviews and meetings with the centre management, staff members and young people, analysis of case files and centre records and contact with guardians, social workers and other professionals as appropriate.  Centres are thoroughly inspected and where an inspection report identifies non-compliance with a regulation, the centre will not be registered and re-registered again until compliance has been achieved.<br><br>  All young people who have had a care history with the HSE are entitled to an aftercare service based on their assessed needs. Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 places a statutory duty on the HSE to form a view in relation to each person leaving care as to whether there is a &quot;need for assistance&quot; and if it forms such a view, to provide services in accordance with the legislation and subject to resources.  The basis of an aftercare service is an individual needs assessment which identifies a young person&#8217;s need for accommodation, financial support, social network support and training and education.  The level of support required will vary for each individual from advice to accommodation to further education, employment or training and social support.  The core eligible age range for aftercare is 18 years to 21 years.  The HSE policy allows flexibility for this to be extended up to the age of 23 years to  complete a course of education.</p>

Under the 1995 Child Care Regulations , the HSE is required to consider a child's need for assistance in accordance with the provisions of Section 45, two years prior to the child  leaving care.<br><br>  All young people who have had a care history with the HSE are entitled to an aftercare service based on their assessed needs.  The core eligible age range for aftercare is 18 years to 21 years.  The HSE policy allows flexibility for this to be extended up to the age of 23 years to  complete a course of education.<br><br>  Some 90% of children in care are in foster care and a large number of these remain living with their foster families, supported financially by the HSE, on reaching 18 years of age.  Many of these young people continue in education and training as planned.  This remains a key component of aftercare for young people when they leave care. <br><br>  The basis of an aftercare service is an individual needs assessment which identifies a young person&#8217;s need for accommodation, financial support, social network support and training and education.  The level of support required will vary for each individual from advice to accommodation to further education, employment or training and social support.  <br><br>  The HSE National Aftercare Service is underpinned by a National Policy and Procedures Document which was developed in cooperation with the key stakeholders, including the voluntary sector agencies representing children in care and those involved in aftercare provision and my Department.  The policy  commits to promoting and achieving the best outcomes for young people leaving care and in ensuring consistency of support to these young people. <br><br>  An intra-agency National Aftercare Implementation Group, comprised of NGO groups representing aftercare, child advocacy, foster care and other groups, was established by the HSE to monitor progress in implementing the national policy.  This group aims to provide a standard, intra and inter-agency approach to the delivery of aftercare services in partnership with the wider voluntary and statutory sector.  Discussions are ongoing on the development of a joint protocol between the HSE and the County and City Managers Association Housing sub group to improve the provision of appropriate and supported accommodation for care leavers.  The experience in implementing the National Aftercare Policies and Procedures and the involvement of a range of important stakeholders in this process provides an opportunity to further improve policy and legislation in this area.<br><br>   The Deputy will be aware that I am currently examining options, in association with the Attorney General, to strengthen legislation to make explicit the HSE's obligations in the provision of aftercare.  I have asked Gordon Jeyes, National Director for Children and Family Services in the HSE to prepare a  report on aftercare.  This report will include, <i>inter alia</i>, the key findings of the group, examples of best practice, assessment criteria and effective aftercare supports. This report will guide the development of policy to underpin the strengthening of legislation for services in this important area.</p>

This arrangement arises from an agreement under the umbrella of the International Award Association whereby a young person in Northern Ireland has a choice to pursue the Duke of Edinburgh&#8217;s Award or the Joint Award Programme.  Both programmes are identical in content and process however the Joint Award Programme literature carries the brands of the Duke of Edinburgh&#8217;s Award, Gaisce - The President&#8217;s Award and the International Award and the term <i>The Award</i>   is used to describe the programme.

Funding of €56.806m is being provided by my Department to support the provision of youth services throughout the country in 2012.  This funding covers the provision of targeted supports to disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and through Local Drugs Task Force Projects.  In all some 477 youth projects throughout the country are supported under these schemes.</p><p><a name='N27'>  In 2011, €2,070,000 was allocated to a number of youth projects and programmes which are administered by Dublin City Council on behalf of my Department.  This funding allocation for 2012 was €1,963,000.</p><p><a name='N28'>  The reductions in the allocation for the provision of youth services throughout the country have been necessary because of the challenging fiscal and economic situation facing the country at this time.  In seeking to achieve the necessary savings in the budget, my Department has sought to protect, as far as is possible, front line youth services and to minimise the impact on youth services for the most vulnerable young people.</p>

This programme requires that staff members acting as preschool year leaders hold a child care qualification equivalent to FETAC Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ).   A higher capitation rate is available to sessional playschool services participating in the ECCE programme in which all child care workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the programme. Staff working with children under the ECCE programme, as preschool assistants, are not required to hold an educational qualification.  </p><p><a name='N4'>  Pobal, which administers the child care support programmes on behalf, of my Department compiles an Annual Survey of the Early Years Sectors which provide information in relation to the level of qualifications of practitioners in the child care sector.  According to Pobal's Annual Survey of the Early Years Sector 2011, there are in the region of 4,300 child care services participating in the ECCE programme and approximately 3,280 of these services responded to the survey.  Of this number, some 2,920 provided information on the level of training/qualifications of some 17,000 staff working with children. The results, which did not distinguish between those working with children enrolled for the ECCE programme and other children in the child care service, show that 96% of these services have a least one staff member qualified to FETAC Level 5 or higher, 75.2% have at least one member qualified to FETAC Level 6 or higher and 34% have a least one member qualified to HETAC Level 7 or higher.  The number of services with one staff member qualified to HETAC Level 8 and above and HETAC Level 9 above is 22.3% and 3.2% respectively. </p><p><a name='N5'>  As the Deputy is aware my Department has commenced work on Ireland’s first-ever Early Years Strategy and in the terms of reference, as approved by Government, I expressly included the need to consider “a robust system of regulation and inspection”, for the new Early Years Strategy. Part of this will include improving access to quality reliable information on services and performance.  I have asked the recently–established Expert Advisory Group to prioritise a review of this matter.</p><p><a name='N6'>  The employment of suitably qualified staff is a matter for each individual child care service. It is expected that in time a register of staff qualifications will be developed and providers should encourage staff to record the relevant details of their qualifications there.</p>

A &quot;childminding service&quot; is defined in the Regulations as &quot;a preschool service which may include an overnight service offered by a person who single-handedly takes care of preschool children, including the childminder's own children, in the childminder's home for a total of more than 2 hours per day, except where the exemptions provided in Section 58 of the Child Care Act 1991 apply.&quot;</p><p><a name='N15'>  Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services as well as childminders taking care of more than three preschool children from different families in the childminder’s home.  Childminders taking care of not more than three preschool children from different families are not covered by the Regulations, recognising parental choice to place children with friends and neighbours, and the challenges of the over-regulation of the more informal arrangements chosen by parents.  As a result of this exemption it is not possible to provide a figure for the number of childminders currently providing childminding services.</p><p><a name='N16'>  The National Guidelines for Childminders, compiled by the National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee which oversees the development of an integrated child care infrastructure throughout the country, provide guidance to childminders on good practice, and assist them to decide whether they are subject to the Regulations, as well as providing other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of child care services.</p><p><a name='N17'>  The 2006 Regulations replaced the earlier Regulations, introduced in 1996, and made a number of improvements to the regulatory environment, including the introduction of a requirement for all staff and students working in a preschool service to have been Garda vetted.</p><p><a name='N18'>  As is the case with all regulatory requirements, the Child Care Regulations set the minimum standards which services are legally required to comply with.  However, my Department is proactive in monitoring, promoting and developing the highest standards of care and education throughout the sector, including the regulatory environment, given the important role which these services play in this crucial phase of children’s lives.</p><p><a name='N19'>  My Department also has begun work on Ireland’s first Early Years Strategy which I envisage will be a creative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland’s Early Years sector aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to age six.   One of the issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the development of the childminding sector as a fully-integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for the under-one age group.</p>

In line with the Programme for Government, my Department has made a significant commitment to maintaining the universal free preschool year.  About 65,000 children, that is approximately 95% of children in the year before school, are availing of the free preschool provision at this time.   </p><p><a name='N22'>  In 2011, the ECCE programme cost approximately €163 million.  Additional funding has been made available for 2012 when the cost of the programme is expected to rise to €175 million to cater for changing demographics and provide for the increased number of children in the relevant age cohort. </p><p><a name='N23'>  I am aware of the need to further develop the early childhood care and education sector and it is my view that it could be extremely helpful to some children if the free preschool provision were extended to a second year.  This could be particularly beneficial for certain children with special needs who currently can avail of the preschool year on a pro-rata basis over two years.  However, any development that involved further provision of preschool would require considerable additional funding and given the financial constraints under which the Government is currently operating it is not possible to provide for any enhancements to the programme at this time. </p><p><a name='N24'>  However future developments relating to early years care and education will be considered during preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy 2012.</p>

The necessary legislation is being prepared by my Department as a priority. It is anticipated that the Bill will be published and enacted in the course of this session. It is my intention that the Child and Family Support Agency will assume statutory responsibility for services for children and families in January 2013. <br><br>  The commitment to establish a new Child and Family Support Agency is at the heart of the Government's reform of child and family services.  The establishment of a single agency, underpinned by legislation and incorporating key children and family services, will provide a focus for the major reforms already underway under the National Director for Children and Families, Gordon Jeyes.  This reform programme contains a number of critical elements:<ul type="disc"><li>  The continued and urgent implementation of a comprehensive change programme to improve the quality and consistency of child welfare and protection services;<li>  The commitment to introduce legislation to place Children First on a statutory basis;<li>  The establishment for the first time of a dedicated budget for children and family services, providing transparency and accountability for the use of resources to meet national priorities;<li>  The transition of existing HSE child protection and welfare and services into the new Agency;<li>  The merger of the existing Family Support Agency with a budget of over &#8364;26 million into the Child and Family Support Agency;<li>  Consideration of the potential for further rationalisation of services for children under the new Agency.</ul>  The new Agency will assume responsibility for Children and Family Services, currently provided by the HSE, and the Family Support Agency.  It will have a workforce of approximately 4,000 staff, and a combined existing budget of over &#8364;590 million. The Agency will be headed by Gordon Jeyes, as the Chief Executive designate, who will be supported by a senior management team. The recruitment of this team is at an advanced stage. <br><br>  The new Agency and the wider transformation of children's services represents on the of the largest, and most ambitious, areas of public sector of reform embarked upon by this Government. My Department is working closely with staff representatives and I am very happy to say that the establishment of the new Agency has received the support of unions and a broad range of professional organisations.  </p>

Its core focus is on identifying ways of addressing costs throughout the industry, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law. Bilateral meetings have taken place with each insurer where they have brought forward their own ideas for cost savings in the market.  These ideas are the subject of ongoing deliberation and policy analysis within the Department.</p><p><a name='N50'>The Forum also facilitates participating parties to consider certain issues related to the implementation of Universal Health Insurance (UHI). The future delivery of health services under UHI will require competing insurance companies driving efficient, cost effective delivery of high quality health care.  The Forum will allow the insurance companies to consult with my Department on many significant changes on the road to the full implementation of UHI.   </p>

Unfortunately, it has become necessary for the HSE to suspend certain products from its list of reimbursable items.  These include glucosamine, omega-3 triglyceride products, orlistat, and gluten-free products.<br><br>  Glucosamine is indicated for the management of symptoms of osteoarthritis.  The National Centre for Pharmoeconomics (NCPE) have assessed the cost-effectiveness of glucosamine on two occasions and concluded that it did not offer value for money to the HSE.  However, glucosamine products are available over the counter without prescriptions.<br><br>  Omega-3 triglyceride products (e.g. Omacor) have been identified both nationally and internationally as not being cost effective or being of lesser benefit to patients. However, these products are also available over the counter without prescriptions, as is Orlistat.<br><br>Gluten-free products have become more widely available in supermarkets in recent years and tend to be significantly cheaper than products sold through community pharmacies.  A Supplementary Welfare Allowance Adult Diet Supplement may be awarded by the Department of Social Protection to eligible persons.  Persons wishing to apply for this allowance can do so by completing an application form which can be downloaded at the following link: <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Forms/Documents/swa9.pdf"><u><font color="#0000FF">http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Forms/Documents/swa9.pdf</font></u></a>  .  Separate application forms are available for children. For persons who are not awarded a Diet Supplement, monies spent on gluten-free foods can be taken into account for tax purposes.</p>

This Act was amended in 2006 by the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act, 2006 (No. 22 of 2006) to provide a clear definition for &quot;diagnosed positive for Hepatitis C&quot;.

My officials spoke to the person who has made this request and explained the rationale for the State's position on this issue.  Her question has also been replied to in previous representations and Parliamentary Questions.  While I am sympathetic to the small number of women whose case she represents, and who have tested negative for Hepatitis C, it is estimated that up to 16,000 women in Ireland were exposed to potentially infectious batches of Anti-D.

My officials are liaising with their counterparts in the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  in Northern Ireland on how to progress these issues. </p><p><a name='N20'>  With specific reference to Paediatric Cardiac Surgery, Our Lady’s Children’s Hospital in Crumlin, Dublin 12 has since 2009 been assisting the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust in providing Paediatric Congenital Cardiac Surgery Services to patients from Northern Ireland. Crumlin cared for 9 such patients in 2011 and this year it is expected that over 20 such cases will be carried out Crumlin.</p><p><a name='N21'>  There have been two meetings between the Department of Health and the Department of Health and Social Services and Public Safety and contacts are continuing with a view to determining as soon as possible how best an all Island service might be established and how soon this could be realised if it is determined, through consultation, to be the optimum solution.</p><p><a name='N22'>   I am committed to working together with my Northern colleagues on issues of common concern and benefit. This is of particular relevance  in the current time when both jurisdictions are implementing change and pushing forward  health reform.</p>

It is an important stepping stone towards the introduction of universal health insurance which is the ultimate destination of the Government's reform programme.  As a first step on that journey, hospitals will be aligned within groups on an administrative basis. Each Group will have a single consolidated management team with responsibility for performance and outcomes, within a clearly defined budget and employment ceiling.</p><p><a name='N41'>  In June 2012, the Minister announced the appointment of Professor John R Higgins to work with the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) in the role of Chair of a Strategic Board to assist the Department of Health in the design and establishment of Hospital Groups.

The Project Group led by Professor John Higgins has carried out a comprehensive consultation process with all acute hospitals and other key advocacy groups which have requested an opportunity to be consulted. In addition, a significant number of submissions have been received by the Project Group. The consultation process has continued through the summer and will conclude later this month.</p><p><a name='N42'>  Criteria for the formation of Hospital Groups and proposed groups arising from these criteria will be identified by the Project Group.

In July 2011, I announced changes to the remit of the NTPF - namely that it would move from working to largely outsource treatments for those waiting longest to working with hospitals in a performance improvement capacity to improve access to scheduled care.  The NTPF has been aligned with the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) and is now targeting waiting lists strategically and incentivising hospitals to manage their waiting times proactively.  The NTPF capability is a core part of the SDU's performance improvement role in holding public hospitals to account.</p>

It should be noted that the Disability Act does not create an office which exists independently of the person who holds office and, accordingly, the ODAO is not a corporate body.  Since 2007, the ODAO has successfully supported the DAO in providing the appeals service envisaged under the Disability Act. From 2007 staff from the Department of Health were assigned to the ODAO to assist the DAO in the performance of her functions.<br><br>  Following the decision in October 2008 to defer further roll-out of Part 2 of the Disability Act for other cohorts, it became apparent that the ODAO did not have the volume of work originally envisaged and by 2011 there was an insufficient quantum of work to justify a full-time DAO position.<br><br>  The former Disability Appeals Officer resigned her position with effect from 31/12/2011 and my Department has been in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the filling of this post.  As an interim measure, a Principal Officer on my Department&#8217;s staff has been designated to discharge the duties of the DAO and is independent in the performance of this function.  This is a temporary measure only and a longer term arrangement will be put in place as soon as possible.<br><br>  The provisions for parents wishing to make an appeal have not changed and appeals will continue to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Disability Act.

The programme will be delivered in a phased manner and a series of Technical Guidance documents will issue to all hospitals covering amongst others (a) Governance and Accountability structures (b) the Management of Referrals (c) the Management of Waiting Lists, Booking and Scheduling (d) the Management and Delivery of Outpatient Clinics (e) the Management of DNAs (f) Clinical Outcome Management and (g) Discharging Patients from Outpatient Services.  The first Technical Guidance Document issued on August 20<sup>th</sup>, 2012, with the key focus of putting governance and accountability structures in place, minimising risk and beginning the process of making robust the manner in which patient referrals are handled and triaged.  This document also sets a requirement of a minimum of 6 weeks notification of leave for all outpatient staff.<br><br>  With regard to the specific question regarding DNA numbers, Table 1 sets out a yearly sum of patients who missed scheduled appointments (did not attend) from 2008 to 2010, along with those who attended and total number of appointments booked (supplied by the HSE Business Intelligence Unit).  The DNA rate is calculated by taking the number of missed appointments (DNAs) as a rate of the sum of the total number of attendances and missed appointments.  While hospitals returned activity, including DNA data across 2011, this data was not compiled / processed by BIU due to the roll out of the Outpatient Data Quality Programme.<br><br><b>Table 1.

The main area of waste resulting from patients not attending scheduled clinics is the effort invested in the pulling and preparation of health care records (charts) and the smaller, albeit significant cost, of processing appointment letters and associated costs such as postage, text messages, etc.<br><br>  In situations where patients do not attend, for the most part, staff are occupied attending to other patients in the outpatient area (as many clinics are over-booked) and thereafter, return to their other duties in the general hospital, such as ward work, theatre work and medical administration work such as the typing and processing of medical notes and charts.<br><br>  Most importantly, however, is the effect of DNAs on outpatient waiting lists and wait times.  In 2010, almost 600,000 appointments were missed by patients on hospital waiting lists.  Current outpatient waiting lists do not exceed 400,000 patients.  It is clear, therefore, that the already limited capacity for the system to attend to all patients on the waiting list in a timely manner is being impacted further by these missed (and therefore wasted) appointment slots which prevents this slot being utilised by another patient still waiting for his/her appointment.<br><br>  I am determined to do all that is possible to minimise this waste and reduce waiting lists.  If a patient finds they cannot attend the appointment they have been given I would appeal to all such patients to inform the clinic concerned as soon as they know they cannot attend.</p>

However, <i>A Vision for Change</i> recommended that CAMHS should be provided for all up to the age of 18 years.  The implementation of <i>A Vision for Change</i> is a work in progress and transitional arrangements apply as CAMHS current service provision is expanded to facilitate the provision of services to 16 and 17 year olds.<br><br>  The 2010-2011 audit of CAMHS indicates that of the 55 teams in place during the measurement period (November 2010), 12 teams accept referrals of children over 16 years, 4 teams consider new referrals of children over 16 on a case by case basis, and 39 teams do not accept any new referrals of children over 16 (but continue to see open cases beyond their 16th birthday).<br><br>  As mental health disorders increase in frequency and severity above the age of 15 years, it has been estimated that increasing the age range of CAMHS to 18 years, doubles the cost of providing the service.  The allocation of an additional 150 posts to CAMHS teams as part of the &#8364;35m package provided for mental health in Budget 2012, should help progress the expansion of CAMHS to all up to 18 years.  The National Recruitment Service of the HSE is currently working to recruit the necessary personnel and the posts are at various stages in the recruitment process.  It is hoped that the bulk of the appointments will be made by the end of the year.<br><br>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the HSE has recently finalised &quot;<i>Access Protocols for 16 and 17 year olds to Mental Health Services</i>&quot; and these have been approved by the Management Team and will come into affect from 1st January next. <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b>In an effort to ensure that children are treated in an age appropriate manner, the new protocol provides that from 1<sup>st</sup> January 2013, CAMHS will accept referrals of all new cases of children up to their 17th birthday, and from 1st January 2014, CAMHS will accept referrals of all new cases of children up to their 18th birthday.</p>

Historically, BCG vaccination is given in HSE West to children in 5th/6th class in primary schools and also to infants in the 'at risk' categories.  This continues with the agreement of the NIAC.  This is effective in terms of outcomes.  The latest validated figures for epidemiology of TB in Ireland relates to 2009.
