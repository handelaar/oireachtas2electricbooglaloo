      <P>I have now got to read to the Seanad a communication which I received from Sir Horace Plunkett.  It was dated on the 16th October, but owing to the adjournment of the Seanad as a tribute to the memory of Deputy Philip Cosgrave and Senator McPartlin, there has been no opportunity of bringing it before the Seanad until now.  The letter is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;MY DEAR GLENAVY,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;After too protracted but earnest thought, I have come to the definite conclusion that I am no longer justified in remaining upon the Senate. I therefore place my resignation in your hands and ask you to take the proper steps to have the vacancy filled.  I wish to tender to you, to <Col N="64" /> the Vice-Chairman and the members my grateful thanks for your kindness to me at my two attendances and your indulgence in regard to my many absences.  To you all, as well as to myself, it is due that I should state the reasons for the course I have taken.  They are two, and can be briefly summarised:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Senate may, if its members give sufficient thought to the problems submitted to them for discussion, and disinterested advice to the Government and the people, build up and exercise a great influence for good.  It is a small body and cannot afford to have members who are unable to attend at least a majority of its sittings.  I could not do this for reasons of health in the near future, and do not believe that such attendance will ever be the best way of rendering that service to my country, which will continue to be the chief aim and object of my life for the days I may be spared to see.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  My work lies in the sphere of voluntary effort&mdash;especially organised voluntary effort&mdash;and not in that of legislation or public administration.  It is true that, when much younger, I represented an Irish constituency for eight years in the British Parliament.  I presided over the Irish Convention, worked for the Dominion settlement (without the partition that had to be) and accepted the honour of a nomination to the Senate.  But in the first case I was seeking State assistance for agriculture and industry. This came with the creation and endowment of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, of which I was the working head for its first seven years.  The other political activities were dictated by the recognition that, failing an Anglo-Irish settlement, all the work I wished to do would come to nought.  I joined the Senate from a wish to take some small part in supporting the Free State Government, well knowing the personal inconveniences my doing so might cause.  I would not leave it now if I could be reasonably suspected to be thereby safeguarding my person or property. <Col N="65" /> But, as things are, I do not wish to make a bad precedent in our public life by occupying a position the duties of which I cannot adequately discharge.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I need only add my earnest wish that the fellow-countrymen with whom I shall be no longer officially associated will realise the high ideal of public service they have set before them.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;HORACE PLUNKETT.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To that letter I replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;MY DEAR SIR HORACE,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I read your letter with very great regret, in which I am certain every member of the Senate will share.  I should have asked you to reconsider your determination were it not for your statement that your conclusion was definite.  I shall of course communicate the contents of your letter to the Senate, and have only to add that I welcome your assurance that resignation of your seat will not involve any interruption in your constant devotion and unselfish service in the interests of your country.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If I am in order, I wish to say how much the whole Seanad regrets Sir Horace Plunkett's resignation.  I understand that the establishment of every technical school and agricultural college in this country is the result of his efforts, and we know that the methods of organisation which he perfected in Ireland have spread to a good many countries.  In Ireland he organised, I think, 180,000 farmers into his organisation.  If I remember rightly the last public letter of President Roosevelt, when he was President of the United States, was a letter of thanks to Sir Horace Plunkett for his great services to the organisation of agriculture in the United States. We, here, forget sometimes how great his work has been and how much honourable fame it has brought to this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.W. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we might consider whether it might not be reasonable to ask Sir Horace Plunkett to reconsider his determination to resign from the Seanad.  I have not before me the exact words of his letter, <Col N="66" /> but running through it was a great regret that he could not give the attendances which he felt were essential to the fulfilment of his duties as a Senator.  Whilst agreeing that these are essential, I feel that Sir Horace Plunkett in his sphere, which largely takes him to America, might still help us in that great country in matters with which we might not be in the closest touch here, and by his thought and counsel be of advantage to us. Senator Yeats has alluded to his great activities.  They are many.  He organised the Irish farmers for better farming, better business and better living. I think the results of his activities are observable all through the land in that respect and will continue to live long after he and we have left this sphere. The Department of Agriculture was his child, as was the Congested Districts Board.  These many activities lead me to think that even though he could attend but rarely, yet working outside and giving occasional attendance&mdash; which I am sure he would do&mdash;his actual membership of the Seanad would be to the advantage of the country which he has so loved and to which he has given thoroughly devoted service. For that reason I will venture to move that we ask Sir Horace Plunkett to reconsider his decision and not to resign from the Seanad at this stage.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words with regard to the resignation of my old friend, Sir Horace Plunkett.  We were boys together. I have known him for many years.  There is one thing that he has not mentioned in his letter, and that is, the getting together of the Recess Committee. That Committee was really the beginning of Sir Horace Plunkett's work and was the recognition of his work in co-operation.  I do not say that he had not done something before that, but that put before the world, and especially Ireland, the fact that Irishmen of all parties had got together to work on that Committee.  I can only say that I agree with everything that Senator Bennett and Senator Yeats have said about Sir Horace Plunkett, and I can only re-echo what you, Sir, have said in your letter, that we hope that Sir Horace Plunkett will continue <Col N="67" /> the good work that he started in this country.  We in this Seanad must remember that Sir Horace Plunkett has been consulted with regard to co-operation by almost every leading man in Europe and America, except, of course, from Denmark, where the system of co-operation has been carried on most successfully for very many years.  I am afraid my old friend will not come back amongst us here.  I am glad to tell you his health is very much better. I think it must be very much better, because I saw an excellent letter from him in the <i>Times</i> the other day, dated from his house in London. I could not let this occasion pass without expressing my regret that we shall not see him here again, because I do not think we shall see him sitting here in our Seanad again.</P>

      <P>I would not like this occasion to pass without saying a few words.  I have had many communications extending over a great many years with Sir Horace Plunkett. When the co-operative movement was beginning, I know the zeal and energy he put into it.  Everybody knows that. We know that he practically made the co-operative movement in Ireland, and even elsewhere to a great extent, and not that movement alone, but that he helped every movement that was for the good of Ireland.  I have not always been in entire agreement with him on various matters, but I think everyone recognises his devotion to Ireland and the work and labour he gave so unselfishly, without any hope of gain or reward.  So many things have happened in the last few years in Ireland that we are inclined to forget some things, but those of us who remember, know that Sir Horace Plunkett has done great and good work for Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS GRATTAN ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say how deeply I regret that Sir Horace Plunkett's health has compelled him to sever his connection with the Seanad.  I think it is a great pity, when our country is struggling to her feet, that the Seanad should lose the services of a man who has given his whole life, with absolute disinterestedness, to further Irish interests. <Col N="68" /> I do not know whether Senator Bennett has made any proposition, inviting Sir Horace Plunkett to reconsider his determination, but if he has done so I would like to support it.  I think it is the least compliment we could pay to a very distinguished man and a very honest patriot.  Perhaps the Seanad might see their way to give Sir Horace Plunkett leave of absence.  That might be a way out of the difficulty if the Seanad thought it a good way of treating the question.  I think some steps should be taken to convey to Sir Horace Plunkett the knowledge of how high the Seanad appreciate him and of how much they regret his loss.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is possible for any friend of Ireland to let this occasion go by without paying an earnest tribute to Sir Horace Plunkett.  I do not think there is anybody in Ireland who has given such devotion and personal service as well as his finances with absolute disregard to his own interests, for the good of this country.  There has been in him a purity of aim and a nobility of action throughout. No disheartenment, it did not matter to him if it was defeat or failure from the personal point of view, deterred him.  In all he did his one thought was of this country.  Therefore, I think whatever resolution is come to by the Seanad, it is impossible to record in too warm terms our sense of the devotion of a good man.</P>

      <P>As one of Sir Horace Plunkett's old colleagues in his co-operative work, I think it would ill-become me if I did not add my voice, as I believe it is the wish of the Seanad to ask him to reconsider his resignation.  I know the difficulties of his position.  I know that he has been in failing health for some years, but I also know that he has always put duty to his country first, and that he has faithfully performed his duties even when they must have been torture to him.  I do not know a more unselfish patriot, and I certainly join in any resolution that may be passed asking him to reconsider his decision.</P>

      <P>Of course, personally, no one would more sincerely <Col N="69" /> welcome Sir Horace Plunkett back, but I have reason to know that this is not a hasty step taken by him, but that he has been in consultation with other members of the Seanad for some months past with reference to the subject. Some of them tried to induce him to alter his decision.  Consequently when he wrote to me to say that he had arrived at a definite conclusion in the matter I did not think that I could take it on myself to ask him to reconsider that determination.  If the Seanad wishes to pass a resolution it is quite within its power to do so.  The only thing I suggest is that it ought to be very slow before coming to any conclusion on the understanding that he is not to give attendance here.  I think that would be a very unsatisfactory procedure.  If there is any reasonable hope that Sir Horace would be able to give some attendance here, so far as I am concerned I would welcome the resolution.  From what I know I do not think it is likely that he would alter his decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Seanad would be paying Sir Horace Plunkett a reasonable compliment if it did not accept what he believes is his own mind.  He is a man who knows his own mind.  There is no resolution which it could pass which would pay sufficient compliment to him for the work he has done for the country.  In doing that I do not think that we should add any note by which we might make it possible for him to think that he had not discharged his duty in the past and that we wanted him to do something further in the future.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might suggest to Senator Bennett that he would consider that it might be more dignified and more complimentary to Sir Horace Plunkett if he would frame a resolution somewhat to the following effect:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Seanad, while accepting his resignation with regret, desires to place on record its appreciation of the pre-eminent services he has for so many years rendered to his country.&rdquo; I only throw that out as a suggestion. It is entirely a matter for the Seanad</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite in your <Col N="70" /> hands and in the hands of the Seanad. I still have at the back of my mind a hope that Sir Horace Plunkett, zealous as he is and desirous for work himself, feels that he is not in a position to give time and attention to the Seanad.  Still his work in the co-operative movement will bring him back here, and I feel it is quite possible that he would be able to give an attendance which would justify us in keeping him on.  For that reason I should like to move a resolution asking him to reconsider his resignation. It will only delay the matter for a week, as I am quite sure he will reply within a week.  In the first instance I should like to ask him to reconsider his decision.  I therefore propose that resolution.</P>

      <P>That postpones for the present any question of an election to fill the place of Sir Horace Plunkett, but there remains the fixing of a date for the election to the vacancy occasioned by the death of Senator McPartlin.  Under existing Standing Orders you will find it provided under Order 105 that the first thing to do is to fix the date.  Shall we say the sitting of the Seanad first taking place after next week?  Seven days are given within which candidates may be proposed and seconded after the date is fixed.  If you fix it for a fortnight hence, say this day fortnight, seven days will be allowed for the proposing and seconding of candidates, and the election can take place this day fortnight, assuming the Seanad meets, or the first day afterwards.</P>

It might be better if it could be arranged to adopt the arrangement suggested by Senator Moore and have the two vacancies filled on the same day.  The difficulty is that at present there is only one vacancy, and until we ascertain Sir Horace Plunkett's decision we cannot make arrangements for filling his vacancy.  Under Standing Orders we have to proceed to fill the vacancy that has occurred, and the only question is whether this day fortnight would be considered too soon, or convenient.</P>

      <P>I desire to ask the leave of the Seanad to make a personal explanation with regard to an incident which occurred at the meeting on the 10th October.  I have no intention to question any ruling of the Chairman. I regret so long an interval has passed since the meeting on the 10th when the incident took place.  I had asked the Chairman for permission to bring it up at the next meeting after the 10th, but the circumstances under which we met prevented it, and I adjourned it. At all events time prevents heat. Senators cannot be expected to remember <Col N="72" /> the details of what happened on the 3rd and 10th instant, so I will re-state them in a few words.  On the 3rd, a discussion arose as to the best form of procedure to be followed with regard to the Governor-General's Address, and Senator Bennett moved:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That we adjourn the consideration of the Address to this day week, to give us time for the consideration of it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>No amendment was proposed, and after some discussion it was passed.  I understood this to mean that the whole procedure with regard to the Governor-General's speech would be adjourned, and that the decision whether there should be an Address in reply, or a resolution in reply to it, would not be prejudiced.</P>
      <P>That is what I understood and voted for.  I put all discussion on this aside, merely saying that was my impression, and that I am not alone in that opinion. Some Senators who have read the proceedings carefully agree with my view; it cannot, therefore, be called an absurd view.  I merely say that was my honest opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>In case the Seanad should decide on an address in reply to the Governor-General's speech, I thought it best to put down a motion, so that Senators might have time to consider the matter, as it was important. Except to find that my motion was not down on the agenda, I heard no more about it, and had no idea of the reason.  On entering the Seanad I heard someone say there might be no address in reply.  Not knowing what the procedure would be, and anxious about the fate of my resolution, I asked the following question, certainly with no desire to embarrass any one:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;On a point of order, I handed in an amendment which, I am informed, is objected to because there is to be no vote of thanks.  In principle I am quite in agreement with that.  I do not want to object to that in any way, but I acted upon last year's arrangement when the <Col N="73" /> Cathaoirleach suggested that there should be a vote of thanks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was stopped at this point by the Chairman.  I intended to suggest &ldquo;if the Senate decided to have no address or resolution in reply to the Speech, my amendments might be taken as a separate resolution.&rdquo;  This proposal might have been unacceptable, I am not disputing that; the Chairman might have refused.  I asked a simple question, as I understand any Senator has a right to do.  I have read the question, and I think Senators will admit it was not a provocative question; certainly it was not so meant.  The Chairman ruled my proposal out of order because he said it had already been decided to have no resolution.  With that I have nothing to say, except that I did not so understand the Senate's vote.  He added:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Really, it is too bad that the Senator does not pay attention to what takes place in the Senate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And he went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I must say I think it very unfortunate that any Senator should now seek to go behind it (i.e., the decision of the Senate) because it puts his colleagues in a very unpleasant position before the public and the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here are two distinct charges launched at me in answer to my simple and unprovocative request, only half of which was listened to.  The first is a comparatively small matter, which, though undeserved, I could afford to pass over; the second is a very serious imputation on my character, which has gone all over Ireland, with headlines in the papers, &ldquo;that I was seeking to go behind the decision of the Senate so as to put my colleagues in a very unpleasant position before the people of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How this simple question, or request, of mine could have such direful results for my colleagues is far beyond the reach of my intelligence or my imagination. We have heard of a mountain in labour bringing forth a ridiculous mouse, but we have here a poor little mouse of a question made to mother a monster to destroy my colleagues. Rather ludicrous it seems to me.</P>
    <P>With regard to the minor charge of negligence and lack of attention, I may <Col N="74" /> say this: I listened carefully to the discussion on the 3rd; I was not content with my memory; I read carefully the official report; I also found that the Dáil had an Address in reply before it.  I pursued the matter further and referred to last year's proceedings, when, at the recommendation of the Chairman, an Address of thanks for the Governor-General's speech was passed.  I found that a certain Senator Moore had put down a motion at that time to discuss a matter concerning the Governor-General's speech, but it was ruled out of order, very properly&mdash;the Chairman saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The only other business is a notice in the name of Senator Colonel Moore.  I will be compelled, I am afraid, to rule it out of order, and I want Colonel Moore to understand why I do so.  It is quite natural he should have put this down in its existing form, but if he looks at the Standing Orders, under which we are at present working, he will find that a Standing Order has been expressly framed to avoid discussions of what I may call a barren nature&mdash;discussions on things that lead to nothing. In other words, he will find a Standing Order which provides that every motion must take the form of a resolution, and it must ask the Seanad to resolve something.  It is not to be merely sterile, and it is not to call for a mere expression of views; it is to ask the Seanad to take action in some respect.  That is the object of that Standing Order, and as long as we have that, this motion of Colonel Moore's contravenes it.  It does not ask for any action, or suggest the passing of any resolution.  It simply says he wishes to call attention to certain things.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seemed to me that decision precluded a discussion without a resolution unless Standing Orders were suspended, but Senator Moore is wrong both ways: wrong when he thought there could be a discussion without a resolution, and wrong when he thought the opposite. I went further still.  I went to the Senate to enquire from the Chairman if my motion had been accepted, and not finding the Chairman, phoned to his house, but did not get him.  I heard <Col N="75" /> no more of the matter till I entered the Senate.  What more could an uninformed Senator do, except ask the Chairman, when proceedings began, for guidance.  That other Senators are of my opinion may not prove we are right, but surely that question which I have read did not deserve to be made the basis of a charge of dishonourable conduct; at least we might expect a simple negative.  The Chairman complained that I had said, &ldquo;I take your ruling, but I do not agree at all.&rdquo;  These accusations were wrapped in the ruling. How could I agree with them?  It seems to me I made a very mild protest. Serious accusations of this sort, if made across the House, can be answered at once.  Is it fair that they should be made by a Chairman who cannot be answered at once?  Every honest man should repudiate such a charge, but it goes out to the country unanswered. That is why I asked for leave to make a personal explanation, and I leave the matter to the House.</P>

      <P>I very much regret that the Senator should have thought it necessary to bring up this matter before the Seanad, because it compels me very shortly to state the position, a position which I think will satisfy the Seanad.  Certainly, though I may not have stated enough, I did not say any more than the occasion justified.  On the 3rd October we discussed the question as to what our proceedings would be with reference to the Address of His Excellency, the Governor-General, and I made a suggestion to the Seanad which was received without objection, of any sort or kind, from any quarter of the Seanad, that perhaps the best and wisest course would be simply to have a discussion on the Address.  So much did it agree with the sense of the Seanad as a whole that when the Committee retired five minutes afterwards into my room to frame a Standing Order to regulate the procedure for future occasions they adopted precisely the suggestion I made that day, and which, as I have said, was received without objection from any quarter of the Seanad.  Senator Colonel Moore has told us what his intentions, understandings, <Col N="76" /> and thoughts were.  I need hardly remind him that I cannot say what are his thoughts and intentions. They are wrapt up in his own breast.</P>
      <P>I can only act upon Senators' acts and words, and accordingly after that understanding, arrived at by the tacít consent of the entire House, I found, when we met on the following Wednesday, the 10th, the Senator got up and complained that he was not allowed to move an amendment, I felt that he was putting the House and his colleagues in a very false position.  I did not say, as he has suggested I said, that he did it for that purpose; I never said anything of the kind.  What I did say was that an action of that kind was calculated to put his colleagues in a false position before the country, and I say so still.  There is one matter, perhaps, to which the Senator has not thought it worth while to allude, but I cannot allow it to pass in silence because it affects the position and status of the officials of our House.  On that day, the 10th of October, in order to justify his interpretation of what I had stated at the previous meeting on Wednesday, he made the following statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I carefully read over all the statements made the other day in consonance with the Clerk of the Seanad, and it was quite agreed that no such arrangement had definitely been come to.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to say that I deprecate in the strongest way the introduction of any reference to any advice received from any officials of the House.  These officials are ready and willing to give their advice to Senators who consult them, but if that advice is always to be quoted in the House and relied upon as a justification for quarrelling with the ruling of the Chairman, it puts our officials in a very false position, indeed, because it brings them into direct conflict with the Chair and in conditions under which they cannot either reply or defend themselves.  But what are the facts with regard to this &mdash;I mean as I am informed by the officials, as, of course, in accordance with my duty I consulted them about it?  The Clerk of the Seanad tells me that Senator Colonel Moore never <Col N="77" /> opened his lips to him on the subject, never mentioned it or discussed it with him, directly or indirectly.  The Assistant Clerk tells me that Senator Colonel Moore did consult him, but that he expressly warned Senator Colonel Moore that he would be out of order in attempting to move any amendment, owing to the agreement arrived at, at the previous meeting, that there was to be no resolution, no amendment, and no discussion.</P>
    <P>I cannot suggest a better illustration of the impropriety or the undesirability of any Senator introducing in debate in this House any reference to advice given him by one of our officers than the unpleasantness caused in this particular case.  It is not for me to determine whether the recollection of the Senator or the recollection of the officers is right, but the very fact that this conflict of recollection has arisen illustrates in the strongest way how undesirable it is that the names of our officers should be introduced in this way, and for the future I shall unhesitatingly rule out of order any such references.  I have no more to say upon that; that ends the discussion, and we will now pass on to the next business.</P>

      <P>You are out of order, Senator.  Let me explain to you.  Sit down, please, while I am speaking.  I referred to a conflict of recollection&mdash;I put it in that way&mdash;that has arisen between Senator Colonel <Col N="78" /> Moore and the officials of this House. We have no power to determine who is right in that.  I did not determine who was right in that conflict of recollection, but I did refer to it in justification of the Clerk, who cannot speak for himself, and who is entitled to defend himself from the suggestion that he gave advice to Senator Colonel Moore which was in direct conflict with the ruling I had given in the House. That is a matter which I was, of course, bound to mention in defence of the Clerk.  As to whether his recollection or that of Senator Colonel Moore is right is not for the House to determine; but the House has an illustration of how undesirable it was that any Senator should, in debate, introduce any reference to advice given him by our officials, because our officials are not in a position to speak for themselves, nor is the House in a position to decide between the Senator and the officials.  That is not a matter that in any way concerns anyone else, and, as I have said, any further discussion of it is out of order.</P>

      <P>6.  When the Cathaoirleach shall have entered the Chamber at the commencement of the sitting, all the Senators present shall stand, and the following Prayer shall be read by the Clerk:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;O Almighty and Eternal God, Ruler of all things and of all men, we, Thy servants here assembled, most humbly beseech Thee to grant us Thy Divine Guidance in our deliberations, that Peace, Justice, Truth, Religion, and Piety may reign in our Country, to the Honour and Glory of Thy Name.

      <P>I think it is only right that the prayer should be read in Irish.  I have been consulted by Senator the Earl of Wicklow in regard to this matter, and I suggested to him, and I understand other Senators also suggested, that the prayer should be bi-lingual&mdash;in Irish and English&mdash;and that the Irish version of it should be printed in Roman characters and circulated amongst the Senators for their use.  In that way Senators would, in a very short time, become familiar with the sound of the prayer in Irish as read by the Clerk.  I think it would be a very damaging thing to the cause of <Col N="86" /> the Irish language if this Seanad gave an example to the country by ignoring it.  The Government has done a great deal for the propagation of the language, and will continue to do a great deal, and we hope that some day in the Dáil they will come to have prayers before their proceedings.  I would venture to say that in all probability these prayers will be read in Irish, and if we want to be consistent in our support of the language movement we should have our prayer in Irish as well as in English.</P>

      <P>I think it would perhaps be a little premature, Senator, to propose that recommendation just now.  At best it would amount to a direction that it should be read in both languages.  I think, perhaps, that it would be a mistake.  It is not, of course, for me, but for the Seanad, to decide.  I think probably it would be wiser to let it proceed as the Committee recommends, and then later on, if the Seanad were prepared for it, to have it read either also in Irish or exclusively in Irish.  I think you are a little premature about it.  I only throw out that suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope no definite decision will be taken as to the exact wording of the Prayer, or as to whether it should be read in Irish.  I think it ought to be known that the words of the Prayer are the result of conversations, I believe, that took place between the two Archbishops of Dublin&mdash;Catholic and Protestant&mdash;and it is certainly the case that the wording was approved by both of them.  That is why the Prayer is suggested to the Seanad by the Committee.  Personally, I think it is most desirable that the same form of Prayer should be used in both the Dáil and the Seanad.  I think it would be very undesirable, unless there is a very strong difference of opinion, that there should be any difference on a matter of religious observance between the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  Consequently, although the matter has come <Col N="87" /> before the Seanad first, it is, I understand, about to be recommended for incorporation in the same form by the Standing Orders Committee to the Dáil. Whether they are making a recommendation to read it in Irish or English I do not know.  I think it well that the Seanad should have definite information as to the action to be taken in the Dáil before coming to a definite decision.</P>

      <P>It strikes me that I should almost apologise for my presumption, being one of the junior Senators, in venturing to suggest to the Seanad that it would be proper for them to indulge in this religious observance at the opening of the proceedings. As no one else was disposed to do so, and as I received kind encouragement, I ventured to write letters to every Senator, and I received kind and sympathetic replies, suggesting a Prayer, somewhat in the form in which it appears in the Report.  With regard to the words selected, they were mainly suggested to me by a layman friend. I took the words to His Grace the Archbishop of the Church of Ireland in Dublin and consulted him.  He made one or two small suggestions, and he subsequently, at my suggestion, discussed the Prayer with the Administrator of the Pro-Cathedral, in the absence of the Roman Catholic Archbishop. They agreed that the words were most suitable for our proceedings.  On the return of the Catholic Archbishop I visited his house, and he was kind enough to say that on the whole he agreed with the wording.  His Grace thought perhaps that the Prayer might be more dignified, or more eloquent, but in his view it met the requirement of a Prayer such as we desire to use. He made one or two trifling amendments, which are now in the Prayer. <Col N="88" /> With regard to the prayer being read in Irish, I sympathise entirely with those who made the suggestion, but, as Senator Yeats has pointed out, there is a doubt whether anything approaching a majority of the Senators would understand it, if it were read in Irish. I rather doubt if in the near future it is likely that Senators will be much better informed in that direction. Would it suit the view of those who take their stand on the side of the Irish language, if the Prayer was translated into Irish and used on alternate occasions in each language?  It seems to me that it would be rather cumbersome if the Prayer was read in both languages on the same day.  If it would be more practicable to have it read on one occasion in Irish, and the next occasion in English, I would not have any objection.  In fact, rather than have no Prayer at all, I would prefer to have it read in Irish.  In any case whatever the Seanad may desire to do, I hope, now that we have got so far as having it on the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee, that nothing will happen to prevent the institution of a Prayer asking for that guidance which, I do not think any Senator will be prepared to deny, we are sorely in need of.</P>

      <P>I think Senator the Earl of Wicklow should be congratulated on the way he has dealt with this matter.  Speaking for myself, I consider the Prayer to be a very good one.  I have read it myself, and it takes exactly a quarter of a minute.  If it takes a quarter of a minute to read it in English, I suppose it would not take much longer to read it in Irish.  If it is read in English first we shall understand it, and if it is then read in Irish we would have the Prayer in our minds and we would understand the purport of it.  Therefore, the whole thing, if it is read in both languages, will only take half a minute.  I have not the slightest objection to having it read in Irish, and if it pleases Senators to have it read in that language, well and good.</P>

      <P>May I support Senator the Earl of Mayo's suggestion, <Col N="89" /> that it would be becoming and decorous to read the Prayer in Irish first and then in English.  After all, it does not matter what language we pray in.  It is the spirit of the prayer, not the wording of it, that matters.  The Prayer ought to be said in Irish and English. I shall endeavour to say it in both languages.  I would like to congratulate Senator the Earl of Wicklow on the manner in which he has carried this matter through.  He has spent an anxious time dealing with the question of the Prayer, and he has been most industrious and most painstaking.  May I also say that he has acted with extremely good tact.  It is a most agreeable thing, and it is significant of the spirit of this little country of ours, to get the heads of the Protestant and the Catholic churches to agree upon a form of Prayer of this kind.  It is a most hopeful sign, and I desire to congratulate Senator the Earl of Wicklow on his efforts.  I hope we will have the Prayer when the Seanad meets in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. YEATS</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a very emphatic protest against the histrionics which have crept into the whole Gaelic movement.  People pretend to know a thing that they do not know and which they have not the smallest intention of ever learning.  It seems to me to be discreditable and undesirable.  I hope this will not be taken as being unsympathetic to the Gaelic movement.  In the Abbey Theatre, on Monday night, a play in Irish was produced, and the theatre was packed with an enthusiastic audience.  They knew Irish, and they were able to understand the language of the play, but I think this method of histrionics, and going through a childish performance of something we do not know, and which we do not intend to learn, will ultimately <Col N="90" /> lead to a reaction against the language.  I wish to say that I wish to see the country Irish speaking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the resolution. Senator Yeats talks of histrionics and so forth, but to be consistent he should have started at the beginning when we termed our Chairman <i>An Cathaoirleach,</i> and used the expressions <i>Níl</i> and <i>Tá</i> for No and Yes.  If he looks at the Order Paper every day he will find that a great part of it is printed in Irish and English.  Is it not rather late in the day now to raise this protest on the ground that it is mere sentiment?  After all, Senator Yeats will admit that there is something in sentiment, and that great movements have been inspired merely on the ground of sentiment.  We found sentiment in hard-headed business people during the great war when we found people changing their German titles and changing the names of cities and streets simply because they had a Teutonic atmosphere or tinge about them.  On these grounds I think the protest is somewhat late in the day and somewhat out of place in regard to this particular motion.</P>
      <P>After all, the legislative assembly of this country is not doing anything very silly, and I think it is acting well in trying to encourage the study of the language of the country itself.  That does not in the least prevent those who wish to develop West-British ideas from developing them, but I do not think that they should do anything to discourage the study of the language of most of our forefathers so that we may become acquainted with its history and develop an idealism which is more suited to our people than an imported one which has never fitted very well and which has not proved very successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out that as the proposed alteration reads, no motions of any kind would be moved which, I take it, would prevent a definite amendment either approving of or objecting to the Governor-General's Speech on the day it is received.  It would not prevent a separate motion being proposed by members of the Seanad.  I think the reasons for that were considered at length.  A motion approving of the Speech will be moved in the Dáil.  It is well known that the Governor-General's Speech is the programme for the Session of the Executive Council.  The Executive Council under the Irish Constitution must consist of members of the Lower House. Therefore it seems impossible for them to attend at both places, and as they are responsible only to the Lower House the Seanad would not be wise in having the Address in both Houses, as Senators would not have the attention desired from the Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a further point, the Seanad does not want to commit itself in advance to legislative proposals in the abstract.  You find in the Governor-General's Address that it was the intention of the Government to introduce a Bill for such and such a purpose.  We will receive that Bill, no matter whether we like it or not.  We must take it on its First Reading because it is a Government Bill.  If the Seanad were to express its opinion it would be on important principles, and the Standing Orders Committee is placing itself in a false position.  Therefore, while the Standing Orders state that without actual division they should <Col N="93" /> disapprove or approve of it, that would be sufficient to give an idea of what the feeling of the Seanad was.  That would leave them free to discuss the matters when they came before them in a constitutional manner.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy-Chairman has said seems to me to contradict itself.  In the first place, he said anyone who wished, on the second day, to bring in a motion, might do so without any objection, but in the latter part of his speech he meant it would be undesirable in any case for the Seanad to consider motions about the Governor-General's speech until those came up in the form of Bills.

      <P>My first remark possibly might have led to the statement made by Col. Moore.  My first remark was that nothing in this Order could prevent the ordinary right at another time to raise a particular question by means of a motion, which, I think, is the undoubted right of a Senator, if he gets the support of the Seanad.  But if you provide here that there shall be moved an address of approval or disapproval, you force the Seanad to come to a decision.  There is a great difference between an option and forcing them to have an address of approval.</P>

      <P>No; that is not so.  What I did say is, if this Standing Order is adopted there will be, on the day the Governor-General's Address is received, an opportunity for the Seanad to discuss it if they wish.  That discussion is to proceed and end without motion or amendment.  That disposes of the proceedings on the day the Address is received.  That does not prejudice the right of any member, on the next day, to give ordinary notice of motion dealing with any particular topic in the Address he thinks fit.</P>

      <P>There is no use discussing questions which are referred to in the Governor-General's Address, when those questions come before us in the form of Bills.  Those matters may not come before us for weeks.  What the Seanad wishes is to preserve the right of the Seanad to express its views on the policy of the Government when that policy is declared.  The only way to do that is to speak on the Address.  As I read this Standing Order, we cannot make any practical objection to anything in the Governor-General's Speech on the first day.  But on the second day, by giving notice of motion to the effect that the Seanad disagrees with the Address on such and such a point, that question will come up automatically.</P>

It can have a general discussion on it and express its views quite freely, but it would be much better for the Seanad, more especially in the absence of Ministers, <Col N="95" /> if they adopted this proposal, because that will enable them three weeks later to raise any question they think has been omitted or not properly dealt with.</P>

      <P>I think, Senator Colonel Moore, that you are under a misapprehension about this. Under the Standing Orders that we been acting on for some time past there is a provision, somewhat similar to this new Order, which requires that a Senator who wants to raise a matter should have the consent of ten other Senators.  We thought that it was a little restrictive on the rights of a Senator, and, accordingly, we framed a new Order which does not require the consent of ten members, but the two cannot stand together.  You propose they should stand together?</P>

It says he is to leave the Chair except in a number of cases, but these cases are not exhaustive, and accordingly we thought it better to cover the whole ground by putting in the word &ldquo;controversy,&rdquo; so that whenever there is a controversy, no matter what it is, he has to leave the Chair.  Otherwise an occasion might arise when he would not know whether he had to leave the Chair or not.  For example, as the Standing Order stands, I should have to leave the Chair when I was reading out Sir Horace Plunkett's letter and when I was referring to the death of Senator McPartlin, and the President's brother, so that instead of enumerating the occasions on which he has to leave the Chair it would be far better to say that he is to leave the Chair on all occasions when there is a matter of controversy before the House.</P>

He shall then judge and declare which side is in the majority, and if his decision be challenged he shall order the Seanad to divide.  After an interval of three minutes the Cathaoirleach shall again put the question to the majority, and if his decision be challenged he shall order the doors of the Chamber to be closed and they shall remain closed until the Division has been taken, and each Senator then present shall, when his name is called, rise in his place and record his vote by replying <i>&lsquo;Tá&rsquo; or &lsquo;Níl&rsquo;</i> as the case may be.  The Clerk shall then hand the Division Paper to the Cathaoirleach, who shall announce the numbers to the Seanad, and declare the result of the Division; provided always that the Cathaoirleach, if in his opinion the claim for a Division is made solely for obstruction, may call upon the Senators who claim it to rise in their places, and if they do not exceed five in number he shall declare the result as already decided by him; but any Senator who has risen may claim to have his vote recorded in the Journal of the House. <Col N="101" /> With the unanimous consent of the Seanad, a Senator may, for special reasons assigned by him, change his vote, immediately after the announcement of the Division.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>No. 11 contains several changes, that I suggested to the Committee and of which they approved.  We have found that when a division is called for, and is about to take place, that members whose names happen to be low on the roll may have an advantage over members whose names are earlier on the roll, because the earlier ones may not have come in when the division is called, and consequently may miss the opportunity of recording their votes.  What the Committee has recommended in the new order is, that after the question is put to the House by the Chairman, and he has given his decision as to how the majority lies, if a division is then called for that there should be an interval of 3 minutes, that it should be increased from 2 to 3 minutes.  At the end of the 3 minutes he should put the question again in the ordinary way, and if a division is again challenged, then he should order the House to divide.  The advantage of that is that very often&mdash; at least I found it in my experience in the House of Commons&mdash;members would call for a division, and the question was put to them for the first time, and after the House was cleared and all the trouble and bother gone to, and when the question was put by the Speaker, or Chairman, they did not challenge a division, and the division was called off.  I think we ought to have that opportunity in the Seanad, and accordingly we recommend that after the question has been put for the first time, and a division called for, and the 3 minutes interval is up, it should be put again, and that on a formal show of hands the Chairman might be allowed to declare the result, and the result then passes unless a division is called for a second time.  There is one other matter I want the House to notice, and it is that every member present when the division is called and the doors closed must vote.  Those are the two changes.  No. 12 is purely verbal.</P>

      <P>Certainly. With the leave of the House, it is constantly done.  A member might quite easily misunderstand from the way the question was put whether his vote should be tá or níl, and he may find out that he has voted wrongly.  It is like a man going into the wrong lobby in the House of Commons.  He is entitled to have his vote properly recorded. There can be no abuse of this power.  It can be done only by the unanimous consent of the House, and we feel that the opportunity should be given where the House is satisfied that a real bona fide mistake is made to rectify it.</P>

We are supposed to be honourable men and women, and I do not think any man or woman in this Seanad who happened to respond &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; or &ldquo;Níl&rdquo; would afterwards, for some ulterior motive, try to withdraw from that position, and say he or she had voted otherwise.

    <P>The Committee, having considered the question of forms of procedure in the Seanad, have decided to recommend the adoption of the following Rules.  The Committee do not suggest <Col N="109" /> that these should be incorporated in the Standing Orders, but that they should be regarded as matters of etiquette for general observance by Senators:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  Upon the conclusion of the Prayer provided for in the Standing Order No. 6, Senators shall remain standing until the Cathaoirleach or presiding Senator has taken his seat.</P>
    <P>2.  Any Senator who enters the House after the sitting has opened shall bow to the Cathaoirleach or presiding Senator before taking his seat.</P>
    <P>3.  Senators shall avoid passing in front of the Cathaoirleach or presiding Senator, except in urgent cases, when they shall bow to the Chair in passing.</P>
    <P>4.  No Senator shall pass in front of any member who is actually addressing the House.</P>
    <P>5.  No Senator shall read any newspaper or other Journal in the House during its sitting, save for the purpose of the business then under consideration.</P>
    <P>6.  If Senators have occasion, when the House is sitting, to speak together, they shall retire below the Bar and not engage in conversation within the precincts of the House in any way calculated to disturb its ordinary procedure.</P>
    <P>7.  Senators shall not remain standing in any of the passages or doorways of the Chamber.</P>
    <P>8.  No Senator shall address or unreasonably interrupt any member who is speaking in the House. Should he wish to interrupt for the purpose of explanation or contradiction, he shall do so by addressing the Chair on a point of Order.</P>

      <P>May I ask a question with reference to the Report <Col N="112" /> of the Joint Committee on Private Bill procedure?  Would it be desirable to enter into consideration of it at this stage, as there are a great many small amendments, not controversial, which would take some time to go through?

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing is that it is very inconvenient to discuss any Report of this kind.  I am afraid there will be very little advantage gained by discussing the Report here.  I should inform the Seanad that the Report is the result of the labours of a Joint Committee, consisting of six representatives from the Seanad and six from the Dáil.  It had previously been very carefully prepared by a member of the Irish Bar and was afterwards revised thoroughly by an expert from that particular office in the British House of Commons.  I spent weeks over it myself, and I had the assistance of the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  The Report is now in the shape we ultimately put it after many weeks of labour.  If the Seanad would like to take it and discuss it, that is another matter, but I am afraid they will have to take most of it on trust.  The orders are purely technical, many of them entirely dealing with legal matters.  Some are of a scientific nature, on which, of course, we had to get expert assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">

      <P>As you know the Standing Orders of the British House of Commons have been taken as the basis on which these Standing Orders were framed.  As these Orders were framed a great many years ago it was found, in the course of experience, that it was desirable to alter them in certain respects.  For instance, when the Irish Tramways Act was passed in 1883, two applications were allowed in the course of the year, in November and May.</P>

      <P>On page 1 you have &ldquo;definitions.&rdquo;  The Report says &ldquo;the term &lsquo;occupier&rsquo; applies only to ratepayers and to other persons not being ratepayers whose interest in the premises occupied is not less than that of a quarterly tenant.&rdquo;  I think that should be made yearly tenant, and for a great many reasons.  In promoting these Bills, in which a great portion of my life has been spent, a great difficulty arises in finding out who are the occupiers of a place.  Very often you cannot find out whether he is a tenant at all or not.  If it was made a yearly tenant it would meet the case.  I do not think that a man in occupation for three months should really have any say as to whether land should be taken or not.  It will make difficulty in complying with the Standing Orders, and also make the number of objections which can be raised as to non-compliance very great.  It will put difficulties in the way of promoters, and I think we should encourage people to promote as many Bills as possible, as otherwise progress will not come.  If you put in quarterly tenants as persons who should get notice, and if it was proved afterwards you did not ascertain there was such a person in existence, and if you did not serve him, the whole of your money would be thrown away.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest that the suggestions made by Senator Barrington and the other suggestions might be referred to the Committee rather than be quickly adopted here? The nature of the draft Standing Orders on private business is of a highly technical character, and you, Sir, probably are the only person in this Seanad who could deal with them from the legal point of view.  They will be coming before the Dáil, and there is very little doubt that some suggestions will come from them by way of amendments. If both sets of suggestions could come before the Joint Committee by way of suggestions rather than amendments, I think it would be a wiser and better way of dealing with the matter. I am not quite sure that a quarterly tenant simply means a person who has been there just three months.  He might have been there for a considerable time.  I hesitate to substitute the word &ldquo;yearly&rdquo; for &ldquo;quarterly,&rdquo; as the term might be too restricted.</P>

It is a Joint Committee, and I do not think that our separate Committee can take action.  It was expressly appointed only to act in conjunction with a Committee of the other House.  That Joint Committee has given in its report, and it is <i>functus officio.</i>  There is great difficulty in seeing how anything could be referred to it again, but if it is referred it must be referred to it as a Joint Committee.

      <P>That would leave Senator Barrington safe, but it would not leave some of us safe.  I understood Senator Barrington to say at first, that he was going to deal with technical matters.  The first matter he raised is not a technical matter.  He is going to debar a person who has been in his holding less than a year.  That is a deliberate attempt to deprive such people from participating in what they are entitled to.  If these questions are to go before the Joint Committee, I suggest that they are going to go before it without my permission.  His first suggestion is going to do a gross <Col N="117" /> injustice to people who have a holding of less than a yearly tenancy.</P>

      <P>I think you may take it from me that your fears are groundless.  I do not think that that recommendation would have the slightest chance of being accepted by the Joint Committee, but even if it had, it will have to come back again to the Seanad.  The Joint Committee cannot legislate.  They can only recommend. I would suggest to you that, apart from taking up any particular application of the motion, the way to solve this is to get the Dáil to agree in reference to all those suggestions made in the Dáil, they should be sent back to the Joint Committee for report, in the same way as we are suggesting here, and they should thrash them out and report back to each House, which will still have control of them.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That, with a view to the establishment of two important industries in Saorstát Eireann, the Seanad suggests to the Government the desirability of offering substantial prizes for&mdash;</P>
      <P>1st.  The most efficient type of internal combustion engine developing 15 B.H.P. while using crude alcohol alone as the motor spirit;</P>
      <P>2nd.  The most suitable and economic crude alcohol for the development of power, so treated that it could not be consumed as a drink.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Both to be manufactured in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And that for the purposes of this competition, temporary exemption from excise duty be granted on such alcohol to bona fide competitors.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should ask you to approach the consideration of this motion from a slightly different standpoint from that which we have adopted in many cases in the past, for several reasons.  In the first place, the Seanad was supposed to be appointed for the special attainments of its members so that certain interests should be represented which would not be likely to obtain representation otherwise.  It seems to me that <Col N="120" /> it is our duty to suggest anything which will make for the improvement of the country, and which might be overlooked if attention were not called to it here.  It might be squeezed out by the process of ordinary legislation.  I may be told that the introduction of such legislation is a matter for the Executive Council, and in this I quite agree, but it is possible, in fulfilling their primary duty of establishing order and law, that such a question as this would escape their attention. I hope to show that the effects which would be wrought in a country like Ireland by the opening up of new fields of enterprise and labour would have a stabilising effect almost impossible to over-estimate.  At present a great number of people are interned who will be returning to civil life. There are also a great number of soldiers who will be disbanded, and we have only to look at the history of countries around us to see what a disturbing effect the return of these men will have if no fresh sources of employment are opened up.  A great number are unemployed at present, and if these other men are thrown on the labour market you will only have an extra number of people to deal with who can find no employment and who are therefore discontented.</P>
    <P>I can hardly fancy any project which, with a smaller expenditure of public funds, would provide for the employment of more people than that which I have tabled.  We are all aware that internal combustion engines can be run on a great many spirits besides petrol, and any money spent on fuel which can be produced in this country and which will prevent money going abroad for petrol is so much money kept at home.  You can hardly go through a village in which you will not find garage after garage, practically kept going by the sale of imported cars, and if you could fancy the amount of employment which would be given by the manufacture of cars here, instead of bringing in cars from abroad, and of alcohol on which to run these cars, you can see the vast amount of work that would be given.</P>
    <P>I remember some years ago being brought into close contact with a man whose name was a household word <Col N="121" /> in connection with science and invention, a man who ran a very good second to Edison, and I will never forget the opinion that he expressed, that the world at large needs power which can be easily and cheaply developed and generally distributed. There are very large aggregations of power in various places, in Niagara, in the Falls of the Zambezi, in the Himalayes, and the Andes, but of what use is the power of Niagara to the plains of Texas?  Of what use is the power derivable from the Zambezi to the veldt of South Africa, thousands of miles away, and of what use is the power derived from the Himalayas to the plains of India, or from the Andes to the pampas of South America?  What you want is to have the power available. This man looked to the development of the internal combustion engine, and he was at that time engaged on the perfection of an engine which was run on gas, the lightest of motive powers. He has left behind an engine which is one of the most perfect combustion engines we have, and he said that if such engines could be supplied all over the world, being light and easily handled, they would completely supersede steam, which entailed the use of heavy machinery and a constant stream of coal which was, owing to its bulk, difficult to convey.</P>
    <P>I think that anyone who is familiar with these things will know that it is not a new idea to suggest that this engine could be run on alcohol.  Some few years ago all the motor papers were full of it.  An agitation at that time was occasioned because some people who were greatly interested in oil had cornered the supply.  They had put up the price of petrol, and everybody said, &ldquo;Let us produce some spirit which will compete with petrol.&rdquo;  I may be asked why it has not been done, and the reason is, I think, very simple.  Manufacturers had no great inducement to do it.  In order to make it a success, you would have to be certain that you could get the supply of alcohol, and every State has its own regulations, its own Customs.</P>
    <P>For many years several of the States of the United States had prohibition in force, and it has now been extended to the whole country, and unless this spirit <Col N="122" /> could be produced in a country like Ireland, which is now in control of its own affairs, and where the supply of alcohol could be assured for Ireland itself, I do not see how it could be done for the world at large.  If it were done here and suitable regulations were made by which people could produce this alcohol and denature it, an enormous field for employment would be opened.  It is well known that it can be produced from almost any vegetable matter which contains sugar.  It can be produced from beet and from rotten potatoes, and the number of people who would obtain employment from the growing of the materials alone would be simply enormous.  For these reasons I beg to propose this resolution, and I am quite sure that if we succeed in getting the thing through, we shall have done a very good day's work for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few remarks on this matter as it strikes me, not in the least out of any spirit of hostility, but rather to face some of the difficulties that may arise in the practical application of the proposal. The proposal falls under two heads.  First, the construction of an efficient type of internal combustion engine; secondly, the manufacture of the power to run that engine.  I quite see that a substantial prize might produce an engine made in the Free State, but I do not see that it will therefore follow that that engine could be produced in quantity in the Free State.  It will be produced in quantity undoubtedly where capital will be thrown in and where there are skilled artisans and the factory organisation which is lacking here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will only be produced where these conditions to facilitate economic production exist.  That will lead, however, to questions of production, and it raises a very big question now.  That is all I have to say regarding the production of the engine.  There is a distinct difference between producing a single engine, a model, which is very expensive, on account of the tooling work involved, and being organised for mass production. Of course, it would be no advantage whatever unless there is quantity production within the country, but I do <Col N="123" /> not speak as an expert.  I imagine you could produce power alcohol purely from a laboratory point of view, sufficient to carry out an experiment, but that will have no regard to the economics of the problem.  I have seen figures, and I am sorry the Senator did not give some, of the cost of producing power alcohol in quantities, for any figures I have seen are entirely prohibitive as compared with the price of benzol or petrol.</P>
    <P>It would not be of much advantage to produce a small quantity of power alcohol on what you might call a laboratory scale, without any regard to the cost of production, if you are not also able to produce that in quantity as an economic problem, and to produce that in large quantity suitable for general industrial purposes would entail a considerable capital and factory organisation which will never be forthcoming until it can be proved that power alcohol can compete in price with petrol and other fuel for internal combustion engines.  I hope the Senator will understand I do not make these criticisms in any hostile spirit, but in order to show that there are practical difficulties which his proposal would not meet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN GRIFFITH</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this motion in the interests of cheap power.  I believe that with the knowledge we have of alcoholic products in this country, we have brains which will be capable of dealing with this particular item probably in a totally different method to what we have been accustomed to.  I should very much like the Government to facilitate an investigation as to the possibilities of this power development by alcohol. The chief difficulty has been that of the Excise.  The matter has been discussed for many years.  It has been the subject of Commissions and Committees, and I think it has always been turned down by the problem of Excise and the control of the sale of the potable spirit, the fear being it would be used as drink.  It is simply with a view to endeavouring to get these matters cleared up from our Irish point of view that I support Senator Barrington in his suggestions.</P>

      <P>Yes, I am. We have been face to face with the great difficulty of costly fuels.  At present petrol is falling in price, but the question as to whether we shall be able to obtain petrol in another 10 or 20 years is a very doubtful one.  I think it is quite time for the Government of this country, and in England, if I were speaking for it, to investigate these natural and almost domestic sources from which alcohol might be formed. It is for this reason that I second and support Senator Barrington's resolution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurJackson" hpid="Mr. JACKSON Mr. JACKSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JACKSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the resolution, and I do so because although I agree with Senator Sir John Keane that it would be better if it were possible to have given us further particulars as to the probable cost of extraction from any of the matters referred to by Senator Barrington, it seems to me one thing is essential, and that is to encourage industries in every possible way, and especially new industries. There is no doubt that if the amount of manufactured goods that come into Ireland in connection with such matters as motor cars, petrol, and articles of that description could be made at home, it would open up quite a new era of prosperity.  Many attempts have been made in the last few years to interest the Government in the question of power in connection with water power resources, but if it would be possible to get crude oil that could be manufactured cheaply it would open up a very much greater question than we imagine.  I accordingly support the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the motion.  The question involved is this, Ireland has a small quantity of coal and a large quantity of turf, but neither is sufficient for the purpose of our manufactures, or the manufactures which we would wish to have large enough to balance with the agricultural population, and we have to search for some other means to make up for what the English have.  The English have coal in abundance, and it is not so necessary for them to use alcohol, because <Col N="125" /> they import a great deal of oil. They and the Americans have practically a monopoly of the oil of the world, and they can rig the market as they like, and stop it going, except for themselves, in any way they wish.  Practically all the oil of the world is controlled by great trusts, and we may be one of these days left out.  It is our business to see how we can make up in our own industries something to take the place of what other countries have.</P>
      <P>We must increase our water power, and our turf supply, and if it can be done, our coal supply, but none of these goes far enough, and for that reason it is extremely important that Ireland should fill up the gap by industrial alcohol, which could be produced here in very large quantities.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that hitherto it has not obtained great support in England, because England does not require it.  There are difficulties which have been already pointed out.  It is only a question of making it undrinkable.  One or two people have asked for figures.  A Committee was appointed by the Second Dáil to investigate the various resources of Ireland.  Some of the members of the Seanad were members of that Committee.  We drew up a series of reports on various subjects&mdash;water power, coal, cattle, etc.  Among them was a report on industrial alcohol.  A copy of that report can be obtained by applying to the Clerk, and I think Senators will find in it a great deal of information.  I think there is no doubt that this would not only increase the manufacturing power of Ireland but increase the agricultural power, because potatoes are the principal source from which it can be supplied.  Ireland is a potato-producing country, and potatoes can be much more largely grown here than elsewhere.  For that reason I desire to support the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to support the motion from the point of view that I have for long thought industrial alcohol could be produced in this country.  It was largely produced in Germany and largely used.  In America it was very little used for some time, but during the last 8 or 10 years Excise protection has been given and it has <Col N="126" /> been more used there.  As Senator Colonel Moore has pointed out, we have very few sources of power here.  We have a sympathetic Government now and they can give Excise facilities which are really the block against this. If this suggestion were adopted and the matter investigated, I feel an industry would be opened up for the country which would be of great advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir NUGENT EVERARD</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to support the resolution, because I think it would add another important rural industry which we want badly to help tillage in this country.  This is not a new idea.  Alcohol is largely used on the Continent for power, and I take it that the substantial prizes will only be necessary in order to improve the type of engine and also, if possible, to cheapen the machinery.  I think it is generally admitted that the more suitable and economic crude alcohol for the development of power is to be obtained from potatoes.  It can also be obtained from farmyard manure and from peat. In fact, there are many sources from which alcohol can be obtained, but the Excise rules stand in the way.  If this was considered in certain quarters, I do not think those rules would be considered unalterable.  I do not believe the Government, if they wish to encourage industries of the kind, would hesitate to allow such a modification of the rules as will enable this great industry to be established.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I just reply to one or two questions.  I did not think when I set out to propose this that there was any need to go into the really elementary question of the use of alcohol.  It is a thing which has been tried all over the world and been proved to be absolutely a success.  I would like to remove Senator Sir John Keane's fears that there is any difficulty about the construction of engines. There is no difficulty about the construction of them.  You can use alcohol in a petrol engine, but you naturally will not get as good results from alcohol burned in a petrol engine as you will from petrol.  I know that during the war the Americans were running the light railways in Cuba, and those light railways were run on internal <Col N="127" /> combustion engines.  Falling short in the supply of petrol, they turned to use alcohol, and the difficulty they found was in denaturing it so that it could not be drunk by the people.  They got over that successfully by introducing all sorts of unpleasant drugs which did not interfere with the gas-giving qualities of the alcohol.  They found that using it in the ordinary engines that were supplied for petrol they were able to get from 65 to 80 per cent. of the power with alcohol that they got from petrol.  The only difficulty in getting the same power from alcohol as from petrol is in altering the design of the engine.  You have to alter the proportions of the engine slightly.  The flash-point in one case differs from the flash-point in the other.  In one case you want a larger cylinder with a smaller stroke.  In the other case you get the same power exactly by a smaller diameter engine with a larger stroke. If you have a 100 h.p. engine you have only to alter the proportions of the engine to get the 100 h.p. from alcohol. It is such an elementary question that really I did not think it was necessary to dwell upon it.  I know that Senator Guinness had a lot of statistics about the cost and how it was to be prepared, but unfortunately he has gone away. However, I am going to throw a certain amount of light on the cost.  Raw crude alcohol in pre-war times could be purchased at something about 4d. per gallon.  Supposing it could be purchased now at three times that sum, and if you put it down at 1/- per gallon, it would still compare very favourably with petrol.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the Excise regulations.  I am not suggesting for a moment that these engines run on crude alcohol could be used all over the world.  They cannot, owing to the Excise difficulties, but in a country like this, where the Government control the Excise, and can make their own regulations, there is no reason why they should not allow crude alcohol to be prepared under certain regulations within the Free State, so that alcohol could be obtainable.  That is <Col N="128" /> the reason alcohol was not used in the past, and if that difficulty is removed you will have plenty of alcohol, and plenty of engines running with alcohol. There was only one other question raised, and that was in reference to the cost of the engine.  Senator Sir John Keane said that an engine produced with a certain amount of tool work would cost more.  That is so.  It is not so much a question of tools as the production of models.  Of course, the first engine has to bear the entire cost of the models.  It is for that reason that I suggest a substantial premium would be necessary.  In the first case, you must give people some security that they will be able to get the fuel, and also give some security that if they get the fuel they will get a certain amount of protection until they get back the first costs.  That is the reason prizes should be given, and I think it would be a sound policy for the Government to give them.</P>

      <P>I hope that when the Seanad takes this motion it will spend a couple of hours on it, or otherwise postpone it, or fix it for a date on which it will be taken.  It is a most important matter to consider, and it should be done seriously.  I think it <Col N="129" /> would give a bad impression outside to discuss it for a short time and then adjourn.</P>

      <P>I presume the Seanad will leave the fixing of the next meeting in my hands.  I do not think we will have any other business for next Wednesday.  We are waiting, and the Dáil is waiting, on the Judiciary Bill, and whether it will be out of the Dáil in time to reach us by Wednesday next, I am not in a position to say.  I generally find that my prophesies turn out inaccurate, but if there is any business besides Senator Sir John Keane's motion for next Wednesday, I shall direct the Seanad to be summoned for that date.  Otherwise I shall wait.</P>
