      <P>I beg to move the amendment which stands in my name, which is:&mdash;&ldquo;In Section 29 (1) to delete all after the word &lsquo;congests&rsquo; in line 36 to the end of Sub-section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These words give the Land Commission power to interfere with the farmer in the management of his holding.  As they would be applied by many, they would be applied towards more tillage. That would be undoubtedly a popular interpretation placed upon increasing the food supply, and also bearing upon the manner in which the holding has been used.  On general grounds I am opposed to these words.  It is an unwarranted interference with the liberty of the subject, in not allowing him to use his own property in the way he thinks best.  There is a third point.  There is no one capable of deciding how agricultural land can be used to the best advantage. I have been sitting for many months on the Agricultural Commission, the terms of reference of which have been to report on this question of tillage, and the possibility and desirability of increasing tillage which undoubtedly would be the effect or would be attempted if these provisions were allowed to be enacted.  Now we had overwhelming evidence that in the case of almost every crop&mdash;I cannot think of any exception&mdash;the cost of production is far greater than the market price. Well, carry that to its logical consequences. If the Land Commission or the Board of Agriculture or their technical advisers, will advise the Land Commission that there is not sufficient tillage, or in their wisdom, which is largely academic, that the farming practised was not correct, they would <Col N="1952" /> have power to resume their retained farm and give it to people who, they consider, might use it to better advantage.</P>
    <P>I hope in this matter I will receive the support of at least the farmer Senators, because it is a prominent plank in the programme of the Farmers' Party, that a man should be allowed to farm his land as he likes.  There is a popular idea that this grass land is used improperly because it is used for grazing purposes.  There is an overwhelming body of expert evidence which says that from every point of view that is the right way of farming land.  In face of that I do claim that it is unwarranted for a bureaucracy&mdash;because that is what they are, and I do not mean the word in any malign sense&mdash;it is I say unwarranted for a bureaucracy to have the power to come in and say to a man &ldquo;You are not farming your land in the right way.&rdquo; I see that these powers are welcomed, as I expected they would, in certain quarters.  But look at it this way&mdash;these so-called experts in the Department of Agriculture are out of touch, most of them, with practical farming for many years.  I would ask the Minister to give us evidence that any one of his officials, his expert advisers in the Board of Agriculture, who will be people from the County Instructor upwards, has done any practical work on a farm since entering the Government service.  Without practical knowledge of this work, you are not competent to tell a man how to do his business.  Therefore I say that this Clause is an unwarrantable interference with the liberty of the subject.  It might be used, and in all probability will be used, to introduce by a side wind this dangerous innovation, the doctrine of compulsory tillage, and for that reason it should be opposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="The MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan) Patrick J. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>The MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to discuss the question as to whether officials of the Department of Agriculture are practical farmers or not, except to say that Sir John Keane's speech reminds me of the small farmer in the country who insists on cutting hay with the scythe on the grounds that he is against machinery, and &ldquo;what do the experts know about it anyway?&rdquo; The question does not arise in this Section.  I was <Col N="1953" /> wondering why Sir John Keane wanted to adjourn this Bill over the Election. If he wants to adjourn this Bill over the Election in order to raise an issue of compulsory tillage, an issue I do not want to raise, and an issue which no sensible man in the country wants to raise, then I say there is applicable the Latin maxim: &ldquo;<i>quem di vult perdere dementant</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;those whom the gods wish to destroy they first drive mad.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is no warranty here for stating that the Land Commission can compel a man to increase his tillage.  He did not say that; he suggested it; that the Bill would compel a man to till a certain area of his land, and that this is really a law brought in by a side wind, that a certain percentage of the land was to be tilled.  We know that is a dangerous question; we know that it is a difficult question, and every practical farmer knows that there is a lot of nonsense talked about compulsory tillage. I am the last man to raise that question on which every academician in the country wants to spread himself. It was not raised here.  The words in the Bill are: &ldquo;And in exercising the powers aforesaid shall have regard to the necessity and desirability of increasing the food supply in the country.&rdquo; This refers to a retained holding because it is over £3,000 in value, and that is a direction to the Land Commission.  I want the Senators to realize this, that when the Land Commission are considering whether they shall sell a man £3,000 worth of land, the limitation in the Bill, or £4,000 worth, which they have a discretion to sell, or £5,000 or £6,000 worth, they shall take into account whether he is the sort of farmer who owned anything between 400 acres and 1,000 acres of land, and used to, under the 11 month system, set 500 acres for grazing.  That is a direction that the Land Commission shall take into account.  Is it suggested that the Land Commission shall not take that into account when exercising their discretion? That is what I would like to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that is the meaning of these words in the Bill, and they bear no other meaning.  I want to say that I stand here for the right of the Land Commission to do that absolutely, and that we are to know where we stand in <Col N="1954" /> that matter.  I further say that I think that is the safest and most conservative and most just method of doing something, to deal with that particular question that I put to you just now, a question that is really at the bottom of the land war.  I want to say just one other thing.  I promised An Cathaoirleach that I would not make many long speeches to-day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for pleasure I am doing it.  It is a long and complicated Bill, and there is an attempt to interpret the clauses.  This land question which we are trying to solve in this Bill became acute in 1918.  The Land Conference of 1918 was set up to deal with it.  It was discussed at great length, and they appointed a special Committee consisting of Dr. Stewart the Bishop of Ross, Lord Cloncurry and Walter E. Callan and one or two others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>They appointed that Committee to make recommendations. They made recommendations, and, as a result of these recommendations, the Land Bill of 1920 was prepared.  The Land Bill of 1920 is in all respects the same as the final draft of this Bill, with the exception of some changes in details. That Bill was introduced.  It was circulated to the Land Owners' Convention, and to every important body in the country, and to the Farmers' Union. I have the Chief Secretary's file in the matter.  I have all the reports.  It was debated through the country all through 1920.  The report of the Committee on whose recommendations the Bill was prepared was published long before 1920.  The Bill itself was published in June 1920, and it was before the country from June 1920, until the end of 1921.  It was expressly circulated to the Land Owners' Convention, and to all important bodies in the country.  This Section, Section 29, the resumption Section, dealing with tenancies, was used word for word&mdash;though I should not say word for word, for in some cases the provisions have been shortened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were in two Sections of the Bill of 1920, and we have put them into one. That is Section 29.  There was a difference <Col N="1955" /> made between congested areas and non-congested areas in the Bill and there were different sections.  But in fact and detail these sections are the same and they mean the same thing. These were before the country from 1920 until the end 1921, and they were accepted expressly by the Land Owners' Convention.  I read their acceptance.</P>

      <P>This was in 1920 and 1921.  The Farmers' Union was in existence then.  Sir John Keane was a member of both.  Was there ever a protest against these provisions?  They were before the country, and I presume the Farmers' Union had an interest in the country.  Was there ever a protest against any section in that Bill?  Not one.  They were accepted in fact, and every man here knows it.  And now in 1923, when the settlement of the land question is five times as difficult, when every wrecker in the country is doing his level best in every direction, I am faced with histrionics on every question arising in the Bill.  I will not say any more.  I will leave it to the horse sense of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EarlofMayo" hpid="The EARL of MAYO The EARL of MAYO">
      <NameTxt>The EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit every word the Minister in charge of the Bill has said; but I wish to make him aware of something, and I wish to make the Seanad aware of something.  After the war there was brought in a Bill which affected England, Wales and Scotland. It was with regard to the breaking up of land, which was done in those three countries in the most extraordinary and arbitrary manner, and it was brought up in our House and we got Ireland included in the Bill.  I wish to confine myself to the words &ldquo;the desirability of increasing the food supply of the country.&rdquo; I know English landlords very well indeed, and I may say a great many of them are some of my oldest friends. <Col N="1956" /> The arbitrary powers of that Bill and the way in which they were carried out would astonish you, particularly in regard to the extraordinary way in which officers who knew nothing whatsoever about tillage, grass lands or gardens, were appointed.  Those officers would say &ldquo;this has got to be ploughed up; if you do not do it we shall do it for you and charge you with the expense.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Lord Cloncurry saw that it would be useful to apply this Bill to Ireland.  We got it applied to this country and it was passed.  The Board of Agriculture sent over their representatives and they told us the country would be ruined and all that sort of thing, but we were accustomed to that type of argument.  The House of Lords saw the sense of it and passed the Bill.  I only mention that to make the Minister wise as to what occurred after the war.  The feeling amongst landlords in England was so strong that one after another got up and gave instances of the extraordinary and arbitrary way in which even gardens were treated, gardens that were actually planted with fruit trees.  The officers would say, &ldquo;This is no good; we want more wheat and oats and barley and you will have to plough the land up.&rdquo; When those arguments were adduced, the House, which consisted of very large landowners, listened to them but they passed the measure all the same.  I think it was wise of Lord Cloncurry to get it passed for Ireland. I know that wheat is the staff of life. We produce not only corn in certain parts of this country but the finest wheat in the world, except, perhaps, the very finest Scotch wheat.  I have only stated that in order to make the Seanad and the Minister wise on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMacLysaght" hpid="Mr. MacLYSAGHT Mr. MacLYSAGHT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLYSAGHT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is much use in talking about wheat or the compulsory regulations which occurred during war conditions. It is important to remember that the larger the number of holdings you have in the country the greater amount of tillage and probably the greater amount of food production there will be.  The real reason I rise is to say that I am glad we are now clear on this subject.  The Minister has made it clear that he stands for the right of the Land Commission to deal arbitrarily, if you like, with a certain type of land.  That is the <Col N="1957" /> land which is used&mdash;or in my opinion is not used&mdash;for the purpose of setting on the eleven months' system.  I support this Bill absolutely so far as it deals with that principle.  I do not see how Sir John Keane's amendment is framed in such a way as would enable him to keep that principle and at the same time to safeguard the homes about which he is interested.  If he can make out an amendment which safeguards the home of a person I will support him, if it does not cut into this most essential principle of the Bill which the Seanad now understands.</P>

      <P>I might, perhaps, break new ground by getting back to the gist of the subject which is really the powers conferred on the Government and not so much the question of whether Ireland is an agricultural country, which I do not believe.  The reason I think that Ireland is more fertile than any other country is because the highest food value comes directly from the vegetable. The powers conferred upon the Government are really what are behind Senator Sir John Keane's motion.  It is not always a capable and persuasive Mr. Hogan we will have to deal with.  We are handing powers of invasion of the home to a future Government which we cannot forecast and which may be a bureaucracy.  It may be a Government chiefly influenced by what is behind the <Col N="1958" /> congests; that is the man who has not got any land.  I say the man who is behind the congest is the man who has not any land.  He will be far more the <i>vis a tergo</i> particularly as the Dáil has made land fluid and it is taking away for the first time the fixity of tenure in Irish land.</P>
      <P>It is really an influence which is very detrimental to government.  It is almost contradictory to government because without analysing deeply the basis of government it is very easy to say that on some fixity the power of government depends and anything that will alter a man's assurance that he will live in his house and hand it on will at the same time alter the power and solidarity of any Government.  It is as I say, not in defiance of Mr. Hogan's excellent intentions but from a feeling that excellent as they are in these two small matters, particularly the last clause, with regard to how the holding is worked, I think that that clause would be construed by an unfriendly Government or a Government of landless men which would be a Government of Bolshevists or retro-Congests as a punitive clause. Therefore not on account of the character of the land or on account of the excellent philanthropy of the Bill but on account of too much power being construed in a future which we cannot forecast, I support the amendment of Sir John Keane.</P>

      <P>My amendment was: Section 29, sub-section (1), to insert after this Sub-section a new Sub-section (2) as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;(2) When any land is resumed by the Land Commission there shall be paid to the former owner or tenant full compensation based upon the market value of the land at the time of such resumption.&rdquo; I had an opportunity of reading the provisions of the Acts especially regarding Section (5) of the Act of 1881, which provides for the compensation to the tenant of the portion of his holding that would be resumed. I also heard the Minister's statement last evening that the compensation would be the amount of the tenancy when sold in the open market at a fair rent.  I am satisfied that that meets my point and I wish to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator Linehan omitted to tell us one thing and that is where the land is to come from and how the land would be any good to the tenants if it were to be bought at market value. It was consideration as to where the land was to come from that made us draw the line we have drawn.  He voted yesterday for land being bought at market value which Mr. Counihan described as being worth £100 an acre. That is the kind of thing you are up against when you are trying to settle the land problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to what the Minister has stated with reference to the point as to where the land was to come from.  The Land Commission are taking all untenanted and unpurchased land in Ireland and I regard the claims of the evicted tenants as quite as important as the claims of any congests.  I would point out that it was through the sufferings of these men in former years that it was possible to have a Land Act at all and without them there would probably be no Congested Districts Board.  I am sorry that the Minister has ignored the claims of this important body.  I think they are as much entitled to a fair portion of this land as any other body.  This amendment would bring in any tenants evicted since 1903.</P>

      <P>The Senator thinks that all the evicted tenants from the days of Brian Boru or at least since the year 1878 should be dealt with, but that untenanted land should be bought at £100 an acre.  There is nothing like having it both ways.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment of a somewhat similar kind.  I was endeavouring to put the date back to 1870 instead of 1903, and I suppose I shall be told that I also want to go back to the days of Brian Boru, though I suppose as a Clareman I have some right to do so. The Minister cannot however tell me that I said that the land is worth £100 an acre but I suppose he will not accept <Col N="1961" /> this amendment as he would not accept the other.  The date 1878 is purely arbitrary whereas the date 1870 was a definite era in the land war and marked an avalanche of land evictions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move to delete lines 61 and 62 in sub-section 1. We recognise amongst these various people to whom parcels of land may be given certain old familiar faces&mdash;the evicted tenant and the proprietor of a holding which is not economic.  We further see some new faces&mdash;the labourer who by the re-sale of land was deprived of his employment.  We could form our own opinion on them but there are moreover masked men whom we cannot see.  I do not think it is fair to give the Government power to put anybody they like on the land.</P>
      <P>It is undesirable to take men without experience of land and put them on it.  We have to keep in mind the best use of our natural resources.  It has been proved right down the ages and in England recently that putting men without any knowledge of the land upon it is to court disaster.  They have to be financed out of the pockets of the taxpayers and you run the risk of landing them into bankruptcy.  It is of course quite possible that use could be made of that not by the Minister but by a Government of a later day who had not the acute perception on agricultural matters which the present Government may possess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no new faces, as Sir John Keane has stated.  We are going back to the Act of 1909.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  In the case of the sale of an estate to the Land Commission <i>(a)</i> advances under the Land Purchase Acts may be made for the purchase of parcels thereof by the following persons <i>(a)</i> a person being the tenant or proprietor of a holding not exceeding £10 in rateable value; <i>(b)</i> a person who has surrendered his holding for the purpose of relieving congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A person who has been twenty-five years before the passing of the Act of 1903 the tenant of a holding to which the Land Law Act applies, and who is not at the date of the purchase a tenant or proprietor of that holding; <i>(c)</i> or in case such a person is dead <Col N="1962" /> the person nominated by the Land Commission as his personal representative; and <i>(d)</i> any person to whom in the opinion of the Land Commission after adequate provision has been made to satisfy the requirements of the persons mentioned in the preceding paragraphs of this sub-section an advance ought to be made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the Land Act of 1909.  We know the provisions for acquiring land that are in the Bill.  This deals with cases where you have land offered, Suppose you offer to buy a parcel of five hundred acres.  The owner has seven hundred in the parcel and says &ldquo;take the whole of it.&rdquo; The Land Commission, that has always had that power, is not to have it in future.  There is one change only and that is the word &ldquo;body.&rdquo; They might make an advance to trustees for the purpose of dairying near a town.  I explained the special significance of the word &ldquo;body&rdquo; There might be a little thinking amongst agriculturists instead of hot air, and we might be able to arrive at some organisation that would make the little land that is over go further.  That Section in my opinion is vital to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>

      <P>In this case in deciding how much shall be re-sold the value of any other land in possession of the owner is taken into account.  So in fact that gives the Land Commission power to get possession of all land over £3,000 value in the possession of any owner.  It is for the House to say whether they approve of such an arbitrary and far-reaching measure of this kind. The Land Commission may re-sell over the £3,000.  I can quite understand that in certain quarters this act is welcome. I should enjoy it myself if I were in that position.  I want the Seanad to understand that with reference to this Section they are giving the Land Commission power to keep land for all time, to deprive the owner of his legal title of all land over £3,000.  The method of fixing the price is not set out. I do not think the methods for fixing the price in Section 25 cover this.  The principle however remains the same and as long as the Seanad clearly understand what they are doing I have discharged my responsibility.  I do strongly disapprove of giving any Government for all time powers of that kind and therefore I move this amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not rise for the purpose of discussing this matter, but to support it.  I suppose the reply will be to refer us to the Act of 1920.  Here is a concrete case.  A man may have his house and his whole farm on which he has laid out a considerable amount of money and according to the definition of unpurchased land in this Act the farm may be held for a term of years or may be fee simple.  That man may have other farms.  He may have farms purchased under the 1903 or other Acts. When he has those lands, that farm according to the terms of this Section, automatically vests in the Land Commission and it is up to the Land Commission to see now or at any future time whether they will allow him to retain his home or not.  In the worst days of landlordism such a thing would not <Col N="1965" /> occur if he paid his rent.  I believe that the Minister never contemplated such a thing.  If he does not want it to occur then why will he invest the Land Commission with such powers?</P>
      <P>I will not debate that any further.  I think the Minister ought to give ear to what is said here and to remember that this Seanad was approved of unanimously by the country.  We are experienced men who go through the country and know the views of the industrial, commercial, and other classes of the people.  I ask the Minister to be guided in some manner by practically the unanimous advice given on this matter by the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. COUNIHAN Mr. COUNIHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COUNIHAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be no misconception. The section does not refer to tenanted land, but to untenanted land.  I will deal first with the tenures to which the Senator referred.  This is the first Act that deals with fee farm rents, long leases and leases renewable for ever.  When the Bolshevik Conservative English Government were dealing with the matter they regarded long leases and leases for lives renewable for ever as they regarded untenanted land which they could take for the relief of congestion, but in this Bill, for the first time, we give an opportunity to people who own leases for ever to redeem their rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pressed in the Dáil by the Farmers' Party, who seemed to be able <Col N="1966" /> to change their alliances with extraordinary rapidity&mdash;I was pressed to regard them as tenants.  In the case where a man owns his land on a lease for 999 years at a small rent, I was pressed to regard him as a tenant and to buy him out at a reduction of thirty-five per cent.&mdash;the amendment moved by the Farmers' Party was a reduction of fifty per cent., but I was pressed to do it at thirty-five per cent., capitalised at four-and-half per cent., and to pay ten per cent. of his purchase money.</P>
    <P>I think that would be most unfair to the unfortunate holder of the head rent. The farm held on fee farm and long lease especially, used to be regarded by the Conservative Government of England as land that they used to take for the relief of congestion.  I am decried for being more liberal because Sections 37 and 38 make provision for the redemption of the fee farm rents and the redemption of rents held on a long lease or on a lease of lives renewable for ever, so that, if we were to regard Senator Counihan as an ordinary tenant, we would give him a chance of redeeming his rent at bonds at four-and-a-half percent., which would bring in his present income.</P>

      <P>The idea is that the Judicial Commissioner shall have power to redeem the rents and regard such a man as tenant.  The Judicial Commissioner takes into account his security, and if the security is good the owner would be entitled to as much bonds as would bring in his original rent.  Senator Counihan will have the opportunity of paying his rent in one lump sum&mdash; the Senator is delighted to hear that, &mdash;but if there are thirty congests in his area and not a perch of other land to deal with them we will unfortunately have to take some land from him; but he will be given the opportunity to redeem his head rents on the favourable terms I have mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me finish.  Let me deal now with untenanted land held in fee simple outside the special tenures <Col N="1967" /> referred to by the Senator.  This Section, in fact, does not deal with demesne or with the things excluded under Sub-Section (2) or Section 24, because demesnes are only bought as a last resort. They do not vest automatically, neither does purchased land, and I put in a safeguard that they shall not be bought if there is any untenanted land available. The land we are dealing with never vests automatically except in the Congested Districts counties, and this is a similar provision to that of the 1920 Bill.  Outside the Congested Districts counties&mdash;and Senator Counihan lives outside them; if he was living inside them he would know more about the problem I am trying to solve&mdash;we only require ordinary untenanted land, not being the exception mentioned, for the relief of congestion.</P>
      <P>There is no automatic vesting, or anything like that.  There might be a case in Cavan or Monaghan, which are outside the Congested Districts counties, where we would have to treat a parcel of untenanted land on which a man lives and which is held in fee simple, but which he works as an ordinary farmer, in exactly the same way as if it was demesne land, and you know what we are doing about demesnes.  Now, there is no real distinction in fact why a man who owns four hundred acres of land in fee simple and works it as an ordinary farmer should be treated differently from a man who owns a demesne which is worked as an ordinary farm; as most small demesnes are so worked.  And the trouble was this; we could automatically exclude residential holdings which are not demesnes, but have every characteristic of demesnes, held in fee simple and all the rest.  We could exclude them outside the congested counties, but for the fact that there is Cavan and Monaghan, and some congests.  We might have to treat a residential holding held in fee simple in these counties and worked as an ordinary farm as we treat a demesne.  So, what did we do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We endeavoured to put the farmer&mdash; a farmer who is particularly well off, a farmer who owns his farm in fee simple&mdash;into the same position as the farmer who owned his land under a judicial tenancy.  We say we will sell <Col N="1968" /> him his three thousand pounds' worth unless needed for the relief of congestion. These provisions are already in previous Bills which were agreed to. We had to meet this case.  I will put a specific case and leave it to the Seanad to say whether we are taking extraordinary powers under this Section. Take the case of a man outside the congested districts counties who owned a demesne, or residential holding, in fee simple, of five hundred acres in Monaghan or Cavan.  There are three or four congests in the counties of Cavan or Monaghan and there are other spots in Ireland where congestion exists. Supposing five or six congests adjoined this residential fee simple holding and there was no other land available to deal with, thirty acres might put the congests right.  We had to take power, if we were serious at all about dealing with congestion, to purchase that thirty or forty acres as exactly what it is&mdash;untenanted land&mdash;and to deal with the congests there.</P>
    <P>The alternative there would be not to deal with the congests but to leave them there for ever on two or three pounds valuation of cut-away bog, or else to migrate them.  We will do our very best to migrate all the small holders we can migrate, but there are cases of that sort where the hardship would be small to a man to give up a certain amount of land for the relief of congestion. Considering that the difficulty of migrating the congests would be so great&mdash;we would have to take down the Dublin Guards to carry out the evictions on a big scale&mdash;we did give ourselves these powers.  That aspect of the question was discussed, and discussed again and again, and they all agreed that we had to have these powers.  Now that is the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Counihan in the course of his speech expressed anxiety as to the operation of this Section.  He seemed to think that a man owning a certain amount of land should be excluded from sale altogether.  If some priority were given under the Section securing the home farm the Senator's concern about the Section would not be so great.  I take it that is a very natural anxiety for a man who has bought his holding and who has expended a great deal of time and labour <Col N="1969" /> in building up his home.  Might I suggest to the Minister that there might be something inserted in the Section which would not make it mandatory for a sale to be carried out in such a case. I would suggest an amendment on the following lines:&mdash;To insert in line 45, &ldquo;In addition to his residential or home farm and such home farm not exceeding £3,000 in value.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I suggest that the amendment, if agreed to, would give priority to the owner in the case of a re-sale.  It would not necessarily compel the Land Commission to retain the man's home farm to him, but in the exercise of their option they might give consideration to the fact that in addition to this home farm they might sell to him the other portion of his holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This sort of a farm is in the same position as a demesne, except that this is simply a legal distinction. This Section is to meet the case of a man who holds four or five hundred acres of land in fee simple around his house which is not demesne land.  I discussed before the question of demesne land, and pointed out why we must take powers, as far as demesne land is concerned, to deal with the relief of congestion. We have power to take demesne land, and sometimes the very same reasons apply to the man who owns four or five hundred acres of untenanted land in fee-simple, except that legally the land is not demesne, but it has every other characteristic of demesne land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is really the position.  The same arguments apply here as apply in the case of demesne land.  We could not draw the line by valuation or by value. Congestion is such a desperate problem to deal with that you can only deal with it by swopping around, and you must give the Land Commission powers and very wide powers if you mean to deal with it.  It was because we had to give the Land Commission these wide discretionary powers that I put the provision in the Section that, before the Land Commission made any division of the land, a High Court Judge should have the last word to say in all these cases.  The Judge is to be the arbitrator between the Commissioners and the Vendor. The Section provides that there shall always be power for an appeal to the Judicial Commissioner, whose decision <Col N="1970" /> shall be final.  Some Senators seem to be under the impression that the Judicial Commissioner is bound up with the Land Commission.  That is not so. What we did was, and this is a mere drafting point, to provide that the Land Commission shall consist of the Judicial Commissioner and the Land Commissioners.</P>

      <P>It has to do with it to this extent, that I made the point that we must give fairly wide discretionary powers to the Land Commission, and cannot draw the line at the £3,000 limit, or anything like that.  I assured the Seanad that the Judicial Commissioner in this matter is an arbitrator pure and simple.  He is a Judge of the King's Bench, and he must approach all these questions in a judicial fashion, and he must be bound strictly by the spirit of the Act.  We could not deal with congestion in any other way than by giving to the Land Commission these wide powers and making certain that the Land Commission will do their work impartially and that the Judicial Commissioner shall be an independent High Court Judge who will act as arbitrator between the Land Commission and the parties concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COUNIHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say a few words by way of personal explanation. I am afraid that the Minister for Agriculture and some Senators who replied to my remarks may think I am acting here in an entirely personal and selfish manner.  That is not so.  I want to point out that I am typical of a number of farmers in the country, and even if I put forward as an illustration my own case, it represents the case of a very large number of farmers in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us that practically this section would only apply to land in the congested districts counties, but that there were a few cases outside of these districts that would have to be dealt with, and that that made it necessary to apply this section to the whole of the land in the Free State.  I wonder did the Minister, and those who advised him, take into account the point that I dealt with before in this matter.  The giving of these powers to the Land Commission will <Col N="1971" /> undoubtedly adversely affect the land which every individual holds in that way throughout the whole of the Free State. We are told that it will not affect more than a few of these landholders, but that is probably I take it the individual owner.  It will affect bankers throughout the country who lend money to individual owners relying on the value of the property which they hold.</P>
      <P>The situation under this Section will create an entirely new state of affairs for the banks when they are asked to advance money to anyone holding lands. They can be told in the future that the Land Commission may come in and say that they want the land.  Therefore they are putting the banks in Ireland into the very same position that they are putting the owners or the occupiers of the land.  The owners of the land come to the bank and say that they have got something to sell, or an individual may come to the bank and say that he wants to buy land.  No matter whether the land is required or not, every single application from an owner of land for a loan from the bank will have to be viewed in the light that the Land Commission, under this Section, will have power to take over that man's land. Anyone who advances money or anything else will have to take that principle as bedrock.  That point, I think, will be quite clear to everyone, and I think it may be taken for granted that the same principle will apply to every other bit of land in all the other counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot say, in a hurry, what the ultimate effect of that will be, but I think it is easy to see that it will have a very far-reaching effect upon the borrowing powers of the owners and occupiers of land in the Free State.  The Minister, I believe, is trying to meet certain cases but I think it would be desirable if some other way could be found and not to apply this principle in such an extremely broad manner.  I admit that the Minister's object is a great one: to relieve congestion but, on the other hand, it is quite clear that no matter what he does, if he applies this principle to every bit of land in the Free State, he is not going to be the friend of those who traded on the valuation system as far as obtaining loans on the value of land is concerned.  What we <Col N="1972" /> have to look to in the future is what price land is likely to fetch.  The Land Commission is to be given power to say that they want the land, and that they propose to take it.  I think such a provision as this will have an adverse effect on the value of land in the Free State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GUINNESS</NameTxt>
      <P>As a practical banker I wish to confirm what Senator Jameson has said.  The whole Bill throws suspicion on the security of the land of Ireland.  Probably the greater portion of the land of Ireland is mortgaged in some form or other, and there is no doubt that when insecurity of any description comes in it means that the value of the article pledged falls.  It may be said, and probably the Minister will say it, that it was impossible to have matters otherwise but it is well, I think, that the Seanad should realize what this whole Bill must mean so far as security is concerned.  It means that something the owner can pledge has, through the action of this Bill, undoubtedly, fallen in value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point I must deal with, but before doing so I would like to give these figures.  The area of the land of Ireland is 20,000,000 acres. The area of the land excluding towns, water, waste, etc., would be a maximum of 18,000,000 acres&mdash;17,000,000 acres would be nearer, and that is for the whole of Ireland.  The area of the purchased land of Ireland is 13,000,000 acres so we are dealing in this Bill with 4,000,000 acres.  We are dealing with 4,000,000, and we are taking power over 13,000,000, and that is a serious point. Let me deal with the 4,000,000, because that is the point Senator Jameson dealt with.  Now, with regard to the untenanted land in the congested districts, as Senator Jameson pointed out, the Congested Districts Board could have taken land compulsorily ever since 1909, and exactly the same consideration from a banking point of view applied to untenanted land in the congested districts counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very same considerations apply as a result of the operations of the 1909 Act, as far as the untenanted land is concerned.  There were nine hundred thousand acres of untenanted land; there are about four hundred thousand acres of demesne, and there would be something over two million acres of tenanted <Col N="1973" /> land in Ireland.  These figures are important.  Remember I am dealing now with the difference between the thirteen millions of purchased land and the land we may acquire under this Bill.  Of that four millions nine hundred thousand acres is arable untenanted land and four hundred thousand demesne, and about two million acres of tenanted land unpurchased.  With regard to the nine hundred thousand acres of arable, untenanted, land, the very same considerations apply from a banking point of view since 1909 in the congested district counties and in reality outside the congested district counties, because, as everyone knew, untenanted land of that particular class was not being bought at its market value and was not saleable at its market value.</P>
    <P>How many landlords in Ireland, even outside the congested district counties, for the last five or six or twenty years, could have divided their land into small holdings, put them up for auction in the open market and sold them untenanted. As far as the untenanted land is concerned, the parallel within the congested districts counties is absolutely accurate and outside the congested districts counties, for all practical purposes, it is the same.  No untenanted land of that class was saleable at its market value; at least half of it, as a fact, was not saleable at its market value, and a part of that land was not saleable at anything like its market value.  Surely as a banking matter the whole of it was tainted, from Senator Jameson's point of view.  We are not interfering with the value of that land as a security, as far as that nine hundred thousand acres are concerned, anything more than it was interfered with as a result of the operations of the previous Acts.  Take demesne land, of which there are four hundred thousand acres.  It was never saleable. It was never very valuable as a security, in view of the fact that it was not saleable.</P>

      <P>As a security I say the land is tainted by the introduction of this Bill.  I quite admit that it is probably inevitable, but it is a fact that this Bill, as it stands, which involves the transfer of land here, there, and everywhere all over Ireland does taint the land as a banking security.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not take me as admitting that at the moment.  What I want to explain to Senator Jameson is that I did say yesterday, when I was discussing a point which Senator Jameson had previously put, that his case was that as a result of the operations of the Bill land would be tainted.  I did not adopt that.  I have thought a good deal about it, and I hope to show you it is not so. You will admit that nine hundred thousand acres of land is not tainted to any extent more than it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>More than it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the demesne land, as Senator Jameson said, there is a big &ldquo;if&rdquo; in it.  I agree that during the war when people were making tons of money out of land, and when there was <Col N="1975" /> quite a lot of speculation going on in connection with land, and when there was not much land trouble, demesnes were selling pretty well, and people parted with land which they could not have parted with between 1903 and 1914. I do not expect for one moment, or profess for one moment, that I will ever be able to bring back land to be such a good security as it was between 1916 and 1918. You could not expect me.  Apropos of that I may say security on Irish land was always tainted because cattle drives and agrarian outrages did not improve the security of Irish land.</P>
      <P>It is really in the long run to improve the security on Irish land that I am bringing in this Bill.  You must deal with the merits of the case, and when you deal with the merits of the case on the one side and when the Government does its duty on the other, you will have the security of Irish land what it should be. I think even bankers will admit that we are not tainting very much, the average security on the demesnes&mdash; the average since 1903, in face of all the safeguards we have hedged them around with.  Now, come to the tenanted land. We give the Land Commission power to resume any holding at resumption price. The landlord had that power already for all practical purposes.  I would ask Senator Jameson and Senator Guinness whether, in fact, that provision will taint tenanted land one iota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we have it there in black and white.  So that as far as tenanted land is concerned, and the security of tenanted land, as compared with the security of the same class of land in England, it has been tainted to some extent for the last hundred years, especially the land of tenant-farmers.  I put it that we are not interfering or tainting the security from a banking point of view, one iota, by giving resumption prices, especially in view of the fact that that land was not saleable already, and that the only thing that will make that land saleable is the completion of the operations under this Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. GUINNESS Mr. GUINNESS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GUINNESS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so much the price.  It is the insecurity involved; the insecurity that makes any land in a <Col N="1976" /> good part of Ireland liable to be&mdash;I will not say confiscated, but&mdash;by the action of the Government, changed from one ownership to another.  That unquestionably spreads insecurity over the land, and therefore, makes the land not so valuable as it was before.</P>

I am dealing with the tenanted land unpurchased. I am pointing out that we are giving resumption price, resumption price being the price of the average open market.  In the past, tenanted land could have been and was dealt with.  As a result of the operation of the 1903 and and 1909 Acts, thirteen million acres of land were dealt with.</P>

      <P>Of course, when we are resuming tenanted land.  I think bankers will admit, in all the circumstances, that we do not taint the security of tenanted land, or if we do, we are ensuring to a tenant whose cattle have been driven for the last ten, twelve or fifteen years, that he will get the resumption price of the land from the State; that is the price that is adjudged to be the value in the open market.  I can say no more now on that question of tenanted land.  Let us come to the really serious point, the thirteen million acres of land unpurchased. Let me read the amendments I accepted.</P>

      <P>It is not exactly germane to the amendment, but it is undoubtedly germane to the questions put and observations made by Senator Jameson and Senator Guinness.  What I mean by that is that they were emphasising that this general legislation makes it possible for the Government to interfere with the ownership of any land in any part of the Free State.  Their point was that this operation created a sense of insecurity, and as a consequence lowered the value of the asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. GUINNESS Mr. GUINNESS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GUINNESS</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment I accepted is as follows:</P>
      <P>Where the Land Commission declare that any land coming within Clause 1 of sub-section 2 of this section is required for the purpose of relieving congestion, the following provision shall have effect: (a) if the land so declared forms portion of a holding, the proprietor or tenant of the holding may within the prescribed time and in the prescribed manner, require that the entire holding be so declared, and the Land Commission shall in that event, either so declare the entire holding or withdraw from the proposed acquisition of the said holding.</P>
      <P>That is to say where the Land Commission propose to acquire compulsorily a purchased holding, then the holder or the owner of the purchased holding shall say &ldquo;you will take it all or none.&rdquo; That is to prevent their taking 120 acres from a man with 150 acres, and leaving him the balance.  The Section goes on:</P>
      <P>(b)  If within the prescribed time and and in the prescribed manner, the proprietor or tenant of the declared land so requires them to do, the Land Commission shall, as soon as practicable, provide the said proprietor or tenant with a new holding which in the opinion of the Land Commission other than the Judicial Commissioner (subject to the right of appeal to the Judicial Commissioner, whose opinion shall be final) shall be equally suitable for the said proprietor or tenant and of not less value than the declared land. The provisions contained in this Act for transferring burdens and rights on the exchange of holdings by agreement shall extend to any exchange of lands effected under this Sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the meaning of that Sub-section? <Col N="1978" /> It means that when we take a purchased holding we must give the owner a holding equally suitable and of not less value.  In most cases, of course, this does not affect the banking question, because we give him a better holding. He will be taken out of a congested area and put somewhere where there is no congestion.  If he wants to keep the holding he can keep it in law and in fact because he would not be under the same pressure as he had been, living amongst congests for the last twenty or thirty years.  He can keep it, and it is as valuable; the burdens of the land are transferred and his personal security is better than it was before, if anything. If he wants to sell it he can do so, a thing he never could have done with his old holding in 95 cases out of 100.  He can sell it in the open market and it will be in a place where there is no congestion. That man is worth to the banker considerably more than he was worth before.  He has a holding of the same value in a place where he can sell it if he wants to sell it, with all the burdens transferred.  In 99 cases out of 100, he would not want to sell it, but if he does he is in the happy position that he can sell it.</P>
    <P>In view of these safeguards, in view of the fact that we will be only taking a very small percentage of purchased holdings, and that if we do take a holding, we must give that man an equally suitable holding, and one of not less value, the position will be re-established from the banking point of view.  I can only conceive one class of case where the banker might be affected prejudicially. That is the class of case where the value of the holding was, say, £4,000. The holder's debts were £4,000.  The value which the Land Commission would pay him if he refused to take an equivalent holding and insisted on being paid would be £3,000.  Possibly if he owed £4,000, and if the market value of the equivalent holding was £4,000, he might, under most extraordinary circumstances, say to the Land Commission, &ldquo;Give me the £3,000; I will put it in my pocket and you can keep the holding.&rdquo; Then the people to whom he owed £4,000 would have to sue him for the £3,000 which he had in hard cash. But remember he would have sacrificed a new holding which he could get the market value for.  So that, in fact, in <Col N="1979" /> regard to purchased holdings we are giving the market value.  If bankers think there is any virtue in the objection, we could insert a provision which would cover that two per cent. of cases to which I have referred and make it mandatory both on the Land Commission and the holder to take an equivalent holding and to have the burdens transferred. That would only affect one per cent. or two per cent. of cases.  If we make a provision in the Bill to give the man an equivalent holding and leave it to him to sell it if he wants the money, it would absolutely cover the point. But is there a point to be covered?</P>

I have thought over the question very carefully and I do not think, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, there is even from the banking point of view any point to be covered. We had two policies to deal with in connection with this land question.  Last year we took up the attitude that no man was going to have a perch of land unless he was the legal owner of it. Six months ago the land of the country was rapidly developing into a commonage. The other side of our policy is this Land Purchase Bill.  We ask you to put through this Land Purchase Bill. Consider carefully the very slight shake it will give the security of the country &mdash;if it does give it any shake&mdash;from the banking point of view, and on the other side consider the tremendous advantages of having the merits of the land question dealt with in Ireland once and for all, and put out of the way, and give the Government a fair chance to bring the question to the same position that it is in England, France, Germany, or any other country.</P>

      <P>I have no hesitation in saying that it is not in the Section.  I am sure the Minister was perfectly <i>bona fide</i> in putting forward his interpretation of it, but what it says is that the Courts have the same powers as are conferred in Section 5 of the Land Law (Ireland) Act.  Section 5 is only introduced for the purpose of giving the Court the same powers and there is nothing about the price or the mode of ascertaining the price in it.  That could be made quite plain by a simple amendment. At present there is nothing in that Section or Sub-section which is any guarantee that the Judge must have regard to the average market value of the land.</P>

If the Government intend that they should have the resumption price it would be very easy to make it plain in the Section.  It is not there, in my opinion, at present.

I congratulate him as an individual who might come to me, as a banker, and ask for an advance and make the most he can of his security, and I think on the whole, the case that he has made out for the land of Ireland is a good case.  On the whole, I think it is only right to say he has satisfied me.  He admits, I think, that there will be a certain amount, possibly, of falling value through insecurity but, at any <Col N="1984" /> rate he has satisfied me that the land of Ireland will not be such a depreciated security in the future as possibly might have been expected by some through the passing of this Act.</P>

      <P>My only object in this amendment is to have the Seanad understand clearly what it is doing. On this general question of banking and security I wish to make a statement on the final stages of the Bill.  In the Bill as before us the position is this: At present this Bill is not law.  The man who owns £3,000 worth of land in the congested districts is liable, of course, to have that land compulsorily acquired for the relief of congestion only.  If that same man also has £3,000 worth of land outside the congested districts&mdash;I am referring to untenanted land&mdash;under the Bill, by virtue of the fact that he owns £3,000 worth of land outside the congested districts that land can be taken by the Land Commission and used, not only for the relief of congestion, but for distribution among the persons mentioned in Section 31.  I only want the Seanad to know what is being done.  I am quite indifferent as to how the issue goes, but there is a grave responsibility on this House to do these things with their eyes open, practically to take away from a man all the land he owns, in certain circumstances, in excess of £3,000 value.  This is the first time that this occurs in this Bill.  It occurs now.  I am not going to speak again on it, but I have to ask the House to divide upon it.</P>

      <P>Several members of the Seanad have mentioned the somewhat unsatisfactory position we are placed in with regard to the number of those Bills imposed on us.  Most of us recognise that they are of an urgent character.  A very unsatisfactory position would result if the Bills are not passed.  At the same time we do not want to give the impression that we have really given full consideration to those Bills, and a suggestion was made that possibly a resolution might be passed reserving our right to bring up those Bills for further consideration when the new Parliament re-assembles, and expressing the view that while we passed those Bills as a matter of routine we did not give them that full consideration which they would otherwise have got.  I understand a similar promise had been given to the other House, and I have no doubt the same promise will be given to this House if the Bills are passed.  In regard to the others which are rather non-contentious some such resolution might be acceptable to the Seanad.  I have not drafted any resolution but I think there will be no difficulty if a few Senators come together in doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for DEFENCE (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the Dáil, to a very large extent this Bill is a complete one. We had thoroughly gone through it with a view to putting it to the Oireachtas as an Army Bill for dealing with our present forces and for regulating the work of the Army during the years immediately in front of us.  We were putting <Col N="1988" /> up this Bill practically as a permanent Bill.  There is just this particular addition, that whereas we did intend to put up a Reserve Bill separately when circumstances permitted, but having to get the Bill passed urgently we put all into the one which is now before you.  You have now an Army Bill which is as I said practically a complete Army Bill and Reserve Bill and certain transitory clauses dealing with the bringing of our present forces under the scope of the Bill immediately on the passing of the Bill and not necessarily waiting for a proclamation of the Executive Council establishing the Defence Forces actually contemplated in the Bill.</P>
      <P>We fully understand that the setting up of Defence Forces and the passing of laws that will control their organisation, the regulation and discipline of them and the general relationship of the armed forces of the State to the State are matters that require the very gravest and most careful consideration, in the first place in order to secure proper control, and in the second place, and perhaps what is most important to see that the Army set up in this country will be, from the point of view of organisation, the most efficient we could have; will be an Army that will not inflict a very great financial strain on the State; and will be one whose organization is such as to harmonise with the character of our people.  It is with very great regret that we find ourselves in the position of having to ask the Oireachtas to pass a Bill of this kind hurriedly.  Personally, making this Bill a temporary Bill, gives me a certain amount of satisfaction, because those who are responsible for the Army at the present time have had their hands very full, and they have been faced with a set of circumstances in the country that we never expected to have been faced with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had to develop the Army in the country to a size that we never anticipated our army would grow to. For that reason, even our own ideas as to the organisation and control of the Army may be somewhat warped by our present circumstances.  We know that when the Free State was established we had certain ideas with regard to the lines on which the Army ought to be developed and organised.  To some extent these ideas have had to undergo very <Col N="1989" /> radical change in actual practice, but there is nothing in the greater portion of the Bill that would not be required in any case.  Disciplinary sections or sections dealing with the relationship with the civil population as regards billeting and the impressment of transport are matters that will always stand.  They have been very carefully considered by a small group of fully qualified men who have set themselves out to control, as far as possible, the actions of the personnel of the Army, and to secure that in every possible way the Army is the absolutely controlled instrument of the State.</P>
    <P>There are certain portions of the Bill which have given rise to the suggestion that we are perhaps going to recruit men for a lengthy period and to present any incoming Government with a fairly large Army enrolled for a long period.  It has been thought that that portion of the Bill which gives us power for setting up a military college and dealing with the military education of higher officers, meant that we are going to establish big institutions of a military kind, and to develop a rather large crop of highly educated and skilled officers.  That has given rise to the suggestion that we were perhaps going to be somewhat expensive with regard to the institutions that we are setting up.</P>
    <P>These clauses that deal with military education, simply are clauses that give us power to carry on the education of our officers, but I do not anticipate that by the end of the lifetime of this Bill we shall have any very highly organised or developed military colleges.  I personally would be satisfied if we had half-a-dozen or eight officers of good standing and education, men of experience whom we could set aside from their ordinary military duties to look after the higher military education of officers and be the nucleus around which one might some day form a military college that would be something worth talking about, even if it were not an expensive institution. In view of the fact that there is little time under present circumstances for giving the Bill the consideration and discussion that a Bill of its nature should get, and in view of the fact that because of that we made it a temporary Bill, it is, perhaps, not necessary to go into any detailed exposition of the <Col N="1990" /> various clauses.  If there were any points that require to be dealt with I would be only too willing to deal with them.</P>

      <P>When it was suggested first that we should put forward this Bill as a temporary Bill I suggested that it should be put forward for a period of twelve months.  There were persons who thought that was too long a period and that the permanent Bill could be introduced earlier.  They suggested that if this temporary Bill passed for six months that that would be sufficient. My idea in having it extended to a period of twelve months is that we could, say in five or six months' time, put a Bill before the Oireachtas that would have plenty of time left for discussion. In the meantime if a Bill did pass earlier than twelve months it would do away with this Bill.  I personally am so satisfied of the importance of a thorough discussion of what our Army Bill should be like that I would be prepared to introduce it, say in six months' time, but I feel that we would want another six months in order to give it, on our own part, sufficient consideration.</P>

      <P>I am quite aware that this is a temporary measure, but it contains elements of permanence and defines the order of the new Army.  One point I would like to ask the Minister is this: I see that he has followed the nomenclature, if I may call it so, of the officers and non-commissioned officers of the British Army very closely. I know that the titles General, Captain and Lieutenant appear in other armies, but why have we gone so far as to have Lieutenant-Generals, Major-Generals and others exactly as they do?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is intended to deal with the Army that we have and to deal with it in its transition and its development to a more or less permanent <Col N="1991" /> army.  We have had reorganisations in the Army of one kind or another, great or small, and we find ourselves with these particular ranks that are in this Bill.  I think Senator MacLysaght will find that these ranks also appear in the French, American, and other armies.  We have not yet come to the days when we can invent new Irish titles for ourselves.  I feel that it would have been very useful if six months ago we could have invented four or five titles of a military nature that had not been heard of in any other country.  Then we would have escaped much of the humourous criticism about all the Generals that we have in this country. The matter can be borne in mind in the discussion of a permanent Bill, and if we are able to improve on the names, either from the artistic or aesthetic or national point of view we will be only too pleased to improve on them.</P>

      <P>I think everybody will admit that the Minister for Defence is actuated by the desire to do the best possible in the circumstances for the State and for the Army.  I feel convinced he has framed this Bill with a view to making the Army an efficient instrument of the State.  I was going to put forward a suggestion that we might take a leaf out of the book of our friends across the channel.  I think the greatest safeguard of the citizen as against the Army is the Bill which is introduced annually in the British Parliament called the Army Annual Act.  I would like to ask if it is proposed to institute any such Act in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>We have gone carefully into this matter and we have decided that it is not necessary in this country, in view of its Constitution, to have an Army Annual Act.  As far as I know the Army Annual Act passed annually by the British Houses of Parliament deals only with disciplinary regulations which are applied to soldiers.  We do not, as we view the matter at present, suggest that there should be in this country an Army Annual Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Our proposals with regard to recruitment at present are that we may recruit or re-attest men for a period of eighteen months or two years and require them to give an additional eighteen months or two years in the reserve.  Actually the army we have at present will demobilise itself, as it were, all the men will pass out at the end of the attestation period, automatically at the end of this year or the beginning of the next financial year.  It would be necessary for us if we are to keep a sufficient army strength to take steps within the next month or two to recruit men.  We have undertaken that we will not recruit men for more than a period of eighteen months or two years, but the Bill was framed as a permanent one and it was thought well to leave a certain latitude in the matter as to the period of recruitment, apart altogether from what our immediate outlook on the matter was.  We do not think it advisable to make any change of any kind that would involve going through the whole Bill and making consequential changes in different parts of it.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, too, there are certain classes of men whom if we did find it necessary to recruit now, we might recruit for a longer period.  These would be men whom we would have to take in and train and we would not wish to be in the position that, after giving them a fairly satisfactory training, in a year or 18 months they would leave us.  They would be men of a special class and their numbers would be specially limited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if it is his opinion that it is absolutely necessary for this Bill to be passed before the Dissolution.  If he says so, of course we have no alternative but to pass it without pretending to understand its implications and without accepting the responsibility that we should otherwise have to accept for its passage.  Regarding the suggestion of Senator Dowdall for an annual Army Bill to be introduced, the Minister has simply stated that that is not the present intention of the Government at all events, but beyond that statement he has given us no grounds for it.  We should, of course, have an opportunity of dealing with that aspect of the case when the Bill comes before us the next time, but I do certainly hold that the <Col N="1993" /> Government should give consideration to that point of view.  There is one important fact in connection with the passing of this Bill.  For good or ill it lays the basis for our permanent Army.  It will lay it in a manner which will be awkward and perhaps undesirable to upset or eradicate when the Bill comes on six or seven months hence.  For that reason it is to be regretted, even although it is useless, that the Bill was not introduced in time so that it could be more fully considered before it passed into law even for the first time.  I only desire to place on record the fact that we are passing the Bill through necessity without having had time to read, it fully or give it the consideration a measure of this kind deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point we have not touched upon and it is one which we civilians look upon rather from the critical point of view.  It is the cost of the Army.  We are passing this Bill because it is quite evident to everybody that an Army Bill is required.  We have the undertaking given us that probably within the next six months the Minister will bring in another Bill and as this runs for a year there will be ample time to discuss the other Bill and decide what our future Army Bills will be like. We may pass that matter over at once. In the meantime, and with the Government going to the country now, there is considerable time during which the real expenses of the Army will be running on.  We know that at present Army expenses are climbing up to nearly half of the whole expenditure of the Free State, and we know also that that burden has to be borne by the ordinary citizens here very much the same as the burden of the Army for the Great War had to be borne by Great Britain.  In fact it is far heavier here, really.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish for a moment to say that it is not right.  We owe far too much to the Army to begin quibbling with this sort of thing.  The Army has done for the Free State what the British Army did for Great Britain.  Our Army has freed us from an immense menace.  All the same, now that we have got through, I think we would like to know that as peace goes on and as the requirement for the Army in its real fighting capacity decreases, step by step with that, the economies of the Army <Col N="1994" /> are being considered.  We would like to know that at the present moment the issue of stores, the purchase of supplies, expenditure in units and other things, are getting that extremely careful supervision which we all know is required in even the British Army.  We know that in that Army every British officer and every individual to whom stores are issued has to account for them.</P>
    <P>I would like to know that the accountancy portion of our Army is being looked after and that there is an efficient department which is taking care of that. I take it for granted that General Mulcahy is looking into that matter personally. I trust there is someone watching to see that there is not any redundancy of officers and that the staffs are just what are needed.  In regard to all these things I think the ordinary citizen would like to have some information and would like to know that our financial affairs as regards the Army are being carefully looked after.  I am not criticising; I am only asking for assurances that the public may rely on it that all purchases of stores and all expenditure are being looked after in this country with a view to making our Army fit its needs and not be excessive in cost.  The reason I am mentioning this matter now is there will be undoubtedly little criticism of any description of the Army during the next six months.</P>
    <P>We will have a new Government and a great deal to do, and I doubt if there will be any criticism of Army expenditure. I am sure everybody in the Seanad is perfectly willing to trust the heads of the Army, and that we have got a good and efficient Army.  I would be the very last, considering the conditions in the country, to say that there ought to be any cutting down that is not approved by the heads of the Army. That is not the line I am taking; but without interfering with efficiency I would like to have an assurance that the heads of the Army are taking care of the expenditure as carefully as possible, and that we could rely, in any statements we make on the subject, that our Army was an efficient instrument being worked on as economic lines as possible in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>In regard to some of the remarks of Senator Jameson, I would like to draw attention to criticisms <Col N="1995" /> that are abroad regarding the Army, especially in the matter of the payment of accounts.  There is a good deal of adverse criticism, and in some cases I believe it is justified; in others perhaps it is partly justified.  Complaints are pretty frequent in that regard and also as regards separation allowances.  Many claims are made for separation allowances that are not justified, but there are cases in which several letters, some registered, have been sent to the proper quarter and have failed to bring forth replies of any description.  Members of the Dáil and Seanad have been troubled in regard to these allowances.  I believe in most cases where the attention of the authorities has been drawn, satisfaction has been secured.  I think that proper organisation of office staffs on a strictly business basis would tend to avoid all this and avoid also criticism that is not an advantage to the Army.  I would respectfully direct the Minister's attention to these little details.  If they were remedied it would save a good deal of trouble and justifiable criticism.</P>

      <P>I would like to support most of what has been said by Senator Jameson and some of what has been said by the last speaker.  I am glad that some words of appreciation in regard to the Army have been uttered. What the Army has done is really marvellous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to this there was of course reason why there should be certain slackness here and there.  The Army were engaged in endeavouring to restore order, and thy could not possibly have everything as correct as we would wish.  But, now, that comparative peace has been restored, I hope that the confidence reposed in the Army by Senator Jameson will be justified, and that the criticisms and the shortcomings alleged against it in that respect will be remedied.  I would like to say, speaking for myself, and I believe for everybody in the Seanad, that I hope in the future these little matters of accounts that we have been troubled about in the past by people up and down the country will be squared up.  I am afraid they have been unduly carried over.  Then in the estimates we find a large sum voted for the officers and men of the Army and in connection with that I think it is only fair to say that up to February last the officers <Col N="1996" /> were paid a miserable pittance.  Indeed many people would be surprised to know the very small sum the officers were paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelODea" hpid="Mr. O'DEA Mr. O'DEA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DEA</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with what was said by Senator Jameson and elaborated by other Senators.  I do not believe any people ever got from any army better service than we have got from our army in the matter of protection for life and property.  I do not think there is anybody in the Seanad who would wish in any way to be critical of the Army.</P>
      <P>The only point I have to refer to, unfavourably, is the payment of accounts. It is only natural, however, that a new Army, an entirely new body, would not have the very best system in dealing with their accounts.  There has been a lot of very serious complaint made to me with regard to accounts, and I am afraid that it has more or less injured the country or injured the Government in the opinion of traders.  I believe that is a thing that should not have occurred. I would say to General Mulcahy that his Business Department or his Accountancy Department should be overhauled. Every application for the payment of an account should be satisfied or some explanation sent to the person claiming the money.  The thing is very serious in this way that people in the country get into their heads that the Government have no money and that they are not able to pay their debts.</P>
      <P>I have over and over again in this Seanad pointed out the urgency the necessity and importance for the Government to maintain their credit at the highest possible standard.  Everybody in business knows how important it is that the credit of a business firm should stand high.  Any firm of whom this could not be said is attempting to carry on under very adverse conditions.  That is just as true of a Government.  As to the Army, all I can say is that we are under a deep debt of gratitude to the Army and a deep obligation to the Army for the great benefits and the great services they have rendered the country. They have done wonders in their time. Therefore we ought to be perfectly generous with them.</P>

      <P>On the matter raised by Senator O'Farrell with regard to the necessity of getting the Bill <Col N="1997" /> through before the Dissolution, I would say that our only justification for having an Army, and for controlling it, and disciplining it, up to the present has been the fact of a state of war.  We have now actually got to the position that the Courts have declared that a state of war no longer exists.  Living in that state of non-war and without the authority of this Act we would not legally and in accordance with our Constitution be able to raise an Army in this country or have an army, and we would not be able to apply the necessary disciplinary measures for disciplining the Army.  That is the reason why we have to have this Act passed before the Dáil dissolves.</P>
      <P>In the matter of economy raised by Senator Jameson, the expenditure on the Army at present is set out in the Army Estimates, period by period.</P>
      <P>We are perfectly aware that it is not sufficient for us to work within the sum of money that has been voted for the Army.  We are perfectly satisfied that we must work, and be able to work far below it, so that we may have as big a saving as possible in the vote for the Army in view of the financial stringency in which the Government finds itself. Every effort has been made to economise and there is an economy push on in every Department of the Army.  As far as stores accounting is concerned it will be quite well understood that we did not start on our late campaign with a stores accounting system like the British or like any other Army of many years experience would have.  Actually we started this campaign with no Stores Accounting Department.  We have worked out in the Army at present a stores accounting system that we are satisfied with.  We have a stores accounting system which we are putting into force now, and when that is at work we will be satisfied with it.  We have the satisfaction of knowing on the report of persons who have gone into our system at the main stores in Island Bridge and at our Headquarters that the system will be satisfactory and can be run economically.  We have started on even as detailed a matter as our Stores Accounting system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there has been a considerable volume of complaint with regard to the non-payment of accounts.  But in a very <Col N="1998" /> large measure that complaint arises because of the fact that we are scrupulously careful how we shall issue public money.  We have received very many accounts that cannot be properly vouched for, and I am sorry to say we have recieved many accounts that when fully investigated are over statements of account. In many parts of the country we have sent regular Commissions from headquarters here, to go into these matters with the assistance of the local officers on the spot, and we have succeeded in clearing up all reasonable accounts in various parts of the country. Now we are taking steps to deal with the residue of the accounts that we could not be satisfied on, even with local investigation on the spot.  We are taking steps to deal with these.  Generally we are looking well after the economic side of things in the Army.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be well if I said a few words in explanation and exposition of this Bill.  Senators are generally aware of the situation with which it is intended to deal.  We had for some years here in this country a dual system of Courts and a conflict for jurisdiction. It has been spoken of as concurrent jurisdiction; it would be nearly as true to speak of it as concurrent lack of jurisdiction.  At any rate there were two kinds&mdash;the Courts set up by Dáil Eireann and the existing State Courts of the British administration.  People brought their business to one or other of those two Courts, and unfortunately <Col N="1999" /> after the Truce people brought their business to both, going into one Court for an injunction against the other party from proceeding in the other Court.  I think most thoughtful people in the country realise that if the country were to continue plunging about in that condition of concurrent lack of jurisdiction it would spell an end to commerce and stability.</P>
      <P>We had the alternative.  There were really two ways of dealing with the situation, to adopt and adapt the Dáil Courts as they stood or to take the view that the State Courts having passed into our hands should receive the sanction and assent of the Parliament of the people since they were no longer obnoxious in the sense in which they were obnoxious in the past.  We withdrew the jurisdiction from the Dáil Courts and that step was criticised.  But Senators will appreciate the fact that they were at best an improvised system, used in the conflict against the British.  Of course they did real work, both in keeping certain peace and order in the country and enabling people to settle minor disputes inevitable in rural communities, and also in their propaganda value for the disturbances in the country at the time.  But the movement was split from top to bottom.  The personnel of the Courts had gone in different directions and people who witnessed the concluding stages of those Courts, who had any real knowledge of the abuses which prevailed generally did not regret the steps taken by the Government to end them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should have long since introduced a Bill of this kind.  The chief criticism of this Bill is that it is belated.  It is because we had to observe a sense of proportion and there were more pressing matters.  I am aware that cases of hardship did occur in the delay in tabling this Bill.  It provides for the payment of Judicial Commissioners to deal with cases pending in the Courts at the time of their abolition and to deal with any appeals there may be from decrees given in the Dáil Courts.  Section 2 deals with the appointment of the Commissioners. The class of business with which those Commissioners will deal is set out in Sections 4 and 5.  There is a provision for the appointment of Assistant Commissioners to help in the winding up of these Courts.  Sums were due <Col N="2000" /> under this system of Courts that it was not possible to pay because there were no legal provisions.</P>

      <P>I am speaking of expenses in connection with those Courts. The decrees will have to be registered and every registration will have to be examined by the Commissioners set up under this Bill.  When they are so registered they will be as binding on an Under-Sheriff as a decree given in the State Courts.  I do not know whether Senators had time to read the Bill very carefully.</P>
      <P>The only other criticism that had been made is one which Deputy Fitzgibbon made in connection with Section 26.</P>
      <P>The exact necessity for Section 26 is this.  There were people who during that period when summoned in one Court did not appear and let judgment go sooner than waive their political principles by entering that Court.  That applied to Dáil and State Courts all the time.  This Bill makes provision that for three months after the passing of this Bill, if a person can convince the Commissioners that he has a good case, then during that three months cases of this kind can be brought forward.</P>
      <P>I am not sure there is any other matter that calls for particular comment. Senators can take it that the matter has been very thoroughly investigated.  The Commission on which Mr. Meredith, K.C., acted and others who knew where the shoe was pinching in the situation arising out of those Courts were at work for some months and this Bill is framed on an unanimous report from that Committee.</P>

      <P>This Bill is intended to last for 12 months.  A Bill may be introduced before that which will end the operations of this Bill and be a substitution for it.  On that undertaking the Dáil did not give a detailed examination to the Bill.  I would like to comment on two things.  Section 4 is:</P>
      <P>(1)  The officers of the Civic Guard shall be divided into the several ranks specified in the First Schedule to this Act, and all such officers below the rank of Surgeon shall be appointed and may at any time be dismissed by the Executive Council, and may be from time to time promoted or degraded by the Commissioner in accordance with regulations made under this Act.</P>
      <P>(2)  The men of the Civic Guard shall be divided into the several ranks specified in the First Schedule to this Act, and shall be enrolled and appointed, and may be from time to time promoted, degraded or dismissed by the Commissioner in accordance with regulations made under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Executive Council appoints officers of the Court under that Section. That preserves absolutely the principle that the Executive Authority wielded in the country is the delegated authority of the people.  That may be said to be pooled in the Executive Council and delegated out to individuals.  The position held by officers in the Civic Guard will be given by the Executive Council and can only be withdrawn by them.  I want to make it clear here, as in the Dáil, that the Executive Council will act on the advice of the people who control the <Col N="2002" /> force.  It would be a bad thing if in a young police force any idea was to prevail that there was to be an appeal from the decision of their authority.  In practice there will not be any such appeal. It might happen that members of the force might think that they were able by establishing friendly contact with politicians to find a way out of any disciplinary difficulties they might get into.</P>
    <P>That will not be the position.  You cannot preserve a disciplined efficient force and proceed to undermine it by allowing personal connection to creep in. The Executive Council will act through well defined channels on the advice of its officials.  I do not want to say that the Section is purely theoretical, but I say to a very large extent the Executive Council will act on the advice of the person at the head of that police force. Senators might be interested in the declaration taken by members of the Guard.  It is in the Second Schedule to the Bill.  It is proposed to have 807 stations established in the country, and we think that will be sufficient for its requirements. At the moment we have between five and six hundred and we are going on with the distribution of the force.  I am glad to inform you that the general discipline efficiency and morale of the Force is eminently satisfactory. The people have been co-operating loyally with the Force and have shown that a responsible civic spirit is asserting itself in the country.  That is perhaps the most healthy symptom we have at the moment, the manner in which the people realise that those men unarmed amongst them weilding an authority and power which is really their delegated power and authority and are enforcing laws which have the sanction of their members in Parliament.  I think the civic spirit will grow, and if it does, the future of the country is assured despite the adverse conditions associated with the birth of this new State.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 32; to insert after this Section a new Section 33 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;33.  Immediately after the date of the passing of this Act the Land Commission shall enquire into and investigate the claims of persons claiming to be persons specified in Section 31 <i>(c)</i> of this Act (i.e., persons commonly known as evicted tenants), and upon being satisfied as to the genuineness of any such claims shall take steps either to restore such claimants to their original holdings or to provide land for them elsewhere in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that the claims of those persons ought to be enquired into. There appears to be a large body of claimants.  Some of them probably are not genuine cases, but I am satisfied that in some cases genuine evicted tenants have been passed over under previous settlements and that their cases should now receive consideration.  The amendment simply asks the Land Commission to inquire into their cases, to reject the undeserving and to put on their list for land those whom they consider deserving cases.  The claim of the <Col N="2006" /> genuine evicted tenants is quite as strong as the claim of any congest. Under this Bill all the available untenanted land in the country will pass into the hands of the Land Commission and this is the last opportunity these evicted tenants will have of being provided with substitute holdings, if their claims are passed as deserving after inquiry by the Land Commission.  It is a bad policy for any Government, at least not to enquire into the grievances of a substantial number of the citizens of the country. The least they might do would be to make that enquiry.  It would cause a great deal of heart-burning if those who consider they have claims are turned down without having their cases enquired into.  I hope the Minister will see his way to accept, if not the whole of this clause, at least the part of it that refers to an enquiry.</P>

    <P>It was only after a good deal of consideration that we agreed to the passing of that Section.  It is passed and surely under it an evicted tenant or the successor of any evicted tenant can put forward a claim.  It does seem rather going beyond the rights of the case when we have given every evicted tenant or his successor the right to put forward his claim that we should go and make it compulsory on the Commissioners to hold a special inquiry into this part of the matter.  I think the evicted tenants and their successors are well able to take care of themselves and to put forward claims in a direct way.</P>

If there is land in the hands of the Land Commission we will take into consideration any genuine cases of evicted tenants.  The Senator did not tell us where we were to get the land.

      <P>Where in the case of a holding retained by the Land Commission, the Land Commission do not exercise their powers of resumption, or if they exercise their powers of resumption in respect of only part of the holding, then if the tenant has used and cultivated the holding as an ordinary farmer in accordance with proper methods of husbandry, the Land Commission may resell to the tenant the holding at the standard price, or any part thereof not resumed at the proportionate part of such price applicable thereto as determined by the Land Commission, and may make an advance for the purpose of the purchase not exceeding such sum as with the amount obtained by capitalising at the rate of four and three-quarters per cent. the original annuities payable on the advances, if any, whether redeemed or not, which may already have been made under any of the Land Purchase Acts for the purchase of lands of which the tenant is the proprietor at the date of such resale, does not exceed £3,000, unless in the opinion of the Land Commission it is expedient that this amount should be exceeded, the difference (if any) between the amount to be advanced and the price being paid in cash by the tenant to the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;Section 33 to delete the word &lsquo;may&rsquo; in line 61 and to substitute the word &lsquo;shall.&rsquo;&rdquo; This and the next amendment can go together and I will be satisfied with the decision of the Seanad on one of them. The amendment affects the position <Col N="2009" /> of the owner of a retained holding.  My examination of the Bill leads me to the conclusion that the greatest injustice in the Bill is done to the unpurchased tenant whose holding is retained.  The Seanad may remember the life history of the land of this unpurchased tenant. If the value of the holding is over £3,000, or if the tenant holds under an annuity land valued over £3,000, his holding is automatically retained.  The Minister stated that such a tenant still gets his breakfast but I am not quite certain that he takes it with the same relish.  The tenant remains in occupation of the holding, but it is liable at any time to be resumed, which means taken over by the Land Commission in whole or in part.  Assuming it is taken over in whole, the Land Commission has power to deal with it.  They can give it to congests or landless men, and if there is any left over they can do what they like with it.  It is purely optional whether they resell it to the original owner.  They may resell it but they are not bound to do so.  I do not think that is fair but the Seanad can give its decision.  I hope I have put the case fairly.  I urge that the Land Commission shall be bound to resell and that decision will be affected by the substitution of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the general question I would ask the Minister to consider such an amendment before the Report Stage.  It will scarcely do justice to the owners to retain holdings, and it would to a certain extent alleviate their anxiety.  The owner, whose holding is retained, should have power to call upon the Land Commission to resume the holding if he so wishes and at least be spared the anxiety of having his property filched away from him piecemeal.  It is not going to deal with the whole injustice, but it is going a certain way to relieve the anxiety of this unfortunate being who has the sword hanging over his head from year to year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I might as well put all my cards on the table at once.  With regard to Sub-Section 3 of Section 24, which provides that certain lands can only be taken, now that we have amended it, when there is no other land available in the neighbourhood and which provides for making special provision for purchased holdings, I would accept an appeal to the Appeal Court on any matter arising out of that Sub-Section with the exception of price.  On any issue in regard to the acquisition of land I would accept an appeal.  That would be when the Judicial Commissioner would decide first and the Court of Appeal afterwards in regard to demesne land, purchased holdings, parcels of untenanted land, and so on.  The Section as it stands is to the effect that we shall take even this excepted land specified in Sub-section 2 if we require it for the relief of congestion and if there is no other land available, and in the case of purchased holdings we shall resell an equivalent holding to the owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On any question of acquisition under that sub-section, I would accept an appeal to the Court of Appeal; but on any question of price&mdash;and I have given the question a lot of thought&mdash; it would be out of the question to give an appeal to the Court of Appeal on a question of whether say the owner was to get £5,500 or £6,000.  To ask the Court of Appeal or any such tribunal, to give an opinion in such a matter, would be out of the question.  This question, as the Cathaoirleach knows well, was argued on the 1909 Act at length in the House of Commons in England and it <Col N="2016" /> was the general opinion there, and I think the opinion shared by both sides, that an appeal to the Court of Appeal on a question of price, a question involving the bringing up of auctioneers, witnesses, valuers and people of that sort to give evidence as to price, would be impossible and would not be businesslike. The only suitable tribunal for such a question would be the Judicial Commissioner.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated how we are appointing the Judicial Commissioner in relation to the Land Commission, and the arguments that were potent in regard to the 1909 Act, in regard to the Evicted Tenants' Act, where compulsory powers were given also and where the whole question was discussed again, and the arguments that convinced the people who drafted the Convention Report, are as potent to-day, and there is no more reason to-day to think that the Judicial Commissioner in the future will be under the influence of any particular Government than there was in the past. I could not agree to accept an appeal on the question of price.  We have put the price here that was recommended by the Convention of 1918.  It was a question that was discussed at great length and the exact phraseology of it is inserted here.  We will give an appeal under Sub-section 3 on the question of what lands are to be acquired.</P>

I should like a ruling as to whether this would be the most convenient time to raise that matter, or would the Report Stage be more suitable?

      <P>Under this Sub-section certain matters will come before the Judicial Commissioner.  The Land Commission proposes to take certain untenanted land or, perhaps, to resume certain retained holdings, and they have various proposals under which they take these powers.  Presumably they apply these powers to correct husbandry.  They may say &ldquo;we are retaining these holdings because we consider that the food-producing capacity of this holding has not been properly developed,&rdquo; or else they may say that it has been farmed in an improper way.  There would be grave contention on this point.  Litigation <Col N="2018" /> of as circumscribed a character as possible will ensue.  I want the Seanad to consider the status of this Judicial Commissioner because the whole thing involves the question of judicial independence. I reinforce my argument from the Land Law Commission Bill.</P>
      <P>I argue that the Judicial Commissioner is empowered to act both in his administrative and judicial capacity. That Bill says &ldquo;The Irish Land Commission shall be deemed to have had as soon as transferred a continuous corporate existence in Saorstát Eireann and shall after the passing of this Act consist of a Judicial Commissioner and such number of other Commissioners as the Executive Council shall consider requisite.&rdquo; I think the Judicial Commissioner there is associated in his administrative capacity with the other Commissioners. I have no doubt that the Judicial Commissioner will do his best to keep away from his notice all matters on which he might perhaps subsequently have to give a decision, but I will ask the Seanad whether in reality that is possible as he will be living in the same building and in the same administrative atmosphere as his brother Commissioners, and must be frequently coming into contact with them, and I fancy as Administrative Officer he will be responsible for their decisions as Commissioners. Then conceive what happens.</P>
      <P>A party aggrieved at a decision of a body of which the Judicial Commissioner is a member and who is associated with that decision, appeals to the very man who is one of the number who have already given the decision.  All through this Bill I want the Seanad to clearly understand what they are doing.  I thank the Minister for what he has given us, but I feel I will not get much satisfaction on this fundamental principle, so all I want to know is what we are doing.  We are giving the citizens a so-called Judge to try his case although he has been associated already with the matter in dispute in his administrative capacity.  I should like to know that there is a precedent for that principle in the laws of any country as I have not heard of anything of the kind. I may be wrong.  The Minister may tell me that under previous Acts it has been so.  The question of law will undoubtedly arise on these matters that I have indicated when I quoted from the Act.</P>

      <Col N="2019" /> Under Section 62 of the Act of 1909, especially as concerns its compulsory powers&mdash;of course this part of the Bill only assumes that matters of grave constitutional importance regarding compulsory powers are involved&mdash;it was laid down &ldquo;There shall be an appeal to the Court of Appeal from any decision of the Judicial Commissioner under this Section, and the decision of the Court of Appeal shall be final.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>62.&mdash;(1) If any person interested in the estate or untenanted land objects to the acquisition of the same under this Part of this Act on the ground (a) that other land sufficient and equally suitable for the purposes for which the estate or untenanted land is proposed to be acquired is available for purchase by the Commissioners or Board, as the case may be, by voluntary agreement at a reasonable price; or (b) that the estate or untenanted land consists of or includes land in the occupation of the owner which is, or forms part of, a park, garden, pleasure ground, recreation ground, demesne, or home farm, or was purchased under the provisions of the Irish Church Act, 1869, for a sum not exceeding two thousand pounds; or (c) that the estate or untenanted land consists of or includes land which has <Col N="2020" /> been purchased under the Land Purchase Acts (d), or is the property of a local authority, or is held by any corporation or company for the purpose of a railway, dock, canal, water, or other public undertaking; or (d) that, if the estate or untenanted land is acquired as proposed, other land of the owner adjoining the estate or untenanted land will be injuriously affected; he may, within the prescribed time and in the prescribed manner (a) apply to the Judicial Commissioner for an order restraining the Estates Commissioners from acquiring the estate or untenanted land, or any specified part or parts of the same under this Part of this Act.</P>
    <P>(2) The Judicial Commissioner shall hear in the prescribed (b) manner and determine all applications coming before him under this Part of this Act, and for that purpose shall have and may exercise the powers conferred on the Land Commission by sub-sections (1), (3), and (4) of section forty-eight of the Act of 1881 (e), and may, if the justice of the case so requires, amend the final offer by excluding there from any part or parts of the lands described therein, or (with the consent of the owner and the body by whom the final offer was sent) by including therein any other lands of the owner.  (3) Where a final offer (f) is amended by the Judicial Commissioner under this section, the body by whom the offer was sent may make such consequential amendments in the offer as appear to them to be necessary, and the offer as amended in pursuance of this section shall be deemed to be the final offer for the purpose of any subsequent proceedings under this Part of this Act. (4) There shall be an appeal to the court of appeal from any decision of the Judicial Commissioner under this section, and the decision of the court of appeal shall be final.  (5) An order of the Judicial Commissioner or the court of appeal restraining the Estates Commissioners from acquiring land under this Part of this Act shall remain in force for five years after it is made.  (6) The expression &ldquo;owner&rdquo; in this section means any person having power under the Land Purchase Acts to sell the estate or untenanted land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2021" /> This is a bigger question than the Act of 1909.  If that Act did not afford a trial by a judge that was absolutely independent of all administrative concerns, I say it was wrong and it should not be perpetuated. I ask the Seanad to accept that view.  There is a sacred principle involved in this that the judge should act with an open mind, and we should shut the door to all possibilities that he should have before him such cases, even in private, let alone in an administrative capacity.  I stand on that, and even if the Act of 1909 conflicts with that principle, I say it should not be perpetuated, and I ask the Seanad not to allow the Act of 1918 to red-herring the main issue. As the Statute stands, on a question of law or a question of price, or both, he should be independent, because he must in the nature of things, have been brought into contact with the negotiations and actions which led up to a judicial hearing. I hope the Minister will not force the issue.  Even if he gave an appeal to another High Court Judge it would be something, but to deprive a man of that right is, I say, an infringement of the liberty of the subject.</P>

      <P>I may mention a case where it is obvious that an appeal to the High Court is necessary to the owner.  Under the compulsory clauses of the Land Act for Demobolised Soldiers, I know a case of a townland where the Land Commission offered a sum of £10,000.  On appeal to Judge Ross's Court that amount, after the hearing of evidence on behalf of the owner, was increased to £16,000.  Therefore, it is obvious that unless the Judicial Commissioner had a similar hearing, where evidence was produced on behalf of the owner from valuers, he would be very unlikely to make much alteration in the price fixed by the Land Commission.  I think it would be an advantage, and in the interests of justice, to have an appeal to a Court of Appeal, even to a Judge of the High Court.</P>

      <P>We are arguing a question that was argued on the 1903 Act in all its bearings.  Every argument put forward here by Sir John Keane and other Senators was put forward in the English House of Commons when the 1903 Act was being passed, and when compulsory powers were being given to the Land Commission.  The same arguments were again used in the 1909 Act, and it was agreed on both sides of the House that though there were certain objections to giving no appeal on the question of price from the Judicial Commissioner, nevertheless there was no suitable substitute.  That was agreed, and I think An Cathaoirleach will bear me out in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>You were.  That is so. They discussed this thing very carefully and closely.  Anyone, on the face of it, could see the objection to asking the Court of Appeal to decide questions&mdash;they are generally Equity Judges, not exactly suitable to such work&mdash;whether the price should be £5,500 or £5,520.  We are not on the question of price or value.  The Court of Appeal would be an ideal court to decide on the interpretation of the Act, but to say what the price should be of a particular area of land is to ask the Court of Appeal or any other body of High Court Judges not used to that sort of work, to do something which, according to the discussions of the Acts of 1903 and 1909, they were not suitable for and which the Judicial Commissioner, though not exactly ideal, was the most suitable person to do.  The opinion of the Conservatives during that debate is fairly summed up by saying that there was no better substitute.  That is a question of fact.  Why was that their opinion of the Acts of 1903 and 1909?  What objections did they see to going into the Court of Appeal when they were anxious to give the <Col N="2023" /> vendors every fair play.  There was an amendment to that effect, and why was it the general opinion, both of the leading Conservatives and Liberals, that there was no suitable substitute to the Judicial Commissioner?</P>
      <P>Anyone who knows anything about Land Commission operations will see it at once.  On the question of price, to bring into the Court of Appeal auctioneers, land valuers, and all the rest, would be really asking the Court of Appeal to do something for which they are not peculiarly suited as a Tribunal. If you get a capable Judicial Commissioner who is accustomed to dealing with these things he would give more satisfaction.  Senator Sir John Keane has been protesting too much that all he wants is to give the Seanad the facts. He started to quote the 1909 Act to support his contention that that Act gave an Appeal to somebody other than the Judicial Commissioner.  The fact is, as he read it out, that the only appeal under that Act to the Judicial Commissioner was an appeal on the question of acquisition and only on the question as to whether the land came within the exceptions&mdash;whether it was demesne land and whether other lands sufficient and equally suitable were available.</P>
      <P>These are the only questions on which the 1909 Act gives an appeal.  That gave no appeal on price.  I am not saying too much when I say it was the general view of the English House of Commons that there was no other suitable tribunal.  I feel that it would do a terrible lot to hold up and wreck the Bill and make its workings arbitrary if there was an appeal on every question.  If there was an appeal on every question that we give the Judicial Commissioner a say in, the Bill would never operate. On the question of price an appeal, in my opinion, would make it more arbitrary. There has been an effort to show that the Judicial Commissioner is part of the judicial machinery of the Land Commission.  Sir John Keane with his usual frankness quoted one Section and left it so.</P>

      <P>The Section he quoted was Sub-Section (2).  It must be remembered that this is only an amending Bill and that all the previous Land Acts apply.  This Bill specifically continues the previous existence of the Land Commission&mdash;it shall be deemed to have continuous existence.  The functions of the Judicial Commissioner were carefully defined in all previous Land Acts and all the Acts were carefully drawn and all the duties that were assigned to him were carefully scanned with special reference to the fact that he was the arbitrator between the Land Commissioners and the vendor.  This Land Commission Bill in the appointment of the Judicial Commissioner makes two things perfectly clear: (1) That he must be a High Court Judge assigned to the work by the head of the Judiciary, not by the Executive Council. The Executive Council cannot appoint him.  (2) That the Land Commissioners themselves are a totally different body appointed by the Executive Council and are only ordinary civil servants. They had the status of County Court Judges.  They have not under this Act. They are appointed by the Executive Council as heads of Departments.  They are the administrative and executive head of the Land Commission and they do all the administrative work.  The functions of the Judicial Commissioner have been defined in previous Acts and are specifically defined in this Bill and any functions assigned to him have always been assigned to him in the light of the fact that he must be the final arbitrator between the Commissioners and the vendors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that he has not administrative functions.  He has some small administrative functions but that was essential in the nature of the case.  What I say is absolutely accurate, that all the Land Acts, realising on the one side the special position, and on the other, the fact that no other tribunal would be equally suitable, assigned his functions to him with great care and defined them with great care. The point that Senator Sir John Keane made now has nothing in it on the merits.  He is in name part of the Land Commission and the mere statement contained in that Section 2&mdash;which says that the Land Commission shall consist of a Judicial Commissioner and the Land Commissioners&mdash;and insisting on the point that he is part of the Land Commission, without reference to the fact that his peculiar position has been carefully defined in all Land Acts, is merely confusing the issue.  There are no merits in that point.  It is merely a point that could be made easily and which takes a good deal of explanation to meet.  That is all that is in it.</P>
      <P>I have here a report signed by Lord MacDonnell, the Bishop of Ross, Lord Oranmore and Brown, M.J. Barry, J.J. Clancy, Michael Knight, and G.F. Stewart.  I do not think anyone would call them Bolsheviks.  Here is what they say on that question of price: &ldquo;In such a case the Judicial Commissioner in fixing the price, failing agreement between the owner and the Estates Commissioners, is to have regard to the fair value of the land to the owner and to the Estates Commissioners.&rdquo; We have abolished the Estates Commissioners and called them Land Commissioners. There is no occasion to have a sort of pooh-bah arrangement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It has this concern, the Court of Appeal would have some functions on the question of the principles of price and the principles of valuation. That would be the Court proposed to decide what is the meaning of resumption value.  On the question, whether the land to be paid for is worth £5,000 or £6,000, the only suitable tribunal is the Judicial Commissioner.  If there is an <Col N="2026" /> appeal on price to the Court of Appeal it will, in my opinion, do a considerable amount to throw out of gear the working of the Land Commission without doing any good whatever to the vendor or the tenant.</P>
      <P>The recommendation of those persons whose report I have read says that the price should be defined in the Act as a fair price having regard to the fair value of the land to the owner and the Estates Commissioners.  We have put in that. It was in the 1920 Bill.  None of the previous Acts gave any appeal to anyone else except a Judicial Commissioner &mdash;neither the 1903 nor 1909 Acts.  I say here considering all the difficulties, considering the times and everything else, we have not done badly at all in just putting in exactly the same provisions in regard to this question as were suggested by the body I have read out, and that were followed previously as far as appeals are concerned by the British House of Commons.

      <P>I have been listening to this debate to try to bring to it the test that I bring to every vote I give. Will the amendment, if pushed, wreck the Bill or not?  I have listened to the Minister to find out what grounds he would give me for forming the opinion that if there is an appeal to the Court of Appeal it would so alter the conditions that it would wreck the Bill.  I must say he has not convinced me.  He based his main argument against the Court of Appeal being used on the fact that it would not be the proper body to discharge such a function, and that it would interfere with the position of the Judicial Commissioner or of the Land Commission. Suppose we grant that.  The Court of Appeal might probably not be the right body to decide such a matter, still I think an independent High Court Judge, having nothing whatever to do with it could be a fair and reasonable individual to hear arguments for and against a certain price.  I think the Minister has met us to a very considerable extent in what he has offered in regard to appeals on Sub-section 3 of Section 29.  How far that goes to meet Senator Sir John Keane I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point the Minister made was that he was adamant on the question of appeal with regard to price.  I wonder will he look into the matter again.  If it is merely that he doubts that the Court of Appeal is a good court to go to, will he look into the question of another independent High Court Judge?  It is hard to understand that it would absolutely upset the whole machinery of the Bill if such an appeal was allowed even on the question <Col N="2028" /> of price.  There is no question, I think, as to how it would be viewed by the persons affected by this Bill.  I think anyone who has heard it discussed and knows the feelings of those who are affected and who knows how far this Bill goes beyond the Act of 1909, would say that we might go a little further as Senator Barrington stated, as a purely Irish body in giving a little more protection as regards appeal than was given by the British House of Commons or the British House of Lords.  I would again ask the Minister to consider whether he is quite right in thinking, even as regards the question of price, that it would wreck the Bill.  I listened to his arguments to see if I could find out why it would wreck the Bill, and I honestly confess I have not heard that yet.  They may be there.  If that is so, and if it is only a question of the Court of Appeal being the proper body, would he consider another Judge of the High Court? As this Bill goes beyond anything we had before, and has given rise to doubts in the minds of people affected, if they had an independent High Court Judge to whom they could appeal, when, in their opinion, a decision was flagrantly wrong, it would be an enormous relief.</P>
      <P>I do not think, if the Judicial Commissioner is, as I am sure he will be, from what the Minister states, a Judge of the High Court, a very high-class individual, there will be a great many cases that will go beyond him.  People are not so fond of litigation, and a well-known upright Judge giving his decisions in a right and impartial way will bring about a condition of things that people would not care to go beyond his decision.  If cases do arise where people would wish to go beyond it, I do not see how it would wreck the Bill for the Minister to allow it even on the question of price.  I cannot see how it would.  It would be on every side taken for granted that he had met a genuine case genuinely, and it would be a great relief to everybody affected by the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not think that this would really wreck the Bill. That is a very strong word to use.  But it would delay the work of the Land Commission if this appeal were accepted.  It would delay the operation of the acquisition of land, and there would be hundreds of cases to be re-heard.  The Minister <Col N="2029" /> has said, and said very truly, that all sorts of people would be called in, land agents, owners, tenants, proprietors. Let me give you an instance.  Let me draw an analogy from this.  You can wreck a motor car by running it for ever.  You have only to go on long enough running it and in time it must smash up.  That is what I think the Minister means.  The delays would be continual and enormous.  I heard this argued over and over again, and when you introduce a question of price you re-open all those difficulties, which I have shewn to the Seanad.  I am not in love with the Bill, not in the least. But I see the necessity of this measure, and I see the necessity of the Seanad passing it as soon as they possibly can, considering the immense stress of business that is before the Oireachtas of this country.</P>

But on further consideration I am inclined to think that the Minister is right, that this is not really an appeal from one court to another, but it is a case of providing that the Judicial Commissioner will really be an outside body, as distinct from the Land Commissioners, who have no legal training.  With regard to the appeal on price, I have had a conversation with an experienced Irish lawyer, a Conservative, and he told me that it would be a great blunder if the Oireachtas were to agree that there would be an appeal from the Judicial Commissioner on the matter of price, because it would add greatly to the cost, and it would ensure no more accuracy or possibly as much accuracy in the matter of price.  He said you may have two men in the box before you.  One swears this and one swears another thing, and if you have intelligence you can have a pretty good idea of which of them is lying.  If, on the other hand, you get two statements signed, it will be extremely difficult, and the appeal would be of little value unless you had the persons before the Appeal Courts.  This would add enormously to the expense. <Col N="2030" /> For that consideration I think the stand taken by the Minister is the wisest one.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a word in reference to the remarks of Senator Douglas, that it is not a question of one witness lying or the other witness telling the truth.  It is not a question of that at all.  It is a question whether the bald facts and figures are there.  I can give you an instance of the case.  We can never forget that this Bill is entirely different from any Bills passed before this.  It gives power to buy the land compulsorily.  It has always been held in the past and I hold now that land should never be bought unless the man from whom it is compulsorily taken should be given the full value.  Why should property be taken away from one man and given to somebody else unless the man is fully paid for it?  As long as compulsory power is there, it alters the case entirely.  I can give you an instance which illustrates the difference very clearly.  I am aware of a case in the country in which the Congested Districts Board have power compulsorily to acquire land.  They went down and they proceeded to prepare an estimate to acquire this land compulsorily. The proprietor said, &ldquo;There is to be an appeal in this case, we will produce all our figures before the Judge of Appeal, and then you can acquire my land.  We are sure they will give us justice.&rdquo; The result was they did not acquire the land compulsorily.  If compulsion was taken out of this I would have no objection, but as long as there is compulsion there, and as long as it is possible that a man's land may be taken, and only a half or a quarter of its value given, I think it is absolutely necessary to have an appeal.  I hope the Seanad will be impressed by the very grave and weighty words which Senator Jameson has addressed to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

      <P>We are dealing now with amendment 42 (a).  That is an appeal on the question of the acquisition of any land.  In fact this amendment does not deal with prices.  It is a question of <Col N="2031" /> acquisition.  I stated what I would be prepared to do in regard to acquisition, to give an appeal in respect of any land acquired under Section 24 (3).  I want to say one word in answer to what Senator Jameson has said.  He suggested a tribunal.  When this question was being discussed before, that was the very point raised.  What is the tribunal to be?  That was the difficulty they found themselves in.  Because taking even the question of prices it will always be an issue what amount of money there will be to give for the land.  And you will have a Judicial Commissioner deciding that question day after day and becoming absolutely an expert on that question.</P>
      <P>If you give a general appeal to a High Court Judge you would be giving it to a Judge of exactly the same status as the Judicial Commissioner, and what you would be doing, in fact, is appointing a new Judicial Commissioner.  The Judicial Commissioner is and must be a High Court Judge.  If you give an appeal on every question or even if you give an appeal on price alone, because price will occur week after week, you will be really appointing a second Judicial Commissioner. You would not be appealing to any new tribunal.  I am dealing now only with the suggestion that has been put forward by Senator Jameson.  Once the Land Commission would get going appeals would come in every day and every week and the second High Court Judge of the King's Bench would be dealing with this question and would have his hands probably fuller than any other Judge.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us suppose there were many appeals.  You will be making a second High Court Judge a second Commissioner.  You would have no tribunal really because the second High Court Judge would, in fact, become a second Judicial Commissioner, and he would happen to be by chance just over the other High Court Judge.  If you like you could put the Judicial Commissioner over him.  Take any two High Court <Col N="2032" /> Judges and appoint one of them a Judicial Commissioner and the other the Judge of Appeal.  It would be really the same Court.  In the case of the second High Court Judge you would really be appointing a man who could do no other work if appeals were many. Would it really be advisable in view of the cost and slowness?  Of course it would be impossible if there were a general appeal on all other questions; it would hold up the whole Land Commission.</P>
      <P>If you gave a general appeal from the Judicial Commissioner on every question, then you would have the Land Commission functioning under impossible circumstances.  When they were discussing this question under the 1909 and other Acts that is what they felt. Supposing there was only an occasional appeal, it must be remembered that this is work that essentially a Judge becomes expert at.  There is not much law involved.  It is not like interpreting a Statute; it is not legal work of that kind.  It is work at which a Judge becomes an expert and if he is an efficient Judge and deals with these matters every day he can get through the work much more quickly and uniformly than if there were five or six Judges dealing with it, and appeals would come before one now and one again.  The work would be more uniform under one Judge and more quickly dealt with, and I venture to say would be much more just.  If there is an occasional appeal before a Judge who has not been dealing with that sort of work and who may be dealing meantime with Divorce, Probate and other cases, more than likely, his decision, being a superior one to that of the Judicial Commissioner, would be a decision that might upset the decision of the Judicial Commissioner. It might be very much lower or very much higher on the matter of price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision might upset the whole uniformity of the Judicial Commissioner's decisions, which, quite conceivably, and more likely, would be fairer. What I mean is this; the decision of the superior Judge might possibly err on the side of the landlord or on the side of the tenant.  The Judge would be more liable to error if he were only dealing with cases occasionally.  The work is essentially expert work and the judgment <Col N="2033" /> would be a superior judgment. If he erred on one side, until there was another decision on a similar set of circumstances, which would probably come soon, then, the Judicial Commissioner's decisions would be put out of gear.  For all those reasons there would gradually be developed a situation in which you would have in the nature of the case a tremendous number of appeals and the Judge would become, in fact, a second Judicial Commissioner.  This question was debated on its merits; it is no new question, and I put it very strongly that it will be a serious hardship and is much more likely to be as serious a hardship to the owner as to the tenant if you set up a tribunal such as was suggested by Senator Jameson.  That is on the question of price.  On the question of acquisition of land, which is the subject of the amendment before us, I am willing to accept an appeal under Sub-section (3), Section 24.</P>

      <P>I have heard nothing from the Minister to relieve my anxiety on this matter of the sanctity of the Judicial temperament. I hope the independence of the Judiciary would be like the integrity of Caesar's wife, beyond reproach. I claim it has been clearly established that nominally, in law, in atmosphere and in propinquity, the Judicial Commissioner is part of the Land Commission and exercises his administration accordingly.  That being so, I should have thought it unnecessary to argue any further the question as to a principle of high constitutional importance that is involved.</P>
      <P>Apparently judging from remarks that have fallen more especially from Senator Douglas, whose reasoning power is usually exceptionally acute, I see there is a doubt on that important principle. The Minister led us to believe that he is giving an appeal on all questions of acquisition.</P>

      <P>I accept the correction. He is giving an appeal on the question of whether a given parcel or estate comes within the exact sections. I am sure the Seanad will appreciate my great difficulty as a layman without any legal advice arguing these intricate matters. The Minister fortifies himself behind the 1909 Act when he says that practically in identical cases an appeal was given.  Therefore the argument is satisfactorily made in respect of precedent.  This Bill gives new and vastly more increased powers than the 1909 Act.  To say that the 1909 Act in equity covers this Act is, I do not think, fair or equitable.  I need hardly tell the Seanad of the additional powers which are given here.  There are powers of acquiring land compulsorily outside the Congested Districts.  I understand that the 1909 Act only gave power to acquire within the congested districts.  They also give power, the greatest power of all, to retain unpurchased tenants' holdings and parcel them out as they think fit.  Those are new and wide powers undoubtedly.  The Minister says that the 1909 Act applied all over.  That only affects my argument to an insignificant extent.  It did not give these wide powers of retention and resumption over unpurchased holdings.</P>
      <P>Those are new features and will involve very wide and important considerations. My argument is that those new powers, unprecedented on the Statute Book of this country must, in the essence of the thing, lead to doubtful interpretation. Here with enormous new powers we are not to allow an appeal beyond the Court of first instance and the Court of first instance is not, nominally anyhow, divorced from the Minister's responsibility.  The Senators can follow the case as well as I can.  It is a question of acquisition under new and very wide powers that have not existed probably in any statute in the world and surely in the interest of justice and fair play an appeal should at least lie higher than the Court of first instance.  The Minister is continually asking us to stand upon the report of other people, for instance the report of the Convention. Need I hardly say the responsibility is ours absolutely and, while it is interesting and may help us to our decision, we have to form our own judgment.</P>

    <P>On the vesting of any lands in the Land Commission under this Act, all sporting rights as defined in sub-section (2) of Section 13 of the Irish Land Act, 1903, including such sporting rights as may be superior interests, and all fisheries appurtenant to the said lands shall vest in the Land Commission subject to any lease then existing as if the owner or owners had agreed to sell them at such price as in the absence of agreement shall be fixed by the Land Commission (other than the Judicial Commissioner) or by the Judicial Commission on appeal from the Land Commission, regard being had in fixing such price to the fair value of the sporting rights and fisheries to the Land Commission and to the owner or owners respectively:</P>
    <P>Provided that in the case of tenanted land the sporting rights other than fishing rights and fisheries shall be deemed to be of no appreciable value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EarlofKerry" hpid="The EARL of KERRY The EARL of KERRY">

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 44, Sub-Section (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete in line 54 the words &ldquo;Provided that,&rdquo; and to add at the end of the Sub-Section the words: &ldquo;Where it can be shown that the sporting rights, other than fishing rights, on tenanted lands are of appreciable value, they may be vested in the Land Commission <Col N="2037" /> and dealt with in the same manner as is provided in respect to fishing rights and fisheries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I lay emphasis on the word &ldquo;or,&rdquo; because Senators will see it is assumed that no shooting rights on tenanted land are of appreciable value, and therefore, they should be made over without any consideration being given for them.  The sporting rights I am contemplating are not those which would interfere in any way with the tenant, that is to say, not in cultivated fields where the tenant might reasonably object to anyone trampling on his crops and doing damage.  The rights I am contemplating are those generally known as rough shooting on waste land and mountain.  Within my knowledge there are many such stretches of mountain which are included in tenanted land.  Some mountains, at all events, would not come under that definition, and the rights to them might be held to be quite separate from any connection with the tenanted land, and would remain with the owner. The ones I mean are where there are small farms with half a dozen fields of low-lying ground and a stretch of rough mountain pasture running up from those farms to the skyline.  It is quite true that in most cases of that kind the shooting would be of very small appreciable value, but nevertheless it is of value to those living on the spot, and would increase in value if the rights were retained by the State.</P>
    <P>What I suggest is that such rights where they can be shown to be of value should be treated in the same way as the fishing rights; that they should be taken over by the Land Commission who would then be in a position to deal with them, and could either let them to those who had exercised them in the past or to anyone else whom they might think fit.  If they were allowed to go with the land I maintain that nobody would be any the better for it after a short time. Every one who had got a gun would be out on his particular bit of land and would very soon destroy all the game on it.  From that point of view I think that a certain national asset, apart from the preservation of wild life, would be destroyed.  It is an advantage to a locality to have a certain amount of that ground, especially in the regions of the West, as it would tend to keep resident <Col N="2038" /> gentry in the district, which must be of some advantage to that district in the way of employment.  It would tend also to bring visitors to the district.</P>
    <P>I have in mind regions in the Co. Kerry where there are hotels which in the past have taken some of those areas of mountain, and where they have had people using those hotels during the winter months, when they would probably not be used otherwise, so that they might have plenty of fresh air and exercise and the excitement of pursuing animals, perhaps more or less visionary. All that I think is of great advantage to the district.  I do not think that it need be any liability to the State.  I have distinctly aimed at a permissive form &ldquo;may&rdquo; and not &ldquo;shall.&rdquo; It would be up to the owner of those rights to show that they were of some value. Naturally the State would not want to buy a pig in a poke.  They, I suppose, would say, &ldquo;What are you prepared to give for them.&rdquo; He might say, &ldquo;I am prepared to give you £5 or £10 or £20 a year,&rdquo; whatever it might be.  The Commissioners might be able to buy them from him and I apprehend they would give him only such a sum as would make it quite sure that the rental would fully compensate them, so that they would not be losers over the transaction.  The great point to my mind, apart from any individual enjoyment, is that if this is not done there may be large tracts of tenanted land without a bird on them. The grouse, woodcock and snipe would disappear and the country would be the poorer for that disappearance.</P>

      <P>This amendment does not refer to the fishing rights but only to sporting rights.  The fishing rights are reserved to the Land Commission. This is a rather difficult and a rather embittered question, and has attained an importance, both in regard to tenants and, perhaps, owners, that it hardly deserves.  For a long time this question of sporting rights has been a bone of contention in all sales under the 1903 and 1909 Acts.  We were faced with the position that it would be quite impossible <Col N="2039" /> to reserve sporting rights on tenanted land.  As Senator the Earl of Kerry has stated very fairly, the sporting rights on tenanted land are negligible as far as 80 per cent of the land is concerned and of very little value in the balance.  Knowing the value&mdash;the exaggerated value if you like&mdash;that both sides attach to these sporting rights I took great care to get all the advice I could, both from the landowners and the tenants point of view, before drafting the Section.  The information I got was that the sporting rights on tenanted land are of no appreciable value as far as 80 per cent. is concerned, and on the remaining 20 per cent. would, in all the circumstances, be of very little value.  I asked myself was it worth while for the sake of rights which are of very little value, and only apply to about 20 per cent. of the land, to put the whole question as an issue.  I decided it was not, on the advice of parties interested on both sides of the question.</P>
      <P>On the facts I think the Seanad will agree that it is not worth while raising the whole question.  If the amendment were carried it would mean that we would have to examine every holding to see what sporting rights are on it, to see whether any particular holding came within the 80 per cent.  We would then have an embittered wrangle on the question of what was the value of the sporting rights on the other 20 per cent.  It would be found in the end that they were worth practically nothing.  Whatever they would be worth, if they were reserved to the Land Commission the landowner would have to get a price and an advance would have to be made to the tenant in respect of that price.  Is it worth while to put the Land Commission to that trouble for the sake of that small percentage of holdings, and the very negligible sporting rights on the balance, to raise the whole question? You would raise an extremely important and embittered question.  I want to assure the Senator that I have taken the trouble to enquire from lawyers, who would know, and I am told that a mountain on which tenants have grazing rights is not tenanted land in practically any case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EarlofMayo" hpid="The EARL of MAYO The EARL of MAYO">
      <NameTxt>The EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>That mountain land, as a rule, is not part of the tenancy. Senator the Earl of Kerry explained what he meant, in a case where there is a little cottage at the bottom of the mountain, on which the tenant had a grazing right.  The particular wish of Senator the Earl of Kerry is similar to my own, I imagine.  Like myself he likes to be able to go out and amuse himself of an afternoon and shoot a few snipe or grouse in the particular district in which he lives.  I should like to do that in the same circumstances.  Senator the Earl of Kerry is not the only one who would like to do it in Kerry.  He adduced the case of the hotels that have very large tracts of mountain, the sporting rights on which attract visitors. This class of sport is an asset to the country and it brings a great many people who spend their money here. There is another aspect.  I agree with the Minister that in some cases it is a very delicate and disagreeable question to have to argue before the Dáil.  The fact remains, however, that if the tenants are allowed to wander over these tracts and bring dogs with them, it is not only a question of shooting, but the dogs eat the grouse eggs.  With regard to snipe and wild duck, I believe they can take care of themselves.  I know perfectly well that there were professional poachers even before the late <Col N="2041" /> trouble who made their living by shooting snipe and sending the game to the Dublin market.  Excellent shots they were!  I hope the Minister will consider this matter.  He said that eighty per cent. of the tenanted land of Ireland was out of the question with regard to sporting rights.  I agree but as to the twenty per cent. it must be remembered that Ireland is a country with a hollow in the middle, most of which is bog&mdash; the Bog of Allen, which is untenanted land.</P>

      <P>I had such an experience in Donegal.  I suggest to Senator the Earl of Kerry, that this matter can be arranged by mutual consent.  The fact cannot be got over that some people wander over this land with dreadful dogs that eat the grouse eggs.  I saw a whole moor in Donegal destroyed by them.  I used to put out poison for grey crows and it killed them. They used to take the chickens from the doors of the cabins of the peasantry of Donegal.  I will tell you a story of what happened one year.  A man came to me stating that his dog was poisoned. I asked him where was the dog.  He said &ldquo;I do not know but he is poisoned.&rdquo; He next came to the river where I was fishing and said, &ldquo;I found the dog.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;You are a nice fellow after telling me he was poisoned.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;well, the dog is dead.&rdquo; I told him he was a nice sort of fellow.  I had to pay him for the dog.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add after the Sub-Section a new Sub-Section (2) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  In disposing of any sporting rights which may be vested in them under the terms of this Act the Land Commission shall have due regard to the future preservation and development of such rights, and shall have power, where they consider that such object would be advanced by so doing, to let such rights to the former owner thereof.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is directed towards the fishing rights which Senators know are reserved by this Bill to the Land Commission.  The Bill does not state what procedure will then be adopted by the Land Commission.  It was in the hope of eliciting a statement from the Minister that I put down the amendment. I am not contemplating in this amendment the large rivers of Ireland; they are more or less able to look after themselves.  It is more difficult to interfere with the big river.  You may get an odd poacher on it but the fish cannot be exterminated.  What I have in mind is the little river, about ten or twelve miles long, in which there are about half-a-dozen pools.  When the water runs to a very low level the fish can be seen from the bank, and enterprising persons can get them all out of it in half an hour.  I am afraid the local population do not realise the habits of the salmon, and realise that if you kill salmon in a river you will probably have none at all there in three or four years.  Salmon are born in the river and stay there for two years.  Then they go to the sea for another two years, and come back fully grown.  If you kill salmon in little rivers the stock will soon disappear.  It was with a view to the importance of preserving fish in the future that I put down the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the Government could give some indication that they would let the fishery rights on these rivers to the former owner or some responsible person, that is some person who would be able to employ people to protect the fisheries and not let them go to ruin.  If that is not done you will very soon have all the fish in the rivers exterminated.  There might be a temptation on the part of the Land Commission to say &ldquo;The fishing rights are bought, why should not this poor <Col N="2043" /> fellow fish in that pool?&rdquo; If he were given permission to fish, the fear is that he would not only fish legitimately with rod and line, but that he would not resist getting out a net and perhaps put in a small charge of dynamite there, and take out the fish and in that way the whole fishery would be destroyed.  That is why I put down the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It was because we realized that the sporting rights and the fishing rights were valuable commercially, and valuable for letting them to people for sport, that we reserved them to the Land Commission.  You can divide both the sporting rights and the fishing rights into two.  Those are of commercial value.  I am almost certain that fishing rights will be handed over to the Fisheries Department.  As far as commercial fishing is concerned, it will be the business of that Department of State to look after the commercial fishing. With regard to the sporting side of both fishing and shooting, we realise that they are extremely valuable, that there is a big income to the State from them, and these small fisheries that are not of commercial value will be carefully preserved by the particular Department of State to which they are assigned.  These will be let to people who will take them.  As far as this portion is concerned the former land-owner is one of the most likely to become the purchaser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Bill as it stands, we have ample power to let it to him, or to any other person who is willing to pay rent for the sporting and fishing and shooting that will be carefully preserved and looked after.  There is another reason why we preserve those fishing rights and that is that rather it will have the effect that there will be no abuse of the fishing of the rivers adjoining the lands we have purchased, and hence no loss higher up stream or lower down stream on the river which runs through the owner's demesne.  From every point of view the right thing to do was to preserve the sporting and fishing to a State Department and that will prevent the constant abuse of the fishing rights in the demense.  We have got the power under the Bill to let these sporting rights.  The person who is most likely to take them and pay for them is the <Col N="2044" /> landowner and other people who have money to spare.</P>

      <P>The question is this&mdash; to-day we passed the Defence Force (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1923.  It is under that Bill in fact that all prisoners are held by the military for military offences.  We are not now talking of political offences.  It is under that Bill that all prisoners held by the military will be held in the future after a state of peace has been declared by the Courts to be now in existence, and a state of war at an end.  That Bill was passed this afternoon.  The Minister for Defence informs me that under Article 47 of the Constitution this Bill does not become law for a week.  Article 47 says &ldquo;not later than seven days from the date on which Bills have been passed or deemed to have been so passed,&rdquo; and they interpret that clause to mean that the Bill does not become law for seven days after it is passed.  I believe that is the state of affairs.  The result would be, if that is so, and I am told that is the decision of the Courts, that all military prisoners would have to be let out practically to-morrow morning.  Whoever drew Article 47 apparently anticipated that some such difficulty as that would arise.  So they put in these words: &ldquo;These provisions shall not apply to Money Bills or other such Bills as shall be declared by both Houses to <Col N="2045" /> be necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now I am informed by the Minister for Defence that the letting out of these military prisoners would be most dangerous to the peace of the realm.  I think with that information before us, that the Seanad would pass a resolution necessary to make this Act effective at once. The resolution that I have to bring before the Seanad is in these words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That it is hereby declared that the Bill entitled the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1923, which has this day been passed by this House is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace and safety and accordingly that the provisions of Article 47 of the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann shall not apply to that Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the whole question before us so far as the Minister for Defence has explained it to me.  I think it is now for the Seanad to endorse the statement of the Minister for Defence, and to enable him to take care of the peace of the realm in the way in which he wishes.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the motion.  This matter appears to be a matter of military discipline, and as Senator Jameson has said, the Minister for Defence is anxious to have himself quite square with the Constitution We are living under a new Constitution and we have not quite explored all its details.  In circumstances of stress and hurry, such as we have been legislating under, it is only natural that some small points like this may have been overlooked.

      <P>The position, as I gather it, is this: speaking from memory, under Section 47 of the Constitution, there is a provision that a Bill has to be passed, and ratified by the Governor-General in not less than seven days, and then the provision goes on to say that it will not come into operation until the seven days have expired, unless the Oireachtas passes a resolution <Col N="2046" /> certifying that in the interests of the public safety it is desirable it should come into force at once.  We passed to-day a Bill to enable the Government to maintain an Army for the next twelve months.  That Bill, though passed by us and passed by the Dáil, will not become law until the expiration of a certain number of days, unless both Houses pass a resolution in the words of the resolution proposed by Senator Jameson. The Army to-day would not be legally existing, nor would the military prisoners be in legal custody unless and until the resolution is passed.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is good enough that these things should be thrown at us like this.  We do not exactly know where we are.  We had before us to-day a Bill of some two hundred clauses dealing with the setting up of the Army and the regularising of the Army.  That was passed through without question.  Now, immediately following that, comes another question in connection with the Bill.  It is most unfair that we should be getting those things thrown at us in this manner without being given an opportunity of really understanding them.  If it was legal for the Army to hold prisoners up to to-day, before the Army Bill was passed, why would it not be legal to hold them until to-morrow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>Really it is the Defence Force (Temporary Provisions) Bill that gives them power to hold prisoners. The matter has arisen because of an interpretation of Article 47 by the Courts. That interpretation has been given to-day and it had not existed at the time the Bill was brought before the Seanad. The words of Article 47 are: &ldquo;Any Bill passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses may be suspended for a period of 90 days on a written demand of two-fifths of the members of Dáil Eireann or of a majority of the members of Seanad Eireann, presented to the President of the Executive Council not later than seven days from the day on which said Bill shall have been so passed, or shall be deemed to have been so passed.&rdquo; The Courts have held that should be interpreted that the Act cannot be a complete Act until those seven days have expired, and that interpretation <Col N="2047" /> of the Act was pronounced by the Court a short time ago.  That is the difficulty.  As Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde has said, &ldquo;We are in a great state of flux.&rdquo; and are acting under a considerable strain even as regards the Constitution.</P>
      <P>It is quite evident that the Minister for Defence did not know when he asked the Seanad to pass this Bill that it could be held up for seven days and that the only way he could get it made into effective law, if that decision was given, was to appeal to us to pass this resolution which is now before us.  That is the period of seven days we are now asking the Seanad to bridge.  It has admittedly been an oversight, but the situation that has now arisen is due to a decision of the Courts, which I do not think any of us could have foreseen.  Whether the Law Advisers of the Government ought to have seen it and given us this Bill seven days ago is another matter; anyhow they did not do it.  Now we are faced with the proposition that the Minister for Defence has told us that all military prisoners will have to be let out and that such a proceeding would be against the public safety and he asks us to pass this resolution.  As to who is responsible for asking us to do it in a hurry the Seanad need not worry about. The difficulties we have to meet are what we have to worry about.</P>

      <P>It is an extraordinary state of affairs that the Law advisers of the Government never contemplated a situation such as this arising, and that they did not make some arrangement to have this Defence Force Bill brought in before the second last day of the present Oireachtas.  The whole position is extremely irregular.  We have passed this Bill without considering it, and now we are asked to pass a special emergency motion.  To think that these things were not contemplated is inconceivable in these times, seeing that hostilities have ceased for such a length of time.  Surely it could have been anticipated that the Courts could not have upheld for any length of time that a state of war existed. <Col N="2048" /> That was a thing that any reasonable man could have anticipated.  I am going to vote against the resolution apart from the merits of the case, principally because of the way the Oireachtas has been treated in this matter.</P>

If the Courts, which are the custodians of the liberty of the people, have decided on a certain thing, in order to violate that decision of the Court you can run to this House and get a resolution passed to upset it.  By doing that you are doing a dangerous thing.  It may be right in this case, but remember you are setting up a dangerous precedent.  The Judges are there to interpret the law.  They come to a certain decision, and if all you have to do is to come here or to another House and pass a resolution upsetting that decision, you are creating a very uncertain state of affairs in the country.  For that reason I am compelled to oppose the resolution.</P>

      <P>At this stage I want to get an amendment which perhaps some Senator will kindly move.  I will explain it first.  Senator Linehan has an amendment bearing on this.  It reads in Section 50 after the word &ldquo;they&rdquo; in line 32 to insert the words &ldquo;provided that the Land Commission is satisfied with the security.&rdquo; That really comes in Section 47.  The position in 1920 was that a considerable amount of land was bought throughout the country by groups of men.  The Land Bank was constituted by the first Dáil and it stepped in and advanced money for the purchase of these lands.  They made the advances to the purchasers who are usually congests or landless men in the neighbourhood and who would not have the money in any event.  The scheme was something like this.  The Land Bank <Col N="2050" /> agreed with those men that they would form a co-operative farming society and an assignment of the land was made to the estate and the purchase money was advanced by the Land Bank and paid to the vendors.  The Bank took a mortgage on the land for the full amount of the purchase money repayable for interest and sinking fund on the following terms&mdash;6 per cent. for the first 6 years, 7 per cent. for 7 years and 5 per cent. for 13 years.  These were the terms and the mortgage was the full amount of the advance including costs.</P>
      <P>Naturally that may have been all right in 1919 and 1920, but the rent made up to 6 or 7 per cent. is not at present a very attractive proposition and some of these estates are in very serious difficulty.  The Bank was constituted by the first Dáil and the liability is to a certain extent the liability of the present Dáil as the heirs and successors of the first Dáil.  In any case we acknowledge that the scheme was directly the result of the people who were in authority in the first Dáil and we acknowledge their liability and further we are interested in the prosperity of these estates some of which are doing splendidly.  We think the time has come when some Government Department should take over the concerns and put them on a proper foundation and we have availed of this Act to do it.  We propose to hand over the estates to the Land Commission and that the Land Commission shall pay off the outstanding advances together with costs and head rents and so forth to the land bank.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>They will get back what money they advanced in bonds and we will make advances ourselves to the estates at 4½ per cent. for interest and 5 per cent. for sinking fund.  That will give them a chance to go ahead.  Instead of paying an annuity of 6 per cent. they will only be paying 4½ per cent. and we also propose to pay a contribution of one-tenth.  That will give them a chance to go ahead.  Instead of paying an annuity consisting of 6 or 7 per cent. they will be paying only 4½ per cent. We propose to pay a contribution of one-tenth. By cutting down the interest from 7 per cent. to 4½ per cent. and by <Col N="2051" /> only charging that interest on the advance minus one-tenth they will be getting a reduction of between 30 and 40 per cent. and will thus have a chance of getting on their legs.  70 or 80 per cent. of the estates are doing well and we believe that the others will do well also when they get the reduction but in any case we regard it as our duty to relieve them and if they do not get on we will have to reconsider the position.  I was proposing to ask Senator Linehan in these circumstances to withdraw his amendment and to meet his point I want to get in his new condition.  I told you that we were advancing the whole of the mortgage but the Land Bank compelled the Estates to deposit one-fourth of the purchase money with them on deposit receipt and they had in a great many cases to go to some other bank for the money.  In order to make sure that we will have a fair security we want to ensure that the Land Commission if necessary will be able to take over that one-fourth and redeem a certain amount of the mortgage with it. That will not affect the Societies very much because they have not the money already.  The one-fourth is on deposit receipt with the Land Bank and if we take it and pay off portion of the advance the mortgage will be for a smaller amount and they will be paying only 4½ per cent.  I want to suggest the following amendment to Section 50:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete in line 15 the words &lsquo;when the bank shall have satisfied the Land Commission that they have repaid to the Society or body of trustees such deposit as aforesaid&rsquo; and substitute therefor the words &lsquo;when the bank shall have lodged with the Land Commission such deposit as aforesaid.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 50.  To add after this Section a new Section 51 as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The deposit when lodged with the land Commission shall be invested by them, and the income from such investments, so far as are not required to recoup the Land Commission for unpaid instalments of purchase annuities (if any) in respect of the advance made to the Society or body of trustees under this part of the Act, by whom the deposit was originally made with the bank, shall be <Col N="2052" /> paid to such Society or body of trustees until the deposit is utilised otherwise by the Land Commission or repaid in whole or in part to the Society or body of trustees under the following provisions, namely:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>(a)</i>  It shall be lawful for the Land Commission at any time before the advance is certified to be repaid, if they are not satisfied with the security for the same, or if the purchase annuities have been allowed to fall into arrear, to utilise the whole or part of the deposit in redemption <i>pro tanto</i> of the advance.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b)</i>  It shall be lawful for the Land Commission at any time, if they are satisfied that the deposit is not required as security for the advance to repay the whole or any part thereof to the Society or body of trustees who originally lodged the same with the bank or to their lawful successors.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(c)</i>  Such part of the deposit as shall not have been utilised under the foregoing paragraphs shall, when so much of the advance as is equivalent to the value of the deposit remaining with the Land Commission shall be certified to have been repaid, and provided that the Land Commission are satisfied with the security for the undeemed portion of the advance, be repaid to the Society or body of trustees who originally lodged the same with the bank or to their lawful successors.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That I think meets the case so far as we can meet it, and if we find afterwards that these estates have not got on their feet we will have to review the position but I am satisfied that the few remaining estates will be put on their feet.</P>

I would like to ask whether the Government would be prepared to extend to other banks the same privileges as they have now brought in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that money paid by the Land Bank to these estates was money given by the previous Government which now belongs to the present Government and the bank is simply acting as their agents in what was the Republican Bond scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

      <NameTxt>Mr. GUINNESS</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked you whether the result of this will not be that the Land Bank as such will become a holding company holding land bonds only.  I think the operations of the bank have been confined to advances of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>No; that is not the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Bank which I had nothing to do with at the <Col N="2054" /> time it was originated was really connected with the Republican Dáil's Land Scheme to enable them to deal with certain landless men in the way which has been pretty clearly explained by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Dáil then advanced money and any action taken by the National Land Bank was done under their guidance.  In a speech made early in the present Dáil by the Minister for Finance he undertook all the liability of the previous Dáil, including the liabilities with regard to the National Land Bank.  If this is passed the position of the Land Bank will be, if I understand this correctly, that they would continue just as they are, except that the land purchase portion of their business&mdash;which I need hardly tell the Seanad is not a paying one and is of no value to them&mdash;would cease and that they would hold bonds instead.  The Government control would be exactly the same, because there are no shares except shares which are the property of the Government.  There are no private shares in the Bank and, therefore, it is entirely Government property. If this were not passed you would have persons who went in under the Republican Dáil Land scheme in a worse position than persons who come in now and the political effect of that would be extremely bad.  Both purchases were made with Government money and you would have people who went in then saying, &ldquo;We are in a worse position and you are not standing by us.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The second question is, whether we would do the same for other banks who have lent money to societies. I am surprised to hear that other banks would like to have that done, that they would prefer to get their money in bonds. I would have thought that the Bank of Ireland, the Munster and Leinster, and others, would not relish such a position if they did advance money to societies, and that they would take the advances made on mortgages in bonds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>The State is going to advance that money and it will have to be borne on some account and we will have to get it out of taxation.  As you say in 80 per cent. of cases they are getting good value.  You are asking the Seanad to agree to this 10 per cent. being advanced by the State.  What is going to happen in the 20 per cent. of cases that, apparently, you have not very much hope of being very successful? Will that be a further loss to the State and what will it amount to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think it necessary to refer to the 10 per cent. contribution because the Sections were there setting out that we were giving this 10 per cent. contribution to the owners of these lands, the same as we were giving in regard to the price of tenanted land. There was no amendment to these sections; otherwise I would have explained the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I did not say anything about the 10 per cent. in reference to this amendment is because the scheme was already in the Bill.  It was set out there that we were doing what Senator Douglas has explained&mdash; doing the same thing for these freeholders, who owned this land subject to a mortgage to the Land Bank, as we were doing for the tenants now purchasing, <Col N="2056" /> namely, giving money at 4½ per cent. and paying 10 per cent. of the purchase money.  No one had any amendment down saying that we should not give the 10 per cent. and I did not think it was contentious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean that it was contentious.  I am trying to see where the State comes in.  It looks as if we are extending to a set of individuals, who would not otherwise come under the Bill, the benefits of the Bill, and they are getting, as you say, the same as anybody else.  There is this other point.  Probably as far as 80 per cent. go they will succeed and there will be no further trouble, but what about the 20 per cent.?  If they fail what further loss will there be to the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We are, of course, extending to these people the same privileges as we are giving the tenant purchasers under the Bill.  We say they are entitled to it for the good reason that Senator Douglas set out.  These are people who purchased land under the old Republican Government scheme. We acknowledge fully liability to them and we are prepared, in circumstances when we have a little more money&mdash; though I do not know how much more&mdash; to give them all the benefits that the tenant purchasers get under this Bill. In regard to Senator Jameson's question about the other 20 per cent. what I stated was that 80 per cent. of the societies, notwithstanding that they are paying such a high rate of interest, are doing well&mdash;perhaps not 80 per cent. but a very large percentage.  The balance, of course, are finding it hard to make ends meet and pay 6 per cent. or 7 per cent. on the money.  We are doing a great thing for them by giving them money at 4½ per cent. and we have every hope that they will succeed with that.  I suppose some of them would fail.  If they do fail we have provisions in the Bill.  Section 52 (2) says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the Land Commission are not satisfied that the foregoing conditions have been fulfilled, and so declare in the prescribed manner, then the interest of the Society or body of Trustees in the lands shall absolutely cease and determine, and the lands shall be retained by the Land Commission, as if they had been untenanted <Col N="2057" /> lands vested in the Land Commission under the provisions of Part II. of this Act.</P>

If the Land Commission so certify the price shall be ascertained as if the land was tenanted land, but if the Land Commission do not so certify the price shall be ascertained as if the land was untenanted land.</P>

To add at the end of the Section the following: &ldquo;Provided always that any regulations made to carry out the provisions of this Act, in so far as they concern the relief of congestion, shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and if either House shall, within 21 days of such regulations being tabled, pass a Resolution annulling such regulations, such regulations shall be annulled; but such annulments shall not prejudice or invalidate any matter or thing previously done under such regulations.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to argue this at great length.  The purpose is to protect a citizen against arbitrary action on the part of the Executive or its Department.  If my amendment is accepted I admit it will have to be amended.  It would cover all the regulations and orders made under this Bill.  The principle is there in my amendment and it has been accepted in the case of the Compensation Bill, anyhow with regard to the terms on which securities are issued, and it has been accepted with regard to the Civil Service Commission Bill.  These regulations, some of which are very little different to law although made in the ordinary Executive shall be under the control of the Parliament itself.  Before these things can come into operation the Oireachtas can see what they are and have an opportunity of voiding or annulling them if they think fit.  I sometimes think by the attitude of some Senators here that they consider that in <Col N="2063" /> trying to protect the public, I am seeking for protection for a particular class. That is not so.  Surely the Oireachtas cannot take any exclusive view of the matter.  It is most important in a properly governed country and under a Constitutional Government to scrutinise with great care the action of the Executive. I know recently in Britain which, whatever we may think of it, has a very long experience in Parliamentary Government, this provision which delegates power to the Cabinet to legislate by order in Council is most carefully safeguarded by Parliament and only allowed to be used in cases of great emergency.  I do not think that anybody can say that the provisions of the Land Bill are cases of great emergency. I would ask the Minister whether he could not go some distance to meet the principles asked for in this amendment.</P>

These are the sort of regulations that the Land Commission make and there are hundreds of them.  To be candid, I have not a very clear conception of what these are.  I will consider that.  It arises along with the question of congests, on which I will have to make a statement to-morrow.</P>

      <P>There is in most public Acts a general provision of this kind.  I do not mean to say it covers domestic regulations but broad rules or orders for the purpose of carrying out the provisions.

      <P>If the Minister <Col N="2064" /> and the Seanad will turn to the Second Schedule, and under the head of Short Title he will find the words &ldquo;Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1906.&rdquo; This Bill before us proposes to repeal part of Section 19 of that Act from the words &ldquo;provided that&rdquo; to the end of the Section. I have the Labourers Act of 1906 before me, and the clause which I am alluding to is 19.  I wish to read that Clause because I must make it quite clear what has happened in repealing this.  &ldquo;An advance under Section 2 of the Irish Land Act, 1903, may be made for the purchase of a parcel of land comprising any estate for an agricultural labourer who has for a period of not less than five years immediately preceding the date of the advance resided in the estate or in the neighbourhood thereof, provided that any pre-existing tenancy under the Labourers Acts of the applicant for an advance shall be determined before the advance is made and that the applicant has paid all rent due by him in respect of this tenancy.&rdquo; That is to be wiped out by this Act.  A man may not have paid his rent.  Let us see what is the effect of this?  This is an encroachment upon the occupier and the landowner of an unknown quantity.  The real truth of it is to make what is called an economic holding.  The Labourers Act gives him a half-an-acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

    <Speaker pid="EarlofMayo" hpid="The EARL of MAYO The EARL of MAYO">
      <NameTxt>The EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well an acre, and this is the power that exists in this Bill to really take as much land as is wanted to make that labourer a farmer with much more land than what is commonly called an economic holding. I only wish to interpret the schedule as I find it and nothing more whatsoever. I do not think I need develop the argument any longer because that has practically the effect of repealing this Section of the Labourers Act of 1906.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter that I would like to have the opinion of the Seanad on and I would like to hear some utterance from the Labour Benches on it.  Really there is a lot to be said for both sides.  Previously when the Land Commission bought an estate they occasionally had land they would not want for the relief of congestion, and they would make an advance to <Col N="2065" /> labourers.  I am now speaking of purchases under previous Acts, the 1909 Act for example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EarlofMayo" hpid="The EARL of MAYO The EARL of MAYO">
      <NameTxt>The EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>That did not repeal the Labourers Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say it did. Under the 1909 Act the Land Commission might have bought an estate, and having some land over they would make an advance to a labourer who occupied a labourer's cottage on the estate, with its plot attached.  If they made an advance to a labourer under such circumstances the following proviso applied: &ldquo;provided any pre-existing tenancy under the Labourers Act of the applicant for the advance shall be determined before the advance is made and that the applicant has paid all rents due by him in respect of such tenancy.&rdquo; That means that if they proposed to make the advance he had to give up the labourer's cottage.  The idea that we are proposing is that if we had land we should make the labourer an advance and there should be no statutory reason why he should leave his cottage.  That proposal may be sound or unsound.  In the past what happened was that the labourer assigned the cottage to his wife and she became the tenant.  Then he got his advance. He could assign the cottage to either his wife or someone else in the family.  There was never a case I believe where an advance of land was made to a labourer by law in which he had to leave the cottage.  What he always did, I am told, was that he assigned the cottage to his wife, sister or brother, and remained there and kept any land advanced to him as well.  That is not a good proceeding.  It will always happen while this provision is there and it is with a view to preventing anything of the sort that we propose to repeal it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a big question as to whether the labourer should not go out and whether this Section should not stand and whether a genuine labourer should not come in.  There is a lot to be said on both sides, even from the labour point of view.  The Land Commission thought that the result of the operations of the previous Acts under this Section was fraud.  We might as well do the thing decently, and when we make an advance of land to a labourer we should not put him to the usual plan of making <Col N="2066" /> the cottage over to his wife or to anyone else in the house.  The Seanad is the best judge of the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EarlofMayo" hpid="The EARL of MAYO The EARL of MAYO">
      <NameTxt>The EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>At last I have got the real gist of this question.  Supposing a man has not paid his rent, who has to suffer for that?  Why, the ratepayers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If Section 19 is allowed to remain as it is and if the labourer gets the advance, then we cannot make that advance until he leaves the labourer's cottage and pays his rent to date, in case he happens to be in arrear. If we take out this proviso we can make him an advance and he can still remain in the cottage, and if he does happen to owe rent he has better security for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to argue it out to the the end with the Minister. This is a rather big question. Notwithstanding what the Minister says, I say as a practical person that if the labourer has not paid his rent he has the power not only to stay in the cottage and get an advance but he has power also to get a great deal more land and become, not only what is called an economic tenant, but as far as I can see, he can get practically as much land as he wants.  I want that contradicted flatly.</P>

      <P>The Senator has come to the conclusion that we wish to repeal this proviso, and that the effect of repealing this proviso was to give a chance to the labourer who has not paid his rent to trick the District Council.  Now that is not so.  Even if we repeal this proviso the Rural Council has all its legal power to enforce payment of the rent.  We do <Col N="2067" /> not take this away.  What we do is if we happen under the Section to give him more land he will have more cattle on it, and if the Rural Council come to execute their decree they will, perhaps, find a good yearling on it.  We are doing that because we did not think it right to be parties to the fraud that was going on where the labourer would give the cottage to his wife.</P>
