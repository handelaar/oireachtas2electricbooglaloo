      <P>I wish to explain to the Seanad that, through no fault of mine, and, apparently, through no fault of anybody, the Finance Bill, which I had thought would have been ripe for Second Reading to-day, is not available.  Some fresh amendments were inserted in the Bill in the Dáil yesterday, with the result that the Final Stage had to be postponed until to-morrow.  Consequently, it will not be available for discussion to-day, but will be available on Wednesday next.  I make this explanation because some members of the Seanad have purposely attended this sitting, and waited over until to-day in the belief that this Bill would be available for discussion, but, in the circumstances, it is impossible that it should be so.</P>

      <P>On reading the reports this morning of the discussion here yesterday, I find that some figures which I gave here yesterday were mixed up in the Press reports, and as I think it well that the general public should understand the financial aspects, from the State point of view of this Bill, I would like permission to re-quote these figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I do not wish to provoke any discussion.  I was simply quoting <Col N="1138" /> figures as given to us by the Minister at the last sitting.  He said that over and above all contributions made by employers and employees Unemployment Insurance is costing the State £250,000 per annum, in addition to £100,000 for administration, and that the contributions for the employers and employees amounted to £35,000 per month, which would amount to £420,000 per annum. Yesterday in quoting those figures I said that roughly to arrive at the contribution by the employees that you might divide that £420,000 by 2, as half would be contributed by the employees, and the other half by the employers.  That would leave the figures to stand in this way: that the total cost to the State of Unemployment Insurance, together with administration, amounts to nearly £800,000 per annum, and that of this total amount the employees or workers contribute about £200,000 per annum, so that, from the point of view of insurance, for every £ they contribute they are getting back £3 along with it.</P>

      <P>In view of the statement of Senator Kenny that I had stated the Unemployment Insurance Fund was to cost the State £250,000 per annum, I think the Senator probably misunderstood what I did say.  I stated that in the present Bill we have to borrow £250,000 from the Central Fund.  It does not follow that Unemployment Insurance is going to cost the State £250,000, because that money must be paid back when the Unemployment Fund shall come into credit again. That will only be a loan from the Central Fund.  I may also point out in connection with the same matter that if some of the corporate bodies who owe the Fund between £50,000 and £60,000 had honoured their obligations to the Fund we would not need to borrow quite such a large sum as £250,000 from the Central Fund, but something under £200,000. Moreover, the Senator points out that this Unemployment Insurance&mdash;on the figures which he has made out and which I do not accept&mdash;is costing the State £800,000.  The Senator will recollect that up to the present the times have been abnormal, but in normal times the Unemployment Insurance Fund did not cost the State anything like that amount. The £550,000 which we have already <Col N="1139" /> borrowed from the Central Fund, plus the £250,000 which we purpose to borrow under this Bill, must be paid back to the Central Fund when the Unemployment Insurance Fund again comes into credit. It is hardly fair, it is hardly correct, that the public should assume from the Senator's remarks that Unemployment Insurance Benefit is costing £800,000 per year.  It is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.S. GUINNESS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in a little difficulty about a matter, as I gave the President notice of a question I wanted to put to him, which he was quite prepared to answer, but he left the Seanad before I had an opportunity of doing so.  It was in connection with the Oireachtas (Payment of Members) Bill, as to whether the allowances, or payments, as they are described, are or are not assessable to Income Tax and Super-tax. The question was raised in the Dáil but the answer given was not satisfactory, and was to the intent that the payments would not be assessable to Income Tax. The Minister for Finance, when I spoke to him about it yesterday, seemed uncertain, and he asked me to put the question to him across the floor of the Seanad and that he would be able to give a definite reply.  As that reply is not forthcoming, I do not know if I am in order in moving an amendment, or, rather, a recommendation that payments or allowances for expenses of members shall be free from and shall not be assessable to Income Tax and Super tax. The amount involved is not very large, but quite a good many members here, in fact I think everybody, knows that when Income Tax returns come to be investigated by the Inspector of Taxes all sorts of questions, microscopic and otherwise, are put to the individual.  If in this particular <Col N="1140" /> instance that could be avoided by a resolution of the Dáil, which would definitely fix the matter for all time, I think it would be an advantage.  If I am in order I would like to move that in the case of the Payment of Members Bill these payments should not be assessable to Income Tax or Super-tax.</P>

      <P>I do not like to commit myself to any definite proposition on the subject, but it occurs to me that, unless otherwise provided in the Bill, these payments would have to be taken into account for the purpose of Income Tax and Super-tax.  I have asked the Clerk of the Seanad to try and get into communication with the President, so that we may have a statement from him, if only across the telephone, as to what the exact position is in the view of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been debated at some length in the House of Commons, where the law determining the matter and the Statute governing this Bill are the same as the law here at the present.  It was clearly laid down in the House of Commons that these are allowances assessable under Schedule D., that the function of the work of the Legislature is an occupation, and that a member is allowed to set off against that an amount to pay expenses. It was accepted by the Income Tax authorities that the expenses more than cover the amount paid, and it was ruled that the payments would not be assessable for Income Tax.  If that rule is there under similar laws to those that are now current in the Free State, it seems unnecessary and somewhat undesirable to make special and specific provision in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I understand from a communication now received <Col N="1141" /> from the President that the view taken by the Government is precisely in accordance with what has been stated by Senator Sir John Keane.  In other words, that these allowances, being for expenses, are not on that ground assessable either for the purpose of Income Tax or Super-tax.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the motive underlying Senator McKean's proposal is.  I would like to point out that, as far as I know, the people engaged in the film business are as anxious to have this Bill passed as anyone else.  They are most anxious that the censoring should be done in a proper way, because it will relieve them of a good deal of responsibility.  When the Bill was before us yesterday it was stated that objection had been raised to a film that had been passed by the casting vote of a priest.  If a clergyman is not a judge of what is proper and right, I do not know where we lay people come in. I would not put myself up against a clergyman, anyway.</P>

I hope that we will never have a Minister for Home Affairs who would appoint people interested in the production of films, or in having certain films, perhaps, refused the right of production because of such persons' interest in other firms, if they should ever be appointed members of this Board; but of course, it is not a proviso that anybody would object to, and I think that I could accept it.

He is the judge so far as he is concerned, and it really does not matter much as to what the interests, say, of his clerk might be. I think the same thing applies in the case of the Appeal Board.  It is the Board will give the decision, and if there is a clerk or, say, a charwoman in the office who would be interested in pictures it would not matter.</P>

      <P>Clause 7, paragraph between sub-sections 4 and 5.  I wish to move: &ldquo;That children or young persons under the age of 16 years shall not be admitted to any cinema theatre unless in a body from the school and under the supervision of their teachers.&rdquo;  We all know the far-reaching importance of the cinema houses and of the influence they have on the morals of the nation.  Some years ago in the North side of Dublin a series of robberies were committed, and it was discovered in all cases that in the houses that had been entered it was the gas meters that were tampered with, and that it was solely and entirely out of the gas meters and gas stoves that the money had been taken.  When the police of the district went into the matter they found that a body of young boys from the ages of 10 to 14 were raiding houses, and when they went into the houses they simply raided the gas meters, and it was found out afterwards that the reason for doing this was that they wanted to go to the cinema houses.  We know the influence of the cinema houses, and we find that on the films the &ldquo;penny dreadful&rdquo; is put on in a realistic form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKEAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I will put it in as a new clause.  I think that when there is an Appeal Board the important thing <Col N="1147" /> is to look after the morals of young people.  They will be the people of Ireland in the next generation, and if we do not look after their morals and if we sanction anything that is contaminating to them it will reflect on us.  I think that this recommendation I am now moving will help to take away that class of thing. The young people should be protected. Enter these cinema houses, and you will see the penny dreadful put before them. We know that the present is a very materialistic age, and the cinema house is a sort of propaganda for materialism of a certain kind.  It is an appeal to the senses and not an appeal at all to the judgment. Everything is put before you there dealing with the senses.  I think that is a very bad idea, and that what we ought to do is to try and protect young people from that class of thing.  I believe that a lot of the Irregularism and trouble we have had in Ireland could be traced, and is directly attributable, to the cinema houses, and there would have been far less trouble in Ireland at present and during the last year or so if it were not for the realistic productions put before the youth of the country.  They, taking advantage of what was put before them, put into practice what they saw on the films.</P>
      <P>My desire is to protect the youth of the country from such influences.  The recommendation which I propose has been adopted in other countries.  In Bavaria young people under 18 years of age are not allowed into cinema houses, and in certain of the States in America young people under 16 years of age are precluded from going into these places. In my recommendation I make an exception. I suggest that when children go to cinema houses they should be in charge of their teachers, and that the superintendents of the schools should have power to decide whether the films to be exhibited are fit for the young people to see, and that, having decided that the films are fit to be seen, they would take charge of the children and go with them to the cinema houses.</P>

      <P>A terrible responsibility has been thrust upon me.  I merely rose to say that I thought I could comfort the mind of the Senator who proposed this amendment.  Artists and writers for a very long time have been troubled at intervals by their work.  I remember John Synge and myself both being considerably troubled when a man, who had drowned himself in the Liffey, was taken from the river.  He had in his pocket a copy of Synge's play, &ldquo;Riders to the Sea,&rdquo; which, you may remember, dealt with a drowned man.  We know, of course, that Goethe was greatly troubled when a man was taken from the river, having drowned himself.  The man had in his pocket a copy of &ldquo;Werther,&rdquo; which is also about a man who had drowned himself.  It has again and again cropped up in the world that the arts do appeal to our imitative faculties. We comfort ourselves in the way Goethe comforted himself, that there must have been other men saved from suicide by having read &ldquo;Werther.&rdquo;  We see only the evil effect, greatly exaggerated in the papers, of these rather inferior forms of art which we are now discussing, but we have no means of reducing to statistics their other effects.  I think you can leave the arts, superior or inferior, to the general conscience of mankind.</P>

      <P>Would I be in order in proposing a small amendment? It is just a few words to Sub-section 3 of Section 7.  The amendment was suggested to me by a film which I saw the other day in England.  It strikes me a great many films at the present day are devoted entirely to propaganda&mdash;propaganda that may be very useful in one country and very injurious in another.  In my opinion, it would be absolutely fatal to show such a film in this country.  The amendment I propose is to add after the words &ldquo;public morality,&rdquo; on the last line of Sub-section 3, the following: &ldquo;or otherwise undesirable in the public interest.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I suggest that we should be very careful before we sanction such wide powers to a Censor as are proposed by Senator Barrington.  I understand what he is driving at, and I think it is quite conceivable that there might be films which in the public interest it would not be desirable to show.  I should be extremely unwilling to set up any Censor, or any Film Board, which would have such complete powers as to censor anything simply on the ground that they thought it was not in the public interest. I am sure there are members of the Seanad who hold political opinions which I think are not in the public interest, but I do not think I should have the right to censor them.  If you are going to give as wide a scope as is suggested under this amendment, then I think it would be much better not to have the Censor at all.</P>

      <P>The question now is that this Bill do pass, and on this I might mention that upon this stage of the Bill verbal amendments can be made, and the Minister in charge of the Bill has suggested to me that he would like to have an amendment that <Col N="1150" /> would, perhaps, have the effect of making the meaning of Senator McKean's amendment clearer, though slightly altering it in form.  What he suggests does not interfere with the substance in any way, but rather helps to develop the object the Senator has in view.  With this amendment it would read: &ldquo;No person having stock or shares, or being financially interested in any company having for its object the exhibition or production of moving pictures, shall be eligible for membership of this Board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister now asks the Seanad to amend that by putting in these words having this object: &ldquo;The exhibition of pictures by means of cinematograph or similar apparatus, or production of pictures capable of being so exhibited.&rdquo; This only makes the meaning plainer, and probably the House will approve of the amendment.</P>

      <P>We have now come to the end of the Orders of the Day on the Paper.  With regard to the question of the Finance Bill, in which so many members of the Seanad are interested, I want to consult their convenience in every possible way, having regard to the disappointments that have taken place this week.  The way the <Col N="1152" /> matter stands is this.  I believe it is now definitely settled that the Bill will pass through its final stages to-morrow in the other House.  It will not, therefore, be available to be put into their hands, or to reach Senators of this House, at the earliest before Tuesday, but they can receive a print of the Bill to-morrow in its present stage, which, for all practical purposes, will be the same as the ultimate print.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it may be the opinion of the Seanad that they will be able to deal with the principles generally on Wednesday. If that is the wish of the Seanad I will have it placed on the Order Paper for the Second Reading Stage on Wednesday. Senators will bear in mind, however, that they probably will not have a full print of the Bill in its perfect form before Tuesday evening at the earliest, but they will get to-morrow substantially copies of the Bill as it will ultimately pass the Dáil.</P>
