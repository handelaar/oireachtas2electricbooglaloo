      <P>I have received a request from Senator Moore that we should resume the discussion adjourned from yesterday on his motion, and that we should do so before taking the ordinary business on the Orders of the Day.  That could be done by agreement, and if there is general consent I should be prepared to do that.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>I am thankful to those Senators who yesterday suggested an adjournment on this motion, because it is always a good thing to think over these matters.  This is an important question, and a night's thought enables one to adjust matters.  I have spoken this morning to a few Senators and we have made a slight alteration in the motion which, I think, will now be more agreeable to everybody.  As far as we could gather the motion is now in accordance with the views of Senators who made suggestions yesterday.  The motion itself will stand as it did, but there is a prefix to it which is different from the affix which was to it originally. The motion will now read:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Government be requestéd to re-open with the British Government the question of the release or handing over to the Irish Government of Joseph Dowling, an ex-private of the Connaught Rangers, agreeably to the following resolution:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;That in the opinion of the Seanad the British Government should release or hand over to the Irish Government Joseph Dowling, an ex-private of the Connaught Rangers, of Irish nationality, arrested in Ireland, who is at present undergoing a life sentence of penal servitude in England in respect of an offence, political or quasi-political, committed prior to the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and that in <Col N="1370" /> passing this Resolution, the Seanad has in mind (1) the International and Constitutional aspect of the case, and (2) the adverse effect on the harmonious relations between Ireland and Great Britain produced by the continued retention of this prisoner.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senators know that there is no disagreement with our Government and that our effort in this matter is only to strengthen their hands.  They have done the best they could up to now and it is for the Seanad to do what it can.  We hope that the Dáil will do the same.  I beg to move the Resolution.</P>

      <P>I beg to support the motion which is now before us.  I think it was the intention of the Seanad yesterday that we should ask the Government to take action in the matter.  We were all perfectly satisfied that they had done so already.  but we felt that it was incumbent upon us to ask them to go a little further, and if it has been turned down to have it reopened, and to have a case which stands between England and us, and which does not make for harmony, perfectly adjusted.  There is no necessity to labour the question of Dowling's innocence or guilt, but we feel, as it was put by Senator Sir Bryan Mahon, that England has made a great case out of this.  At the time of Dowling's arrest there was a great scare about a German plot, and Dowling was glorified into a prisoner in the Tower, and so on.  England does not wish now to go back on that.  We feel that England must go back on that, and that if she does not go back on it, the relations between England and Ireland will be strained.  For that reason I think that resolution should be passed and the Government <Col N="1371" /> urged to have this matter reconsidered.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKEAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In yesterday's debate Senator Moore and other Senators made a most convincing and irresistible case for the release of this man Dowling, and that the British Government, in face of these facts which must be known to them, have not released this man appears incomprehensible. They have released men of more ability, men who have capacity for doing more serious injury to British interests.  Yet they keep in prison this poor illiterate man who has already served a long sentence.  I understand that our Government have already brought this case very strongly before the British authorities.  Yet the British authorities seem not to have taken any action in the matter such as they were requested to do. At the inception of the Free State the Government introduced an Amnesty Bill, a most generous Bill, that was intended to blot out all the bitter memories of the past, and it was expected that the British Government, on their side, would reciprocate and release all the prisoners as had been done in the case of the Free State.  It seems that they are pursuing this man Dowling in some spirit of vindictiveness, and I assume that Senator Moore has brought this motion before the Seanad as a sort of forlorn hope, that through their intervention something will eventually be done.  The case of Dowling is one that, I think, opens up a much larger issue.  If the British Government is induced by this motion to release this man, I think that that could be put before the Northern Government as an object lesson to them of clemency which they could extend to the prisoners who are in their jails.  At present there are great numbers of prisoners in Northern gaols.  There are three men in Derry gaol who, it is considered, were arrested contrary to the terms of the Truce, and no inducement seems to be able to get the Northern Government to release them. Dowling's case is, I think, relevant to their cases.  If the British Government shows clemency in his case it would be natural to expect that the Northern Government could be prevailed on in the same way to show clemency in the case of these three men.  There are also internees on board the Argenta, suffering great hard ship.  They were brought away from their <Col N="1372" /> homes, their business had been dislocated, and their dependants are in a state of hardship.  I think there again our Government should bring before the Northern Government the necessity of giving these men trial or else releasing them at once. We are told that there is peace in the Northern province.  It is a peace based on terror, intimidation and the torpor of despair.  It is not a genuine peace.  I think the release of the men who are now in Northern gaols and on board the Argenta would not in any way be detrimental to the future peace of the Six Counties.  I hope this motion will be passed unanimously by the Seanad and that it will have the desired effect on the British Government.</P>

The point I wish to raise is, without going into the merits or demerits of Dowling's case, that I think the form the resolution takes is one that is unconstitutional and out of order.  I read here, &ldquo;that the Government be requested to forward this resolution to the British Government.&rdquo; It is on that point I raise the matter.</P>

      <P>May I point out that before Senator Guinness arrived Senator Colonel Moore gave me to understand that there was more or less an agreed alteration of the motion on lines discussed yesterday.  I put that to the Seanad, and in order to meet Senator Moore I asked if Senators would be willing to take it at the commencement of the business.  The Seanad then gave Senator Moore leave to withdraw yesterday's motion. He is now moving another motion of which Senator Guinness has now received a copy.  It is in substance the same resolution as the one we had yesterday, except that the paragraph at the end is deleted, and a somewhat similar paragraph is placed at the commencement. I think I ought to add that if it is the desire of the Seanad to debate this matter at some length, as they are entitled to do, we should go on with the business on the Orders of the Day, as <Col N="1373" /> we arranged that the Minister for Home Affairs would attend.</P>

      <P>I will not waste the time of the Seanad any longer, as the new form in which this motion appears is a form with which I could agree.  I certainly could not agree to vote in favour of the original resolution, as I think it would be absolutely unconstitutional that the Government should be asked to forward a resolution from the Seanad to the British Government.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Whenever the Commissioners acquire any premises under this Act any person (other than a caretaker) who was put out of occupation of such premises or any part thereof in order that the same might be used for the accommodation of members of the Civic Guard shall be entitled to reasonable compensation for disturbance, the amount of which shall, in default of agreement, be fixed by the Commissioners.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. K. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday Senator Farren raised, on Sub-section (2) of Section 3, the position of a caretaker in premises acquired under this Bill by the Board of Works for the accommodation of the Civic Guard.  There are two points of view on the matter; there is the strict administrative point of view, which recongnises only two parties to the transaction&mdash;the owner of the premises and the State, which, to meet a great public need, commandeered these premises for the time being.  There is another point of view than the strict administrative angle, and in an attempt to meet that <Col N="1376" /> I have drafted an amendment which possibly the Senator may think fit to move.  It is not proposed to give to the caretaker a legal right as against the State, but it is proposed to ask a discretionary power for the Minister for Home Affairs, where special circumstances seem to require it, to compensate a caretaker for disturbance.  The amendment which I have drafted does not give a legal right to the caretaker and yet it leaves room for discretionary action where the circumstances seem fitting. It will run as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;To add at the end of Sub-section (2) the following words, &lsquo;and where any person being a caretaker was so put out of the occupation as aforesaid it shall be lawful for the Minister for Home Affairs, if in his opinion there are any special circumstances warranting his so doing, to authorise the payment to such person of such sum by way of compensation for disturbance as the Minister aforesaid shall, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, think proper.&rsquo;&rdquo; That would leave room for <i>ex gratia</i> grants where special circumstances seem to require it, and if the Senator will accept that it might possibly meet with the consent of the Seanad that he should move it as an amendment.</P>

      <P>This is the Schedule that defines pensions and the rates of pensions.  Without entering into any criticism, or in any way questioning these pensions, may I ask, for the sake of information, are they on the same rate as the British Army pay pensions?  I have not heard any statement of the rates at which these pensions are granted. I believe this Bill is certified as a Money Bill, but it would be worth while knowing at what rate these pensions are calculated, and whether they are calculated on the same basis as the British Authorities calculate their pensions.  I ask the question merely as a matter of information.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I am not able to answer this question as fully, perhaps, as it ought to be answered.  It might be well if the Senator would raise it on the Report Stage, when the Minister for Defence himself will be here.  I know that in the case of officers' pensions they are not exactly along the same lines as the British Army pensions. For certain grades of officers they would work out a little higher, but the scale is practically a flat one.  In the British Army, a General and a Captain would have a different rate of pension, but in our circumstances we thought it better to have a flat rate, and to pay all officers equally.  That means that a Captain would have a higher rate than he would have had if he had been receiving a pension on account of disablement incurred in the British Army.  It was felt that in our circumstances it would be very difficult to have the same number of grades, and to have all the distinctions and differences that are observed in the British Army Pension Scheme.  Sometimes it was largely a matter of chance whether a man held a higher rank or a lower rank.  Men were promoted sometimes very quickly, while others in somewhat different circumstances, but in a different area, who were equally meritorious, were not promoted.  The whole question of rank rose up very suddenly, and often there would have been changes in the grades that men would have held if time had elapsed, and their work had been scrutinised.  Consequently, the feeling was that it would be better to take the thing in bulk, and have a flat rate for all officers.  That works out slightly more to the advantage of the lower rank officer than to an officer in the same rank under the British scheme.  At the moment I could not, without notice, give the details that the Minister for Defence himself would be able to give, and hence I think it would be better if this question were raised on the Report Stage when the Minister himself will be here, or, if he is not here, there will be some Minister present with the necessary documents to answer the question.</P>

      <P>The Report of the Committee on the Standing Orders was taken at the meeting of the Seanad yesterday and its adoption was moved by Senator McPartlin, and seconded by Senator Farren, but as there was not a quorum of the Seanad present when I was about to put the motion, the debate had to be adjourned until to-day, and we now resume discussion on the Report.  The motion is that the Report of the Committee on Standing Orders be adopted, with the following addition, which has been been moved by Senator McPartlin:&mdash;&ldquo;in line 9 of paragraph 2 of Standing Order No. 70 to insert after the word &ldquo;stage&rdquo; the following:&mdash;&ldquo;but save in the case of a certified Money Bill, not before the expiration of three clear days after the circulation of the Bill as passed by the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ought to say that the Report of the Standing Orders Committee was, in <Col N="1383" /> substance, adopted by the Seanad, but Standing Order No. 56 was referred back to the Committee to have some verbal alterations made.  The Report now before the Seanad is the Report making the alterations that were suggested, and also suggesting some slight verbal alterations for the purpose of clarity in two other Orders.</P>
    <P>It has been proposed that the report should be adopted with this amendment I think the effect of the amendment proposed by Senator McPartlin would be to make it impossible for the Cathaoirleach&mdash;unless a special motion to take it were passed&mdash;to put down any Bill, except a Money Bill, until three days after it had been sent out to the members of the Seanad in its final form as passed by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>What you tell us is very interesting.  How would it be if we referred the matter back to the Standing Orders Committee, the same as the other proposals which have been referred back to them, to see whether they could not meet this difficulty?  I think that the Senator's amendment is a good one.  It would be a great advantage to us by and by, when we get settled down, and when legislation is going on in the normal fashion, if we could have any Bill we propose to amend at least three days before.  It would also be possible to suspend the Standing Orders if the Chairman or Deputy Chairman wishes us to do so.  No doubt the Seanad would always agree to that for reasons shown. I think, on the general principles it is only right that we should know what we are supposed to amend.  Complaints have been made heretofore that we have had very short notice in connection with Bills we were to discuss, and there was much weight in that objection which, of course, we waived in the circumstances of the country.  I am not sure that it would not be well to have it upon record in our Standing Orders that, at all events, we should have three clear days for the investigation of a legislative proposal after it has been circulated.  If there is any difficulty about the matter we might refer it back to the Standing Orders Committee, otherwise I would very much like to support Senator McPartlin and get the amendment now. <Col N="1384" /> If you thought there would be any advantage in referring it back to the Committee I would support that view.</P>

      <P>That is not for me to say.  If it is the unanimous view of the Seanad, then referring it back would mean a delay in getting properly indexed copies of the Standing Orders circulated to Senators which the Clerk is very anxious to do. On the other hand, if there is any difference of opinion it probably would be wise to refer it to the Committee.</P>

      <P>I am not very keen on the matter, but you have said it would mean delay in the printing of the Standing Orders.  We have this difficulty at the present time.  Yesterday we met here to consider the Civic Guard (Acquisition of Premises) Bill, and we only got a copy of the Bill by the morning's post.  Most of the Senators had not even read it and it was while reading it that they suggested amendments.  That is the reason I say that we should have time to read these Bills and see what they are about.  If you think the delay in the printing of the Standing Orders does not matter I am prepared to agree.</P>

      <P>I venture to suggest a change in connection with Clause 3 in which provision is made in case the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach are not able to attend, to have a reserve of two Senators.  A contingency may arise, and while I do not think it probable, it is possible.  If the Cathaoirleach is absent and the Leas-Chathaoirleach finds at the last moment that he cannot attend, and if the reserve Senator with whom he makes an arrangement to act meets with an accident coming to the Seanad, then the Seanad might find itself without a Chairman. That would be a very awkward crux.  I would suggest that we add after the second paragraph &ldquo;that in the absence of both selected Senators, the Seanad may appoint one of their number to act as Chairman <i>pro tem.</i>&rdquo; I should like to see the Standing Orders in their complete form in the form of a little book with headings or marginal notes for the purpose of easy reference.
