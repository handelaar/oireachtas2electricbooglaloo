      <P>I oppose this Bill.  I opposed the motion here before, and the motion was practically the same as the Bill.  I opposed the motion when it was introduced some time ago, and I did so for various reasons which I gave at the time.  I will not repeat those reasons, although I presume, what is most natural to presume, that everybody has forgotten all about the discussion that took place that day.</P>

      <P>The objections I put forward to the motion when first introduced might be summed up by stating that the League of Nations as at present constituted, and in the present conditions that exist in Europe, is no help whatsoever to those who worked for liberty and freedom among the nations. I would not expect a great deal from the League of Nations at present.  I <Col N="1546" /> would quite understand the League started as it has been, somewhat weak and shaky, and not able to do very much. I would not expect it go to war, to raise Armies, or to start off and oppose great nations like England and France. I would not expect it to use coercion against nations like Poland when it absorbs a great part of Lithuania, but I would expect it not to go against its own decisions and its own statements.  When it stated again and again that certain things were unjust I think it is hopeless to find that same League of Nations later on passing a resolution in favour of what it had already stated to be unfair.  I would expect it to be an emblem of light on the horizon to guide nations in the direction in which they ought to go.  I would expect it to raise its voice against injustice equally whether that injustice be perpetrated by small nations or by powerful nations, whether it was perpetrated by Belgium or Poland, by England or France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately it has done nothing of the sort.  If it had I would be the first person to vote for this Bill.  But, as far as I have been able to follow it, in numbers of cases it has done the most unjust things in history or in the history of any nation.  It has done nothing to help forward the cause of liberty and freedom. After protesting against the action of Poland in absorbing Vilna from Lithuania, and stating repeatedly that these were acts of injustice, they proceed to pass an Act in favour of it, and actually sanctioned the wrong against which they had protested.  It has sanctioned the mandates by which certain Arab States have been handed over to the dominion of France and England, although England had made treaties with the Arabs assuring them freedom, promising them in high-flown terms that henceforward they would be free to proceed on their own lines.  Instead of insisting that these promises would be carried out, the sanction broke all these promises, imposing the yoke of England on Mesopotamia and Palestine, and making Palestine a Jewish home, to the disadvantage and great objection of the great bulk of the inhabitants.  I feel quite sure that if Ireland joined the League of Nations, that instead of being able to reform the League, it will only be dragged into a lot of dirty work which will disgrace it and drag it down in the same <Col N="1547" /> mire with other imperialistic nations who are going round annexing land and behaving very improperly.</P>
    <P>President Wilson, who brought in the scheme first with his Fourteen Points, was right in his ideas.  Everybody approved of them, but he found when he came to Versailles that he got entangled in a net, and not one of these Fourteen Points was carried out since except when other countries rebelled and fought. It was never done peaceably.  Another point is the question of money.  We were told the last time that it would cost us £7,000 or £8,000, or something like that. Does that include the whole cost, of all the clerks and envoys we may send there and the buildings we may have to put up?  Does that include everything, or does it include only entry into the League &mdash;subscriptions to the League?  I think if that is not seen to we might find ourselves afterwards let in for a very big bill.  These are really only preliminary expenses.  I voted against the First Reading of the Bill the other day.  I was the only person who did, and it was an unusual proceeding which I would not take under any other circumstances.  The reason I did vote against it was because I think it is very improper for a Government in its last stages, just before the elections, when it may be in or out of power, to bring the country into a permanent condition by implicating it in the League of Nations and in the trouble arising therefrom without giving the country a chance of deciding.  There is no reason except that the first meeting may begin probably before the elections are over here.  This is a temporary Parliament. It does not attempt to be anything else.</P>
    <P>The Government under difficult circumstances took up a certain job.  By law and by arrangement their job was to end in December, and yet this Government endeavours to plunge us into those permanent difficulties and endeavours to pledge the country for years to the League of Nations.  I think that is an improper thing, and there is no reason for it.  Nearly all the Bills that we have been asked to pass have been temporary ones.  The Land Bill was, perhaps, an exception, and then there were very grave problems to be dealt with.  This Bill merely tries to force the opinion of the Government on the whole country <Col N="1548" /> without the country being allowed to form its own opinion.  I oppose the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>When the suggestion was made, in the first instance, that the Saorstát should join the League of Nations, I think it was made in a somewhat irregular manner.  On that occasion I asked the Minister whether it was intended to lay the matter before the two Houses.  It came as a surprise to the Seanad that the matter was not laid before both Houses.  Under the present Bill, however, whether or not it was on the strength of that remonstrance, both Houses are to be consulted, and the joining or not joining in the League of Nations will be decided by the Oireachtas. As to the merits of the Bill, I think it is probably right that Ireland should join and I will record my vote in favour of the Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. WYSE POWER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to obtain some information from the Minister in regard to this Bill.  We were told that the reason we ought to join the League of Nations is that Ireland is now a nation, and it will speak for itself in the League of Nations.  I understand that what are called the Dominions do not speak separately for themselves; but when they are gathered into what we would call a Committee, a spokesman representing the British Empire speaks for them as a whole.  I would like some information from the Minister on that subject. If what I have stated is the case, I think we ought to be very wary before adopting this Bill.  I am sorry the two gentlemen whose names backed the Bill are not here, because they might have given me that information.  I want to know what nations are represented in the League outside of what we know as the Allied group.  I also want to know at what date the application was made to enter the League by the Government or by the Executive Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for EXTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the questions put by Senator Mrs. Wyse Power, the nations known as Dominions are represented separately in the Assembly as the League of Nations. They are always represented separately, and they are not represented by any representative of the British Empire group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. WYSE POWER</NameTxt>
      <P>I know they are represented by their own representatives, but do those representatives speak separately for their own individual nations, or do they speak only through one representative for the whole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. DESMOND FITZGERALD Mr. DESMOND FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DESMOND FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated, they speak separately for their own countries.  With regard to the nations that are in the League, there are fifty-two nations, and it is much easier to give the list of the nations who are not in the League.  They are as follows:&mdash; Abyssinia, Afghanistan, Germany, Iceland, Mexico, Russia, Turkey, and United States.  I want to correct a mistake that was made by Senator Colonel Moore.  He speaks about this being a permanent Bill, whereas all other Bills are on a temporary basis, and he talks about committing this country to the League of Nations for ever, whereas in regard to other Bills changes could be made.  As a matter of fact, any country can withdraw from the League of Nations within a period of two years, so there is nothing permanent about the Bill.  Prior to the Seanad coming into existence a resolution was passed by the Dáil, when the Dáil was the sole Executive, calling upon the Executive Council to take steps to join the League of Nations as soon as it seemed desirable.  We proposed acting on that, but an independent resolution was brought forward in this House some months ago, and I think it was Senator Guinness pointed out at the time that the Oireachtas should be consulted in the matter of joining the League of Nations. Joining the League of Nations is, as I explained, actually an Executive act, but I did not wish to act in any way contrary to the wishes of the Oireachtas, and this Bill is brought in with a view to having both Houses register their opinion on the matter.  As you will see, the Bill is a short one.  It has reference to Article 1 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, which says that a nation applying for admission to the League shall give effective guarantees of its sincere intention to observe its international obligations, and shall accept such regulations as may be prescribed by the League in regard to its military, naval, and air forces and armaments. We have already in the Treaty an arrangement which defines to some extent the extent of the Free State's military equipment.  The Senator will, I <Col N="1550" /> think, remember that clause, so we propose in this Bill that the Executive be empowered to give the required guarantees&mdash;that is to say, a guarantee that we intend to keep our international undertakings, and to agree to regulations prescribed by the League in regard to military, naval, and air forces and armaments.</P>
      <P>That is the purport of the Bill, and it raises the whole question as to whether the Free State should or should not join the League.  I pointed out that there are only some half a dozen nations not already in the League.  It will be agreed that, seeing there are 52 nations members of the League, and only eight not members of the League, and recognising that, on the whole, in the world good does outweigh evil, and that the declared objects of the League are such as we are whole-heartedly in accord with, no harm could be done by joining the League, and, I think, certain definite good can be done by joining.  We become the fifty-third nation that has joined.  Senator Colonel Moore has pointed out several defects in the League.  I have said before that it is an aspiration, not an accomplishment. Every country does cling very much to its own rights and its own sovereignty, and in order to have perfection it would mean that there would have to be a bigger abrogation of countries' powers than any country is prepared to give.  The League, therefore, has so far done very good work, but it has also had to compromise very often, and I quite recognise that it has had more or less to sanction things that are not in keeping with the principle of its declared objects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to financial commitments, I admit it is difficult to give a definite answer.  So far there has been rather a rough-and-ready arrangement about the subscriptions given by the various nations to the League.  Those subscriptions have largely been based on the subscription given by the various countries to the International Postal Union.  So far we are not a member of the International Postal Union, and will not be a member for some months, and also, owing to the smallness of the Postal Union unit, the arrangement could not be worked on that mathematically.  I estimate that our subscription to the League should be something equivalent to the subscription given by New Zealand, which is at present 10 units, and I think it will roughly <Col N="1551" /> be about £10,000.  There is no question, of course, of building any special buildings or anything like that; there is a question of representation.  Seeing that at the sittings of the League there are 52 nations represented, it is necessary, whether we be members or not, to have a representative and an office there, which we have at the present moment. It is necessary both diplomatically and for the purpose of trade to have such representation there.</P>
    <P>Joining the League means additional expense in our subscription to the League, which I estimate at about £10,000 or £10,500&mdash;I think it can hardly be more than that&mdash;and the expenses of the delegation, which will be sent there annually in the month of September. It would not be anything very considerable, and I think that my first estimate, in which I put the sum at £15,000, should be adequate to cover the whole annual expenses of our member ship of the League.  Senator Mrs. Wyse Power has asked me on what date our application to the League was made.  It was made a few days before the motion was introduced here&mdash;actually on the 17th April.  These are the points I wish to bring out, namely, that although the League is not perfect, it aims at perfection, and its general objects are in accord with the mind of the people of this country, because I think, if ever any country stood for universal peace, this country, having had a fairly considerable experience of war, does stand for universal peace.  We have to recognise the fact that it is not a perfect organisation. Arising as it did immediately after the Great War, it was inevitable that it should not be.  We recognise the additional expense, but we think that it will be well-spent money, because we have found that most countries do not actually understand that we have that full and complete independence possessed by Canada.  It was made very difficult for them to understand that during the last year, as the situation here was quite impossible for outside people to understand properly.  We do not live alone, and the League has many Committees which deal with other business.  We have, for instance, already sent a representation to the International Committee dealing with tariffs.  The thing is not necessarily permanent, because we are only birds of <Col N="1552" /> passage.  We commit this country only to the period of two years, and if, after the next election, there is a new Government here who disagree with the policy of being members of the League, they can take immediate steps to withdraw from it, and they will be out of the League long before the succeeding election takes place.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister will the effect of Section 2 be to give full powers to the Executive Council in regard to the policy to be adopted at the League?  Does it take away from the Oireachtas the power to discuss any of the regulations made by the League, and does it also give a mandate as to the policy to be adopted by our representatives in the League of Nations?  It would seem to me that that is the case, and that the Bill gives an absolute mandate to the Executive Council to act upon their own authority after admission to the League.</P>

      <P>The Minister explains that this Bill contains 58 sections, all of which, with the exception of four sections, represent a codification of the existing law relating to corrupt and illegal practices at elections, the general principles of which do not require any alteration. These principles have in the Bill been applied to Seanad elections and to Referenda, with such slight modifications as are necessary.  The new sections deal with questions affecting Seanad elections and Referenda, and provide for the number of persons who may be present at a Seanad count, for cases of Seanad candidates becoming disqualified before the completion of the counting, and for the appointment of a sponsor and challenger at a Referendum.  The existing law has been varied in the following matters: :&mdash; (1) A false statement of withdrawal is a more serious offence at a P.R. election than at former elections.  This is now regarded as a &ldquo;corrupt practice.&rdquo;  (2) No limit is placed on the amount a candidate at a Dáil election may spend, so long as a full disclosure of expenses is made.  (3) Certain small matters, such <Col N="1557" /> as hiring of hackney carriages, bands of music, payments for flags, ribbons, etc., will not now mislead electors, and are not regarded as being in any way illegal.  A method for the better enforcement of the penalties for corrupt and illegal practices is provided in the Bill, and for the more serious offences a minimum punishment is provided.  Trial will generally be by summary jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>I read the debate on this Bill when it was going through the Dáil, and I think the Minister in charge, Mr. Blythe, called attention to a provision directly affecting this Seanad.  That is the provision which deprives candidates at a Seanad election of the power of appointing personation agents.  You will observe that Section 24 provides that candidates at Seanad elections are not to be allowed to appoint personation agents.  The Minister gave very good reasons for that.  He said he would like the Seanad to express an opinion on it when it came before it.  If we are not going to take the Committee Stage of the Bill to-day I would recommend Senators to look into the matter, and perhaps read the debate on the subject in the Dáil. The way the matter stands is this.  At the first Seanad election there will be 45 candidates, and, inasmuch as the constituency covers and includes the entire electorate of the Free State, there will be 5,000 polling booths, and if the unfortunate candidate appoints a personation agent at each booth it would mean 5,000 personation agents, so Senators will have some idea what it means.  In addition, if each candidate appoints a separate personation agent there will be 45 such agents in each booth.  The thing is impracticable.</P>

      <P>Probably he does occasionally, but he is not supposed to do so.  There were two alternatives. One was that the State should have an agent there of its own to prevent persons personating, but he said that that would be futile, because he could not get anyone who knew the persons in the locality and who could challenge anyone attempting personation.  He said that the matter was one for the Seanad, and that he would welcome an expression of opinion from it on the matter when it came before it.  I suppose the proper time for discussing that would be in Committee.</P>

That would be a different aspect of the case to individual appointment.  I should like to have an opportunity of thinking that over.  I do not think that there will be any fear of any individual Senator going to the trouble of appointing 5,000 personation agents.  I suggest it is rather fantastic.</P>

      <P>There is a question of the people losing their money if they do not get one-third of the quota.  That is quite reasonable; but I think what would happen in those elections has not been considered where there are a great number of candidates.  In Dublin County, with eight seats, for instance, you might have twenty candidates.  It is quite a different thing to get one-third of the quota when there are ten or twelve. A great difficulty may arise with this great number of candidates.</P>

      <P>I think the Seanad is very much obliged to you, sir, for having explained this very difficult clause.  I noticed these words, &ldquo;each candidate at a Seanad election, or any group of such candidates, may appoint a person, etc.&rdquo;  If you accept the Bill, there is a way of getting out of the difficulty, but it is a cumbersome thing to deal with indeed, and I do not see, with regard to this Bill. how you are going to get over the difficulty now before the Seanad.  You have created this Assembly, and you have got an election on your back, and if you begin to amend you will find that the elections will be on you before you have made up your mind to do anything serious.  Therefore, if I had to be elected to this position in this way, I should certainly, if I took the question <Col N="1560" /> seriously, go around and ask my friends to form groups and get over the difficulty in that way.  You really cannot expect the Seanad and the Dáil to do everything, and the public must try and do something for themselves.  We are a new country at this game, and I think it is much better to take the circumstances as they arise and to deal with them.  The Bill is well drafted and put together.  I have read it and it looks practically a consolidation Bill except for this particular clause pointed out by the Minister acting for the Minister in charge of the Bill.</P>

      <P>There is a rather dangerous omission from this Bill which was always in previous Bills, and that is fixing the maximum amount that a candidate for the election to the Dáil would be entitled to spend.  I think it is an omission that should receive very serious consideration, because I think it is desirable not to allow persons who may have unlimited supply of money to use that money for the furthering of their candidature.  It is pretty generally known that you often find people with a tremendous amount of money who have not the greatest amount of commonsense. The Earl of Mayo said he was rather new to this game.  I am not so new.  I know a little about elections, and I have been engaged in election work in Dublin for the last twenty-five years, and I think this is rather a serious omission from the Bill.</P>

I have not read the Bill very closely, but looking at Section 8 of Part 2, it appears that there must be some maximum, because it says in Sub-section (2) &ldquo;subject to such exception as may be allowed in pursuance of this Act, no sum shall be paid by a candidate at an election or by his agent for any purpose in relation to the conduct or management of such election in excess of the maximum amount authorised by this Act.&rdquo;  There must be a maximum amount somewhere.</P>

      <P>I would like Senators also to consider this other question about personation agents.  My own view is that it would probably be found that the best solution of it is to leave it alone, that is to say to have no personation agents at all.  The local interest in the election, which runs for the entire 26 counties, is not likely to be so great as to stimulate much personation, and probably the best solution is the one that the Minister himself approved of, that is to make no provision for the appointment of personation agents in the case of a Seanad election.  The alternative, I think, would be to allow candidates by groups or as one body to act in the matter.  There will be an opportunity later for Senators to consider this matter, and I think that probably they will agree that we had better adjourn the question to the Committee Stage, which, I think, we might take on Wednesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>That is actually so, and the reason of it is that in the past the returns furnished in connection <Col N="1563" /> with election expenses were never accurate. I think that Senator Farren, who knows something about elections, can bear witness to that.  A candidate legally could spend up to £400, but actually he usually spent up to £1,000, and he failed to show in the return he furnished how he spent that money.  We think the insertion of this clause would encourage candidates to make a full disclosure of the sums spent by them, and in cases where there were any abuses it would enable a careful scrutiny of the accounts to be made afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount allowed for legal expenses in rural constituencies is £75, and in borough areas £50.  On the general question, I do agree that there should be a maximum fixed, notwithstanding the fact that heretofore there have been some little abuses as regards furnishing correct returns.  We have entered a new era now, and I hope that whatever regulations are laid down by the Parliament of the nation, they will be adhered to by the citizens generally.  I hope, even though there may have been electoral abuses in the past, that now under a native Parliament the elections will be conducted on clean lines, and that they will be a credit to the citizens of the Saorstát.  The franchise has been extended as far as possible, and I hope that, in all the circumstances, the elections will be conducted in a clean and honourable manner.  Hence I think that a maximum should be fixed as regards the amount that a candidate can spend at an election, because I think it would be undesirable to put people with unlimited means at their disposal in such a position as to enable them to be able to buy votes.  We know from experience that unless some provision such as I suggest is made candidates with unlimited means could do that.  Under all the circumstances, I think the Seanad would be entitled to recommend to the Minister in charge of the Bill to have a maximum <Col N="1564" /> fixed of the total that a candidate can spend at an election.</P>

      <P>I beg to support the proposal of the last Senator.  I regard this proposal from a democratic point of view, which is what we have got to accept now.  I think if a maximum is not fixed the clause in the Bill as it stands is reactionary, and highly reactionary.</P>
      <P>I could not quite follow the argument of the Minister who suggested that, by removing all restrictions as regards the furnishing of accounts, you would necessarily get true accounts.  If there is any item which brings the candidate into the illegal zone, he is not going to include that item merely because he has got freedom to include anything he likes in the accounts.  I may be stupid, but I have not been able to follow the arguments of the Minister in that respect.  It is highly desirable, I think, that that provision should be examined very closely by the Seanad; and, moreover, in view of the fact that it has been adopted in other countries as a precaution against the unbridled action of a plutocracy, and has been found effective.  Whatever may be said here, a provision of that kind has been found effective in other countries. I do not ask the Seanad to take my personal views on that, but I have had an opportunity of meeting people who have actually seen the provision working elsewhere, and, so far as their opinion goes, such a provision has been found to be in the interests of the candidate who has not got the control of unlimited means.  I hope, therefore, the Dáil will examine this new proposal very closely.</P>

During the last election, which, of course, was not a normal one, to say the least, but was symptomatic of what may occur again, we had the most fantastic returns made regarding election expenses.  We had cases of bunches of candidates returning <Col N="1565" /> their total expenses at £45 each, though everybody knew they were nearer to as many hundreds, and when they got every vehicle that could be bought or hired in Dublin, and which were paid for at exorbitant rates.  The Returning Officer or the Sheriff accepted that statement, and it was not questioned in the least. Evidently no inquiry was made into it. Somebody suggested to some of these candidates that that was an absurd statement, and the reply was: &ldquo;We only put down personal expenses; the Party we belong to paid the rest.&rdquo;  If they could get over the restriction of amount of expenditure in that way, and if it were left to a private citizen, or one of their own opponents, to raise a question, then I say restrictions in regard to expenses are a mere farce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Sir John Keane that it is an exceedingly retrograde step and is a confession that the law cannot be enforced in regard to matters of this kind. I hope that we shall have some time to consider the introduction of amendments of a suitable nature into this.  I am surprised that when the Bill was passing through the Dáil there did not seem to be very much objection to this, what we would consider, serious omission. Regarding the question of personation agents in the case of Seanad elections, I am personally entirely in accord with the provisions of the Bill.  I believe that it is utterly impracticable and undesirable to try to find thousands of personation agents.  I think one stands a better chance really of getting something like justice or equitable treatment by this arrangement.  It may not be very desirable to have the local Civic Guard challenging people in the first instance, but I do not think that they are going to win any unpopularity by acting in that way, and, in any case, the presiding officer will, under this Bill, have the right to challenge any person whom he looks upon as being engaged in an attempt to personate. The provision regarding disorderly conduct at meetings is a very desirable one and should be particularly enforced outside polling booths.  It was very regrettable at some of the recent elections to see the manner in which would-be voters were intimidated on the way to the polls, women and others being actually carried in by a lot of robust young men and told whom they were to vote for, thereby being frightened <Col N="1566" /> and confused.  Many people turned back, women particularly, when they heard of the scenes that were being enacted outside some of the polling booths.  The local police authorities should have very strict instructions to see that nothing of that kind goes on at future elections. Canvassing should be confined to the homes of the people and not to the polling booths where people are expected to vote in the way they are intended to vote and not have them intimidated into doing something they never intended to do just as they arrive at the polling booths.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the resolution which appears in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That having regard to the large sums of money paid by Irish citizens as premiums for the insurance of their property from loss by fire, riot, or civil commotion, the liability to pay for which is, in consideration of these premiums, assumed by insurance companies and underwriters, but which liability it is now endeavoured to place on the rates,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is in the opinion of the Seanad desirable, and they would urge the Government to introduce legislation, under which insurance companies or underwriters who (a) repudiate the liabilities they have assumed, or (b) are unwilling to abide by the decisions of the Free State Courts, shall be precluded from carrying on business in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have ventured to put down the resolution because it has become obvious lately that a great many insurance companies, underwriters, and persons of that sort have been availing themselves of the state of affairs which has unfortunately prevailed in this country to enable them to evade the obligations which they have undoubtedly undertaken, and for which they have been receiving very large sums in premiums.  What this in the gross would amount to it would be impossible to say, but when you take into consideration the fact that practically all buildings in Ireland are insured, and furniture and things of that sort, one must appreciate that it would be a very large amount.  Most of the policies include clauses protecting the insured against loss arising from arson, or incendiarism, but when these losses have arisen lately, insurance companies have availed themselves of the state of affairs to repudiate their own liabilities, and to refer the people to the legislation which exists here for recovering damages for malicious injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is undoubtedly the case, and in addition to that there are a great many policies which have been taken out at very largely increased premiums, which have covered property against losses arising from riot or civil commotion, and we have had a number of cases in which <Col N="1568" /> these losses have also been endeavoured to be repudiated by these large insurance companies.  The policy holders are, therefore, thrown back on the only remedy which they possess, which is to seek to make the ratepayers liable for the losses which they have incurred, or to avoid a most expensive law suit, with a certainty that if the decision goes against these wealthy insurance companies the case will be taken to the House of Lords, and the unfortunate policy holder will be faced with practically prohibitive expense in litigation.  It is no wonder that these insurance companies under these conditions have been able to put up the palatial edifices that you see in London and scattered all over the large cities in Great Britain, because they have been receiving a most substantial income from Ireland, and, of course, other places as well.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Irish income is not as large as the others, but the repudiation mainly has taken place here.  None of us is so young that he cannot recollect the time when honest John Bull was referred to with respect, and often with affection; but a new generation has arisen, and with new men and new methods the place of honest John Bull has been taken by these huge associations, and whenever they have any case to fight, the unfortunate policy holder is put up against an enormous aggregation of capital, which he knows will be ruthlessly used against him.  I think it was O'Connell who said that these large associations had neither a body to be kicked nor a soul to be saved.  They do not mind what excuses they put forward to evade conditions. Even the London <i>Times</i>, lately, has found it necessary to call attention to the abuses which have been taking place even in England, and they have pointed out that in most of the proposals and in some of the policies there are conditions attached which are something like the small print on the back of a pound note, which nobody ever reads, and which have vital effects on the interests of the policy holders.  They pointed out that the policy holder in every case is hardly able to protect himself, and that some protection is necessary for him.  I think the time comes to all of us, and probably to most countries when one has to consider whether you will submit to an imposition like a slave, or whether you will fight it. I think that time has come in this country, <Col N="1569" /> and I think the people we represent here expect us to do what we can, and, perhaps, what we can do for their protection may be very limited.  I do not think we would be at all out of place in asking our Government to take advice as to what steps they could take to protect the policy holders.  I think it is only reasonable to ask them to do so, and, therefore, I have much pleasure in proposing the resolution which appears in my name.</P>

      <P>If Senator Barrington would kindly allow me, I would like to point out to him, with regard to the latter portion&mdash;&ldquo;are unwilling to abide by the decisions of the Free State Courts&rdquo;&mdash;that the insurance companies in many cases have taken litigation to the House of Lords.  I want to point out, owing to the recent pronouncement of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, that will be no longer possible. An isolated action of that kind can no longer go to the House of Lords. It is almost certain that if a petition is made for leave to appeal the leave to appeal will be refused.  Therefore, in the future, for all practical purposes these matters will be decided finally and for all time by the decision of the ultimate Court of the Free State.</P>

The appeal to the House of Lords is absolutely and entirely abolished in reference to any decision in any Court in the Irish Free State.  There is no longer the power with either litigant to take the appeal to the House of Lords. If he wants to go further, when the case has been decided by the Court of Appeal in the Irish Free State, he has to apply to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for the right to appeal.  The Judicial Committee laid it down the other day that they will not give any such right except there is some question of national importance involved or except the case raises grave constitutional issues.  For all intents and purposes, the decision of the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State will be final in the future.</P>

      <P>I might also suggest that wherever the insurance policy covers riot or civil commotion the company have got to pay.  They have no choice.  The difficulties that have arisen are owing to the fact that with the majority of insurance policies in Ireland the reverse is the case.  There is a clause exempting the company from liability in cases of riot or civil commotion.  That is the difficulty.  Wherever a policy contains a covenant which makes the company liable in the event of riot or civil commotion&mdash;which they often do for an increased premium&mdash;I know of no case where liability was disputed.</P>

After nine months and after a good deal of trouble the insurance company&mdash;Lloyd's&mdash;paid £16,000 conditionally on the people going into Court and getting compensation from the county.  The £16,000 was only advanced as a loan until the party went into the Courts and got compensation for the malicious destruction of their property.  I know several cases in which that occurred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>That has always been the law in these malicious injury cases, and for an obvious reason. It has been held that the mere fact that the person injured is insured does not deprive him of his remedy or right against the rates.  Therefore, if an insured person instead of claiming against the rates claims against the insurance company, it has been held up to now under the old law that he was trustee for the money he got from the rates for the insurance company.  In other words, he could not have it both ways.</P>

      <P>In this case the rate charged was £3 per £100 for three months for riot and civil commotion. The ordinary rate for fire would be 3s. per £100 per annum.  The insurance companies collected very, very big premiums in that way, and incurred no liability, because they could make the parties collect the compensation from the county.  They collected £3 per £100 for three months and gave nothing for it.</P>

      <P>I am quite aware of that, but the principle always applied.  If, where the premium is small and does not cover riot and civil commotion, the party insured or the insurance company, is entitled to recover from the rates, the same principle would necessarily apply even though the insurance premium was increased and extra risk <Col N="1572" /> was covered.  The principle still remains the same.  I am merely pointing this out as I do not want the Senator to be under any misapprehension about it.  It does not interfere with the purpose or intention of his resolution.

      <P>I put down an amendment:&mdash;&ldquo;Before the word &lsquo;It&rsquo; in line 38 to insert the words &lsquo;subject to the provisions of the Constitution.&rsquo;&rdquo;<Col N="1573" /> My reason for that is that the Constitution lays down in Sections 6, 7, 70 and 72 some important rules which cannot, as far as I see, be broken through.  Any Bill that controverts the Constitution is in itself illegal.  When a Bill is passed by the Oireachtas it is always to be considered in collaboration with the Constitution, and when the two clash the Constitution rules.  I am not sure, but I think that is the Constitutional state of affairs.  Section 6 of the Constitution states, &ldquo;the liberty of the person is inviolable, and so on, and in Sections 7, 70 and 72, you will find similar provisions.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that a good many of these Articles laid down here in this Bill now before us are clearly contrary to the Constitution.  That would not matter if it was in time of war.  Then, of course, the Constitution states very clearly and definitely that these Rules do not apply in time of war.  So that, if this Bill referred merely to a time of war there would be no such objection to be raised. But it is clearly not that, because it is meant to continue after the war is over. For instance, any of those days the judges may decide, and it is for them to decide, that a state of war no longer exists.  As long as they do not say that, the state of war is presumed to continue. But once the judges state that war has ceased, that in their opinion war has ceased, then, and therefore, they must grant a habeas corpus.  Then we will have to go by the Constitution.  It is not for me to say whether these do constitute breaches of the Constitution.  I merely put this down subject to the provision in the Constitution.  There are two things that might occur, if it is contrary to the Constitution.  First it is contrary to the Constitution, and therefore is not law; or, as an alternative, it might be possible to amend the Constitution. If it is a law amending the Constitution I think the Minister ought tell us that.  There ought be a preamble that this law amends the Constitution. The Constitution can be amended, but I do not see any such provision in this Bill. If the Bill is in accordance with the Constitution there is nothing more to be said about it.</P>

That is why no one member or two members of the Executive Council were mentioned specifically.  There is no specific mention in the Bill of the Minister for Home Affairs or of the Minister for Defence, because the things done under the Bill will be matters for which the Council will be responsible as a whole&mdash;collectively responsible.</P>

      <P>I think what the Minister has stated is correct, but I should like to urge him to consider that, from the point of view of the public, it would be wise to insert words such as are proposed.  The substance, I admit, is the same.  Where you have an Executive Council there is, of course, collective responsibility, and the whole Council would be, under the present words, collectively responsible for the act of any one Minister. But the way in which the amendment <Col N="1576" /> appeals to me is, that it is desirable that this Bill should be carried out by one, or at most two,&mdash;possibly the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Home Affairs, or either or both.  It seems to me as it stands now that the public will say that the Minister for Education is interning somebody or the Minister for something else.  I admit collective responsibility is there, but I think it would be better if the Council themselves delegated their powers to one or two of the Ministers named so as to make it clear.  I would not be in favour of pressing the amendment, but I hope the Minister will consider the matter and see whether it would not, from the public point of view, make it clear.</P>

      <P>I am of opinion, and I am confirmed in that opinion by the Attorney-General, that in fact the acceptance of the amendment would be rather to weaken the position and restrict, to some extent, responsibility.  The words &ldquo;Executive Minister&rdquo; were used throughout the Bill to emphasise the collective responsibility aspect.  If we substitute for that, that a particular Minister authorised by the rest may do these things, then that tends to limit, and will in the public mind, tend to limit the responsibility for acts done under the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;Section 1&mdash;&ldquo;To delete all after the word &lsquo;shall&rsquo; in line 42 to the word &lsquo;officer&rsquo; in line 43, and to substitute therefor the words &lsquo;certify in writing that he is satisfied.&rsquo;&rdquo; The object of the amendment is to endeavour, to some extent, to meet a point to which I referred on the Second Reading.  The Minister in reply, possibly not to remarks of mine, but to some points made in the discussion, said that some Senators had objected to portion of Section 2, which gave a responsible officer of the Civic Guard power to arrest.  As far as I am concerned I certainly did not object to anything of the kind, because I do not see what the Civic Guard are there for except to arrest persons whom they suspect.  But the <Col N="1577" /> feeling, I think, is this, that the object of the Government will be met every bit as well by the words I have suggested, which would put the whole responsibility on the Minister concerned without his having to state exactly, or even state at the tribunal, the exact source from which he received his information.</P>
      <P>If you are going to have power of interning given a Minister, then I think it is much better that he himself should be satisfied that the reasons put forward for suspicion are good.  As it stands in the Bill, you bring in your responsible officer, who may be either a Superintendent of the Civic Guard or a Commandant of the Army.  What I want to avoid, if possible, is bringing in these new forces, particularly the Civic Guard, and mixing them up with this Bill in the eyes of the public.  I should like it to be made quite clear that if an officer of the Civic Guard arrests a man he brings him forward in the ordinary Courts for trial, but if in the meantime, under the Bill, the Minister interferes and interns him, the public cannot blame the Civic Guard officer who is responsible. This and another amendment further down would have the effect, in Section 1, of placing the full responsibility on the Minister.  Exactly where he gets his information he is not bound to disclose, and it would not bring in the Civic Guard to the same extent in the public mind.  I hope the Minister will consider this, and see whether it is not possible definitely to remove the advice of this officer of the Civic Guard in regard to interning.</P>

      <P>I wonder whether the Senator has considered this aspect: that it might well be a weakening of the section to leave out any reference to a definite report from a responsible officer, and that the amendment that he proposes to substitute would, in fact, enable the Minister to act without such report, simply on the ground that he personally was satisfied, possibly by something that he heard from some reliable person who had been in to see him on other business, or possibly in some other way, that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting a particular person of being engaged in the commission of the offences mentioned in Part I. Whether it is really strengthening the Bill to substitute a mere certificate from a Minister for a definite Order based on <Col N="1578" /> a definite report from a responsible officer of the rank named in the Bill is simply a matter to consider.  If the Senators generally consider that there is virtue in the amendment I would not oppose it, and I would be prepared to move in the Dáil that it be accepted.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Minister, I might say that I have carefully considered the point he made, and my feeling is that this is abnormal legislation for a period of six months.  The ordinary carrying out of the law by the Civic Guard is a thing which we want to establish definitely in the country by means of the ordinary law.  It will be permanent; it is becoming permanent; and it is essential that the respect and complete confidence of the country and of the people of all sections should be gained by the Civic Guard in the exercise of their duty.  I think, even if it were weakening them&mdash;I do not think, for reasons which I will state, that it is &mdash;that it would really be what the Government require, and would help, in any case, to prevent the danger of our mixing the new things which we are setting up&mdash;which we are proud of and hope to be permanent&mdash;with this temporary legislation, however necessary it may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally I do not think that, if a man is a Minister, and fit to be a Minister, he will do as Mr. O'Higgins suggests&mdash; which I know he does not mean&mdash;simply take something said to him by someone who was in on other business.  I would rather, if we are going to have internment, to have a statement signed by a Minister or his responsible official, to the effect that he is satisfied that the grounds are reasonable without stating that he has a report from a Superintendent of the Civic Guard.  I suggest, therefore, that, <Col N="1579" /> instead of weakening, it would rather strengthen the section.  What I want to particularly avoid is that a person in a town should feel that a certain superintendent in the Civic Guard was the man who reported him or his cousin, whoever it is who happens to be interned under this Bill.  It is an endeavour to try and keep the Civic Guard out of such a position.  I thank the Minister for the way he met this amendment, and in stating that he is willing to leave it to the Seanad.  On this occasion I hope the Seanad will agree to the amendment.</P>

      <P>As it is going to be left to the Seanad, I think, on looking forward a little into the Bill, that Senator Douglas is fighting for a principle that underlies Clause 2, where the Executive Minister takes the whole responsibility on himself, and where the officer of the Civic Guard makes the arrest and only carries out the ordinary law.  If there is anything to be done beyond the ordinary law to carry out this Bill, then the Minister takes full responsibility.  I think what Senator Douglas is asking for is that much of the same principle should apply to Clause 1.  As it strikes one on looking at the section, if the Minister does not think the amendment injures the Bill, it seems reasonable.</P>

He gets the report and orders arrest.  I do not think by adding the amendment to the Bill that it will make him any less responsible. The following section gives powers to a subordinate officer, and there I should like some safeguards introduced. I do not think the present amendment will take any power from or give any power to the officer without an order from the Executive Minister.  I do not think the Bill would be improved by such amendment.</P>

      <P>I have no special regard for the amendment, as I fail to see how the section can be satisfactorily amended.  The only point in the amendment that appeals to me was the one emphasised by Senator Douglas, that the acceptance of the amendment would <Col N="1581" /> tend to save the Civic Guard from becoming a new R.I.C. or Black and Tan organisation.  It is unfortunate at the very inception of their career that they should be called upon to discharge duties of this particular character, and definitely made responsible in this subsection for the internment of people without trial.  After all, the law is successful or otherwise according to the respect in which those who administer it are held, and if we proceed right away by making the Civic Guard, which is the principal police force in the country, discharge duties of this obnoxious nature and make them directly responsible for the detention of people without trial&mdash; possibly large numbers of people&mdash;we are going to strike at the very fundamentals of justice in the beginning. That is the only point of view from which I would support the amendment.  For that reason I hope the Seanad will adopt it in order to try, as far as possible, to make the Civic Guard respected a little more than the R.I.C. was, and to render the force more liable to discharge its duties in a more satisfactory manner, and with more public confidence, than will be the case if these duties are imposed upon them.</P>

I can only give you an instance of what I know was done in the past by people across the water, who, I regret to say, are now being copied very much on this side of the water.  They kept a man in prison in the belief that he was reasonably suspected. The matter was later brought before a Commission which they had set up, and the evidence was that a certain policeman admitted that the prisoner had not been keeping company with any suspicious person.  Then he was asked why <Col N="1582" /> he reasonably suspected him, and he explained that this man had paid a visit to the priest.  It was admitted that the priest was not a rebel nor suspected of being a rebel.  It was also stated that another man had been on a visit with the priest, and that he was reasonably suspected. Although it could not be shown that the first prisoner came in contact with the other prisoner, he was suspected. These are the sorts of suspicions that will take place when you want to arrest a man.  When you want to arrest a man in the country there are suspicions on all kinds of extraordinary grounds.  I want to see some <i>prima facie</i> evidence showing that there is some cause for arresting a man.</P>

      <P>I would not be open to accept that amendment, and if the Seanad were to accept it I would have no alternative but to ask the Dáil not to accept it.  It would render the Executive absolutely powerless in dealing with the situation in the country.  Senators must know that there are scores of men engaged in criminal activities throughout the country against whom it would be impossible to produce even that <i>prima facie</i> evidence which the amendment demands. Personally I am aware that there are men in charge of columns in various parts of the country still in hiding who could not be placed on trial, and against whom no <i>prima facie</i> evidence could be produced.  The term &ldquo;suspicion&rdquo; throughout this Bill means something more than suspicion.  It means common knowledge prevailing through a locality, but inasmuch as everything short of legal proof has to be covered, the word suspicion has to be used in the Bill.  I could not agree to an amendment which would impose on the Executive the necessity of producing <i>prima facie</i> evidence.</P>

      <P>I propose the following amendment:&mdash;Section 1: To insert after the word &ldquo;is,&rdquo; in line 50, the words &ldquo;for reasons stated in the report.&rdquo;  This amendment was moved in the Dáil, and was rejected on the grounds that the inclusion of the words might leave it open to a civil court to enquire into the sufficiency of the reasons stated.  The words at the end of the clause were added as a kind of safeguard to insure that the <Col N="1583" /> powers given by this clause would be utilised only on account of the state of war.  The argument that the words to be added would bring the case before the Courts is of doubtful validity.  In any case, the words about the state of war have been added.  The intention of the amendment is simply that the military authorities should not be able to secure the internment of any person on the general statement that it is a matter of military necessity.</P>
      <P>Something more definite should be required. Presumably a military officer always makes a report of some sort as to why he makes an internment.  The amendment would mean that the information in that report, or at least the substance of it, should be passed on to the Minister who orders the internment.  I cannot see why this amendment cannot be accepted.  We all know from experience, with human nature as it is, that it would be humanly impossible to get any body of men, whether members of the Civic Guard or of the Army, who are all desirable.  We all know it is quite possible that men may get into the Army who are undesirable. I am not suggesting that the general body of the Army are undesirable.  I suggest that it is quite possible for undesirables to get into the Civic Guard and become officers.  I suggest that men may have petty spleen, and if they are empowered, without making a definite specific report as to why a person is reasonably suspected, they should not be allowed to deprive a man of his liberty.  It should not be within the power of any officer, military or police, to deprive a citizen of his or her liberty without making a definite specific report as to the reasons for so doing.  I leave it to the good sense and honour of the Seanad to see justice done to the rights of the citizen.</P>

I am informed that if in a Bill you state reasons for what courses are to be taken, and set out in writing the reasons, thereupon you place it in the competence of the Court to inquire into the sufficiency of those reasons.  Both in the Dáil and in the Seanad I have been <Col N="1584" /> strongly advised by the Attorney-General not to agree to the insertion of those words or any similar words, and that if they were to be inserted it brings it within the competence of the Courts to ask for the reasons and to inquire into their sufficiency.

      <P>1.  I am sorry to hear that you are still confined to bed.  If you were able to move round a little at all you would soon get your strength.</P>
      <P>2.  It is a splendid idea to start classes. I was never in jail very long myself, but while I was there I was absolutely fed up with the way men used to lounge around.</P>
      <P>3.  <i>Military Organisation.</i> Our time is pretty much taken up with our present difficulties, so that I have not made a very deep analysis of the real reasons for our failure.  I believe your three reasons and the fact that it was a defensive war, and that we always thought the enemy would not go so far, were the principal ones.</P>
      <P>4.  <i>That question of staff work.</i> There was too much of it done by Division O/C.'s through the country instead of by Adjutants, and there wouldn't be call for half as much if the junior officers were impressed with the necessity of sending short reports regularly.</P>
      <P>With regard to the future, I believe the rifle and revolver is out of date as an offensive weapon, and that riflemen should only be on protection for special Corps of Engineers.  The use of explosives, gas, and fire may be concentrated on, also small trench mortars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Organisation.</i> Our organisation in the past made for a lot of unnecessary duplication and staff work.  You should raise a discussion on this matter, and see if it <Col N="1585" /> would be better to have county organisation and batts., and the present divisional officers merely an operation and inspecting staff.  If we have to fight another war with the Staters, it will have to be short and sweet, and our units will need to be trained in taking the offensive in large bodies.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Non-fighting men.</i>  I am continually impressing on Divs. the fact that the lack of civilian organisation to back us up was chiefly responsible for our present position, and that it is their duty to see that our civilian supporters are organised, also that the Fianna are reorganised and trained at once.</P>

      <P>The letter read by the Minister is very impressive if not taken in connection with other facts.  We know arrests have practically ceased throughout the whole country, and there is a very shrewd suspicion abroad that the writer of that letter and other people more prominent than he are available both in Dublin and outside, but are still left at large.  It is inconceivable to think of the number of prominent men that have been left at large and the general belief is that they can be arrested.  I do not like to suggest that they are left at large as an excuse for a measure of this kind, which proposes to trample on the elementary freedom of the citizen.  The amendment is of a character that one can hardly imagine the Minister should refuse assent to.  It merely suggests that whatever Minister is responsible for the detention of the arrested person shall know from the military authority the reason why he is being interned.  Otherwise there is no use whatever for having the Minister in Parliament, alleged to be responsible for the internment of those people, when he can say he has not the slightest idea why they are interned.  All he can say is that some military captain, perhaps one with a limited experience, says that those people should be interned, and &ldquo;consequently because of this Act which you yourselves have passed I have no right to inquire into it.&rdquo;  I do not know how this would meet him.  All those reasons could be inquired into by the Civic Guard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may be; but I hope, and all the <Col N="1586" /> indications go to show that we are approaching a period when there will be no great danger to the State involved in having matters of this kind brought into the Court, and the sooner the Executive Council show they have the confidence that that time is approaching, the more likely is the restoration of normal conditions to come about.  It is this panicky legislation, such as the refusal to accept simple amendments of this kind, which keeps people on tenter-hooks, and which is injurious here and disastrous abroad. I hope notwithstanding what he has already said, that the Minister will see his way to reconsider the matter, and that the Seanad will accept the amendment, looking at the country as they know it, and record their own convictions.  There must be a tremendous censorship of the Press if the country is as bad as the Minister would lead us to believe.  We hear of terrible happenings, but very little appears in the Press.  We hear of very little violence, and we are informed no censorship is in operation.  Consequently it is only in the minds of certain people that those things may come to pass.  I believe there is no justification for passing this section, and, consequently, that the amendment moved by Senator Farren should be accepted</P>

But we also know that those things do not happen now.  This is bringing the past into the future as a kind of horoscope that what has been done in the past is to be done in the future. Until we make some effort to get some friendship into this country we will never get further, and if we pass this measure we are only pushing things further away from us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacPARTLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move as an amendment to delete Clause (<i>c</i>).  Senators will notice that Clauses (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) cover certain cases that powers are needed to deal with, and Part II. of the Schedule contains a whole litany of crimes that powers are sought to deal with.  This clause is intended to meet some particular cases which the Executive appears to be somewhat afraid to mention.  I assume that it is intended to deal probably with politicians or Labour leaders or social reformers, or other people of that type, who, in the opinion of the Executive Council, would be much better removed, and the Executive Council, apparently consider it desirable to prevent them from creating difficulties.  There is no case that could not be dealt with under the ordinary law, with the exception of the cases mentioned here, and why the Executive Council should be seeking such wide powers as are contained in Clause (<i>c</i>) I fail to understand.  If the clause is aimed at getting political opponents put out of the way, it is an unfair thing.  If it is intended to deal with social reformers, it is likewise unfair; it is unfair to leave them at the mercy of any man in the crowd, either officer or anybody else. Whatever class he sprang from, he would be paid to do a certain duty, and he would be directly bound to be opposed to the feelings of the people he is listening to.  He has the power to get them interned simply because he might not agree with their system of propaganda.  In my opinion, the powers sought here are too wide.</P>

      <P>I would like to support this amendment, for the reason that I believe the section as it stands is a further encroachment on one of the few privileges that a citizen enjoys.  It seems to me that it is handing into the hands of any Minister or the Executive the power to arrest without charge any civilian.  I hold, and I think the Seanad will agree with me, that that is not a state of affairs that should exist in this country.  There ought to be some charter of liberty for the individual.  Sub-sections (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) have already provided sufficient powers to deal with any individuals with whom it may be necessary to deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (<i>a</i>) of this sub-section deals strictly with offences mentioned in Part I. of the Schedule, and paragraph (<i>b</i>) deals with arrests made during a state of war or armed revolt.  Paragraph (<i>c</i>) deals, and is intended to deal, particularly with the question of public safety.  It deals with situations that will arise the day after the Courts decide that a condition of war or armed revolt does not exist in the country. I do not know when the Courts may decide that; I do not know when the Courts may refuse to accept the affidavit of the Adjutant-General that you have an organisation opposed to the State, that that organisation has arms and explosives at its disposal, and has refused to surrender them to the accredited representatives of the people and to those who alone have the right to control lethal weapons in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> I do not know that the Courts may decide that that state of affairs does not constitute a state of war or armed revolt. On the day after they so decide you will have a situation where people who have been in hiding for a long time may come out and work more or less openly, and unless covered by (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>) it would not be within the power of the Executive to arrest such persons.  Senators Duffy and MacPartlin suggest that paragraph (<i>a</i>) is sufficiently broad.  It does not give power to deal with people preparing for the commission of such offences or people advocating the commission of such offences.  It confines itself to people who have been committing or concerned in committing offences in Part I. of the Schedule, and people who are abusing their liberty to the detriment of the public safety.  It is really for the Senators, in a responsible spirit, as it was for the Dáil, to ask themselves whether it is right, in a situation like the present, and with the potentialities that there are for future trouble in the country, to hamper the Executive&mdash;an Executive that will be from day to day responsible to the people's representatives in the Dáil and inside two months will be responsible to the people's representatives in the Dáil, elected on the broadest possible franchise basis.  That Executive cannot remain a day in office if it has lost the confidence of the people's representatives.  It is to a body of that kind that it is proposed to entrust those powers.</P>
    <P>I have said again and again, with regard to this Bill, that theoretically it can be used as a vehicle of tyranny and a vehicle of oppression, or, as some of the Senators have called it, a coercion Bill, but I submit that is not probable, and in fact and in practice that is not possible, because the Executive that would attempt to so use it would not retain the confidence of the majority of the people's representatives.</P>
    <P>You have got to distinguish between the letter of the Bill and the spirit of the Bill in which these powers will, in fact, be exercised.  If you hamper and fetter and restrict the Executive, then you would not be entitled to complain of the results.  If no one would be arrested except people concerned in committing offences mentioned in Part I. of the Schedule, except where you have the situation of war or armed revolt, then you are hampering the Executive, and you <Col N="1590" /> are hampering it in dealing with people going around the country sowing the seeds of future war or armed revolt; in dealing with persons the most dangerous of all&mdash;the person who keeps clear from any firing line himself, but is active in stirring up revolt and stirring up conditions that will react disastrously on the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I see tremendous danger in this portion, which leaves room for the secret letter being sent by the opponents of certain people to the responsible military authority, and it then being acted upon.  Now, the liberty of the subject is all-important.  We should endeavour to provide that no subject of this nation might possibly be arrested and detained on anything but what was a fair charge.  We cannot punish people for their opinions.  We cannot imprison a man or woman for having certain opinions.  Everybody is entitled to have opinions, and I suggest that it is possible, with partisanship running so high as it is in this country at the moment, that a person who would be guilty of no crime&mdash;persons who would conscientiously and honestly have their convictions and work for them in a constitutional way, would be arrested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that, if you go to the utmost of the terms that are proposed in this Bill, it is quite possible that such people might be deprived of their liberty. I do not suggest for a moment that the Executive would use these powers harshly, but the Minister has admitted that it could be used as a measure of coercion.  The Minister admits that.  I have been trying in my own way to put that before this Seanad and it is quite possible, if this Bill is passed, that it can be used as a measure of tyranny to deprive the subjects of this nation of their liberty.  Now, that is a very serious thing.  To take away the liberty of a subject is a very serious thing, and I respectfully suggest that the Minister is not taking the proper view of the position. The Minister seems to think that there is quite a possibility that there may be a recurrence of trouble in this country.  I suppose it is quite natural that the Minister, having been, as he has been, a member of the Executive during the past twelve months, would not be taking the same view as a person outside, moving amongst the people, would take.  As one <Col N="1591" /> who travels about the country, I think the danger of a recurrence of war is over.  I think that our people have got such a sickener and horror of war, and horror and a distaste against everything appertaining to war and the gun, that it will be a long time before the people of this country will go into war again, whether it be war amongst themselves or war against any other nation.  Therefore, I do not see the necessity for taking these powers. For the good name of the country I sincerely hope that this clause will not be passed.  I think it would be a blot on our civilisation to pass this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be a good thing if the Minister would give us some idea as to the distinction between (<i>a</i>) and (<i>c</i>) in regard to the powers which are claimed.  I think it would be well if he would consider whether, if this clause is retained, there might not be words inserted which might meet one, at any rate, of the points which some of the Labour Senators have raised.  They want to make it clear that constitutional action, even in a direction which some of us might think would not be for the public good, would not be interfered with. &ldquo;Public safety&rdquo; is a pretty wide term&mdash; much wider than in most of the other sections in the Bill.  Therefore, I think that the Minister might consider between this and the next stage whether some other words might not be introduced which would be somewhat more limiting than the words &ldquo;public safety.&rdquo;  Most of the other powers are given either for definitely endangering the State, as in Part 1, or for the offences mentioned in Part 2 of the schedule, which you have in Section 2.  In this case you have the <Col N="1592" /> vague powers simply of &ldquo;public safety,&rdquo; and I think these are words which would cause some uneasiness.  I can quite understand the desire of the Minister to be able to use the powers in Sub-section (<i>a</i>) in reference to persons who might not actually have formed military units, or might not technically come under Part 1. At the same time, I see the point of the Labour Senators that &ldquo;public safety&rdquo; might be taken by some Minister&mdash;and we cannot be sure of the Minister we may have&mdash;to include offences which it is not desirable should be dealt with except by means of a Court.  Personally, I can conceive of persons making speeches which, in my opinion, do not help the public safety; but unless they advocate armed violence, or violence of some kind, I am not prepared to intern them for the speeches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point which I think some of those present, including the Minister, seem to be overlooking. As has already been pointed out, Sub-section (<i>a</i>) deals with armed revolt and Sub-section (<i>b</i>) deals with a state of war.  In addition to that, Part 2 of the Schedule contains a litany of all the possible crimes that could be committed against the public safety.  Section 2 of this Bill reads: &ldquo;It shall be lawful for a responsible officer to arrest and to detain in custody for any period not exceeding one week, any person found committing or attempting to commit, or whom such officer suspects of having committed, any of the offences mentioned in Part 2 of the Schedule to this Act.&rdquo; It goes on to state that at the expiration of one week the Minister shall have power to intern that man without trial for any of the crimes mentioned in Part 2 of the Schedule.  What other crime is there that a person could commit against the public safety in addition to these that cannot be dealt with under the ordinary law, unless the Executive are to have the power to intern everybody whom they may wish and keep them there without trial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what state of mind the draftsmen of the Bill were in when they put in Sub-section 3.  It seems utterly unnecessary, and sweeps away the last vestige of protection remaining to the individual citizen.  It leaves it open to any evil-minded individual to lock up a large section of the community.  It leaves it <Col N="1593" /> open to Ministers deeply imbued with political ideas and vigorously opposed to their opponents, to lock up at crucial periods some of their opponents merely on the strength of a report under this sub-section. It is too dangerously wide altogether as it stands, and it does not seem necessary.  It seems a gross abuse of private liberty altogether.  I do not believe that the suggestion of Senator Douglas is practicable, and I hope the mover of the amendment will not accept any amendment, such as to put in other words for &ldquo;public safety,&rdquo; because, I believe, the only way to amend this is to delete the sub-section altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Principles of liberty are easily stated, and Senators have been stating absolute principles of liberty with a certain glibness, forgetting that people enjoy the maximum of liberty by agreeing between themselves to surrender a certain amount; forgetting that men live together in society by each making certain concessions to all; Senator Farren agreeing not to exercise his liberty of throwing stones through my window, and I making a reciprocal concession, and so on.  There are times when, in order to enjoy liberty and security, it is necessary to give up more than in normal times; to surrender to the Committee of the people, which is called the Executive Council, greater rights and powers than would be surrendered in normal, hum-drum, routine times.  That is the principle underlying the whole of this Bill, that the decent, law-abiding people of the country, in order that security may be restored for them, in order that they may sleep of nights, in order that we may get back to the day when a man can leave his door on the latch, entrust to their Committee or Executive Council larger powers than it is usual normally to entrust to such an Executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are broad powers that are asked for in this Bill.  They are not considered excessive, having regard to the circumstances of the times and of the possibilities of the future.  I am asked what kind of case would come under Sub-section (<i>c</i>) as distinct from (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), and I am reminded that &ldquo;public safety&rdquo; is a vague word.  It is a vague word.  But the body in the country that has the duty of interpreting where public safety lies in any particular case is the Executive Council.  If its interpretation is wise, <Col N="1594" /> if it is an interpretation that appeals to the common-sense of the majority of the people's representatives, that Executive Council will remain in office.  If its interpretation is unwise, if it is harsh, if it is tyrannical, if it is oppressive, presumably that Executive Council will not retain the confidence of the majority of the people's representatives.  I do base the whole case for this Bill on that&mdash;that its powers are to be exercised by an Executive responsible from day to day, and from week to week, to the people through their representatives.  That is democracy; that is representative government.</P>
    <P>I could not state offhand the exact cases that might, in a given set of circumstances, come under (<i>c</i>) as distinct from (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>).  Let us take a purely hypothetical case.  Sub-section (<i>a</i>) gives power to arrest and detain without trial people on reasonable suspicion of participation in the offences mentioned in Part 1 of the Schedule.  Sub-section (<i>b</i>) deals with arrests made during a state of war or armed revolt.  My attention was drawn by Senator Cummins to Part 2 of the Schedule, with which Section 2 of the Bill deals.  What about the people advocating the offences mentioned in Part 2 of the Schedule, or, for that matter, advocating the offences mentioned in Part 1 of the Schedule?  The arrests mentioned in (<i>a</i>) are for participation in the acts mentioned in Part 1 of the Schedule. The arrests mentioned in (<i>b</i>) are for active participation in the offences mentioned in Part 2.  What about the man who goes around the country advocating both one and the other, or advocating either for that matter?  Let us take one item in Part 5: Wrongful entry and retention of possession of land without colour or pretence to title or authority.  A man who does that may be arrested under Section 2 of the Bill.  The only provision you have for the man who goes around inciting to these offences is paragraph (<i>c</i>) of Section 1.  Public safety is a broad term. The interpretation of it would not be the same in one set of circumstances as it would in altered circumstances.  The body that must interpret it from day to day and decide where public safety lies is the Executive Council, and that body holds office from the representatives of the people.  It cannot hold office one day or one hour longer than it succeeds in retaining the confidence of the majority of the people's representatives.</P>

      <P>I think I can assist the Minister if I draw his attention to Section 12 of Part 2 of the Schedule.  He has mentioned that the only thing which occurs to him at the moment as left out of this Schedule is the encouraging or advocating the commission of any of the crimes mentioned in Parts 1 and 2 of the Schedule.  Section 12 reads: &ldquo;Aiding, abetting, assisting in or encouraging the commission of any of the offences mentioned in this Schedule, or helping in the concealment or escape of any person guilty of any such offence.&rdquo;  That certainly covers the cases mentioned by the Minister but he might have overlooked it for the moment.

      <P>After listening to a good many of the speeches that we have heard, one would think that all danger has passed in this country, and that we are living in a state of perfect peace.  Unfortunately, I must say that is not my experience.  I know that peace does not exist yet in spite of the efforts of the Government and of the forces that are working for peace in the country.  Houses are being visited and raided still.  We are urged to reject the advice of our present Government, who have succeeded in giving us the amount of peace we now have. I really cannot understand how the Seanad could be asked to accept an amendment which predicts a state of peace which most of us know does not exist.  We hope it will exist; but for the Seanad to say to the Government, &ldquo;We will not take your advice as to the essential requirements of the present state of the country, but will take away from you the weapon that you say from your experience is necessary for the public safety,&rdquo; would be acting against the best interest of public safety.  I, for one, cannot see how we can take the advice of those who have not got the experience and do not know what the country requires, in preference to the advice of the Ministers who have charge of the country and know the dangers with which we are confronted.</P>

      <P>Senator Jameson's information is quite different from what I have heard, and is quite different from what the Ministers themselves state. Ministers themselves state the country is quiet.  The Postmaster-General stated the other day at Athlone that there was less crime in Ireland than in any country in Europe.  These things may or <Col N="1596" /> may not be true.  I have not been all over the country, and I do not know, but, judging from the newspapers and from what people tell you, my information does not agree with Senator Jameson.  He might be right.  I do not know where he gets his information.  With regard to the Minister's statement about the representatives of the nation turning out the Government if they do not do what is right, I do not think that is our experience of party government at all.  Party Government, I am afraid, is not better than any other form of government.  If a party intends to back a Minister, it does so through thick and thin, whether he is right or wrong, not only here, but in England and everywhere else.  The party backs him, and the Minister sails along until the election comes, and that Government is turned out of office.</P>

They are all the more serious because we have not found the people coming forward to give evidence as to the commission of these crimes.  As to the amendment before the Seanad, I cannot see the particular and cowardly crime of inciting others to commit offences mentioned in the list.

That has not been the attitude that Senator Jameson took on other Bills in which his own party were interested.  I think I remember him putting forward certain amendments to certain Bills.  In connection with the Land Bill I have also seen people putting forward amendments.  We have the same right, especially if the object is to make the Government more popular than it is.  I believe this section is encroaching too much on the liberty of the people.  I believe there is plenty of power in the Bill to cover all the crimes that the Government wishes to cover.  If we are to take the line suggested by Senator Jameson, the best thing we could do is to dissolve the Seanad and the Dáil and let the Government manage the show.</P>

      <P>I beg to move: To delete in line 2, the words &ldquo;from a responsible officer, or.&rdquo;  This follows naturally on Amendment 2, which was passed by the Seanad.  I take out responsible officers, and leave in paragraph (<i>c</i>)&mdash;namely, that the Minister receives reports from the military authorities as distinct from a military officer.  It is entirely in consonance with the argument adopted in regard to (<i>a</i>), which was passed.</P>

      <P>I think this amendment scarcely follows on the amendment which was accepted, and which was an agreement to leave out any reference to a report, and place the responsibility on the Minister to act on his own initiative.  Paragraph (<i>c</i>) retains mention of a report, and provides that people may during this middle period be interned without trial if a report is received that they are abusing their liberty and that it is a danger to the public that they should remain at liberty.  If that is right, if we decide to put in this Bill the powers of internment of persons who are abusing their liberty, then I see no reason why the police should be excluded, and that a report to that effect should be strictly confined to military sources. The police will shortly be established in 807 stations throughout the country. One may assume, if the improvement in affairs be progressive, that the military will be gradually withdrawn from the country, and concentrated in larger centres here and there.  It is simply a case that if we decide to intern at all, if we think this transitional period demands internment without trial, that internment should be possible on a police report. I share to a certain extent the reluctance of Senator Douglas to bring the police into what some might consider a temporary Act arising out of the political situation, but surely the police are the guardians of the people, and, even more than the military, they are concerned with the question of the public peace and safety, and if a Minister is to intern on report that an individual citizen is abusing his liberty there is no case for excluding a police report, and saying that it must emanate from a military source.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is right to this extent to bring it into conformity with (<i>a</i>), and that the words &ldquo;military authority&rdquo; should go out. That would leave it open to the Minister as in (<i>a</i>) to use the source he thinks best. I agree that the public safety is the business of the police, but I want the Civic Guards, so far as their responsibility is concerned to carry out the ordinary law which, in the future, they will be expected to carry out.  I do not know whether I would be allowed to alter my amendment, and substitute different words so as to conform with (<i>a</i>).</P>

      <P>I am sorry to find that people who continuously remind us that they do not belong to any one party &mdash;that they are simply national representatives with a broad and national aspect&mdash; again remind us that they are going to do nothing but take the word of the Minister, who, of course, represents a party.  It is deplorable that in an Assembly of this kind people do not exercise a little more liberty of conscience.  It is extraordinary that this body could not be convinced of the necessity of accepting the amendment I have referred to.  The Minister was not very strongly opposed to it, and if he could only have got a little encouragement from the people who mistakenly supported him he would have accepted it. For that reason I am going to vote against the section, and I hope that the panic displayed in other places will not be displayed here, and that Senator Jameson's dictum that the Government must be the best-informed body, and that they are the people who know best, is not to be <Col N="1600" /> followed out in this Seanad.  It is ludicrous to bring us here at all if we are simply to carry out what the Minister says.  I know Senator Jameson does not always do it when it does not suit him. Yet he queries the right of us to inquire into the merits of the Bill, and advises us to let it go by the board.  The Government said it was necessary, and consequently we must do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Senator O'Farrell is quite justified in his remarks.  It is not for me to interpret for Senator Jameson, but I do not think the attitude taken here is one of stating that whatever the Government proposes is what should be accepted.  I only make the remark simply because Senator O'Farrell's statement was received in silence and no one refuted it.  But in other discussions it has been frequently stated and repudiated.  There are a great many amendments to this Bill, which proves that a great many of us are not satisfied with this Bill.  At the same time, I think a Senator has the right to follow the Government if he likes.  When he says so, I do not think there is any right to say that he is not following his conscience.  I deprecate that statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the whole section, and I think I will have the opportuniy of saying now what I wanted to say before.  I am opposed to the whole section because it gives the right to the Minister or his responsible officers to take away from the subject liberty without trial.  I am sorry the Government have taken the view-point they have, because I think they are alarmed needlessly.  I do not think there is such cause for alarm.  I do not suggest that an ordinary person going through the country can see a wonderful change.  Notwithstanding the letter read to-day, I believe there will be no further necessity for having such a Bill.  I am not looking forward to the immediate present.  A precedent will be set if we pass this Bill that will give responsible Government the power to deprive a citizen of his liberty without charge or trial.  For that reason I am opposed to this section of the Bill.  I will not say anything further, except that I hope, when Senator O'Farrell is in the position now occupied by Deputy O'Higgins, he will get the same amount of support, when there is a Labour Government in <Col N="1601" /> power.  All those suggestions were made on a previous occasion here&mdash;that it was quite possible under the Bill that it could be used for the advantage of the present Executive.  The present Government might not be likely to take advantage of the powers, and the suggestion was made that they felt sure that if a Farmers' Government were in power they would not take advantage of the powers, but in the case of the Labour Party there was some doubt.  I think there is just as great a sense of justice among labour people as any other section of the community, and they would not abuse any power.  I would make a last despairing appeal to the Minister on this point, because I believe in future, when we have got over the present little trouble, we would not like to have inserted on the Statute Book of <Col N="1602" /> the First Oireachtas a measure of this kind.  For that reason, and for the good of the country, I would press upon him carefully to consider the points we have brought under his notice.  When all the trouble if over, let us be in a position to look back on this thing with satisfaction, and not be sorry for what we have done.</P>

      <P>Section 2, Sub-section (2): To insert after the word &ldquo;custody,&rdquo; in line 12, the words &ldquo;for a period not extending beyond the limit of the duration of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My reason for moving this amendment is the fact that this Bill is temporary.  It might happen that a person would be sentenced to nine or twelve months' imprisonment. I do not think it was the intention of the Minister that at any time such a thing would happen, but to make it clear that it would not be possible for such a thing to happen I move the insertion of those words.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's namesake in the Dáil moved an amendment to this effect, and it was not accepted, simply because it is not in reason that the powers of detention without trial which spring from this Bill could survive the Bill.  Those powers would not exist but for the Bill, and when the Bill expires the powers conferred by it will expire also.  No one could imagine the State Counsel coming into Court and pleading as justification for the detention of a person without trial the Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Bill, if that Bill had expired.  If it has meantime expired, such a defence to a <i>habeas corpus action</i><Col N="1604" /> would be simply scoffed out of Court, and the words &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Act&rdquo; which appear in that sub-section are considered ample.  My reasons, therefore, for not accepting the Senator's amendment are identical with the reasons given for not accepting a similar amendment in the Dáil.  I believe the amendment is absolutely unnecessary, and the words suggested would be a blot on the draftsmanship of the Bill.  The words are not necessary; they are  superfluous. The Attorney-General has advised in this matter, and has stated that an amendment of that kind could not be accepted, because it would seem to imply a belief or opinion that the powers conferred by the Bill could last beyond the lifetime of the Bill itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the fact that the amendment will do no harm, it will relieve a great deal of doubt in the public mind.  People interned under this Bill, when it becomes an Act, may be, in the words of a Minister, left in until they rot.  That is one of the reasons why this amendment should be accepted, apart altogether from that which will be the position quite definitely, and avoiding a good deal of litigation and legal proceedings afterwards.  That will be the effect of having this amendment accepted.  I do not know why the Minister should stand so strong against it.  Even if he states it is the intention of the Government, it may not add to the artistic side of the draftsmanship, but that drawback will be counterbalanced and the drawbacks will be balanced by the amount of doubts which it will remove.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The view simply is that under this Bill a person could not be kept interned without trial for a single day longer than the lifetime of the Bill. The objection to putting in any reference such as the Senator suggests to a period is that internment is not for a period.  It <Col N="1605" /> is simply a business from day to day, under the powers of the Bill, and to suggest that a man could be interned with reference to some fixed period is wrong. It is wrong in principle.  The whole idea of the Bill is a deterrent detention as distinct from a punitive imprisonment.  Men interned to-day might, if the situation appreciably altered, be released in three or four weeks' time.  There is no suggestion that people interned will be kept in for the six months.  They may be released sooner than six months.  The reference to a fixed period in connection with internment is wrong, because it suggests the same as a fixed sentence.  Now, the Law Advisers of the Government are absolutely of opinion, and the Senators may make their minds easy about it, that there would be no power in the Government to hold people detained without trial for a single day beyond the lifetime of the Bill.  The reasons for refusing the amendment are simply the reasons I have stated&mdash;that to insert it would be a blot on the draftsmanship of the Bill.  The words are utterly superfluous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">

      <P>The Minister is rather conflicting in his statement.  He stated that no person arrested under this can be kept a day after the Bill expires, or a day longer than the Bill is in operation. In rising to speak on the last occasion he stated that, if he accepted it, this would mean that every person interned would have to be released.  Do I take it that the Minister gives it as his opinion, according to his legal advisers, that any person arrested and interned or imprisoned under this Act will, on the expiration of this Act, have to be charged and tried, or released?</P>

      <P>The Senator's amendment is unacceptable.  As to the point in the certificate at all, that question was raised in the Dáil, and the mover of an amendment which called for a definite record simply stated that he wanted, at least, to ensure that there would be that much trouble taken about the thing that a Minister would set his hand to a statement that &ldquo;A B&rdquo; was considered to be abusing his liberty to the detriment of the public peace and safety.  It is the merest formal check on irresponsible action by any subordinate of the Ministry. To drag the Courts into it, to suggest that a certificate should be sent to the Judge of the High Court, is not in keeping with the spirit of the Bill&mdash;a temporary Emergency Bill, which legalises deterrent detention, which legalises detention without trial for a period of six months, during a difficult transition period from conditions of anarchy to what we hope may develop to be normal peaceful conditions.  The exact value of the certificate might be <Col N="1608" /> difficult to say.  It will at least be a Departmental record of the fact that the Minister assented to detention and concurred with the propriety of the detention of the individual concerned.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;&ldquo;Section 2, Sub-section (2): To insert at the end of the sub-section the words &lsquo;a copy to be handed to the prisoner.&rsquo;&rdquo; The Minister the other day animadverted on a statement of mine that it was the Bastille, and said I was apparently very badly acquainted with the history of France.  That, in his opinion, may be so or not.  As far as I know, subject to the Minister's contradiction, it is the very essence of the Bastille, and why it was called that, is that a person could be put into the Bastille without any definite charge being made against him, simply on the work of the King.  That is exactly what is happening here.  That is the essence of the thing being called a Bastille, and the essence of it here as well as in France.  I want to get out of that to a certain extent by prescribing that the prisoner himself should be given a copy of the charge, so that when the case comes before the Appeal Committee he will be able to say: &ldquo;These things are quite incorrect; such and such charge is not correct, and I can prove it.&rdquo;  If he comes before the Committee and does not know what he is charged with, how can he argue against it?</P>

      <P>I support the amendment.  I think it is the very essence of justice to state that a man shall at least know what he has been deprived of his liberty for.  Many things have happened in this country during the last few years that some time ago we thought would have been impossible, but there are things proposed in this Bill which we thought no Irish Government would ever think of proposing.  It is a repetition of the old kidnapping by the Czar's police of politicians and others, hiding them away in the cellars of Moscow, and not allowing them even to know why they were kidnapped.  It may be said that this is exaggerating the position, but there are all the powers to do acts of that kind here&mdash;filch prisoners away, pitch them into internment camps or prisons, and not even tell them why they <Col N="1609" /> are being kept there.  It is certainly not asking too much that persons taken away in these circumstances shall have a statement of the reasons why they are being interned.  The Minister is to certify in writing that the man is being detained for certain reasons.  Where is the object or the justice in withholding these reasons from the persons interned.  I hope that this will receive more consideration than other amendments of an equally reasonable character.  The desire is to make the Bill as reasonable or mild as can be expected in the circumstances, and amendments of this kind should not be treated as hostile and turned down by a dead-weight vote without giving them serious consideration.  It may be a display of force, but it is not a display of strength or statesmanship.</P>

      <P>It was contemplated that in practice, under this Bill, an Order would be served on the persons to be detained and the Order would set out in general terms the reasons for the detention.  But words have been used which seem to suggest a confusion of thought One Senator used the word &ldquo;charge&rdquo;&mdash;that it is unheard of that a man should be arrested without charge, particularly as he will be coming up later before this Court of Appeal. Both the words &ldquo;charge&rdquo; and &ldquo;Court of Appeal&rdquo; show misconception of the provisions and of the purpose of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There will be no charge, there will be no trial, and no Court of Appeal.  There will be an Advisory Council or Committee before which detained persons will be at liberty to appear, if they feel that a mistake has been made, and that the public safety does not, in effect, require their detention.  They will have an opportunity of showing and endeavouring to convince reasonable men of that.  Any suggestion that this Council is to be in the nature of a Court, or that there is to be a trial, is out of harmony with the entire object of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators know, or ought to know, that <Col N="1610" /> against some of the most dangerous people within our jurisdiction at the moment it would be utterly impossible to formulate a charge, or to sustain that charge with evidence.  Senators know that it requires a rather higher degree of both moral and physical courage than, in fact, prevails to enable evidence to be brought forward against the people who are of most danger to the State.  The reference to the Czarist police and all that is on a par with the reference to penal provisions against clergymen in the past that was used when discussing the flogging section of this Bill.  In fact, we were dealing with penalties for people who were found guilty on indictment of the crimes of arson and robbery under arms.  There is no analogy; but if you are going to make seven or eight men responsible for order and peace and stability and decency of life in this country, then you must give these seven or eight men very wide powers for dealing with the situation that exists and that may develop.  No men will face the task, no men will accept the primary responsibility to the people for restoring order and stability here, and solving the social problems that exist, unless they are given wide powers, answering for the use of these powers to the Dáil.  No detailed charge will be served on persons arrested under the provision of this Bill but they will be served with an order for detention, stating in general terms the reasons that prompted the Executive to secure their arrest and detain them temporarily.</P>

      <P>I was going to suggest that the Executive Council could not possibly be in touch with the conduct of all people likely to be interned under this Bill.  They will only be acting on the advice of certain people, and I suggest that it is not right to give such power.  If people do wrong, it is not right to do wrong to other people.  Because certain sections of the community do wrong, it is not right to pass a law that will leave it in the power of anyone to deprive others of their liberty without just and sufficient reason being given.  The more we get into this Bill the more we see that it certainly denies the right of the citizen.  It is all very well to serve a printed document informing a citizen that he is being detained because of so and so.  That is not fair treatment.  There ought to be some evidence as to the reason why people are going to be detained.  I think that is the least they are entitled to get. It is quite possible that an innocent man or woman may be arrested and detained under this Bill.  If only for the sake of one or two persons that might be illegally imprisoned we ought not to pass this Bill. I think the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move the following in Section 3, Sub-section 1: &ldquo;To insert after the words &lsquo;those authorities,&rsquo; in line 30, the words &lsquo;certify in writing that for stated reasons they.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is doigh liom nach gadh moran cainnt ar an run so mar bhí an cheist ceadna againn cheana.  The same arguments apply to that as to some of the previous clauses, where we ask that the matter should be put down in writing.  The arguments that those words would bring the case before the Courts are of very doubtful validity.  The intention of the amendment would be that the military authorities would state something definite for the Minister to go upon.  This amendment, I understand, was accepted in the Committee Stage in the Dáil, and was taken out on the Report Stage.  A very distinguished legal authority there did not, I understand, agree with the Minister's advisers that the amendment would leave it open to the Courts to enquire into the reasons.  It is a matter for this Seanad to judge for themselves.  I think if they come with an impartial and open mind to the matter they will be in favour of not having this matter so vague.  I think it is a very dangerous thing that the unqualified statement of the Minister should be accepted.  It should be remembered, of course, that this deals with prisoners in custody, and that their position can hardly be affected very much by any sporadic outbreaks of war in any particular locality.  That seems to be the fear of the Minister.  The amendment, I think, is a very moderate one.  It simply asks why they are keeping a particular individual in custody.  We have been told that great numbers have been already released.  I have no doubt whatever that many more could be released without any danger to the State.  I believe in times of excitement it is known that many a fellow who was absolutely harmless in himself, except perhaps that he had a loose tongue and talked flippantly of the Government, was arrested on the unsupported statement of young and inexperienced military officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fellows went on the run, and remained on the run for a few weeks, and came back with an enlarged beard and an extra growth of whiskers from their sojourn in the wilds.  They were regarded as popular heroes, and were stuck into prison.  I have no doubt many of those could be released <Col N="1614" /> with advantage to the State.  Men and women are detained without trial for very long periods.  The case of those men may not have been sufficiently investigated by the officers responsible for their arrest.  Other officers got into control, and mistakes are liable to occur, and great injustice as a consequence results to some of those people.  We have no appreciation for the fellow up against the State, and it would be suggested that every attempt to amend this Bill is a direct act of opposition against the Government in their efforts to maintain peace in the State.  I repudiate all such insinuations as that.  It is an effort on our part to popularise the present form of government and to make people feel that while due protection is being extended to them, at the same time none of the rights extended to citizens in all parts of the world shall be filched from them by that Act.  Executives come into power and perpetrate grave acts of injustice in the name of justice before they can be removed. It is our object not to leave it in the power of anyone to do this without being immediately brought to book in the matter.  To justify such detention a statement should be made in writing that for reasons set forth the detention of the prisoner is a matter of military necessity. This would ensure that prisoners may not be detained without reasonable cause. The amendment cannot in any way affect the utility of the Bill or curtail the powers the Executive have taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to urge the Minister to accept this amendment. We have heard statements to the effect that large numbers of prisoners have been released every week.  If that is the case, there must be some specific reason for detaining the others.  Is it too much to ask that those reasons should be stated in writing by the military officers who detain them?  It is reported that, because of the confusion that existed for some considerable time during the conflict, and because of transfers of responsible officers from one district to another, there are large numbers of prisoners interned, and that no one has the slightest idea why they are interned.  The mere fact is that they were arrested, and the people responsible for their arrest having left the Army or been transferred, nobody can say on what suspicion they were arrested or for what cause they are being <Col N="1615" /> detained.  It is time that that position was investigated to some extent, and that some enquiries should be made into the detention of people who did not play a prominent part in the recent struggle. Those people did not play a prominent part at all, and their neighbours are well aware that they were never connected with any movement.  That is causing a great amount of discontent, and it is  the case of those people that this amendment would apply.  It is a reasonable proposition, and in normal times to refuse it would be looked upon as tyrannical to the last degree.</P>

      <P>I would accept this amendment if the words &ldquo;for stated reasons&rdquo; were left out.  I have already explained the objection to those words. Senator Cummins has stated that one eminent lawyer disagreed with the opinion of the Government's advisers. Lawyers are apt to disagree, but it is not a matter that we could leave in doubt. If we are to set down in the Bill in that way that reasons for the detention of a prisoner should be stated, the principle is that the claims could be put forward that the Courts have power to examine into the sufficiency or otherwise of those reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators who have talked about persons detained in recent months should know, or ought to know, that 75 per cent. of the persons detained were taken in arms, and they know that the only condition precedent to the sympathetic consideration of a prisoner's release was an undertaking from that prisoner that he would not take up arms against the lawfully elected Government of the people, and that he would respect the rights of his fellow-citizens and not injure the property or person of his neighbour.  That was the only condition we insisted on before we were prepared to give very careful and sympathetic consideration to the question of releasing prisoners.  The vast majority of the prisoners have refused to give any such undertaking, and it is substantially true to say that they hold the keys of their own cells.  No one wants to keep those men living parasitically on their country, costing roughly £1 per head per week, for a single day longer than is necessary.  The lists of prisoners are being scrutinised with a view to releasing as many as it is considered possible in a responsible <Col N="1616" /> spirit to release.  It will depend on whether the improvement that is taking place for the last couple of months goes on progressively, and it will depend on the powers it is thought fit to give the Executive.  If the powers are narrow, we will be forced into a conscientious discharge of our stewardship to the  to take up a conservative attitude on the release of prisoners.  It is true that there is a good deal of information at our disposal that we have not thought fit to communicate either to the Dáil, Seanad, or the people generally.</P>
    <P>We would be glad that an improved commercial atmosphere in the country would continue to improve.  We would be glad that the kind of faith cure that is taking place in the country would continue to take place.  At the same time there is information at our disposal showing a very delicate and highly explosive position, and we have to keep at least one eye on that.  It is proposed to release in the near future as many prisoners as it is thought proper, with due regard to the public safety.  Before the elections we will try to release every man whom it is considered safe to release, and it is not fair to suggest that we are out to lock up anti-Government votes, as was suggested here the other day.  There are two sides to the shield, and we have to watch those two sides.  If the Senator who moved the amendment would leave out the words &ldquo;for stated reasons,&rdquo; I would be prepared to accept it.  But there is a technicality there, and it is at least doubtful that if these were inserted the Court would not claim that they had full power to call for those reasons and to examine them.</P>

That is to say, the Minister claims the right, even where they sign a document, to keep them interned.  That is one of the main reasons why others have not signed documents.  When they see that those <Col N="1617" /> who have signed documents are not let out, they say: &ldquo;Well, there is no reason why we should sign a thing like that and put ourselves in the way of doing a thing we dislike.  Those who have signed have not been let out after all.&rdquo;  I do not think it is quite fair to let the public believe <Col N="1618" /> that if people sign they will be let out.

      <P>To insert after the words &ldquo;such Minister,&rdquo; in lines 35-36, the words &ldquo;certifies in writing that for stated reasons he.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is somewhat similar to the last one, only the Executive Minister is the authority.  I see no reason at all why my amendment could not be accepted.  Probably legal phrases are very tricky, and so peculiar that maybe, while the Minister refused to accept it in the last case, he would accept it in this.  I would like to emphasise the fact that this is dealing with people already interned, and the Minister has stated both in the Dáil and here that great numbers of men are being released.  Now, if there is no reason for keeping those men in gaol, there must be some reason for keeping the others; and if there is some reason, I do not see why it should not be stated.  I do not see why these men should not be told why they are kept in.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would do the Government any harm, and, in so far as blaming them for not signing the documents is concerned, the Minister knows as well as any other Irishman that there has been an objection to signing any documents in this country for some years back.  The very same feeling prevails with the men now interned as prevailed two or three years ago.  I do not say they are the same class of men, or that the fight is of the same character, but they are Irishmen all the same, and they feel that signing any documents means some class of humiliation.  Senator Colonel Moore has said many signed, and it did not do them much good.  It does not appear that signing the document is any particular advantage to the men interned.  The other night I met one of the members of the Dáil who was looking after the interests of a Government supporter who was interned.  He was trying to find out why the man was interned.  There was no one who could give particulars of the man's arrest.  I do not know whether anything has been found out yet.  If there was some reason stated as to why the man was arrested and interned, he might be able to make some move for his release.  Perhaps the Minister could see his way to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I make the same offer as I made to the Senator who moved the last amendment.  I will accept the amendment minus the words &ldquo;for stated reasons.&rdquo;  I said no more with regard to the form of undertaking than that it was a consideration precedent to the consideration of a prisoner's release.  In any case <Col N="1619" /> where that form had been signed a careful and sympathetic consideration is given to the prisoner's case.  We released men who signed those forms, and they took up arms again.  As soon as our faith in human nature got a few little shocks of that kind we were a little more careful.  Some men signed the form with a view to getting out and renewing their activities, but they were disappointed to find that the signing of the form was not the master key to their cell doors.  All cases in which documents are signed are carefully considered.  We look at every case from the angle that a man wants to get out to lead a decent life.</P>

      <P>I think no harm will be done by the acceptance of the amendment.  When the Minister stated that 75 per cent of those who were taken were taken under arms, he made a very alarming statement.  The general impression is that only a small number had arms, and that fully three-fourths of them were taken without arms.  The people who were taken without arms are the people we are anxious about.  We do not want to turn adrift people who will turn their hands against the State.  No prisoners should be kept longer than is humanly necessary, and they should be told why they are being kept, so that they will be able to make an effort to clear themselves of any charges made against them, and to prove that those charges are false.</P>

Some Senators may view their sense of responsibility as coming here and simply passing as rapidly as possible, particular measures.  We have another sense of responsibility which is equally important from our point of view.  To say that we are simply obstructing or holding up the public business is altogether beside the mark.  We claim the right to discuss every measure, however necessary, and to challenge divisions.  We have challenged divisions because of the statement made by the Cathaoirleach that when a clause is not amended it is taken for granted there is general agreement upon it.  Because of the very serious nature of the Bill, and of the serious in-roads it makes on the liberty of the subject and the <Col N="1622" /> citizen generally, we think it our duty to record our votes properly on every section.</P>

I merely throw out the suggestion as the question has not arisen in the Seanad before.

The present discussion is the result of an appeal by a certain section of the Seanad to another section suggesting that they should be content as regards the amendments with a show of hands, and as regards the sections with a division.

    <P>(6)  An Executive Minister shall make regulations for the execution by Appeal Councils of the functions imposed on them by this section, and the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; where used in this section means prescribed by such regulations. Any such regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made, and if either House of the Oireachtas shall pass a resolution annulling the regulations, the regulations shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything already done under them.</P>

There is a precedent for an arrangement of this kind in Commissions set up in another place for the purpose of dealing with this question of people who are in prison for political offences.  This is a very peculiar Bill, and some of us who feel it our duty to vote for it do not like it any the more for that.  It would have a very good effect on public opinion in the case of an incarcerated man if a Commission were appointed having as its chairman possibly, or one of its members, a person with the authority of one of our Judges.  That would remove any legitimate objection that might be made to a revising tribunal in these cases.

      <P>The tendency seems to be to give this Advisory Council or Committee the complexion of a Court, and to make it obligatory that one of its three members shall be a Judge of the High Court would increase and emphasise that aspect.  In point of fact, it is not a Court, and it is not proposed formally to charge persons detained.  The idea is that detained persons should have an opportunity of going before three reasonable fellow-citizens and rebutting or attempting to rebut the suggestion that the public safety in any way requires their detention.  It is considered advisable that one of three members should <Col N="1626" /> have some legal knowledge&mdash;some kind of training that would enable him to summarise facts and appreciate evidence accurately&mdash;but it is not a Court.  Apart from everything else, I would ask Senators to dwell on the question of the advisability of putting a highly-salaried Judge of the High Court on to work of this kind.  The persons detained will be persons against whom the Executive Council feel perfectly satisfied that there is reasonable suspicion of acts which endanger the foundations of the State and the foundations of Society.  The proposal to set a gentleman with a salary of £2,000 or £3,000 a year on the work of hearing appeals from people of that class is doubtful wisdom and doubtful finance. Any barrister of four or five or six years' standing is capable of doing all that is required of members of that Advisory Council.</P>

      <P>May I ask whether there would be any way, short of appointing a Judge of the High Court, to strengthen these Councils?  This is the only Appeal Council that is being suggested for the prisoners, and I think it ought to be suggested to the Minister that he should consider the advisability of strengthening the Council, if it is at all possible to do so.  A Judge of the High Court would undoubtedly be a very high official to bring into the matter, but there may be somebody not quite as high as that.  Of course, this would entirely rely on the Attorney-General's opinion, and no doubt the Attorney-General would select some sound man of legal experience. I think the Ministry would not be wrong in suggesting so many years' experience, so that we would be sure of getting a qualified person.</P>

      <P>As a general thing it can be understood that the Appeal Council will be supplied with fuller information than would be supplied to the prisoners.  There are obvious reasons for that.  Prisoners may ask to appeal before the Council simply with a view to ascertaining the source of the evidence on which they were arrested.  It would not be wise to put into the hands of such prisoner the <i>dossier</i> of his case.  Prisoners appearing before the Council will be left under no illusions as to the general nature of the suspicions which rest on them, and the considerations which led to their arrest and detention.  The important point is that this is not a tribunal in the ordinary sense of the word.  A prisoner coming before that body takes on himself the onus of convincing three reasonable men that there was no reason for detaining him.  These people will have at their disposal accurate information as to his arrest.  They may put questions to the prisoner on that <i>dossier</i>, and will give him such information as it is considered wise and safe to impart to him.  By safe, I mean proper protection for citizens who may have given information for their own protection and the protection of the community generally. It is not a matter where you can lay down a hard and fast rule, but you must be careful to preserve to yourself the right to withhold from the prisoner a certain amount of information you have with regard to him.  Prisoners of a certain turn of mind may, with a view to vengeance in the future, come to find out where the information with regard to them came from.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;Section 4, Sub-section (4). To delete the sub-section and to substitute the following new sub-section therefor:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  When such an Executive Minister shall receive a report from an Appeal Council that there are no reasonable grounds for suspecting him of having committed or being engaged or concerned in the commission of any of the offences mentioned in the Schedule to this Act, he shall, within one calendar month, order his release unless&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  he shall refer back the report to the Appeal Council for the consideration of further evidence, or:</P>
      <P>(b)  the person be charged with any offence punishable by imprisonment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of my amendment is to try and make it clear that it is the intention, unless there are reasons, that when the Appeal Council recommends the prisoner to be released it puts the onus of his release on the Minister as soon as he receives a report to that effect unless he is prepared to refer it back on further points, or unless he is prepared to have the person charged before the Court.</P>
      <P>The way the Section is worded does not seem to make it clear what the circumstances are, how, or what time the person may be released, if at all.  I understand the Minister's point that this is not a Court, and I do not think it is desirable that it should be thought that it is a Court, because, if so, a person failing in his claim to be released would virtually be found guilty.  I do not want to suggest that this is anything more than a claim to come before the Advisory Council, but to ease the public mind and make it clear that as soon as the Council has examined and reported, they should be released within one month.  If the Minister considers the clause he will see that something should be inserted so as to make it clear that he should be released in a reasonable time.</P>
      <P>The reason I am urging this is because I think it is wise and right, and because a number of persons have the impression, it may be genuine or it may not, that the Appeal Council is not a genuine body, and is not intended to function, and that no one will ever know whether a case is being heard by the Council or not.  With abnormal legislation of this kind it is well that you should have the public with you, and that you should allay any uneasiness that may occur.  On the Second Reading debate a suggestion was made in the Seanad that the Government had inserted certain of these internment clauses for the purpose of attacking their political opponents in a vindictive spirit.  I should like to say that anyone who took any part in the so-called negotiations that took place would absolutely give the lie to that statement. There never was anything which could lend any colour whatsoever to the suggestion that there was a vindictive or personal element, or anything of that nature.  I hope that by either accepting this amendment or, on the next Stage, bringing in another amendment, the position will be made quite clear.</P>

      <P>I feel disposed to accept this amendment.  It gets over one difficulty.  Attempts were made in the Dáil, when they were dealing with the question of the Appeal Councils, to give to the Councils mandatory powers of release that were objectionable.  Just as the arrest of persons is an Executive act, so ought their release to be an Executive act.  It should not lie with an advisory body, set up the Government or a Minister, to order, the release of any person. I told the Dáil I did not conceive that in 100 cases there would be one in which <Col N="1631" /> the advice of that body would be set aside, and yet the principle was important that the power of release should lie with the Executive Council, and ought not to lie with this body.  Senator Douglas' amendment is an improvement on that.  If the Executive Council are to receive an order it is better that it should come from the Oireachtas than an Adsory Departmental Committee, and this amendment gives a month.  Even after the Advisory Council has reported that there does not seem to be grounds for the detention of a particular individual, if the Executive Council is strongly of opinion that his release would be dangerous, then they have a month in which to produce any further evidence that may be at their disposal for the consideration of this Committee.  If the Senators were to accept this amendment, and I see no reason why they should not, I would be prepared to recommend its acceptance to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>This goes some little distance to improve the clause, and I suppose we must be thankful for small mercies.  We have little hope of getting any of the amendments put down by us accepted, and I am going to support this amendment on this Stage in the hope that on the next Stage it may seem proper to eliminate the words &ldquo;within one calendar month,&rdquo; or at all events reduce the time.  It is a terrible hardship on a person, particularly one with a family, to be kept in a month after he has been declared innocent.  It is no encouragement to hasten his release or investigate his case.  Sub-section (a) is somewhat vague.  I do not know exactly what it implies, or whether it means that some evidence already in possession of the Government had been held back, and ultimately given for the purpose of detaining the person still longer.  I am <Col N="1632" /> prepared to vote for the amendment at this Stage.</P>

      <P>It covers what I want, but in different terms.  The prisoner is arrested for three causes, first as a matter of military necessity, second as a matter of public safety, and thirdly, because he is guilty of offences set forth in the Schedules. Now, the Appeal Court has not power to deal with those offences.  In the case of offences where prisoners have been arrested through military necessity, or for public safety, I understand that report would not be given to the Appeal Court. I think that is not correct.  I think that is not as it should be.</P>

      <P>The position with regard to this Appeal Council would be that it is free to hear the cases of all persons detained without trial, that is to say all persons arrested under the provisions of this Bill.  The military, while a condition of war or armed revolt prevailed, would be free to hold any prisoner, and nothing that this council could do or recommend would alter that fact. But, if a state of war or armed revolt were declared at an end, then the provisions of this new Sub-section would apply to all prisoners, both to prisoners arrested if such were to happen that they were arrested under the provisions of this Bill, and the prisoners who were arrested under a state of war or armed revolt, and whose detention is prolonged by the Bill. But we could not in legislation interfere with the inherent common law right of the military to detain any prisoner whom they thought was a matter of military necessity to detain.  The new sub-section has everything short of an over-riding power of the military in a time of war, and when the time of war would be at an end, would have complete power to deal with prisoners whose arrest was, in the first instance, made as a matter of military necessity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose this amendment, and the <Col N="1634" /> reason I do so is because the Oireachtas will not be sitting.  The Ministry say that they will lay these matters before the Oireachtas, and if either of the Chambers object, that it may be withdrawn.  That sounds very pretty on paper, but the Oireachtas will not be sitting.  There will be a dissolution some time.  I do not know when.  Until after the elections these things cannot be put on the table at all.  Therefore, I suggest that before the dissolution of the present Oireachtas these papers should be put on the table, so that the Seanad would have a right to give an opinion on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendment is scarcely reasonable.  The preparation of these regulations will take some little time, and if the Senator's amendment were accepted the dissolution would need to be postponed in order that these regulations might be considered. &ldquo;As soon as may be&rdquo; in that context is, I submit sufficiently imperative, and the Senator may feel that no time will be unnecessarily lost in the preparation of these regulations.  If when they are completed the Oireachtas is not sitting, it may be assumed that immediately after the elections the new Dáil will be summoned, and the regulations will be laid before them.  In the meantime there is provision that anything done under the regulation will not be prejudiced by the fact that they did not receive sanction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Sir HUTCHESON POE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;Section 4.  To insert after this section a new Section 5, as follows: &ldquo;5. As soon as may be after the passing of this Act, there shall be established a Prisons' Inspection Committee of three persons of recognised status and independent position (to be appointed by the <Col N="1635" /> President of the Executive Council) who shall be empowered to visit and inspect any prisons or places of internment in Saorstát Eireann, to investivate any complaints that may be made by persons under detention other than those connected with the reasons for their detention, to examine the general conditions obtaining in such prisons or places of internment, and to report thereon to the Minister for Home Affairs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In moving the amendment I hope it will receive the favourable consideration of the Minister.  I express that hope because during the discussion of the measure in the Dáil a great many of the Deputies expressed a very strong feeling in favour of some suggestion, such as is indicated here.  As a matter of fact on no less than four occasions amendments in this direction were introduced.  One of these amendments dealt with the appointment of certain medical members of the Oireachtas, and was ruled out of order.  The other three were rejected by the Minister mainly on the ground that to allow the Dáil or County Councils to appoint Committees of Inspection, as was proposed in these amendments, would be utterly out of order; that it would not be fair to submit or subject the actions of the people who are in charge of these prisons or detention camps to the criticism of outside bodies, and that it also would virtually mean the abdication by the Government of its own responsibilities and functions.  In that contention I think the Minister was unquestionably right, but as this amendment does not err in that direction I hope he will be able to reconsider his attitude to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment, I may say at once, is as much in the interest of the Government as it is of the internees and of their relatives and friends.  It is brought forward in the hope that if the Minister can see his way to nominate a Committee of three persons, men or women, who fulfil the conditions of recognised status and independent position, that it will go a long way to dispel the cloud of mistrust and suspicion that, unfortunately, has grown up around the whole question of detention and the treatment accorded by the Government to its political opponents. To account for that suspicion and mistrust we have to carry our minds back a little way and to think of those drear months last winter when every day <Col N="1636" /> brought forth its tale of horror and outrage; when hundreds of persons were being arrested, both men and women; when party spirit ran high, and the passions of civil war were in the ascendancy. If we think of that, we can realise that the conditions under which many of these internees were placed must have been one of considerable hardship.  What else could be expected.  The existing prisons were full to overflowing, and the arrangements for the housing and feeding of hundreds of men and women drawn from all parts of the country, and between whom no distinction could be made, had to be hastily provided.  Their medical supervision, the sanitation of their camps, their safe custody, and so on, had also to be provided for, and this had to be done largely by the officers and men of an Army that had only recently sprung forth, as it were, from the void, and which lacked training, had little idea of discipline in the ordinary sense of the word&mdash; I am not making any complaint about that, because it was inevitable&mdash;and who had no experience, at least no knowledge, of the duties which, under the new order of things, they would be expected to perform. Is it any wonder that in such circumstances discontent and disorder on the part of those under detention were rife?</P>
    <P>Many of the internees very naturally resented their arrest.  Others were unruly and insubordinate.  Few of them would conform to any regulations or submit to any discipline, both of which, I need hardly say, were absolutely essential if any kind of decency or order was to be maintained.  As we all know, in some cases the prisoners, with the possibility of getting out, broke up the furniture, burnt their beds, choked the latrines, and did other things which could not be defended, and which only aggravated the situation.  Can we be surprised if under such circumstances and in face of such behaviour reprisals did take place, and that soldiers took the law into their own hands and adopted rough and ready methods for putting a stop to these irregularities? Can we be surprised if, in order to improve their position, the internees made the most of the situation, and wrote home to their relatives and friends gruesome details and exaggerated reports of their treatment?  The familiar molehill became a mountain, and, to add to all this, the public protagonists of those <Col N="1637" /> who were opposed to the Government piled up the agony, issuing a weekly bulletin of what I can only say were mendacious reports respecting the sufferings of the internees?  Under such circumstances can we be surprised that many of the relatives and friends of these unfortunate people were very much concerned for their safety and for their health? Happily those days have now passed away, I hope never to return.</P>
    <P>With the discipline and efficiency of the Army very much increased, with the higher instincts of our human nature coming into play and reasserting themselves, with party passions dying down, may we not hope that such irregularities will not now be possible, and that if they are, we may be quite certain that the military authorities will put them down with great insistence.  We may, I think, be satisfied that under present conditions the position of the internees is as satisfactory as, under the circumstances, is possible.  Liberty is, as has been expressed by many Senators, a subject which is dearest to men's hearts, and I hope that some means may be found, as the Minister told us to-day, of releasing a considerable number of these men and women, who are now detained, before very long, and that in any case, long before the expiry of this Bill, the whole of these persons may be restored to their homes.  In the meantime, I think that if the Minister can see his way to obtain the services of three men or women who will fulfil the conditions laid down, that their very presence and their association with the Government in the administration of the prison camps, and so on, will inspire confidence and allay any anxiety that may still be felt on behalf of the internees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust it will meet the Senator when I say that I am prepared to accept Amendment 33 on the Orders of the Day in the name of Senator McPartlin to appoint honorary visitors to places of detention who will report to the Minister for Home Affairs for the time being.  The need for the inspection of these places, an inspection that will not be official, is obvious.  I am glad the Senator stressed the point that these prisoners themselves took good care to ensure that their conditions would be far from ideal.  The mania for destruction did not desert them on their arrest, <Col N="1638" /> and they did damage on a large scale to the extent of thousands of pounds in places of detention.  They did such foolish, wanton things as smashing the hot water system in their places of detention, and then complained of the cold; tearing the fibre out of mattresses; stuffing the lavatories, and then complaining of unsanitary conditions.  There are complaints of congestion, and yet if they had succeeded in their attempt to burn Maryborough Prison there would be more congestion.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence dealt at length with this aspect of the question recently when commenting on conditions in Wicklow Gaol.  Every attempt has been made to ensure decent sanitary conditions in places of detention, and any failure has been due to the conduct of the prisoners themselves.  It is humanly impossible to keep conditions properly in places of detention without a reasonable amount of co-operation on the part of the prisoners, and that co-operation has not been forthcoming.  I am prepared under this Bill to appoint honorary inspectors, decent level-headed citizens here and there through the country on condition that their reports will be made to me in the first instance, and that only in the event of their finding the reports not investigated or proper action not taken, would there be publication to any other source.  After all if the Executive is to have the real power and real responsibility delegated to it by the Dáil, then any matter which calls for comment by these inspectors should be reported in the first instance to the responsible Minister.  Only in the event of clear failure to take action on any matter which requires action, should there be publication elsewhere.</P>

      <P>The chief difference between the amendment that the Minister says he will accept and the amendment put forward by Senator Sir Hutcheson Poe, is that the latter's says the persons appointed shall be persons of recognised status and position.  I think it is very desirable that they should be such persons. Otherwise you will find it difficult to get the country to believe that the Government has not somehow or other settled the matter beforehand with these people.  I do not believe that the Government would do such a thing, but I also do not believe that they will carry the same weight with the people as if <Col N="1639" /> the Minister had accepted Senator Sir Hutcheson Poe's amendment, that they should be persons of independent position and recognised status.  I would be glad if the Minister would let us know what kind of person he proposes to appoint.</P>

I do so entirely in the interests of the internees and their friends, as the suggestion the Minister made about appointing certain medical officers throughout the country will not satisfy these people.  I am not surprised.  The conditions, I am sure, have led to hardship.  I believe fully in the honesty and the good intentions of the Minister, but there are plenty of people who do not.  It is suggested that the want would be met by appointing dispensary doctors, or whoever you like, very worthy and very good people, but they cannot command the confidence of these people.  In view of the strong feeling expressed in the Dáil I believe the feeling I myself voice is the feeling of the Seanad.  I wish, however, to leave the matter in the hands of the Minister.</P>

If these words were put in they would meet your view, and probably the Government would not object.</P>

      <P>There is just this difference.  In Section 13 it provides for regulations, and the regulations will provide, with the acceptance of Senator McPartlin's amendment, for inspection by honorary inspectors, and it will at the same time define conditions under which inspection could be carried out, and the persons to whom the reports or complaints are to be addressed.  If we merely put in the Bill this new Section which Sir Hutcheson Poe proposes, the matter is left vague.  It would be necessary, when inspectors are appointed, to have a clear understanding as to the quarters to which they should report any matters which they consider called for attention.  I would ask that the persons to be appointed to inspect would be persons not in receipt of any salary or emolument from the Government.  Senator MacPartlin's regulations come in under Section 13, and the regulations made with regard to inspection are set out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister would be extremely unwise not to accept this amendment.  It is a notorious fact in the city of Dublin that there are a number of people who are worked up to <Col N="1641" /> a terrible pitch about stories told about their relatives in prison.  They are being played upon by certain people, and these stories are doing a great deal of harm to the Government.  I think in the interest of the Ministry that it would be wise to accept the amendment, that independent inspections and reports should be given and thus prevent certain people trading on the sufferings of others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>My preference for Mr. McPartlin's amendment is this.  There will possibly be six or eight places of detention throughout the country, and to set up an inspection Committee of three, presumably resident in Dublin, would involve a certain amount of expense to these people by reason of their travelling to these places.  My conception of the future was that near these places we would make a selection of sane, level-headed citizens, and ask them to act as honorary inspectors and define their duty.</P>

      <P>As there is obviously a fundamental agreement, I suggest that this should be brought forward on the Report Stage after consultation with the Minister.  I suggest that you should combine both ideas, and that power to make the regulations should be put in Section 13.  By that means you give the Minister power to make regulations in Section 13.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with Senator Douglas.  I think it would be the most common-sense plan for the two Senators to come together and settle this amendment on the Report Stage. The Minister has stated that these Committees should be local, and I quite agree with him, because I foresee what might happen.  Once you set these people up you cannot get rid of them when the Bill comes to an end.  I think the Minister's remarks are very sensible and will lead to a saving of expense.</P>

I simply visualise near each place of detention three or four <Col N="1642" /> persons appointed, with a reputation for common-sense and straight dealing, and we ask them as a public duty to make occasional visits and inspections of the places of detention, and bring any matters under the notice of the responsible Executive Minister that may require attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to interfere with the dinner hour of the Senators.  We have been considering for some time the question of dissolution, and in that connection we also had to consider the various Bills which we would like to see passed by both Houses before dissolution.  I have had the advantage of having a preliminary consultation with the Dáil, and we have got general agreement upon a number of Bills that will be non-contentious.  I have been in the Dáil all the evening, and three Bills are being sent up from it this evening.  I do not think any of those three will provoke much opportunity for contention in the Seanad.  But, in order that it would be possible to dissolve at the end of the week, <Col N="1644" /> I am afraid that we will have to ask the Seanad to give us some assistance with regard to the matter, and in that connection I would like to say that we have given an undertaking to what may be termed the opposition in the Dáil that they would not be called upon to sit next week. To some extent that limits our time, and if it would be possible for the Seanad to help us I think it would almost be necessary in the case of amended measures that we should have them back in the Dáil, by Friday.  There may be a difficulty about that, but I would ask for the special consideration of the Seanad owing to the circumstances of the time.  Apart from a small number of Bills those measures will be non-contentious.  It was our hope to have the election by the 20th of August.  That has not been possible, and I am sure it is unnecessary to say anything here in the Seanad about the advisability of having an Election at the earliest possible moment.  Most of the business people and quite a number of other. sections are satisfied that the sooner we approach stabilised conditions the better. That is in essence what I have got to say, and it is to explain the reason for this big congestion of legislation.  The Dáil has sat almost continuously for eleven months.  It has been kept on the quick march the whole time.  Apart from that time there has been a great deal of work in connection with the setting up of the Saorstát.  I am sure when we ask for the indulgence of the Seanad in the circumstances a good deal of the objections urged towards such a list of measures will be restricted as we are so much pushed ourselves.</P>

The people most anxious to sit on are those <Col N="1645" /> who believe in going out and refreshing themselves.  They tell those who have been watching the business here to sit on <i>ad infinitum.</i>  It is a farce to call this legislation&mdash;to rush business of this kind, and tell us that we have to get through it in order that we may have an election. The only alternative to considering those Bills properly is to pass them without considering them at all.

It is open to them to consider now whether they have not asserted it, or whether there would be any doubt in the public mind what is their position in the future as to the attitude they have taken up to-day, or whether it is consistent with the dignity of the Seanad whether they could maintain that any longer.

      <P>I beg to move: Section 5, sub-section (1): &ldquo;To delete in line 23 the words &lsquo;death or.&rsquo;&rdquo; I put down this amendment for two reasons. In the first place I am one of those persons who is totally opposed to capital punishment. I recognise that this is not the time or place to go in any detail into the merits or demerits of capital punishment, except to say that I have always held and believed that to send a man to his Maker without any possibility of redress or rectifying an error is an enormous responsibility for the State to take.  When a man takes up arms against the State he takes his risks, but when he has been caught and when, as it were, in cold blood he is tried, I think the State makes a serious mistake in executing him.  I could go at great length into the reasons <Col N="1650" /> why I am opposed to capital punishment, but I do not propose to do so.  In the main, my reasons are that I have a great belief in the possibility of the spiritual reclamation of any man.</P>
      <P>My main reason for putting down the amendment is this: It has been suggested that it is the intention of the Authorities, if the Bill is passed, to try a number of persons at present held and to execute a number of them.  I feel it would be a very good thing if the Minister could give an assurance, unless there is an actual state of warfare again in the country, that that is not the intention. Personally I feel that it is a mistake, except in very grave circumstances, even if one admits the right of capital punishment, to execute persons taken for political offences.  We all must know that in many cases persons who have been sentenced to death for political offences and afterwards reprieved, have become some of the very best and noblest citizens in the country.  Although we may not anticipate that at present with those whom we may be dealing with, at the same time there is always a possibility.  In the main I put the amendment down not to press it, but in the hope that there might be some kind of assurance from the Government as to the suggestions made outside.</P>

      <P>I have nothing but respect and sympathy for Senator Douglas's outlook on the question of capital punishment, and I feel that if the world, or even the country, were composed of citizens like Senator Douglas, that it might be possible to adopt that view. But the fact is that it is far from being the case, and I am not aware that any State has found itself able to dispense with capital punishment for treason. One could talk at length on the abstract side of the thing, taking the view that no man should be hurled into eternity without any chance of being reformed or reclaimed and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is simply a question, that those on whom responsibility lies of saving the State, and saving society within the State, are compelled to resort to the extreme penalty in certain cases.  As to any retrospective intention in this Bill, I want to make this perfectly clear. There has been a good deal of ill-informed, loose criticism about this Bill, as about other Bills, and it has been mooted that <Col N="1651" /> we propose to turn round on men who have robbed or burned within the last year, and apply the penalties of this Bill to them.  That is far from being the case, but every robber, every prospective robber, and prospective arsoneer in the country may expect the penalties of this Bill.  The penalties under this Bill will not apply to any person except for an offence committed after the date of the passing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do readily give the undertaking which Senator Douglas has asked for, that with regard to these penalties for offences mentioned in Part I. of the Schedule of this Bill it is not proposed to go back now and deal with anything that has passed up to date.  There is no such intention.  The whole outlook of the Bill is simply to meet a possible future situation, rather than deal with an actual past situation.  We share the pious hopes expressed here and elsewhere that things will continue to improve, and that in a couple of months everything will be lovely in the Irish garden.  There ought to be no one more pleased, and none more relieved, if that turns out to be the case, than we who are members of the Executive Council.  At the same time it is our business as prudent, responsible men, with a duty to the people of the country, to face the fact that something quite different is possible.  If it is even possible, it is our duty to provide against it, and to see that the Executive returned after the coming Election does not find itself hampered or fettered for want of full power to deal with such a situation. It is in that spirit this Bill is framed. We all hope that people will come to their senses and realise that no political creed, and no political formula justify them in garrotting the nation.  If people do attempt to garrotte the Nation&mdash;and mind you it is the Nation rather than the fabric of the State, that this onslaught has been upon&mdash;then those on whom the primary responsibility rests for dealing with the situation ought to have very full and comprehensive powers, and ought not to be fettered in any detail, in dealing with that situation by any lack of powers delegated to them by representatives of the people.</P>

      <P>I am very glad there seems to be general agreement on both sides of the Seanad on this question <Col N="1652" /> of the death penalty.  I happen to have practically the same amendment down as Senator Douglas, and for that reason I have every hope that the Seanad will carry this amendment.  Regarding executions in the past in this country, every one is aware that the country has been sickened with executions, and to my mind it is very doubtful if the death penalty is efficacious in preventing crime in any country.  In this country we know that during the last seven centuries the people who tried to govern it always tried that punishment, and we know that is was not always successful.  I think that every offence which this death penalty is intended to apply could be dealt with by the ordinary Courts with the ordinary law.  That would have been preferable to passing a special Bill which is bound to be regarded by a number of people as a measure inspired by political animosity and a vindictive desire to get rid of obnoxious Republicans.  If it were true that we could obtain or have obtained peace and order in this country the best way to attain it to my mind is by having a certain amount of clemency and good-will in our legislation rather than advocate the shedding of more blood in this unfortunate country.</P>

      <P>May I quote to my fellow-citizens the answer given by an old French philosopher in the last century to people who asked him to support a Bill for the suppression of capital punishment?  His answer was &ldquo;let the gentlemen who commit the crimes set the example.&rdquo;  There is nothing in this Bill to compel anyone to commit crimes which it wishes to punish; if the gentlemen who hold up banks, burn our houses, and commit other heinous crimes abstain from doing anything of this nature, not even the most hardhearted Executive can inflict any of the punishments here meted out to those who do so.  If we agree that that class of crime is an unmitigated evil, what right have we to handicap the Government by vetoing the means which they consider to be the quickest in putting an end to that evil?  Surely our common sense and our duty both suggest that we should give them the power they are asking for, as it is in the hands of the criminals themselves to make these penal clauses nugatory by not giving the <Col N="1653" /> Executive an excuse for putting them into action.</P>

      <P>I should be glad to have leave to withdraw my amendment in view of the Minister's statement.  I feel strongly about capital punishment. I recognise certain circumstances, and I will withdraw the motion rather than have it turned down.  If I am spared, I hope when peace and order come to bring in a Bill to abolish capital punishment.  In view of the last speech I should say that I have not opposed capital punishment on grounds that people do not deserve it.  I think it is quite conceivable that in many cases they deserve much worse if they were to get their deserts.  My desire is to find out some thing which will not be an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, but which shall give a person punished a chance of becoming a decent citizen and which shall protect the community. I am against capital punishment, because I believe it is not possible to make a man a decent citizen by sentencing him to death and hoping he will be alright in two or three weeks' <Col N="1654" /> time.  It is because I believe that punishment should be in the direction of saving the man as well as saving the community that I am opposed to capital punishment on principle.</P>

      <P>I propose: To insert &ldquo;not more&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;not less&rdquo; in sub-section (1), line 24.  I object in this case to give sentence not less than so and so.

      <P>I would like to support this amendment.  In all existing legislation I think the general practice has been to fix a maximum and not a minimum penalty.  In this case we have the reverse.  A person may be found guilty of any offences in the first part of the Schedule.  Everyone will agree that there are varying degrees of guilt.  The minimum penalty the Judge imposes in every case is three years' penal servitude. He must inflict that or discharge the man. Why it is considered necessary to tie down a man in that way is not apparent. Surely the Judge should be able to assess any penalty.  Is it alleged that the <Col N="1655" /> Judges are supposed to be too lenient? I do not think that is our experience of the Judges of this country in the past. It is certainly showing a lack of confidence in their strength to punish crimes of this character, and whatever else they may be lacking in I think from past experience they are not disposed to treat people found guilty of crimes of this character very leniently.  Apart from that the fact that it is a reversal of all previous law is another reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely what I anticipated is happening in connection with the penalties of this Bill.  When we were going over the Bill in the Executive Council the unanimous desire was to keep the penalties down to a minimum, and I felt at the time when the Bill came before the Dáil and Seanad that a very determined attempt would be made to convert that minimum into a maximum. Sub-section (1) of Section 5 deals with the offence &ldquo;an armed revolt against the Government of Saorstát Eireann threatening, coercing, destroying, damaging or removing, or attempting to destroy, damage or remove any property in furtherance of such a revolt.&rdquo;  Inside two months the Government of Saorstát Eireann will consist of persons elected by the Dáil, and that Dáil will be elected on an adult franchise of the population of this country.  I ask any reasonable citizen who hopes for stability here, whether that penalty is excessive for that offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Men can go out to their fellow-countrymen and expound any mad or sane doctrine, and convince their fellow-citizens to that view, get the seal of the people's endorsement for whatever policy they wish to prosecute.  But for men who abandon all attempts to settle the minds of their fellow-citizens, who set out to coerce their bodies or bring coercion to them by the destruction of what they hold most dear&mdash;their household gods&mdash; through intimidation of their wives and families, is three years an excessive penalty?  Is it an excessive penalty for those who try to garrotte the nation and force their fellow-countrymen into their will?  That penalty was a minimum penalty which men with a sense of their duty could attach to that crime.  A comment was made that whereas it is usual in legislation to name <Col N="1656" /> the maximum that we named the minimum. We did that, not out of a desire to set down a harsh or vindictive penalty, but to set down the minimum penalty that would commend itself to a man with any proper conception of the insolence of the crime.  I am surprised at the quarter this came from.  Truly the essence of democracy is the fact that every man should have an equal voice in deciding the affairs of the community, and yet we are asked to say that in the case of men who go out with guns, torches or land mines to coerce their fellow citizens, three years' imprisonment is an excessive penalty.  If the amendment were to be accepted here I would advise the other House to reject it.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that where death may be the penalty for a particular crime, it is making light of an offence to say that the maximum penalty instead of death should be three years.  It would be far better, if an amendment were required at all, that it should be the penalty of death or such less penalty as the court may decide. That I think would meet the case.</P>

I think the Minister passes over what is really the objection to the clause that the Judge who may see the exceptional circumstances has no option whether he likes it or not, but to inflict the sentence.  I do not at all question what the Minister says, that anybody going around and doing these things deserves three or five years penal servitude.</P>

      <P>If I might intervene again it would be to say that Senators are losing sight of the fact that it is open to any Judge, having passed the particular sentence that is embodied in legislation, to make his recommendations afterwards.  Judges do that as a matter of practice.  In recent months Judges have passed sentence and have afterwards written to the Executive and stated they considered, that owing to the state of the country and for the sake of the effect upon the public mind, they should pass a particularly severe sentence. The Judge in such a case has said: &ldquo;I want you to take a note of the fact that <Col N="1657" /> that sentence was passed more for its public effect than with the view that it should be served out to its last week or month as the case may be.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is always that channel open to judges to make their recommendations. There is always room for the prerogative of mercy, and the prerogative of mercy is exercised constantly to a far greater extent than Deputies or Senators are aware of.  Prisoners are brought before a Court.  A judge, having regard to the general condition of the country and the general irresponsible outlook prevailing at the time, passes a particular sentence. Later on there is a petition for the prisoner and it is passed to the judge or magistrate for his comments.  It is open to the judge, if such a particular case as Colonel Moore suggests comes before him, to pass his legal sentence and to make his recommendation to the Executive.  That is done every day, and it will be done to the end of the chapter, and it is an aspect of affairs that the Senators ought not to lose sight of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that that is making the Minister the judge. Why should that principle be adopted here of fixing the minimum any more than in the case of any other offender?  When the Minister talks of the enormity of the offences enumerated in the first part of the Schedule we are at a terrible disadvantage. When we make any opposition to this Bill we are accused of favouring this thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Such accusations have been made, and that is not conducive to getting all the good possible out of the Bill, at the finish.  The position the judges will be in, will be that they must pass this sentence although they know that it would be unfair.  There may be cases notwithstanding the enormity of the crime, that would make it an excessive sentence, but they must pass that sentence and constitute the Minister the judge. It is not fair to the Minister because, if he is to go into the decision he must have to review all the evidence himself, and that will be a duty that will lead to unnecessary labour.  The suggestion of Sir Nugent Everard is an improvement undoubtedly upon it.  It emphasises the enormity of the crime far more emphatically <Col N="1658" /> than this does, because it names death as a penalty, but leaves it to the judge to inflict a lesser penalty.  For these reasons I do not know why the Minister would not accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of amendments which it is almost inevitable should be discussed together and it would save time.  I think the Minister's own speech to some extent shows the difficulty that is in our minds in this matter.  The suggestion that a judge gives a severe sentence in order that it should be a deterrent has been made. That to some extent is an argument as to why there should be a discretionary power in the judge.  I can conceive quite a number of cases in which the offences in the Schedule will be committed and in which the punishment is not by any means sufficient, and I can conceive of other cases in which the punishment might be decidedly one in which the judge or jury could not possibly approve of the sentence.</P>
      <P>I think the mistake which the Government is making in this particular case is that they have decided on a long list of offences which are not at all equal, and which, according to different circumstances, might not be equal, yet they have a rule of thumb set of punishments which must be inflicted by the judge.  I have consulted lawyers and some have spoken to me, and they all say that is an extremely unwise principle of legislation to introduce and one to which they are opposed.  I know of several cases where the very speech of the judge gave an impression that he was prepared to deal leniently with the particular prisoner who was charged.  I remember in one particular case where I felt on the evidence that a girl was not guilty; together with one or two other jurors I was extremely unwilling to find her guilty, but very reluctantly we brought in a verdict with a recommendation to mercy. The judge said that the impression we had formed was confirmed by the evidence as to character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that if you insist on having an absolute rule of thumb you will have a certain reluctance to convict, if they feel that the judge has no option whatsoever in the sentence.  Consequently I think it would have the effect of weakening the power of the judge in dealing effectively with the evidence.  One or two <Col N="1659" /> cases mentioned in Part 2 of the Schedule provides a penalty for injury to property of any kind.  That means that if a boy deliberately breaks a window he must if brought forward and if convicted be sentenced to one year or a year and a half.  I have no doubt that in such cases there would be a reprieve.</P>
    <P>It is not fair to the Minister himself nor is it a wise thing that offences of that kind should be included.  In another portion of the Bill there is reference to a person aiding or abetting the escape of a prisoner.  It does not say whether it is to be done knowingly or unknowingly. A person might come to my house and spend the night there.  That kind of thing actually did happen during recent events in the country.  That person might commit offences which I would know nothing of and yet the judge, even if he were satisfied that I knew nothing about it, would have no option.</P>
    <P>The Minister to whom an appeal would be made for a reprieve would no doubt act as justly as he could, but I suggest it is the judge who has heard the whole of the case is the best judge, and it is not fair to the Minister who gets the recommendation to have to decide matters of this kind.  I would urge the Minister carefully to consider between this and the Report Stage as to whether an alteration might not be made.  I would be in favour of having the punishment heavier.  I would not altogether favour the death penalty, but a very much stronger punishment ought to be possible.  Some offences are exceptionally serious in view of the present condition of Ireland.  The set of punishments indicated in the Bill are in some respects too moderate and in others too extreme. There should be no rule of thumb punishments. Circumstances would tend to make certain cases extremely serious and others not nearly so serious.</P>

      <P>The mandatory system is justified by the Government on the plea that in the dangerous state of the country the Executive Council should take the responsibility on themselves of assigning a definite penalty and not leave it simply to what the President described as such &ldquo;accidental circumstances as the outlook of a Magistrate here and a Magistrate there to decide.&rdquo;  There is something, according to the Minister, &ldquo;haphazard and casual and fortuitous in that.&rdquo;  If in any case the Judge or Magistrate under these <Col N="1661" /> definite orders, <i>after having carried out the law by passing the sentence</i>, should think it would be right to make representations to the Executive of mitigating circumstances, no doubt, Ministers think, he would do so.  Is there nothing haphazard and casual and fortuitous in that? Is there nothing that implies a danger deeper to the country than a fortuitous error of a magistrate in open court, under public criticism?  Are judges limited in authority under a severe State control likely to make many &ldquo;representations&rdquo; to their masters of cases where the rules imposed on them have failed in the execution of exact justice?  For the next six months the mandatory system in fact appoints that it is with the Minister, not with the Judge, that lies the punishment of crime.  I urge that so far as the nation consents to weaken the responsibility of Judges and Magistrates, it lowers their virtue.  If it continues to throw on them the highest public duties, it gives to the weakest the strength of the strongest.  The mandatory system is not only likely, but certain, to degrade the whole judicial order and ordinary law in the public mind&mdash;an evil that will last long beyond the six months of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The further defence of the Minister does not help us.  It is his sincere and courageous statement that the Executive in the present peril take on themselves the full responsibility for mandatory law. The fact, however, is that no such statement can relieve us of our duty.  We have our own responsibility for giving Government such powers.  The answer may be&mdash;&ldquo;it is only for six months.&rdquo; But if the real protection of the citizen, the independence of the law as against the State, is once broken, who will repair it, and how?  And if confidence of the people in Irish law is shattered at the outset, who will create that faith, and how?  If the Minister feels and courageously uses his own responsibility, so we must consider our own problem.  On the one side we may weave a net that shall catch every atrocious malefactor in the next six perilous months; for the enactment evidently contemplates the capture of a multitude of criminals and their swift condemnation.  On the other side we can thus in this critical moment lower the non-political authority of law, and fashion it into a tool of this State, degrade its dignity, and once more make <Col N="1662" /> it the object of popular distrust, or even presently of contempt.  Our responsibility is as great as that of the Minister. Where he sees danger ahead if we do not accept his mandate&mdash;we have on our part rightly to measure his demands and balance them against other dangers deeper and more persistent which might follow any lack in us of foresight and responsibility.</P>
    <P>Besides the mandatory system, there is a second question of justice at issue in this question&mdash;the flat rate of punishments decreed.  A schedule of crimes is set out, three in Part I, and other twelve in Part II., with a brief code of punishment for the lot.  The debate in the Dáil shows how this scheme affects legal opinion.  The Minister in fact undertook to consider carefully the possibility of discriminating between the last five and the first seven of these twelve offences thrown into the one bag.  But no change has been made in the Bill as before us, and no <i>may</i> has been permitted as regards the last five offences instead of <i>shall.</i> Mandatory law, if we can call it law remains in possession.</P>
    <P>The flat rate is defended by the Minister on the ground that it is not as high as it might be.  It is not the question of high or low that is troubling some of us.  It is rather the degradation of law.  Till now law has had to laymen a dignity based on reason, on inherited learning and a great tradition.  Instead of this we now find statesmen taking the maximum penalty of greater crimes, and &ldquo;merging&rdquo; it, as they say, with the minimum penalty for other offences, or in their words &ldquo;whatever <i>we believed</i> was the minimum penalty that should be imposed by anyone with a proper sense of the gravity&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say a sense of the present peril of the coutry.  Maximum and minimum combined make up the flat rate.  The fruitless discussion of this question in the Dáil shows at least how grave may be the reaction of public opinion to such a doctrine during the next six months.  The flat rate is not a problem that requires a legal mind.  It lies within the view of any plain believer in accustomed justice.</P>
    <P>To sum up&mdash;these enactments of flat rates and mandatory sentences look as if the Executive could not trust the Judges by themselves to deal out justice.  And if their own makers do not trust them, how shall the people have faith?  Will <Col N="1663" /> any group here maintain that the calamity of temporary looters is so great as to drive us back on one final misfortune a remedy&mdash;the defiance of our whole legal system by flat rates and mandatory punishments.  The amendments I have suggested in this Section have been entirely with regard to this desire to free the law from mandatory orders and from flat rates.</P>

      <P>This is the usual discussion which always occurs wherever I have been before between the words &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  I notice that further on in this Sub-section (2) the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used&mdash;&ldquo;and may in addition be sentenced to pay a fine of fifty pounds.&rdquo;  It also reads: &ldquo;every person convicted by a court of summary jurisdiction of any offence mentioned&rdquo;&mdash; we all know what the offences are&mdash;shall be sentenced to a certain imprisonment. &ldquo;May be sentenced&rdquo; is suggested.  There is a &ldquo;may&rdquo; further on in the Section, and I cannot see from a commonsense point of view what this meticulous argument really means between the words &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  Reading it as plain English, there is really no very great difference.</P>

      <P>I certainly never heard that startling proposition. There can be no doubt what the Section here means, because the whole policy of the Minister is made quite plain.  It is perfectly plain that &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the first part of the Sub-section (2) means that that is the penalty and no other penalty, and that it shall be and must be imposed by the Magistrate if he finds the person guilty. But he may, in addition&mdash;he is not bound &mdash;order a fine of £50.  That is discretionary but the sentence of twelve months is mandatory, and he has no discretion over that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put a position before the Seanad which might soften the heart of the Minister.  In the Schedule there is an offence, number 12, &ldquo;aiding, abetting and encouraging the commission of any of the offences mentioned in this Schedule, or helping in the concealment <Col N="1664" /> or escape of any person guilty of any such offence.&rdquo;  A mother may have a son or a daughter who may be charged with an offence of this kind.  Are you going to say to a magistrate that he shall send the mother of such a boy or a girl to jail for twelve months?  Is there any mother that would not shield her son? You are going to compel a magistrate to send such a mother to jail for twelve months, and in addition she may be fined £50 for giving shelter to her son.</P>
      <P>I remember in December, 1920, with two of my colleagues here, Senators MacPartlin and O'Farrell, being present at a Labour Party conference in London for the purpose of considering the awful conditions prevailing in this country at the time. We endeavoured to impress upon the representatives of the labour movement in England the horrible state of affairs existing here and the manner in which the people were being treated by the Government.  We pointed out that an Irish mother could be sent to jail for harbouring her son.  Sir Hamar Greenwood had passed a Bill known as the Restoration of Order Bill, in which a proviso was inserted that a mother could be sent to jail for harbouring her son. Surely we are not to follow the very bad example that was set us then.  It is clear from this Bill that if a boy or a girl is concealed by a mother in her house, and if she is arrested for that the magistrate must send that mother to jail for twelve months.  Surely we are not going to be guilty of such a crime as that at this stage of our history.  I agree whole-heartedly with those who have spoken against making it mandatory for a magistrate to inflict this sentence.  There must be a certain amount of discretion allowed to Judges, otherwise there is no necessity for having Judges at all.  Judges are appointed because of their great knowledge of the law.  They are placed in a most responsible position, and they are supposed to use discretion in making the punishment fit the crime.  If in this Bill we lay down the penalties to be inflicted, then there is no necessity to bring them before a Magistrate at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to say that Senator Farren knows well that under the law as it stands people may be sent to jail for compounding a felony, and that mothers are not excepted. Senator Farren also knows very well that <Col N="1665" /> the fixing of minimum penalties is not uncommon.  This whole Bill must be taken in its setting, must be considered in perspective.  Certain definite offences are menacing the life and the future of this country, are menacing stability here. Stability must come if we are to solve the problems that loom big and black ahead for us, and if we are to solve the social problems that confront us frowningly, such problems as unemployment and housing.  If this State is to rest safe and solid on its foundations, the particular offences set out in the Schedule must be grappled with, and brought to a standstill.  If we have taken certain offences and classified them in Part 2 of the Schedule, they are simply offences that reports from all over the country show are the ones that most menace peace, and most menace the future of this country.  You cannot take one out of the context and analyse it and turn it over and say &ldquo;Is that worth twelve months' imprisonment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have to take each item in the picture, and there is no use in Deputies or Senators talking about the harmless little bottle of poteen for which 12 months i to be given.  You have to consider what part poteen is playing in the national life at the moment and what its re-actions are likely to be on the national life.  I simply take that as one example of the fact that things must be considered in their setting and in their perspective.  The six months to come are a vital six months for Ireland's future. I am not ashamed, despite Senator Mrs. Green's dissertation on the evils of a flat rate, of saying, after having considered reports from officials throughout the country, that there is no one of these offences more seriously menacing the life of the nation than another.  So far as Ireland and her future goes it is equally necessary that each one of these offences in the Schedule of the Bill be stopped and stopped quickly.  Senators will get into an atmosphere where they are inclined to consider this Bill and its provisions in a rather abstract and academic sense.  Let us at any rate be realists, and let us face the fact that this country's books are unbalanced and must remain unbalanced when there is no atmosphere where men will indulge in that commercial enterprise which is necessary, if the country is to live and drain up unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1666" /> Men will not sow here for fear they will not reap, and that is because the whole condition of the country is one of indiscipline, one of looseness, one of lawlessness, and these crimes set out in the Schedule must be stopped within the next six months, if there is to be a decent future for this country.  Is it too much to say that we here, the Parliament, the highest Court in the land, should decide that the penalties for particular offences for six months to come shall be so and so? You say no role is left to the judge.  It is left to the judge to decide the law; the question of guilt or no guilt on indictment, is left to the jury.  We have a responsibility, more than the responsibility in each individual case.  We have a responsibility to all the people, to society here, to the decent law-abiding people who live in the country, and we are entitled to say that particular offences must be stopped and particular offences in their present setting and perspective loom so large and so black that we are entitled to attach particular penalties to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLYSAGHT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out that the Minister has in no way answered the point raised by Senator Douglas.  When answering Senator Farren he stated that a mother may be convicted for compounding felony, thereby missing the whole point, because in the common law she &ldquo;may&rdquo; be, whereas the word we feel so strongly about now is the word &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator MacLysaght that the Minister has not met the real point but has treated us to a dissertation on the enormity of these crimes.  He is simply preaching to the converted.  We all agree with his contention that there must be settled conditions of law and order.  The only difference we have is as to the method. In this particular case the particular objection is that stated by Mrs. Green, making the judges and District Justices the creatures of the Ministers and taking away their independence and making them dependent on Ministers.  Surely the Government must have confidence in their judges and District Justices to do justice in these cases as otherwise we could not carry on at all.  To adopt this mandatory system is equivalent to passing a vote of non-confidence in the whole <Col N="1667" /> judicature of the country.  That is calculated to create a lack of confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Judge is the person who gets the real atmosphere of the case.  He has the whole case before him, and he should be allowed to decide for himself, up to a certain limit, if necessary, as to what the penalty shall be, otherwise the statements of the Minister are unnecessary.  We know that a very bad state of affairs has existed and that all is not well in the garden as he pleases to put it; but that is no reason why we should stamp out all principles of justice which prevail in every civilised land.  We are told that these are only temporary provisions.  They will, however, have permanent effects.  They are likely to be extended from one period to another.  They destroy the whole essence of the administration of justice in the country.  It is deplorable, because of what has happened in the past, that we should start on our career with a measure like this.  The great difficulty in the past was that of catching the culprit.  It was not because the punishment was not sufficiently severe, but because there was no way of bringing the culprit to justice. That has now come to an end.  No matter what penalty you inflict, unless you are able to bring him to justice it is useless. <Col N="1668" /> It is on the basis that we have no police or courts functioning this Bill has been conceived.</P>

On this &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; question, Senator Douglas dangles his bait of an extension of the term.  I am not anxious for an extension.  What we wanted was not a long but a swift sentence, a sentence which a prospective criminal would have in his mind's eye when setting out to commit a crime.  I would prefer <Col N="1670" /> if the Seanad would leave over the question of any extension of the term of imprisonment and deal simply with the question as to whether it is right or not that the Parliament should take into consideration the existing conditions to affix a penalty or leave to the Courts of the land simply the duty of deciding guilt or innocence.

      <P>A fine of £10 on one man may be as severe as a fine of £100 on another.  You have again the principle of fixing the absolute minimum. It is only reasonable that this amendment be carried.  Take the case of two men committing a felony.  One had previously held up a bank and has sufficient money in his pocket to pay the fine.  He gets off the imprisonment.  It is a case of again fixing the minimum instead of leaving it to the judge.</P>
      <P>On a show of hands 11 voted for the amendment and 11 against.  By the casting vote of An Cathaoirleach, the amendment was declared lost.</P>

      <P>I would like to make the point that this Bill is urgent. The president announced to-day an intention to prorogue on Friday next.  I do not know whether Senators view with equanimity the prospect of 12,000 or 13,000 prisoners being released indiscriminately on the country.  As one with some responsibility it is a thing that I contemplate with no equanimity, and I think that if we are to adjourn the Committee Stage of the Bill it should be adjourned with the definite understanding that the Bill would become law within the week.</P>

      <P>The difficulty about that is that those who have to catch trains would have to stay here all night.  I have no objection to sitting at 10 in the morning if that is the wish of the Seanad, and take this Bill from <Col N="1674" /> 10 o'clock to 12 o'clock.  We could take the Land Bill at 12 o'clock.</P>
