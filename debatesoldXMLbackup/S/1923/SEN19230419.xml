      <P>I would like to congratulate the Government on the fair and straight way in which they have dealt with the people concerned under this Bill. I have had long experience of Government actions in these matters, and the people whom this Bill is mostly meant for have always been swindled by Governments across the water.  At last we have come to a Government that has treated us very fairly and endeavoured to meet us in every possible way.  I would therefore like to add my testimony to them.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I may be allowed also to congratulate the Government on the exceedingly artistic and careful way in which this Bill has been drafted It is a great credit to the draftsman, because it was a most complicated matter dealing with a great variety of legislation, and its draftsmanship was very concise and very artistic.</P>

    <Title>SEANAD IN COMMITTEE.</Title>
    <P>The Seanad then went into Committee on the Summer Time Bill, 1923.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 1.</P>
    <P>(1)  The time for general purposes in Saorstát Eireann shall, during the period of Summer Time, be one hour in advance of West-European time.</P>
    <P>(2)  Wherever any reference to a point of time occurs in any enactment, Order in Council, Order, regulation, rule, bylaw, deed, notice or other document whatsoever, the time referred to shall, during the period of Summer Time, be deemed, subject as hereinafter provided, to be the time as fixed for general purposes by this Act.</P>
    <P>(3)  Nothing in this Act shall affect the use of West-European time for purposes of astronomy, meteorology, or navigation, or affect the construction of any document mentioning or referring to a point of time in connection with any of those purposes.</P>
    <P>Motion made and question proposed: &mdash;&ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There is an amendment to this Section in the name of Senator Butler, but I have to rule it out of order because it is inconsistent with the principle of the Bill which has already been affirmed by the Seanad. This amendment is practically equivalent to rejecting the Bill, and I, therefore, cannot allow it to be discussed. The next amendment is also in the name of Senator Butler.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.A. BUTLER</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BUTLER</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move: Section 1, Sub-section (1), to delete the words &ldquo;West European&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;Dublin.&rdquo; The time in use in every country generally has some relation to the sun time and to the geographical position of the country.  For the past four or five years it has been different in this country owing to the adoption of Greenwich time.  What I propose is that the time formerly in force in this country be adopted, namely Dublin time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the amendment.  I noticed that the Minister said yesterday that this twenty-five minutes that we put on in order to be with the English time did not count, and that it had nothing to do with the matter.  Considering that it puts us on one and a half hours, instead of one hour as in England, I think it has very much to do with the matter.  It seems to me rather like the man who drank a quarter of a bottle of whiskey and when he was advised not to drink any more said the quarter bottle did not count and that he must drink the remaining three-quarters. I think it is very unreasonable that we should be one hour and forty minutes, as it will be in parts of Ireland, in advance of sun time, and that we should go by Dublin time.</P>

      <P>The next amendment is in the name of Senator Linehan.  I will allow this amendment to be moved though I am not sure whether it is consistent with the principle of the Bill as already ratified by the Seanad.  Inasmuch as there is a Sub-section providing for certain exceptions I am not prepared to rule that it is not in order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. T. LINEHAN Mr. T. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move: Section 1, Sub-section (3), before the word &ldquo;astronomy&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;agriculture.&rdquo; The Sub-section will then read &ldquo;Nothing in this Act shall affect the use of West European time for the purposes of agriculture, astronomy, meterology or navigation, or affect the construction of any document mentioning or referring to a point of time in connection <Col N="952" /> with any of these purposes.&rdquo; In the debate yesterday most of the members in favour of the Bill were quite willing that the agricultural community should fix their own time for their own business.  The object of the amendment is to carry that out, so that agriculture would be in the same position as astronomy, and the other matters mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly necessary to speak against this amendment. It would have the effect of making the Sub-section somewhat ridiculous.  The Sub-section is put in for the purpose of not interfering with astronomical tables and regulations in regard to navigation, matters that do not touch the everyday life of the country, and which can easily have a special time of their own apart from the time that is generally observed.  It would be impossible to give effect to this Sub-section if the amendment were inserted.  Trains will convey milk, for instance, and possibly the running of a train might be said to be for the purpose of agriculture, and it might be argued that it would be impossible to alter the time at which the trains should run or to use Summer Time for the purpose of the railway time tables.  I do not think the amendment is one that should be inserted.  It would remove any clarity that there is in the Bill, and make the whole thing entirely confused and incapable, I think, of construction. Certainly, if it were put in I think there would be plenty of scope for litigation.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and negatived.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move: Section 1, Sub-section (3), to insert after this Sub-section a new Sub-section (4) as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;(4) Nothing in this Act shall affect the time of opening and closing of schools.&rdquo;  The object of the amendment is to make it clear that the time of opening and closing of schools should not be affected by this Bill.  I think it was admitted by everybody that there is some hardship in having school children, especially in rural districts, attending school at such early hours</P>

      <P>I am not quite sure if the powers of the manager are as Senator Cummins stated, that the manager of a school can alter the time, but certainly he can do so with the assent of the Minister for Education.  No <Col N="954" /> obstacle will be placed in the way of any manager who wants to keep the hour for opening a school the same by sun time as before the passing of this Bill if he desires to do so.  I think this amendment has no real effect, and if it did add anything to the Bill it would mean that schools in the city that might desire to avail of it would be prevented from observing Summer Time.  I believe the amendment would not have any effect, and that consequently it should not be put in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Douglas has stated the reason for putting in 31st December.  In September there will be an Expiring Laws Continuance Act, under which a number of Acts will be continued for another year.  It is intended that the Summer Time Bill will be included in that list, but if the Seanad then chooses to strike it out they can do so.  If they do not wish to strike it out we will get rid of the necessity of having a new Bill being put through all stages in both Houses next year.  It is merely a matter of convenience, and if it is desired to continue the Summer Time it can be done with less waste of time, while on the other hand if not it can easily be struck out.</P>

      <P>The next business on the Order Paper is the further consideration of the motion which the Seanad may recollect was moved on the 21st March by Senator Douglas, and I think it would be convenient if the Seanad would give permission to Senator Douglas to say a few words, briefly stating again the effect and purpose of this motion, because a considerable time has elapsed, and the Seanad may probably have forgotten most of what took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that I took up a considerable amount of the time of the Seanad in introducing this motion some time ago, I think it is <Col N="957" /> not fair or desirable that I should do more than very briefly re-introduce this subject, re-stating the main reasons as to why I moved the resolution, and why I trust the Seanad will pass it, and answering briefly one or two questions on the points that were raised in the discussion when the motion was originally moved.  I may say that my main object in moving the Resolution has already been achieved, because, as I think I stated on the last occasion, I wish the Irish public to realise that the status which has now been achieved by Ireland is one under which they could rightfully assume that they had the right of applying with reasonable certainty for admission into the League of Nations, and that it was wise and right that the public should discuss, and that the Government should decide on its merits as to whether an application should be made on behalf of the Saorstát for membership of the League of Nations or not.  I give reasons why, in my opinion, it would be desirable when the right time came, and I recognise that the Executive must decide the exact time when the application should be sent &mdash; I give my reasons, briefly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I stated that I thought it would make perfectly clear, not only to our own people, but to the other nations of the world, that we are now for all practical purposes an independent State, and that we intend to take our place as soon as, and as much as, we could in international affairs.  My second reason was that it would definitely make clear that Ireland was prepared to back Internationalism; was prepared not necessarily to approve &mdash; and I give my reasons why, in some respects, we disagreed with some provisions of the present League &mdash; but to support the general idea of the League of Nations, and that it recognised that while this League was not perfect it was prepared to go in and assist those Nations which were trying to improve the League, and to make it a success in so far as it could be made a success.  Thirdly, the reason I gave was, which I still hold, that it would help to add to the sense of responsibility of the people of Ireland, who are inclined, all of us, I think, to look far too much on our own difficulties and not to realise that we, as a Nation, must take a live interest in the affairs of Nations round about us, principally in <Col N="958" /> European affairs.  Since I spoke the first point has, to some extent, been met because an invitation has, if to-day's paper's be correct, been definitely sent to the Saorstát inviting Ireland to take part in an International Conference on Customs, and that of itself is a recognition of our status to be International, a recognition of the highest possible importance. One point with regard to some criticism of the League has been made both in public and here as to the possibility of so small a nation having any effective part in improving the rules and the working of the League.  It is a matter of considerable interest, and I do not think very largely known here, that Canada has down for consideration at the next meeting of the assembly an amendment to Article 10 by which they propose that Article 10 which, as you will remember, more or less pledges the different members of the League to recognise each other's territory, shall be amended, so that no country will, because of that Article, be obliged to take part in any war except with the consent of the Parliament of the nation concerned. This is an extremely important amendment which I imagine it will be the desire of most people in this country to support.  I mention that as a matter of interest, because that has been sent out to the various nations as an amendment to the League, and, I think, has a very fair chance of acceptance.  It is perhaps, a guess, but one might hope if that amendment is accepted that the United States might feel that it can at least look more favourably on the League, if it does not join it following that amendment, and I rather think that Canada, in proposing the amendment, probably had something of the kind in mind.  It is also a matter of interest again that Canada, in this matter and the action it wishes taken in regard to her own nation being at war without the consent of the Parliament, is following Ireland, because I think that we are one of the first countries, if not the first, to make it a definite constitutional matter that we shall not be committed to war without the consent of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to deal with the main points any further except briefly to refer to the matter of expense, of which questions were asked in the last debate.  I understand that the apportionment of <Col N="959" /> the expenses is made by a Committee and reported to the Council.  As an aside I may mention that the present treasurer is a representative of China, a matter which is, I think, of considerable interest, and I was surprised, in reading the proceedings of the League, to find that its budget was presented by the Chinese representative.  A certain number of units are apportioned to each nation, and it has been laid down in a comparatively new rule passed, I think, somewhere within the last twelve months, that in apportioning the units the ability of a country to pay shall be taken into consideration.  It is not possible, I think, to state mathematically the exact number of units which would be apportioned to us if we were admitted members of the League but I think we might safely assume that he sum payable would be between £8,000 and £10,000.  At the present moment the exact amount paid by two of the members of the British Commonwealth who are members of the League I have in actual figures.  I have been unable to find in the reports the exact figures of the others.  The summary of the League of Nations does not give the figures, I believe, of the different Nations, at least I have been unable to find them, but in the Report of the Parliament of New Zealand I find that they pay £10,209 and Australia pays £14,465.  I believe that I am safe in stating, and I know that the Minister for External Affairs told me that this was his view also, that it would be something about £10,000, if not less, that we would have to pay if we were admitted.  I think that there was a misunderstanding, and some of the rather exaggerated figures, which were not exactly suggested but were whispered about during the last discussion, were due to the fact that in the first division of its expenses some small nations did find themselves liable to much larger sums but these have already been discharged so that I think, on the grounds of expense, we would not be unreasonable in suggesting that we could spend as much for the League of Nations as we do on the Governor-General's salary.</P>

I recognise, and I think every Senator here will recognise, that the Executive is the only body who can tell what is the right time for making that application.  I think the assembly of the League will probably meet somewhere in the Autumn.

      <P>If I venture to dísagree with what Senator Douglas has said I hope it will require no assurance on my part to say that anything I have to urge against the motion which he has proposed is neither due to no want of sympathy with him, much less to any antagonism to the League itself. I think no man who has followed the movement in support of the League since its inception, or its proceedings during the last four years, but will admit that it has done very good work, even though nothing of the sensational character that was hoped for.  That has not been its fault, however.  Every man, I believe, who has the good of mankind at heart must long for the day when the League will become an effective instrument for the settlement of international differences and the cessation of wars such as that we have recently passed through, and from the effects of which we are still suffering.  If I counsel for the moment, as I feel bound to do, that we should not be hasty in adopting any action which implies admission to the League at present it is solely because I think it is somewhat premature for this new-born State, faced as it is with overwhelming difficulties, not of its own making, and which require all its energies and all its resources to combat to undertake and further responsibilities such as would be <Col N="961" /> involved by admission to the League. With two of the most populous and powerful nations of Europe, Germany and Russia, excluded from any participations in its councils, until such time as they have purged their offences; with the United States holding aloof and seemingly not much inclined to come into line through the persuasive arguments of Lord Robert Cecil; and, what is more important still, with two members of the League, France and Roumania, absolutely set on pursuing their own policies, to the disturbance of the peace of the whole world and in utter violation of the first cardinal principles of the League, there is I fear little prospect of those splendid ideals and aspirations materialising for which we all so hopefully looked at the time the League was formed.  In these circumstances I feel that we should hesitate before we take any immediate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to expense, what Senator Douglas has said is perfectly correct.  I spent one or two days at the Ministry of the League of Nations in London, and I there learned, what we have all seen to-day in the papers, that at a meeting of the Economic Conference in March they made a recommendation to the Council that an invitation should be sent to Ireland to take part in the International Customs Conference which is to meet in October.  That recommendation came before the meeting in Geneva on Wednesday, and I think Senator Douglas is right in saying that in the course of a few days we shall get a formal invitation.  I do not know whether we have yet had an invitation to the Colonial Conference, but these are satisfactory indications that the League has recognised Ireland as an independent State.  The fact that Germany and the United States have accepted invitations to both these Conferences is a hopeful omen that later on they may, perhaps, look with a more favourable light on the League.  With regard to the question of expense, Great Britain and France each contribute something like £80,000 a year to the League.  The total expense comes to over £1,000,000 a year, and towards this sum Great Britain and France are the largest contributors.  The revised scale to which Senator Douglas alluded was drawn up last October, and under it the Council, in apportioning the contribution of the several members of <Col N="962" /> the League, has to take into consideration their population and payable capacity. The unit of contribution is, roughly speaking, £1,100, and so many units are apportioned to each State. Judging by comparison with some of the smaller States, whose population is that of the Free State, viz., 3,000,000, our contribution would probably be fixed, Senator Douglas has said, at something between £8,000 and £9,000 a year.  We may be called upon to pay more, and I do not think we will have to pay less. But even that sum is a matter of consideration at the present moment.  Are we justified, with a deficit of £20,000,000, and burdens of every kind increasing, and not decreasing, in assuming a further debt of even £10,000?  In normal circumstances I quite agree that it would not be worth considering, but the matter assumes a different aspect when we have nothing in our pocket to meet it.  No man is more in sympathy with Senator Douglas's motion than I am, but I would ask you to consider whether it would not be better to wait and see the result of these two Conferences.  I am sure that the International Customs Conference and the Colonial Conference will be productive of the best results.  Our members will be brought for the first time into contact with the representatives not only of the Overseas Dominions, but with those of the great States of Europe, many of whom are Prime Ministers and other leading statesmen of the day.  Such an association, and the discussions which will take place in an atmosphere which, as I have always heard from members of the League, is one of mutual goodwill and co-operation, cannot but be productive of good results to our representatives in broadening their outlook on the world's affairs and taking their minds off from always dwelling on the wrongs and grievances of their own country.  Other nations of the world have far bigger wrongs and grievances than we have, and if we can contribute anything to the settlement of these, I am sure we will be all anxious to do so.  I would suggest that if, before committing ourselves to membership of the League, we watched the result of these two Conferences, the experience we shall have gained will not be lost.</P>

      <P>While I am not in agreement with the proposal I am glad <Col N="963" /> it has been brought up, because I think it well that Senators should consider matters of great public importance abroad as well as at home.  At the same time I do not at all agree with the proposal that the Free State should enter into any such negotiations at present.  I fear the mover of this resolution has allowed his hopes to interfere with his thinking.  If the League of Nations had been at all what we hoped it would have been long ago, I certainly, and I think most of the others, would have been most anxious for the Free State to join it, but it has proved to be very much otherwise. Designing politicians have made working arrangements for the organisation and apportionment of the material results of victory.  It is not a neutral body.  On the contrary it is deep in all the intricacies of the Treaty of Versailles, the supervision of mandates, and so on.  I do not know how much Senators know about the League.  All these foreign affairs have been conducted for us by other people over our heads, against our will, against our sympathies and inclinations, and we have got out of the habit of thinking about the world abroad. Moreover our private affairs have become so pressing that foreign affairs do not come very much within the purview of our vision.  There was a time, a few years ago, when we did look across the European horizon for help and sympathy from the League, but we got none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Foreign Governments are very selfish, and they only think of their own affairs, so that as we have had no trade and diplomacy to bargain with, we got nothing out of it.  Now, matters are somewhat different, and we have both trade and diplomacy; we are equal to Great Britain in status, if not in power or strength; and we would have a considerable amount of influence, I dare say, but I do not, on the other hand, wish that that we should dabble too much in foreign affairs at the present time.  If the League of Nations were merely weak, as it has been, I would not say much against it, but it has been much worse than that; it has been pusillanimous.  It has been extremely base in its decisions, and if we come into the League we should remember that we must submit to these decisions.  I think it is well that Senators should know what some of its decisions have been, because in some matters it <Col N="964" /> has decided questions which will be our own main subject of difficulty before long.  If Senators will have patience with me for a moment I will read to them a short statement of what the League has decided in the case of a dispute between Poland and Lithuania.  That was a frontier dispute, and that is one of the questions which we also have to face.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Vilna was the capital city of Lithuania, but was claimed by Poland, both States having been established after the late war, and desultory fighting continued until September, 1920, when the two Powers agreed to accept mediation by the League.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;October 17th &mdash; Armistice signed under auspices of League, called Suwalki, agreement to remain in force till all questions in dispute were settled.  This agreement left Vilna to Lithuania.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;October 9th&mdash;General Zellgowski&mdash; a Polish freebooter &mdash; seized the city and flouted armistice.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;October 28th&mdash;League Council met and disapproved of Zellgowski, invited him to retire, and announced it would send an international army to supervise a plebiscite.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Zellgowski did not retire, and international army did not go, but he said he would hold a plebiscite himself.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;March 3rd, 1921 &mdash; League met again and resolved that a popular consultation was impossible.  It suggested, instead, direct negotiations between Poland and Lithuania, under League auspices, the preliminary conditions being the reduction and control of Zellgowski troops.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) Lithuania accepted all the negotiations and conditions; (2) Poland accepted negotiations, but declined conditions; (3) League then proposed that the conditions be ignored and negotiations begun anyway.  At every step the League begun by talking justice and then yielded to Poland &mdash; the darling of the Allies.  Throughout it has shown itself, not an instrument of equity, but a tool of the Great Powers.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;April and May, 1921 &mdash; Poland and Lithuania met, but Poles refused to discuss League's proposals until the Buccaneer, General Zellgowski, was brought in as a third and equal party; <Col N="965" /> 2 Poles to 1 Lithuanian.  Mr. Hymans, spokesman of the League, declared this to be a violation of the agreement.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;June, 1921&mdash;League Council met; several members made stern speeches against the Poles, and declared that Zellgowski's troops must retire and a local police be established by the League.  This was not done.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;September &mdash; Mr. Hymans, for the League, again offered a compromise, which Lithuania accepted and Poland flatly refused.  So far the League was only pusillanimous.  Zellgowski then held an election, his own troops presiding at the polls.  Only Polish candidates were nominated, and the ensuing Diet naturally voted for annexation to Poland.  The Polish Diet ratified this. Lithuania protested.  The League cravenly approved it, so that Vilna became Polish.  Lithuania has constantly referred back to the Suwalki agreement under which she laid down arms, trusting to the League's good faith.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>From an American paper, &ldquo;The Nation,&rdquo; which is one of the best known, one of the best written, and one of the most liberal papers in America, one that is most respected and honoured in America, one that has always been on the side of liberty in these matters, and one that has fought very hard against all sorts of difficulties with great courage.  Now that was the settlement of Lithuania.  What is our own problem that is likely to come up before long?  It is a problem very similar to that which I have just referred.  What has been the state of affairs of our frontier problem?  England has made a Treaty with the Free State by which it has arranged to establish a Committee to decide a frontier.  Ulster has refused to accept, just the same as Poland has refused to accept the arrangement of the League.  England is in considerable difficulty.  Lord Derby was in Ulster recently and he was present when the Prime Minister declared that the frontier question was settled long ago and would not arise again.  I think the probabilities are that England is very anxious for <Col N="966" /> the Free State to go into the League, because then it can appeal to us and practically force us to lay our cases before the League.  If the League decision is unfair in our case we should have lost our position.  I say that we should not do such a thing at present.  Let us stick to our agreement with England.  Do not let England slip out of it.  Do not let her push it on to the League of Nations, but let us stick to our Treaty, and if England breaks that Treaty we will know what to do, but if we refer the matter to the League we shall have lost all our position.  The League is, as I have said, a mere tool.  It is dominated by great powers, notably France and England, and it has decided practically according to their wishes and pressure. As a matter of fact it is bound so to decide.  The League of Nations cannot be a League of Nations when it is dominated by great empires whose very foundations are based on interference with other nations and who compel weak, small nations to comply with them.  A league of small nations may be a very good thing, but as long as we have great nations dominating this League we should keep out of it, at all events until other great nations such as America, Germany and Russia come in to hold the balance and prevent the League from being subservient as it is at present.  Therefore I say, although I did not think so at one time, that the Government very wisely decided to wait and consider the matter. I say it more freely now because I was not of the opinion at the time.  We should refrain from entering till quite a different situation has arisen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.W. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>The mover of this resolution advanced as one of the reasons that we should join the League that it would give the Irish people a sense of their responsibilities.  He failed to define these responsibilities.  One of the responsibilities seemingly is that all nations may be compelled to partake in war if so decided by the League.  The amendment proposed is that any nation or member of the League may contract out of such a war if it was so decided. We do not know whether that amendment will pass or not, but we are going into this League of Nations simply blindfolded. Ireland has been for over a century trying to get free of a connection <Col N="967" /> which pretty well strangled her, economically and financially.  There were several vain attempts during the century to wrench ourselves free, and eventually we have succeeded in doing so. The position during all that time may be compared to that of a very game but relatively small Irish terrier tied to the tail of a hefty English bull-dog.  No matter how the terrier struggled and fought to wrench himself free to go where he liked the bull-dog simply dragged him along wherever he went.  Our position to-day is that Ireland, deriving no benefit from the European War, will probably have to share the War debt, a very heavy and weighty responsibility.  The amount of our proportion of that debt has not yet been defined, but in a White Paper of March, 1921, I saw that the then Chancellor of the Exchequer estimated Ireland's share by dividing the whole debt of the war up to that period by thirty-two, which was Ireland's relative capacity to bear taxation.  The figures were brought out at two hundred and thirty-four millions.  How far that valuation could be increased by the end of the war I cannot say, but that is a minimum at any rate.  How far we will be allowed to bring any offset in the adjustment as against the enormous obligations which have been entailed by those connections, and by which we have benefited nothing, I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We got free of this entanglement and now we are on the outer rim of a dangerous whirlpool.  If we venture in we may get engulfed financially.  Otherwise, as we do not know exactly what our responsibility will be in any policy decided on by the League of Nations, I can see we might be doing ourselves a very grievous injury, because in any matter of arbitration between Ireland and England in the adjustment of our position, as a result of the political changes that have taken place, we shall have to take the decision of the League.  We see that Powers already included in the League are wrangling among themselves. France and England are wrangling.  It might so happen, no matter how we voted, that we would strain relations between ourselves and France, or between ourselves and England.  The primary object of the League of Nations was, we understand, the averting of war <Col N="968" /> in the future.  I presume Senators will have read Mr. Lloyd George's comment as to that.  He says &ldquo;the dispute over reparations, that is, between the Powers composing the present League, is churning up deadly passions, and may end in the most destructive conflict on record.&rdquo; That is the present position of the League.  No Great Power has, so far, permitted any international question in which it has a direct and vital interest to be submitted to the League of Nations. &ldquo;France refused to agree to a reference to the League of any problem arising out of the Treaty of Versailles, which is so wide in its application that it touches international interests at almost every point.&rdquo;  That shows the effectiveness of the League as at present constituted. Ireland throwing in her weight&mdash;which is a very negligible quantity &mdash; into a chaotic condition of that sort, will be of very small account.  I think, for all these reasons, we might very well pause, especially as America has seen fit to refuse to be associated with a League of this sort.  We are in a very safe position to-day, geographically and otherwise. We are outside all the influence of this maelstrom of European politics, and we should not allow ourselves, blindfolded, to be drawn into it without further information than we have, and until the League is further developed and shall have become a useful instrument; until it frees itself from the charge of not being impartial in its decisions.  There are grave charges against it in that respect. Until the League becomes a more perfect instrument for the purposes for which it was originally intended, and until we can see, and are assured of, direct benefit in joining that League, I think we should pause and postpone the consideration of this matter.  I say that the time is not yet ripe for such consideration.</P>

      <P>I have listened with great interest to the debate here, and I am very glad to see how interestedly the Seanad follows this matter. It is well known here that last year I proposed a resolution in the Dáil that at <Col N="969" /> such time as it would be advisable we should take steps to join the League of Nations.  That was the Government's opinion then.  Since then we have considered the matter more fully, and it is even more our opinion to-day.  Therefore, the Government does actually propose taking steps to join the League of Nations, and they think that it is quite possible that the matter will come up and will be on the agenda of the assembly of the League in September.  With regard to expense I could not say exactly how much it will be.  I should say it will be not more than 8 units.  It might possibly be more, because I notice that countries with a population more or less equivalent to that of the Free State in some cases pay as much as £12,560. Anyway, I should say it would, probably, not be more than £8,000.  Ireland at the present time has no money to throw away.  We quite recognise that.  But, in attaining freedom, Ireland was not able to disregard the rest of the world.  We are a country in the world; we are a country in what is called the British Commonwealth, and we are also a European country.  We cannot exist in an absolutely isolated state, and in attaining freedom we also attained responsibilities. I think it was Senator Moore said foreign Governments were selfish, and did nothing for us.  During our conflict with the British I was very intimately associated with what was known as our Publicity Department, and without in any way wishing to pat that Department on the back I have to say in justice to the peoples of other countries, that we did receive very real sympathy from those peoples, and that the success that we achieved, to my mind, is very largely due to the fact that these countries followed the happenings here with interest and sympathy, and it was very convenient that we had that interest and sympathy at the time.</P>

      <P>I carefully said peoples, as the Governments and peoples are so intimately associated. We are one of the peoples of Europe and of the world, and we cannot consider ourselves in an absolutely selfish way.  When we called upon the peoples of other countries to take an interest in <Col N="970" /> our concerns here, we made the point that what happened in Ireland was not to be disregarded in other countries, and we often urged that the freedom of Ireland would not only be beneficial for this country, but we flattered ourselves by saying that we had something to give to the world in general.  When we said that we believed it.  I think, with regard to the League of Nations, it is particularly true.  I think that we are justified in saying that we are quite independent-minded, that we are not lacking in courage, and that we have no axe to grind.  Many faults have been found with the League here.  We have considered the League, and I for one quite recognise that it is incomplete and that it is imperfect.  I think that in the interests of the world in general, of the countries of Europe and of Ireland itself, peace and general harmony amongst countries is desirable.  I think although one Senator said Ireland would be a negligible quantity in the League, although we quite recognise that we are a small country, and that militarily we are not powerful, that in that Assembly a country which has no axe whatsoever to grind and which is quite fearless, standing always for what they honestly deem to be the right thing, will have an influence quite altogether out of proportion with their military strength or their population, or any other consideration like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Senator Moore spoke about the Ulster frontier, and seemed to suggest that the question as to whether there should be a Boundary Commission or not was a matter which might be disputed. We made a Treaty with England, and in that Treaty England agreed to the fact that there should be a Boundary Commission.  The fact that an interested gentleman in any other place should say there would be no Boundary Commission does not interest us.  England has made that agreement, and we accepted it, and are quite confident that there will be no attempt made to break that agreement, knowing as we do that if that clause of the Treaty were broken that the whole Treaty would go by the board.  The only question that can come up to the League of Nations would be a question as to the findings of that Commission. The League of Nations, as I have said, is not a perfect body, and is not an impartial <Col N="971" /> body possibly, but it is as near an approach to an impartial body as there exists in the world at the present time, I suppose.  In view of these things I have mentioned, and in view of the fact that Ireland has this responsibility of taking her place in the world, and also as she has something to gain by it as a new State, having to create the machinery of government it is necessary that we should learn from other countries.  So far we have, as far as possible, in making new developments, inquired into how things were worked in other countries, and in these matters we have always had the most cordial goodwill, support, and assistance of other countries. We feel that by Ireland taking her place in the Assembly of the League of Nations, that by that closer contact we will have a good deal to gain.  The net result of the Government's consideration of this matter has been in favour of Ireland joining the League of Nations, and I think that unless there should be something very much calculated to change our opinion, as I said before, Ireland will join the League of Nations this year, and that the matter will be considered in September.</P>

      <P>I may say it is rather unfortunate that such a big question as this should come forward on a motion like this as we find that the Government practically has made up its mind to join the League of Nations.  I do not know what position we are in, whether the Government requires the consent of the Seanad or whether it does not. From the speeches we have heard to-day it is a very serious matter and might have far-reaching consequences if settled at the end of a short debate and by a very small House.  I admit, personally, and I have no doubt that a great many of my co-Senators will agree, that they have not seriously gone into the question at all, not knowing it was pressing.  If it had been brought before us with a statement that the Government wanted the decision of the Seanad before they made up their minds I think a good many of us would have studied the question and asked a good many questions, and made up our minds as to what was the right thing to do. Personally I admit I am not in that position to-day.  I should hesitate in <Col N="972" /> committing the Seanad to say that they now approve of it, as I do not think we had an adequate opportunity of debating the matter.  I think if the Government wanted the opinion of the Seanad we should have been told and given adequate notice, and then it would be open to us to debate and arrive at a decision Personally, I would not vote for the motion to-day as I think the Seanad has not had time to consider a question of such a serious nature.</P>

There are other most thorny subjects which to me seem to be questions for legal interpretation.  I think it highly desirable that we should appoint a Committee with the necessary expert knowledge to report on the subject before we come to a definite decision.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister, as he is possibly in charge of the motion, whether the action proposed by the Government is Executive action, or action by the Oireachtas, because if it is Executive action the Dáil and the Seanad will, I believe, have nothing whatever to say to it, and for that reason our discussion is futile.  On the other hand, if it is to come, as I imagine important measures of this description should come, before the two Houses, we would be in a better position of knowing what the circumstances are. As Senator Jameson has stated, many of us, and I for one, know very little about the subject, so that I find great difficulty in voting upon it.  If I knew that it was coming forward in the shape of a Bill and that the Oireachtas had a decision in the matter, I would prefer to wait and record my vote then.  I prefer not to record my vote until I am thoroughly able to make up the subject, and hear what other bodies have to say. For that reason I would like to ask the Minister whether the matter is an Executive one, or whether it will be brought before the Oireachtas in the shape of a Bill.</P>

      <P>I was going to join with Senator Yeats in appealing to Senator Douglas to let this matter stand over for some time until the Committee is appointed to give more information to the members of the Seanad.  It was admitted by some of the Senators that they had not studied the matter very much, and did not feel in a position to vote.  To me the matter appears to be that the Government have almost decided to join the League of Nations.  I do not see that we ought to submit Senator Douglas's motion to a vote and probably get it defeated, as it would leave us in an awkward position if the Government have already decided the matter. Most of the arguments I listened to against the motion would not carry very far with me, and if it was put to a vote I would vote for Senator Douglas's motion. At the same time I think the suggestion that Senator Yeats has put forward is the most advisable in order to give us more time and more information before deciding.  I appeal to Senator Douglas to consider Senator Yeats' proposal.</P>

I can hardly imagine that they are serious in proposing to do such a thing.  I do not know whether it was done in England, but I can hardly think so, and we have it from a Senator that it was not done in Belgium without reference to both Houses of Parliament. And in a country such as this, where there is a brand new Government, a brand new Constitution, and brand new Houses of Parliament, that the Government, which admittedly will probably not be there very long, is going to take this tremendous step without consulting Parliament at all is a thing which this Seanad should condemn in no uncertain terms.  I do not know whether rejection of Senator Douglas's motion would have the effect of pointing out to the Government that we, at least, do not agree.  I think the majority of the Seanad will strongly disapprove of having these things done without our leave, and I am inclined to think that the Minister did not quite mean all we have read into his remarks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that that is largely the object of the motion, in order to prevent further discussion of the matter here.  In accordance with your ruling, I shall confine myself to dealing, not with the subject matter of the League of Nations at all, but with the motion and the attitude that is taken up here in the Seanad.  I should strongly oppose that motion being carried, stating that we would not discuss the matter any more.  A postponement I could possibly understand, although that is what we did previously; a rejection I could understand; a suggestion that it might be withdrawn I could understand, but a proposal to try to close the discussion on the matter, so as to prevent a reply, I cannot understand, and I cannot understand the object of the proposer and the seconder.  I respectfully submit that this motion should not be carried.  The passing or otherwise of the motion is relatively unimportant. I stated that at the very beginning, and if an appropriate opportunity were given for a reply I would have been willing to withdraw it, in view of the statement of the Minister, which is quite satisfactory; but I should strongly urge the Seanad not to pass this alternative motion, and I should like to say, in doing that, I think I would be in order in pointing this out.  The original motion was brought forward here about one month ago; it was on a subject which had been brought before the world two, three, or four years, in almost as many different points of view.  It was stated <Col N="977" /> before that, as perhaps the Seanad had not paid any attention to foreign affairs for years, they could not discuss this motion unless it were postponed.  We agreed to postpone it for three weeks, and I did not press the matter until there was an appropriate opportunity.  The result is that there was practically a month in which the matter could be considered, and at the end of one month we are told that Senators did not consider the matter, and therefore no decision could be reached.  We are told by one Senator that if they had known that the Government wanted a decision they would have considered it, but because it was only a member of the Seanad asked to have it considered, it should not be considered. That attitude, I think, is not a reasonable attitude for us to take up.  If we are a public body, I think this is the proper place to bring forward and discuss public matters and record our opinion, if we have an opinion; but the suggestion that a matter of this importance would not be considered because they did not know that the Government would like a decision on the matter is, I think, making little of this Seanad, and I cannot support this.  I strongly urge, quite apart from the importance of the question, that the motion proposed by Seanator Sir Nugent Everard should not be passed.</P>

      <P>As one who got up to answer Senator Douglas's motion, I may say that I am in agreement with everything he has said.  I was here when the motion was originally brought forward, and when all of us, myself included, said that we did not know anything about the question.  I do not take any credit for it, but when I was in England last week I studied the question a little, and it was as a result of the inquiries I made that I came to the conclusion that, while I was in sympathy with the motion, and would do everything in my power to further it, I decided that the time was inopportune. I think it would be most unfair to Senator Douglas if this motion were now passed&mdash;most discourteous and absolutely unjustifiable in the circumstances&mdash;and I entirely agree with him.  I would have suggested to him that in view of the discussion that has taken place, he should allow the matter to stand over for a time, rather than adjourn it again, <Col N="978" /> seeing that we have had ample time to become acquainted with the subject, although as Senator Douglas said not more than one, or perhaps two, have given it a moment's thought since it was introduced.</P>

It seems to me that these questions require studying, and that they are largely questions of the legal interpretation of clauses, and before we discuss this question we ought to know what experts think of these clauses.  I have no opinion on the question one way or another, but I want to know if, as it seems to me, by moving the previous question, and getting rid of a decision, we will not have the opportunity later on of appointing a Committee to consider the legal bearing of the clauses of the League of Nations on this question?</P>

As far as I know, and I have followed foreign affairs to some extent, although I do not claim to be an expert&mdash;applications for admittance to the League of Nations have been in practically every case matters for Executive action on the part of every Government.  Foreign Affairs of this kind are usually made matters of Executive action.  I do think that in making it an Executive action, as I did in the resolution, and as the Government have done, that the Government are acting quite properly lest there should be any question as to the main principle. According to the Minister for External Affairs, the Government did some time ago bring before the Dáil a resolution approving of the principle of membership of the League of Nations.  That was passed by the other House, and that other House was definitely consulted. The question, I think, is a matter of Executive action, and I cannot see how any Committee of the Seanad can decide the question of time. It should be, naturally enough, left to the Government, and I think it is desirable that the Seanad, although it has no direct control over the Executive, should express its approval of the application for membership.  I brought forward a resolution which apparently does not meet with the approval of the Seanad, but it was largely so that the Seanad should express its point of view. The form of this resolution ignores that the Government has consulted the other House, and it ignores the fact that these are largely matters of Executive action.  The question has been asked how it came before the Houses in the United States.  I think it is clear because the discussion did not take place on any formal proposal of the Government of the United States, which has never yet made that proposal, but the opposition to the Treaty was such that it was rejected by the United States Senate, which has the prerogative of approval <Col N="983" /> or disapproval of treaties in the United States.  That was made perfectly clear, and the United States did not apply for membership in view of that, but I do not think because the Treaty at that time was rejected and they took no further action, that in the United States that is not a matter for Executive action.  If you pass this resolution you are censuring the Government on a matter, which, if you believe members of the Seanad, they pay little attention to&mdash;that is if you take them at their word.  In view of the discussion on it I think it would have been much wiser if the Seanad had been satisfied to have allowed me formally to reply to some of the arguments and then let me withdraw, as I proposed.  The amendment is virtually essential, and the arguments urged against a resolution which you had a month to think about seem to be much more effective than those against one which you had only five minutes to think about.</P>

      <P>I was present when <Col N="984" /> this matter was before the Dáil, and although it was some considerable time ago, my memory of the matter is that it was merely brought forward as a suggestion. A messenger came over from Switzerland and the Government was pressed as to whether it would join the League of Nations or not.  Some question was then asked in the Dáil as to what would happen, and the suggestion was made by the Minister for External Affairs that the Government would at some time in the future bring the matter forward.  I do not think that there was any regular motion brought forward. It was merely a general statement that at some proper time the Government would bring forward the matter.  Senator Douglas complained about the way he is being treated in this matter, but it was he who brought us into all this difficulty. We were not proposing this thing at all, but finding himself in a difficulty, with the possibility of the Seanad censuring a Minister, he says that as that is a terrible state of affairs, the best thing he can do is to withdraw.  I do not think that that is a satisfactory arrangement.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That a Committee of the Seanad be appointed to endeavour to reach agreement as to the dates upon which Bank Holidays in Saorstát Eireann should fall, and that the further stages of the National Holidays Bill be postponed until the Committee has reported.</P>

    <P>Since I raised this question some time ago it has received an extraordinary amount of criticism, some favourable. There have been complaints that I did not make all the Catholic holidays Bank holidays and some have complained to the opposite effect.  As regards the opposite criticism I find myself variously described as a backwoodsman who comes from a remote part of the country interfering with the affairs of bankers and other business men about which I know nothing.  Others refer to me as a sinister Papal agent trying to force Catholicity down people's throats.  These are somewhat foolish.  In regard to the religious point, what I am really interested in is having holidays suitable to Ireland, and it happens that this country keeps Catholic holidays and consequently I selected one or two such holidays.  I do not know in a country where Protestant employers have Catholic workers that such employers find anything sectarian in the fact that their workers keep Catholic holidays.  The least said about this matter the better.  As regards banking objections where these are real genuine ones, and not a cloak for religious objections, they deserve every sort of consideration, and they will get them from me.  For example, it was brought before my attention that the 29th June is the day upon which half-yearly accounts are made up, and so it would be a very bad <Col N="987" /> day for a Bank Holiday.  I am not sure that it is necessary for general holidays to be on the same days as Bank Holidays. On New Year's Day the banks are closed, and nobody is much inconvenienced.</P>

      <P>As you have said that I did not put the position correctly, I shall put it plainly.  This Bill is not on the Agenda at all, and instead of putting it on the Agenda, and then bringing forward the motion that it should be referred to a Committee, or that a Committee should be appointed, and, pending a report, that your Bill should be held up, you have not put your Bill on the Agenda at all.

      <P>Before persons can ask for a Committee to be set up on a subject, presumably they have to show reason why that subject should be discussed. If I stood up here and asked the Seanad to form a Committee on a question of holidays in this country without giving any reasons as to why the existing holidays are not satisfactory, I <Col N="988" /> might well be accused of asking them to do a thing of which they know nothing.

      <P>I did not mention the Bill at all.  I was going to say that in parts of Ireland the 12th July is kept as a holiday.  So far I have not referred to the Bill, I have been very careful not to do so.  I have endeavoured so far to show there was a case for not going on with the ideas which I had before. I also want to show there is a case for a re-consideration of the whole question of holidays.  I know some people believe that the present holidays are perfect.  I want to see Irish holidays, but there are people who want to keep English holidays.  I ask those who want English holidays to consider Good Friday.  I want to ask them&mdash;do they want us to keep Good Friday as England does?  Last Good Friday in England they had eight First Class League matches, with special trains, and they kept everything exactly like Easter Monday.  I do not think we want that in our country. I could show, if I had time, that last Good Friday in Dublin was a very miserable sort of day.  People are not all temperamentally inclined to go to churches all day long.  We had the factories working.  We had some of the offices open and some closed; trains stopped but trams working, and so on. I shall say no more about it, though I would like to say a lot more.  The very fact of Good Friday being so unsatisfactory and becoming so English-like is enough to justify the consideration of the question of holidays, apart from the arguments which I put forward on the First Reading.  As a matter of fact I think if this Bill were rejected on the Second Reading that that would be much more likely to be interpreted as a matter of religious bigotry than the fact of putting forward the Bill which has been so interpreted.  I apologise for the first time for having kept the Seanad for more than five minutes.</P>

I observed that in the Seanad there were three Banks represented, and I selected three people as being Directors of these Banks.  I realise now that I ought to apologise and do apologise to the Directors of the Bank of Ireland for calmly selecting one of the two, and putting him down on the Committee.  Probably, the other one is very thankful to me.  I had forgotten there were two at the time.  I chose two Labour representatives&mdash;one clerical and one manual. I chose Senator McKean as representing Commerce in a different direction from the Bank Directors, and I chose only two wretched agriculturists.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the motion, and would like to say that I think a Committee to regulate the holidays of Ireland, whether we call them Government or Bank Holidays, is a proper thing.  They are holidays at all events, and people look on a holiday as a day of enjoyment and of rest.  There is one thing to be said for the Mondays that occur&mdash;Easter Monday and Whit Monday and the first Monday in August.  You may call them English holidays, but they are holidays upon which people enjoy themselves.  When they take these holidays the working people get the advantage of the half-day on Saturday, the Sunday, and the Monday together, rather than one isolated day in the middle of the week.  I know the Committee would bear that in mind, because the labour members are on it.</P>

We are not discussing the Bill, but it is a fact that the Bill which was introduced here raised the question of holidays, and there has been a good deal of discussion on them. I cannot agree with the Senator in his Bill, and would be opposed to it.  At the same time I recognise that in suggesting that an effort should be made to see if <Col N="990" /> there could be a general agreement before he went any further he has acted wisely. I do not know what he will do after that, but I think we would be well advised to agree to this in view of the whole circumstances. If it had not been for the Bill, possibly we would not have regarded the matter as urgent.</P>

Senator MacLysaght has paid me the compliment of putting me on the Committee.  While being quite anxious to help him with all the knowledge I can give him I certainly think it is a most improper thing to appoint a Committee to sit on a Bill of this kind unless the Seanad have by passing the Second Reading said it was worthy of debating.  To bring it up like this without any information as to whether such a Bill is going to meet with the approval of the Seanad and to bring it forward on the report of a Committee seems to me great waste of time.

      <P>In the old days in Ireland when we began our imaginative movement which, for good or evil, had a little share in bringing about recent events, we all looked forward to the time when there would be adequate editions of the old literature of Ireland.  That literature is of very great importance.  The late d'Arbois de Jubainville, a very great Frenchman of science, whom I knew, spent his life in its study on the ground that through that literature you got to know what the world was immediately before Homer.  In addition to that there is lyric poetry, great lyric poetry in Irish, lyric literature that was matured in the time of Chaucer.  The work I hope the Seanad will enable the various scholars to do will be a work of science, that is to say a study of a language which is of great importance to culture, and a study of this old literature.  It is not a work of propaganda.  I am not in any way denying the importance of propaganda, but personally I do not get any pleasure when I see my name spelt <Col N="993" /> in a way that makes it look very strange to me at the top of this resolution.  It seems to me that that is a course entirely warranted by recent science.  It is the propagandist way of saying &ldquo;I am getting better and better.&rdquo;  What I propose to you is a work which I think any Government in the world would feel justified in undertaking.  Much of this work has already been done by certain bodies, done with very limited resources, by the Royal Irish Academy, Trinity College, the School of Irish Learning and the Irish Texts Society.  The greater portion of the Saga literature has already been adequately translated and adequately edited, but there still remains great quantities of old Bardic poetry which should be translated. There is also great need for critical additions of the Annals, the Annals of Boyle, Innisfallen and Connaught, and above all, perhaps there is need for a dictionary of the old language.  I have been in consultation during the last week with the principal Gaelic scholars, or most of them. Mr. Best, Professor MacNeill, Dr. Douglas Hyde, and Mr. Gwynn.  I think they are unanimous on the importance of the dictionary.  Then, too, as a preliminary work, a proper catalogue is required of the work of the Royal Irish Academy.  A very large rough catalogue does exist, but a condensed catalogue is necessary.  Trinity College scholars have just published their catalogue, and the British Museum is about to publish its catalogue of Irish Manuscripts there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal I make will not require a very large sum of money. At the beginning, at any rate, it will be quite a small sum annually, which will be used to keep at their work certain young scholars.  I understand that Professor Bergin of the National University has two or three scholars of very great promise.  At the moment two of these are studying in Germany with travelling scholarships, I understand Professor O'Rahilly and Professor Gwynn, in Trinity College, have a few more.  In ordinary circumstances these scholars would have to accept, let us say, School Inspectorships, or something of that kind, and would be lost to Irish Scholarship. It is most desirable that a little money should be found in order that <Col N="994" /> they should be set to do the work I have described, probably cataloguing in the first place, and dictionary making, and later on, or simultaneously, editing all the old Bardic poetry and bringing out critical editions of the Annals.  When I read this resolution, you will find that I have made slight additions to it at the suggestion of certain scholars, chiefly Mr. Best.  I may be a little out of order in doing that, but I hope you will permit it.  I have added a clause which would permit a certain portion of the money being expended in training scholars in phonetics, so that they would be able to take down what of Irish literature still remains in the living tongue. It is quite possible that that is the most important work of all, because that old literature in songs and stories is dying out.  It only exists, I understand, in its perfection where the people still think in Irish.  As they become thoroughly bilingual even, it dies away, so that it is work that can be done to-day, and done next year and the year after, but very soon it will be a work which cannot be done at all.  That is why, perhaps, it is most pressing.</P>
    <P>I feel it strange that I, who am a non-Gaelic scholar, should be left to bring this proposal before the Seanad.  I may say, to give a little weight to my words, that the greater portion of my own writings have been founded upon the old literature of Ireland.  I have had to read it in translations, but it has been the chief illumination of my imagination all my life. The movement I am connected with, the whole poetic movement of modern Ireland, has drawn a great portion of its inspiration from the old Bardic literature. I think it is of great importance to set before our own people a task which they will feel naturally inclined to undertake.  It is a great thing, when you find people wanting to learn anything, that you should encourage them to learn that, and not something else that they do not want to learn.</P>
    <P>It is a moment, too, when we will have to build up again the idealism of Ireland. We have had the old form of wild, wasteful historic idealism.  The country got into that position, but, like a spendthrift coming into possession of his inheritance, it has wasted that idealism in a year of civil war.  We have to build up again in <Col N="995" /> its place an idealism of labour and of thought and it is not asking much that the few hundreds a year necessary should be spent to begin what may grow to be a very important work of national scholarship, a work for which all the scholars of the world will be grateful, a work which will enhance the reputation of this country.  I, therefore, propose the amendment in its amended form: &ldquo;That a Committee of the Seanad be appointed to submit to the Government a scheme for the editing, indexing, and publishing of manuscripts in the Irish language now lying in the Royal Irish Academy, Trinity College and elsewhere; for the scientific investigation of the living dialects; for the compiling and publishing of an adequate dictionary of the older language; that the Committee have power to invite the assistance of persons not members of the Seanad, and to take evidence on the subject, the Committee to consist of four members of the Seanad.&rdquo;  I am now able to add the names of four members, Senator MacLysaght, Senator Mrs. Green, Senator Mrs. Costello, and myself.  I find it a little difficult to suggest a quorum because those members will add to their numbers persons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think you ought to be a little careful about that. You see, your resolution does not ask that; it only says that you will be at liberty to invite assistance.  We have made no provision for having a Committee of this Seanad on which there will be strangers.  You are asking the Seanad to appoint a Committee which is not only to include Senators but outsiders, but that is not what your motion says.</P>

      <P>I support very sincerely the resolution that has been made.  I have for many years been in very close touch with the workers in Irish work, and I have seen the extraordinary devotion, the labour and the self-sacrifice of those people who have been little known and little recognised outside a very small circle.  But their work has been admirable and they have laid foundations on which later workers can build.  It is necessary now to try to reap of their harvest.  We have now collected in Dublin a mass of material worthy of a small staff of very skilled, highly-trained and conscientious workers. There is, besides that, a groups of scholars who are of the first reputation, and who would be esteemed and honoured in any European country.  We have in Dr. McNeill the most illuminating interpreter that we have yet had of Irish material, especially what relates to old Irish history, the most important revealer of the character of that history since the time of O'Donovan and O'Curry.  Then, we have people who are eager to know really what is the rock from whence they were hewn.  The dignity of Irish history and literature has suffered a good deal from the enthusiasts who have taken it up; their enthusiasm has been splendid, but their skill, through no fault of their own, and their training have been insufficient, and they have left in the minds of a great many of us a kind of picture of a dark, thunderous could with streaks and flashes of lightning in the shape of saints and scholars across it, but no coherent idea of what the country was, how it was governed and what its dignity and importance is.  Now, I believe the new work is getting rid of that dark splendour; it is laying a foundation which can little be realised by the ordinary reader of the basis of Irish history, and, not being an Irish scholar, my interest lies chiefly in the historical side which Dr. McNeill has revealed.  When that comes to be adequately put forward to the world it will be one of the most interesting histories of local development and of early institutions that could be imagined; it will give back to Ireland the dignity that she has so long missed.  It will be the real basis for an honourable pride in the country, felt by every member of the country I am sure alike, and it will be the spiritual tie that is necessary to bind the nation together in a feeling of real <Col N="997" /> tradition and of history of which it might be rightly proud, and so I think that if we encourage and allow these scholars to do their work that there will be no intelligent person living in Ireland who will not have a new sense of a lively spiritual patriotism all joined in the words of the great scholar, &ldquo;The mother who has nursed us is she, and when you have looked at her she is not unlovely.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have pleasure in supporting the motion brought forward by Senator Yeats.  It is a curious fact that a great deal of the work done for Ireland in connection with Irish has been done by foreign scholars, such as Kuno Meyer.  It does not seem creditable that work of that description, translating and editing of manuscripts and old literature, should be left to scholars of another country.  England and Ireland, I think, have been wanting very much in not taking up, and in not according Government support to the preservation and publication of historical documents.  A certain amount has been done, but nothing like as much as has been done on the Continent or in America.  We are now starting a new State, a new country altogether, and I certainly think that for the small amount of money involved that it would be right and proper that the Legislature should be asked to support financially, for that is really what is at the bottom of Senator Yeats' motion, the work of translating and editing such documents as are now lying in these various academies and colleges, and which are quite unknown to the general public.</P>

      <P>Not many people here know that Ireland is the only country in the world which can show a continuous <Col N="998" /> succession of literature from the year 500 or 600 up to the present.  Some years ago Dr. Kuno Meyer gave me a little book which contained a series of poems.  I think the first began in the year 600, before the Saxons had come into or settled themselves in England, and before they had any literature, and before the French had begun their literature.  Ireland is the only country, not speaking of Greece and Rome, which has a succession of literature from early times up to the present and it is only quite lately that we have fallen back as English crept in, and that Irish literature has fallen away. Some people suppose the Irish language centuries out of use.  Almost in my own time the majority of the people of Ireland were speaking Irish.  Ten or twenty years before my time, three-fourths of the people of Ireland were talking Irish. It is for us now that we have got an opportunity to re-establish it, and gather together the old remains of literature.</P>
