      <P>Owing to some delay in the printing office the Orders of the Day have not yet been furnished to us.  The first matter that we agreed to take up was the consideration in Committee of the Electoral Bill. Before we proceed with that, however, I understand that the Earl of Mayo has a question which he would like to put.</P>

      <P>I beg the Seanad's pardon.  I wish to ask the following question:&mdash; When a Senator introduces a Bill in the Seanad why should not that Senator and other members of the Seanad interested in the said Bill&mdash; that is to say, if the said Bill has passed the Seanad&mdash;attend a meeting of the Dáil when the Minister representing the Department that could deal with the said Bill makes his statement?  The reason I have put that question is&mdash;that I feel in these days of reconstruction, so to speak, in our country, our Ministers have as much work as they can possibly do. In fact, they have a very difficult task to carry out under extremely trying and severe circumstances.  That we all know. Therefore, I think it would be much easier for members of the Seanad interested in the Bill, and the promoter of the Bill, to attend the Dáil, where, at all events, the Minister as a rule is always <Col N="604" /> in his place, and able to deal with the matter.  What often happens, as I see by the records in our Debates, is that a question is asked of the President of the Dáil, and he very often has to refer it to the Minister of the Department who has to deal with that question.  Let us suppose the Minister is over here trying to answer a question, or dealing with a Bill that has been introduced.  That means delay and trouble, and a great deal of work for everybody, especially our Ministers, who are very hard worked, indeed. That is the reason I have put the question, simply to try and make the business that is being carried on by the Government easier for the Ministers.  I hope I shall live to see the day that we can really deal with what I call domestic legislation.  There will be a number of private Bills introduced in time when the reconstruction period, so to speak, is over, and when the morning comes, and the shadows flee away.</P>

      <P>Under the Constitution the Ministers of the Dáil are given a right to be present at the debates in the Seanad.  Members of the Seanad have no corresponding rights under the Constitution to be present in the Dáil or to take part in the proceedings there. But realising the benefit that has been derived already in the Seanad, in our deliberations, by the presence from time to time of the Minister responsible for a Bill, I think that all members of the Seanad will probably agree that it would be desirable if, by arrangement with the Dáil, we could arrive at some plan by which, in the case of a Bill initiated in this Seanad and afterwards taken up in the Dáil, or in the case of amendments inserted by the Seanad in a Bill that came from the Dáil, one or more of the Senators interested in the particular Bill, or responsible for the amendment introduced into a Bill that came from the Dáil, should have by courtesy the opportunity of attending in the Dáil and explaining the views of the Seanad.  That we cannot claim as a right.  It can only be as a matter of courtesy, and the Committee that you have already appointed to arrange matters involving inter-communication between the two Houses have not lost sight of this matter.  It is one of the things that they have been pressing upon the attention of the Chairman <Col N="605" /> of the Dáil, and it is a matter that we have yet got to see whether we can or cannot arrive at some amicable working arrangement.  From what I have seen already of the responsible officers of the Dáil and of the Ministers concerned, I think they are exceedingly anxious to help and to facilitate our work in every way.  I am of opinion that if this matter is left to the Committee who have it in charge, we may be able to arrive at some arrangement which will produce the result that is aimed at by this question.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask you a question.  I did ask it before, and you answered it, but I do not know that it has been carried out.  Who is responsible for assembling Sub-Committees? I think you answered me before that the Clerk of the Seanad was responsible. There have been several Committees in which I have been interested, and I have several times come to the Clerk or the Assistant Clerk, whoever happened to be there, and I have always been told that they could not do it on their own responsibility without the authority of An Cathaoirleach, and as he was not present and could not be got, the matter had to remain over.  Some days ago I asked to have a Committee summoned that has just assembled this morning. As a matter of fact, nothing was done until during the sitting yesterday I spoke to you about it, and it was assembled at 2.30 to-day, half an hour before the Seanad met.  As a matter of fact, it did not assemble until about 2.40, and of course there was not time to do anything. That is only a small matter, but this has constantly occurred, and I would like to know if there is anybody you could get to make responsible for calling these Committees together.</P>

      <P>I should think that primarily the responsibility would rest with the Chairman, but the actual summoning of the members would be a matter for one of our clerical staff. I might mention with regard to what the Senator says as to the Committee to-day, that I was satisfied from my knowledge of what was before the Committee that a quarter of an hour at the outside ought to give ample time to discuss and dispose of the one point, and the only one point <Col N="606" /> that arose, and experience proved that I was correct in that, because they concluded the business within the time.  I should remind the Seanad, however, that the Committee on Standing Orders are actually at present engaged in concluding the only remaining portion of the work that has to be done in regard to Standing Orders, and amongst these matters is the question of the assigning of particular duties to the various members of the staff, and we shall, of course, deal in our recommendations with this question, amongst others, of the summoning of Committees.</P>

      <P>I only just want to make one remark.  Of course, we got through the business because we were told that everybody had to leave to go to the Seanad; therefore, it had to be wound up whether we liked it or not, and, consequently, another motion which was coming on we were not able to take at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenjaminHaughton" hpid="Mr. HAUGHTON Mr. HAUGHTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HAUGHTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the following resolution:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Minister of Finance be invited to enter into communication again with the Exchequer of Great Britain and the Northern Parliament of Ireland with the object of obtaining the maximum of reciprocity in import and export duties, and at a minimum of inconvenience to the respective interests.&rdquo;  This question of the respective duties between the two countries is one of vital importance in the interests of our future&mdash;there are so many vital interests affected.  In the whole of Ireland, North and South, comparatively speaking, we have far too few industries.  In recent years we have had some new industries started, and if what I anticipate may be brought about, and if things are allowed to go on as they are planned at present some of the industries would have to be abandoned altogether, so that I think it is a matter claiming the very serious and the urgent attention of the Seanad and the Dáil.  The industry that is especially present to my mind is the great works of Messrs.  Ford &amp; Son that were recently started in my own city and neighbourhood. Mr. Ford is an Irishman born in <Col N="607" /> the Co. Cork, and, as a true patriot, when he was enlarging his great business for the manufacture of automobiles in the United States of America&mdash;by far the largest factory of the kind in the world&mdash; when he thought of extending his business in Europe, the first place that occurred to him to start such works was in Ireland and in his own native County of Cork.  With that object in view he acquired a large property in Cork extending over six acres and expended several hundreds of thousands of pounds in capital.  The expenditure on the buildings put up in the last few years amounts to over £250,000.  The machinery and plant cost no less than £625,000.  To-day the firm employs 1,800 men, and the wages bill amounts to about £10,000 a week. The men's wages when compared with other firms are found not to be less, at any rate, but on the contrary considerably more than those paid by any other firm in the South of Ireland.  Looking to the future they were preparing to export from Ireland in this year of grace 1923, parts of cars and engines amounting in value to one and a half millions of money. The arrangement was to consign these engines and parts to the assembly plant in Manchester.  If the tax that is proposed to be inflicted on this valuable export be carried out it would mean for the British Treasury and for the Chancellor across the Channel no less than £275,000 yearly.  I submit that it would be practically impossible tax, because, although Messrs.  Ford are an enormously wealthy firm they must work their business on an economic basis, and it would be practically an impossibility for them to continue their work in Cork, at least I am so advised by their manager.  I would like to point out that on the 22nd February, 1922, the late President Griffith, whose memory we all cherish, and who was alluded to so suitably in the Seanad only yesterday, and also on a previous occasion, gave his assurance to the management of Messrs.  Ford's works that there was no intention whatever to set up a Customs barrier between the two countries with regard to their manufactures. Being thus encouraged they continued their work of expending large sums of money on permanent buildings, and laying down more and more plant.  I venture to express the earnest hope, therefore, that some practical steps will be taken <Col N="608" /> in hands at once, and that with that object the resolution I submit will be adopted and carried out.  It has been suggested to me that one way out of the difficulty would be, if they could differentiate between the manufacture of motor cars and automobiles, and other exports or imports, so that the duty we would impose on imports manufactured in Great Britain would about cover the exports of Ford cars from Ireland.  If some means like that could be adopted it would be a great advantage to Ireland, and particularly to the South of Ireland, with which I have the pleasure to be associated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.C. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to second the resolution that has been proposed by Mr. Haughton, and I confess I do so with some misgiving, because I can see the importance from the Free State point of view of being master of its financial resources and collecting its revenue, and for that purpose some sort of Customs barrier is absolutely indispensable.  Those who have studied such questions as tariffs and customs barriers generally and duties protective or for the purposes of revenue well know the enormous difficulty of collecting the greatest amount of revenue with the minimum amount of dislocation to trade or the destruction of trade in some cases.  My view on the proposals foreshadowed is that I do not think in the circumstances in which the Government of this Free State has been working since it came into office it has had sufficient time at its disposal to deal with questions like this which are really very intricate and very involved and may imperil many of the too few industries we have in the country.  If some means could be arrived at by which we could carry on for the present until a number of representatives in the different industries were able to put their views before the Minister for Finance&mdash;no doubt some would be for and some against&mdash;it would at least enable the Minister for Finance to acquire a mass of information so that he could form a more mature judgment when he comes to frame legislation with regard to Customs duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MARTIN FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>Before passing this resolution, a little care should be taken as to the effect of it. The Government are trying to carry on in the country and they require finance. They require all the assistance that finance can give them: It will not help <Col N="609" /> any industry in this country, to my mind, to make retrospective, or whatever form you may call it, financial arrangements as between the manufacturers of motor cars in England and the manufacturers in Cork.  If the Government consider it is well to have a tariff similar to the tariff which the British Government has imposed upon Canada, on vehicles such as motor cars, there is no reason why we would not create our own industries, and there is no reason why that tariff should not serve us.  I am not aware yet that the sending of certain portions of a motor car created tariffs.  I have imported from France and other places portions of motor cars and other material which have not borne tariff; I have done it within the last month.  As far as I know the Act of Parliament with reference to tariff on motor cars does not mean that there will be 22½ per cent. imposed on £128 on each car from Ford's.  At all events, I think the Government might get a reasonable chance without their hands being forced as to tariff and the way to arrange it. There are many things I know of at the present moment coming into this country in such huge quantities that if you do not put a wall of tariff around them you will have no revenue.  If you have no examination of goods, there can be plenty of arms and ammunition poured into the country.  There are plenty of goods which should bear a tariff.  Quantities of goods come in here which should bear a tariff, and which the English Government derive a tariff from.  If there is no strict barrier imposed, I am greatly afraid we will have no revenue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir NUGENT EVERARD</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand the difficulty that has been raised in reference to Ford motor cars. Our interest as an independent unit, if it were not for the Ford works, would be to have no tariff whatever upon imported cars.  If we do not get the advantage of a tariff here&mdash;that is, the 33? per cent. charged on imported Ford cars&mdash;I do not see exactly what complaint can be made by the Ford Company if a tariff is put against them from this country; nor do I see that we get the benefit of the car being produced in this country.  I think to evade our general rules as to what the national policy of the Government should be in regard to fiscal matters, would be a great interference on our part.  For instance, take the case of steel plates.  I <Col N="610" /> believe there is a heavy import duty in England simply to protect their steel works.  We have no steel works, and we should prefer free trading in steel plates, whether they come from Sweden, Belgium, or any other foreign country. It would enable our shipbuilding here to be carried on at a lower cost than in England. Then take any other article that is protected in England and which we do not produce.  We are not bound, I understand, to impose the same tariff. Musical instruments, which we certainly do not use to a large extent, and which are produced in England, are taxed heavily there to protect the British industry. I only wish to put forward a caveat against committing ourselves to a Free Trade policy before we have an opportunity of thoroughly considering the matter. I do not think it would be fair to the Irish Government to commit them to any definite policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad Senator Sir Nugent Everard has made that point, because I think this is a case where a motion on the grounds of urgency, on a matter in which everybody in the Seanad has a very considerable amount of sympathy, asks us to be committed to a sweeping resolution as to the whole immediate and future policy of the Irish Government. We are asked to enter into communication with the object of obtaining a maximum of reciprocity in import and export duties.  We are asked definitely to declare our opinion at a few moments' notice on a question which has exercised years and years of discussion as between the Dominions and Great Britain, and we are asked to commit ourselves not only to a free trade policy, but to a protectionist policy, by the resolution which we have here.  There is a small point with regard to the Parliament of Northern Ireland.  I do not think that should be in the resolution, as the Northern Parliament has no power to deal with this matter I think if Senator Haughton would be satisfied, having now brought this matter forward and drawn the attention of the public to it, to withdraw the resolution, it would meet the point he has in mind.  We are all in agreement that every effort should be made to meet that particular case.  If he does not see his way to do that, then I would like to move as an amendment a much simpler form of motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS H. GRATTAN ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>This very interesting discussion, as it is now growing, is an illustration of the special difficulties under which we are endeavouring to function.  On what is ostensibly a resolution of apparently no very great importance, or, at all events, a resolution couched in very general terms, we are asked to discuss the fundamental issues of free trade and protection and reciprocity and so forth, in regard to Ireland.  With every good will to assist our colleague, I do not know that we can go as far with him as he asks us.  If we are to discuss fiscal policy, a subject upon which the Seanad will naturally have a legitimate right to express its views, that would be a very large order.  It is not an issue that we can decide even in one day's debate.  As far as I am concerned I admit I do not know where I am on this matter of free trade, protection, or reciprocity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in a position to vote one way or the other at the present moment.  It is perfectly true that my first teachings were the usual teachings of my time&mdash;free trade, owing to the influence of Adam Smith. John Stewart Mill, and the rest of those gentlemen.  Things changed a little later, and when one discovered people like Cairns, Devas, and men like those who took opposite views, our opinions commenced to change.  Then we had the experience of foreign countries, and we found out how well they were getting on under protection with their system of special bounties, and so on, and some of us harped back to the days when the Irish Parliament gave bounties to advance special industries, so on account of that, we came to be changed in our original opinions.  Then, on the other side of the Channel, labour went bald-headed for free trade, and it will be in the recollection of the Seanad that a few years ago a leading English statesman endeavoured to direct his country into the channel of colonial preference, and that endeavour reacted rather disastrously upon the party for which he spoke.  So far as this country is concerned I have not made up my mind, and I do not think any one can make up his mind until we have a settled Government in the country, or until we have a year or two years' practice in the operation of our fiscal laws, and the experience of the treatment we are to receive from our nearest <Col N="612" /> neighbours, both north and east.  I do not know that we can help our friend and colleague in relation to this resolution. He is anxious, as we all are, to encourage Irish industry.  For many years when I had a wardrobe it was all of Irish manufacture. We are all anxious to encourage Irish industry, and particularly to encourage the very splendid effort made by Mr. Ford to establish an Irish motor factory in Cork.  I do not know whether Mr. Ford is hampered under the present arrangement.  Personally, I have not the remotest idea of what the present arrangements are.  I have not the smallest idea of what the import or the export duties are, who imposes those duties, or who receives them.  I have not yet heard that our Government is looking forward to receiving financial assistance from duties on imports.  I should be very glad to hear it was receiving assistance in that respect.  But I have not yet heard anything about it.  If there are to be import duties I should like to be informed about them, and if there are to be export duties I should also like to know of them.  In fact, if we have reached the stage when we can discuss in a practical manner these questions, we shall naturally ask the Government to lay papers upon the Table of this Seanad in order that we may know where we are.  We have not got to that stage so far.  I understand, of course, for the present there must be some kind of Customs barriers between ourselves and our Northern brethren.  I do not know whether that would be duties levied on exports to or imports from them all.  I do not think that follows.  I know nothing whatever about it.  As far as convenience goes I am quite certain our Government would like to spare everybody any inconvenience if it would be possible. and to the extent of the inconvenience I would be willing to support the honourable Senator, but if we are to raise the question of reciprocity so early as this.  I do not think the Seanad can commit itself one way or the other.  I agree with Senator Douglas that our friend opposite has done very well in raising this question.  We have discussed it, and I think that for the moment he has attained his purpose by ventilating the subject as he has done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. ANDREW JAMESON Mr. ANDREW JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANDREW JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Haughton must have understood from the remarks of the Senators who have <Col N="613" /> just spoken that the words of his resolution have gone far beyond what, judging from his speech, we know he has really in mind.  Irish manufacturers know it. Anybody in Cork knows also.  He sees an industry, which is at present being conducted in Cork greatly for the benefit of the working classes there, and everybody concerned, in great risk of having a large part of its business cut off&mdash;that is, the export of goods from Cork into Great Britain.  That is the danger he is concerned with, because undoubtedly the Cork industry can carry on business in the Free State as well as ever it did.  Messrs. Ford can only be afraid that they will not be able to carry on their business of exporting from Cork as well as before, and probably they will have to establish a great industry across-Channel, so that in England or Northern Ireland only will the Cork industry be cut down.  That is probably what Messrs. Ford are foreseeing.  There are a great many industries&mdash;some of them have been brought to the notice of the President and other members of the Government&mdash;where, because of our becoming now a Colony when we were before a part of the United Kingdom, the duties against goods imported from the Free State automatically come in under existing arrangements. We cannot at present avoid those things.  If an industry is hit in that way, and knows that it will have to take part of its factory and send it over to Great Britain, it will undoubtedly have a good case to come to the Government with, and I have not the slightest doubt but that it will get the most sympathetic hearing.  If there are any possibilities of avoiding such a state of affairs, it is to the interest of the Government to do so, and I have no doubt but that it will be done.  To ask them, however, to interfere with the duties because a few industries may have to go would be going too far for us, and we must see that. The upshot of what we are saying here should be that every manufacturer in the Free State who knows that the duties put against him by importing his goods into Great Britain is going to cut down his factories very largely, and probably that he will have to go across water and establish a factory on the other side for manufacturing&mdash;that gentleman should lay his case before the Government, and I have no doubt it will be seriously considered. <Col N="614" /> I think that is as far as the Seanad should go.</P>

      <P>The first thing on the Orders of the Day is the Committee Stage of the Electoral Bill. The first amendment in the Paper stands in the name of Senator de Loughrey.  I want to call your attention, Senator, to this amendment, because it is not really in order, and I want to help you to accomplish what you wish to discuss.  It is not an amendment to any particular section.  It is an amendment to omit certain words&mdash;the words &ldquo;for Local Government&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;Minister,&rdquo; wherever it occurs, except in one particular section.  Of course, that amendment is not in order.  The right way to do that is to put down an amendment to these words wherever they first occur in the Bill, and then it can be discussed.  If the Seanad accepts your amendment as regards that particular section, it will follow that the consequential result will be that the words will go out wherever else they occur in the Bill; but you cannot propose an amendment in the form it is in.  I have been looking through the Bill, and I think I am right in assuming that the first section in which these words occur which you wish to have omitted is Section 8 of Sub-section 2, and accordingly I will call on you when we reach that section.  I may say the same with regard to the next amendment in your name, which also is not confined to any particular section, but proposes to omit certain words wherever they occur in the Bill.  I have not been quite able myself to follow the effect of the second amendment, nor can I find the particular first section of the Bill in which the words objected to occur, but perhaps while we are discussing the earlier clauses you will look <Col N="615" /> into the matter yourself, and if you find out for me where these words which you wish to omit first occur, I will call on you when we reach that part of the Bill.</P>

I do not see that there was any necessity for it.  I think these words occur over thirty times, but if the Minister thinks my proposition of no service or importance I will not press it.</P>

The object of these two amendments, No. 1 and No. 2 in the paper, that stand in your name, apparently is to avoid the repetition of the words &ldquo;for Local Government,&rdquo; that is to say, you will find in various sections references to the Minister for Local Government, and your suggestion is it would be sufficient to leave those words &ldquo;for Local Government&rdquo; but when you come to the Definition Section and say &ldquo;the Minister in this Act shall mean the Minister for Local Government,&rdquo; I have not gone through the Act, and I cannot say if that would be satisfactory, because other Ministers, for example the Minister for Finance, may be referred to, and it would be very awkward if you were to do that, unless you were satisfied that no other Minister is referred to in that Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that in order to enable us really to understand the motive and object of my amendment it would be a good thing for us to think of how other people regard us, and in connection <Col N="617" /> with that perhaps I might refer to an article which I read in an American paper a good many years ago discussing the fitness of the Irish for self-government. The article was written in connection with the franchise, as they call it there, or a concession which had been voted away by a board which was controlled largely by Irishmen, for what was notoriously a consideration.  The article went on to say that the Irish appeared to have a peculiar power or capacity for corruption in public affairs, and that even in America where they were controlled by public opinion that if a few Irishmen got into a town in the course of a very few years they ran that town, and it further said that if in this country where in the face of public opinion they had kept themselves moderately honest they could in a short time have stolen the fee-simple of the Emerald Isle what can we expect will occur in their own country.  The article was somewhat illuminating as regards the American editor's idea of what moderate honesty was and the standard it set up by stealing the fee-simple of the Emerald Isle, but it was more illuminating as showing the power which they had acquired, a power which gave them a monopoly of votes.  An advice was given by an American Society, which was largely controlled by the Irish, that in every election they should vote early and vote often, and it was said that by means of this proceeding they had succeeded in obtaining the control they had.  Whatever form of Irishmen we may be, reading remarks of this sort in a foreign press hurt.  They hurt me, and I am sure that every member of both Houses of this Irish Parliament will be concerned to do everything that is in his power to put a stop to the possibility of corruption being carried on.  I heard on the last occasion on which this matter was discussed in the Seanad that a lot of dead people had been polled, and in fact that it was the practice to poll them and with that object in view I framed these amendments. I followed the lines, as far as I could, which covered the issue of passports, and we shall probably hear from the Minister that he has submitted this question to a Committee which has considered it and which has advised them.  I have the Report of the Committee and I see <Col N="618" /> that they allude to a system of electoral cards, which differs in some very important respects from the proposals that I have made.  For instance, I propose that on every card a number of spaces shall be provided in which the Presiding Officer at the polling booth will stamp the date of the election at which the card was used.  If the Presiding Officer satisfies himself by means of the photograph and by the signature that the right person presents the card, and if he further stamps the card, it seems to me that no better protection can possibly be given to prevent that person voting a second time or to prevent the wrong person polling the vote of somebody else.  Of course all this procedure will cost a certain amount of money, and furthermore the whole electoral proceedings will cost a certain amount of money.  The country has to pay that.  I do not think I am disclosing any very great secret in saying that the country wants money and that the more money we can get the better.  I am not wedded to the sum in any way; I do not care whether it is more or less, but I think everybody who wishes to be a good citizen should not grudge, say, the amount of a dog tax to exercise his vote, and I never yet knew an Irishman so poor that the amount of the dog tax prevented him keeping a dog if he had any desire to do so.  If he has any great desire to exercise the vote conscientiously I do not think that five shillings will prevent him from doing it, but, as I say, I am not wedded to that sum.  I simply put it down.  I suppose we may probably assume that there will be a couple of million voters in the Irish Free State, and, if so, this will bring in a revenue of £500,000, which would largely go towards the cost of conducting elections and preparing the Register, and in my opinion it would be a very good thing.  If anybody thinks that the amount is too high it can be reduced, but if a man has first to get a card the same as for a passport, if he has to get a photograph, which he can get for a very small sum&mdash;a stickyback on the card sufficiently accurate to enable his features to be recognised would be sufficient&mdash;and he brings the card to the office of the proper officer where it would be stamped with an embossed stamp, I do not know what better protection we <Col N="619" /> could adopt to prevent corruption.  I beg to move the amendment.</P>

      <P>There is a legend in this country that at elections there is a certain amount of personation.  Our side never personates, but the other side always does.  But however that may be an opinion prevails that personation is carried on to some extent.  Some time ago the Minister&mdash;I am not sure which Minister it was&mdash;sent round a very interesting pamphlet with regard to the Ministry's ideas for dealing with this question of personation.  I am not sure how far those ideas are carried out in this Bill. To be frank, I have not read through <Col N="620" /> the Bill and I do not know, but I think Senator Barrington's idea is original and it deserves to be encouraged.  The only question is that of expense.  The five shillings which he puts down as the price of this voting card is not as bad as it looks.  It is five shillings for the first time and then it does for five years or three years, so that it is really at the rate of either 1/4 a year or a 1/- a year. That is not at all too much to pay for a vote.  I think if people want to have votes they might pay that much for them, and I also think that if people get votes they ought to be compelled to use them.  Some people personate, and others do not vote at all.  I do not know which of the two species is the greater offender.  If Senator Barrington likes to put his proposition to a vote I will vote for it with pleasure.</P>

      <P>I think that this is not an amendment which the Seanad would be well advised to pass.  Some time ago, when Dáil Eireann was in its period as a Provisional Parliament, a Committee was appointed to consider the question of electoral abuses, and particularly personation, and we appointed six people on that Committee who had had a good deal of experience of elections. I will not say that they ever had anything to do with personating, but in any case they are all on the side of the angels now.  They considered this proposal and they came to the conclusion that it was too cumbersome and too costly to be adopted, and that moreover it might not be efficacious.  In Belgium, where people have to carry cards to establish their identity when they change their residences and must produce to the police from time to time, these cards are called for when they go to vote, but here people are not compelled to have cards. I believe that if anything had to be paid very few people would get cards and that when you got right up against an election you would have, perhaps, not one-fourth of the people qualified to vote by the possession of the necessary cards. They might have a certain interest. They might intend to get cards, but fail to do it, and it is undesirable that people through any sort of slackness when an election comes, and when a vital matter has to be decided, should be prevented from exercising the franchise.  I think <Col N="621" /> the exercise of the franchise would be restricted.  Then if people could not vote without the cards it is possible you would have a few young men with guns straying along the roads who would let some people pass and would stop others and relieve them of their cards.  You would find, perhaps, that the issue of cards had created a new difficulty.  The Committee to which I referred is of opinion that the problem of personation presented its greatest difficulties in the cities, such as Dublin and Cork, and that there the difficulties were largely due to the form of the register.  There were large polling districts where people came from one end of a ward to another and where personating agents could not possibly be put into the booths who would know everybody entitled to vote there.  The Committee recommend a system of smaller polling districts consolidated round each polling booth, so that it would be possible for agents to be put in who would be personally acquainted with nearly every one entitled to vote.  They also recommend giving certain additional powers to policemen who might be in the booths and to Presiding Officers, and they recommend that changes should be made in regard to the penalties for personation&mdash;that people convicted should not be let off with a fine, but should get at least a term of imprisonment.  A Corrupt Practices Bill is in preparation and we intend to incorporate these proposals for dealing severely with people who personate in that Bill and also to provide powers to enable Presiding Officers and policemen to arrest, without direction from the agents of either candidate, people whom they know and whom they are prepared to swear in court were guilty of personation. I think that though personation has been a terrible evil in this country it is one that can be overcome without resorting to the costly and difficult and somewhat drastic measures proposed by Senator Barrington.</P>

      <P>I am of opinion that some form of identification or guarantee must be produced in this election, not so much to stop personation as to ensure that the election should be carried out on the adult franchise.  It is very difficult, so far as I can gather from the means adopted to secure information <Col N="622" /> as to who are and who are not entitled to be on the roll.  It is very difficult to discern whether a boy or a girl is really nineteen or twenty-one years of age.  So far as my information goes from some inquiries that were set on foot I know of people who are only eighteen or nineteen and who certainly will appear on the register if not objected to.  I think that if some definite steps are not taken to tighten matters up you may conclude that you will have this election on an average of about a nineteen-year-old franchise so far as a great number of those who will be enabled to get on the register are concerned.  That is not a desirable thing. Article 14 of the Constitution is referred to in the amendment, and it specifically states that those only who have reached the age of twenty-one, or of thirty years in reference to the election to the Seanad, who have actually reached that age, and not those who have stated they have reached it, are entitled to be on the register.  The onus is thrown on the Government and on those responsible for this election to secure that persons only who have reached these respective ages appear on the register for the Dáil and for the Seanad. Now the present regulations do not ensure that.  In fact they afford every facility for evading it, and consequently unless something more definite than appears to have been done so far is done you will not have the election carried out in accordance with Article 14 of the Constitution.  It is for us to take every measure that we reasonably can &mdash; and even then there will be new loopholes to secure that the spirit in which that article was couched and was drawn up should be adhered to.  I think the proposal of Senator Barrington is not such as could in practice be carried out.  I am rather inclined to agree with the Minister that you would have only a more limited register to work upon. There should, however, be some guarantee that those young persons whose age cannot be certified should have some declaration made.  If we insist on their getting a baptismal certificate we will probably find that the records are not there.  The baptismal records or other records of many people of that age are not procurable, or possibly could not be procured, because those who are in a <Col N="623" /> position to give copies of these records would require certain fees.  Certainly it would be a very long and wearisome task.  There should be somebody, whether father or mother, uncle or aunt, or some responsible relation, who would be made to sign a form under a very heavy penalty that a person claiming to be put on the register, and whose age was doubtful, was 21 years of age and over. I think that would not impose any very great hardship upon anybody, and I am sure that these adult relations will be only too glad to certify.  If you put on a penalty I do not think that many will sign that declaration unless they are absolutely sure of what they are signing. In that way we might get near to the ideal election, the election that we would all like to see carried out on an adult suffrage basis, and an election that will be carried out in such a way as will give no room to any party to question the result of that election on the very serious issues that will have to be decided.</P>

      <P>I intend to vote against this amendment, because I believe it would restrict the number of voters that would turn up.  I would suggest to Senator Barrington that a good way to meet this point would be to agree to pay the voters that are going instead of making them pay to be allowed to vote.  They would then have a much better chance, because in many cases a great many workers cannot afford to go up to vote and somebody else personates them.</P>

      <P>I should like to associate myself with the remarks made by Senator Kenny, and to suggest that this is not the proper time to effect his very desirable intention, and that the matter would more properly come under the Bill which the Minister foreshadowed in connection with corrupt practices.  I do suggest very strongly that there is a duty cast upon the Government to make corrupt practices as watertight as possible and not to throw that duty on the party organisations.  Party organisations in the last resort, of course, have to operate, but the Government should reduce the scope for the party organisations in this matter to the minimum by Statute and by adequate penalties. <Col N="624" /> There is a danger we all know of the Central Authority being satisfied with things which appear all right on the face of them, but which in practice will prove to be very defective.  As you know a certain form, I think it was Form A, was issued lately in connection with the preparation of the register.  I do not exactly know who is to blame, but we know as a fact, at least many Senators know, that many of the forms never reached a large proportion of the voters at all.  I believe it was the duty of the rate collectors, but they did not do it.  The point I make is that it rests with the Government to see if these things are not done that adequate penalties are inflicted and, if possible, the law altered and some machinery set up which does.  As Senator Kenny has said, the great danger will be not on the question of personation but on the question of age.</P>

      <P>I move to delete the section.  I hope notwithstanding anything that has happened in the Dáil that the Seanad will consider this amendment purely on the merits. If I could convince myself that the ends of justice were in any way served materially at all events by depriving policemen of the vote I should not move the amendment.  Although you may deprive a man of the vote you cannot deprive him of his mind or of having the right to a political outlook and a political voice.  We know from experience that some of the most ardent politicians in the past and indeed at the present time are people who never had a vote.  The Bill as it stands does not prevent a policeman from being a politician. He can take part in the elections to the extent if he so desires of canvassing, speaking on a public platform and in other respects acting as an ordinary elector.  At least as far as the Bill goes the only restriction is to deprive him of the right to record his vote. Now the actual voting power of policemen <Col N="625" /> with the extended franchise will be absolutely negligible.  Where there are 6 or 7 policemen in a town or district where there are thousands of electors their votes will not count; their political influence will to all intents and purposes be negligible, and certainly will not, if there is any influence at all, be minimised by depriving them of the vote.  It is like a man who, knowing that water or some other liquids were becoming scarce, developed a terrible thirst.  The knowledge that he has been deprived of the vote makes the policeman perhaps more of a politician than if he had the ordinary rights of other citizens.  The other people connected with the work of an election, the returning officers and others, the Sheriff, all those who are inside the booth, and who really have the power if they have the mind to influence the election one way or the other by the proper working of the Franchise Act, have the right to vote.  The only one deprived of the vote is the policeman who may be standing outside the booth or waiting inside to carry out his instructions.  He certainly does not exercise the same influence on the election as people who are actually engaged in seeing that the Act is being complied with in all its details.  For that reason I fail to see how justice is going to be served or the better administration of the Act is going to be furthered by inserting this particular clause.  I appreciate of course the spirit in which the clause is being inserted, but I believe on further consideration it will be found to be unnecessary. I quite agree that it would be very undesirable that policemen should be canvassed in barracks, but at any time the Minister can make regulations preventing that without having this special provision. We would agree that it is also undesirable to canvass soldiers in barracks and that particularly will be the case at the first election.  Still they have the right to vote, at all events, and the inference is that they will also be liable to be canvassed.  If it can be prevented in the case of soldiers it can also be prevented in the case of policemen.  For that reason I hope the Seanad will give a fair and unbiased consideration to this amendment, as I think they will agree that it will in no way disimprove the Bill, but on the other hand that it will be a better document than it is at the present time.</P>

      <P>I would like to assure the Seanad that before this Section was inserted in the Bill the matter was considered very carefully indeed and the Government and the people associated with the direction of the police were of opinion that it was desirable to have a provision of this sort.  We are at the present time starting a new police force under very difficult circumstances.  We are sending them out with very little training as it happens, with incomplete training, to carry out their duties under circumstances of extreme difficulty.  We want them everywhere they go to preserve an attitude of strict impartiality and to do their duty without any party bias whatsoever. It is quite true that their vote in the balance would not matter, their numbers would be so small that it would not matter in the least how they voted.  It is also true that men may have their opinions whether they have votes or not&mdash;strong opinions on political matters&mdash;but if they have no votes there will be no attempt made locally to drag them in by one side or the other. They will not be subjected to a canvass, and they will not have the neighbours coming to persuade them to go and vote for this side or for that side, or asking them to use their influence one way or the other. They will be able to preserve more easily their position of detachment and impartiality in the matters that arise in the political arena.  We think in the circumstances of the time no matter what may happen in 5 or 10 years, that at least for the present it is most desirable that no arrangement should be made that would tend to have the police brought into party political strife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, it is quite clear they would not be allowed to canvass or speak on public platforms at elections.  That can be prevented easily by regulations, but we think it is improper that they should be given the right by law to vote and be debarred from exercising that right to vote by police regulations.  That would be a way by which it could be done, but we think that is an undesirable way. If the law confers the right on people to vote they ought not to be debarred from voting by private arrangements.  Consequently we think it is desirable that they should not vote.  One of the difficulties of stopping personation arose from the fact that the onus for action rested <Col N="627" /> on the political parties and their agents. What happened was that both sides were personating; one agent got one man arrested from one side, and his opponent got another man arrested from the other side.  At the end of the day they exchanged prisoners, so to speak, and nothing happened.  We want to make arrangements so that if there is flagrant and undoubted personation the police could come in and prosecute a man whom they find personating just as a policeman would prosecute a man found drunk on the streets.  If this new duty is cast upon the police it is doubly desirable that they should be kept detached from political activities.  I recommend to the Seanad to leave the provision in the Bill as it stands for those reasons, and inasmuch as people who have given most thought to the question of police administration, present and future, advise it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Every person rated as occupier of any house, lands, or other hereditaments shall be disqualified from being registered as an elector, if the last rate made on the premises out of which he or she derives his or her qualification has not been paid, provided that he or she is legally liable for the payment of such rate.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not require many words to explain what the purpose of the amendment is.  It means that people who do not pay their rates should not have the right of voting.  In the conditions that we have in the country at present I think it will be a very excellent thing for the local authorities to get in the money by means of such an amendment as this, and it also will exclude that class of elector that I think would not do any good to the country, because the man who will not pay his rates in the district in which he lives is hardly a good sample of citizen.  What the Electoral Bill should do, if possible, is to get the best class of our citizens to vote, and the men and women who bear the burden of the country on their shoulders should be given the right to vote; would-be electors who <Col N="628" /> refuse to take their share in paying the rates should not have a vote.

When the Bill came to be introduced I suggested to the Minister that he should have such a clause inserted in a Bill dealing with Local Government Franchise, and that would carry out the object which is intended by this amendment. For Parliamentary Franchise I think it would be unfair to deprive a man of his vote who had not his rates paid, because he is contributing to the taxes of the country in the same way as an individual who had no rates to pay was contributing.  He is contributing by means of taxes paid on the food he consumes, on the tobacco he smokes, and on the drink he takes.  In that way he is contributing to the taxes of the country, and ought to be entitled to the Parliamentary vote.  I oppose the amendment on this occasion, but I would be very glad to support the suggestion in connection with Local Government Franchise.</P>

After the period for lodging ordinary objections has expired, and although we know in some places rate collectors and others have wrongfully included names which should not be included, I believe we would be able to get most of those names out of the Register before it is printed.

I believe that, with reference to deputies, the Clerks of the Crown and Peace being solicitors themselves have a habit of appointing other solicitors to act as their deputies, and Lord Wicklow's belief is that the most efficient deputies would be the Clerks of the Rural Districts and the Urban Councils, and the Town Clerks, and that solicitors to act as deputies should only be appointed when those clerks will not act. He believes that the putting in of the words of this amendment will enable the most efficient men to be first called upon to act, and that solicitors will only be called upon to act in the failure only of the clerks to fulfil the duties.</P>

      <P>If the purpose of this amendment is adopted I am quite prepared to admit that it will entail several consequential amendments, but as we have at present no legal adviser except yourself, Sir, to carry these things through, I did not wish to bother you about it.  But I suggest at present that an enterprising party who wished to obstruct the Government could embarrass the Government very much by putting up the same candidate in a number of constituencies, and the only method by which you could prevent that is by the forfeiture of the penalty, and I am not quite clear even then that if the candidate chooses to take his seat for one constituency legally his deposit is forfeited in all the other constituencies. because naturally it is a physical impossibility for him to take his seat for more than one constituency.  That is a matter of law which the Minister has probably considered already, but if I am right, and if a candidate could get elected for&mdash; take an extreme case&mdash;fifteen or twenty seats, you will then have fourteen or fifteen bye&mdash;elections forced on the country; and that is not desirable in the interests of economy or business, or even national dignity, and I suggest you can prevent it by ensuring that no candidate shall be allowed to appear on the ballot papers of more than one constituency.  As I understand the thing at present, you cannot prevent a candidate being nominated in a number of constituencies.  The nominations take place on the same day, but a period must elapse between the nominations and the printing of the ballot papers, and during that period a candidate must elect for which constituency he will go forward, and his name will not appear on the ballot papers of any other constituencies.  That appears to be the most practical method of achieving the purpose.  It may not always be necessary, but conceivably in certain circumstances it may be highly desirable.</P>

      <P>What seems to me to be an insuperable difficulty in this connection is that a candidate may be proposed in his absence from the country. His proposer or seconder may be his election agent.  For all purposes they are really two persons, as you might say. One set of people propose him in one constituency; another set propose him in another, and there is no means of deciding between these two sets of people in the absence of the candidate.  There is no means of making one of them give way to the other, and at the same time it would be unfair to strike out a candidate's name because of that.  As this Bill stands at present, no matter how many seats a candidate may be returned for he can only get one deposit back, so that there is at least a fine of £100 where a candidate is returned for more seats than one.  There are not likely to be many constituencies with unopposed returns under Proportional Representation.  I think the unopposed return in the future would be a very rare thing indeed.  Consequently all that will be effected by the nomination of a person in more constituencies than one will be to add an extra name to the ballot paper, and I do not think that that is likely to be the case, except in very rare instances where an election is forced upon a constituency by a spurious nomination.  I think that possibly this might impose restrictions which are undesirable, and there are difficulties in carrying it out.  This is a difficulty that I have mentioned in carrying it into effect, and I think that unless we see from experience that evil had arisen in this way it would be better to leave things as they are.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;If a candidate is not elected the deposit made by him or on his behalf shall be returned to him as soon as practicable after the result of the election is declared, unless the number of votes polled by him does not exceed one-third of the quota as ascertained in accordance with the rules contained in the Third Schedule of this Act, and in such case the deposit shall be forfeited to Saorstát Eireann. <Col N="636" /> For the purposes of this sub-section the number of votes polled by a candidate shall be deemed to be the greatest number of votes at any time credited to him in accordance with the Rules contained in the Third Schedule to this Act.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I beg leave to move the amendment to Section 20, Sub-section 4, standing on the Order Paper in my name and my object in doing so is to endeavour to make forfeiture more equitable.  The whole Bill is based on Proportional Representation and the amendment that I suggest is based on similar lines.  At present if the required number of votes that a candidate should secure so as to obtain the return of a deposit was 1,200 and he obtained 1,199 his whole deposit would be forfeited.  I suggest, in that instance, that only one-fourth of his deposit should be forfeited and that £75 should be returned to him.  Similarly, if he only obtained half the amount, that half the deposit would be returned to him, which is an endeavour to make the forfeiture more equitable.  Were it not for the strong objection to frivolous candidates I would be keen on sweeping aside the whole section because, while it is calculated in some respects to deter these frivolous candidates from going forward, experience has shown that frivolous candidates are drawn from a class that will not be deterred by this penalty of £100.  On the other hand we know from experience that £100 would act as a handicap on candidates of great merit who will go <Col N="637" /> forward and contest elections.  We have only to look at the recent past to find such experiences.  In the case of genuine candidates&mdash;and I hold that genuine candidates will be in the greater number and that the frivolous candidates will be a very small percentage&mdash; it looks to some extent like confiscation that if they do not come up to the required number of votes, which is reasonably large, their whole deposit shall be forfeited.  That is my object in proposing the motion and I beg to recommend it to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I take it that one-third as set up here as a first quota would enable a man to save his deposit. If he gets one vote less than that he forfeits his deposit and that would be considered a very great hardship. Possibly the last successful candidate may have only three or half-a-dozen votes more.  Look at the wide gap between these two men; one is an elected candidate and the other has not only lost his seat by a few votes but he is penalised to the extent of £100.  Now what about the man who only secures one-third, one-sixth, or one-tenth of the quota?  Is he to be put on the same level as that man, or is the man I have mentioned to be penalised to the same extent as the man who had no possible chance whatever to secure a seat, and who knew it, and the party who put him forward knew it?  I think there should be some differentiation or sliding scale in the treatment of unsuccessful candidates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>On two grounds I dislike this amendment.  First, it substitutes votes polled for votes credited to a candidate.  Now it is undesirable, especially in elections under Proportional Representation, to depend on first preference for deciding as to what support a candidate has.  I quoted in the Dáil the case of the last Cavan election, where the quota was 6,030, I think. Deputy Milroy was elected by a small surplus over the next candidate, but on first preference he received only 513 votes, that meant that although he was elected ultimately by 15 votes, if he had been those 15 votes less and had just failed to get elected, he would have, under an amendment like this, not have got one penny of his deposit.  I think <Col N="638" /> it is undesirable in view of the fact that a party may concentrate on a single popular candidate for their first preferences and that other candidates who may have a good chance to get elected may receive only a small number of first preferences, so that I think when we are dealing with the matter of the return of the deposit we should pay attention not to first preferences, but to votes credited.  Even if the amendment were to be altered to that extent, I think then that we would be reducing the penalty unnecessarily.  If a person cannot get credited to him in the course of the count at least one-third of the quota, that candidate must really be looked upon as a frivolous candidate. If the quota is 10,000 it will mean in most instances that there is a total electorate of 30,000.  In big constituencies it may be far more; a person who cannot get 3,000 votes in that case credited to him in the count must be regarded as a frivolous candidate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another way of looking at this.  One-third is not at all too high. In fact, looking over the election returns you will find that only a very small number of candidates would be kept out, and would fail to get their deposits back. I do not remember the figures exactly. I had a look over the last election lists and I found that the number would be extraordinarily small indeed, but it is desirable to put some check on nominations, because one of the difficulties of Proportional Representation is to get intelligent marking of the preferences. The tendency is for people to vote for a favourite candidate and then to mark their subsequent preferences very much at random.  Consequently it is undesirable that there should be an unnecessarily large number of candidates on the paper, and you will get much better voting and much better representation by attempting to keep the names down.  If you let the people off without any forfeit, because they can get some small amount of support, you might have happening what happened in Belfast at the time of the Municipal elections. There are a number of wards in Belfast, about 24, I think, and every year a gentleman named Boston got himself nominated for every ward. This little flutter cost him something, but he got some satisfaction out of <Col N="639" /> it.  In Dublin, too, there has been a practice in the case of Municipal elections of people who, having the same name and surname as some genuine candidate getting nominated, or being persuaded to get themselves nominated, so as to  voters.  We want to prevent that sort of thing taking place. That might work very well where you have ten or twelve candidates going forward a bogus candidate bearing the same name as one of them might put out a large number of electors, and it would make it much more difficult for them when voting than if there were only one candidate of the same name.  Consequently, I think that if there is anything wrong with this it is that the figure of the deposit is really too low.  We accepted that as a compromise in the Dáil and reduced it from £150, but certainly £100 is on the low side.  If you introduce a modification as suggested by the Senator, and bring it in fact lower still, I believe you will not get the effect intended, that is to keep out the frivolous and freak candidates.</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 20, Sub-section 5, line 54:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete all after the words &lsquo;should be&rsquo; and substitute therefor the words &lsquo;returned to the person by whom the deposit was made as soon as practicable after the result of the election is declared.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment of another kind. It provides for the return of the deposit of the successful candidate whether he takes his seat or not, or where there is a delay before he takes his seat.  I do not know that I can say anything new on the subject.  The deposit was first provided to prevent freak candidates.  A candidate, however, who secures sufficient votes to return him cannot be termed a freak in the sense in which it is understood.  The electors who return him may be freaks, but the electors are the supreme authority, and they have a right to be freaks if they so desire.  It is quite unlikely that abstention from Parliament is going to be a popular pastime in the future; certainly it is not going to be stopped if it is popular by a forfeit of one hundred pounds.  We know that from past experience and from recent Irish history.  I do not like the idea of actually holding out inducements to people to come into the Dáil.  A person who is elected and who is so stupid as not to take his seat should, I think, be rather paid for staying away.  We seem to be rather holding out an inducement or actually offering a financial consideration for coming into the Dáil, to which an elected candidate is entitled to come by reason of having been elected. Certainly I would rather like to show our appreciation of his patriotism by paying him to stay away, because I cannot understand the reasoning of a man who seeks election to the Parliament of his own country, who is elected by his own <Col N="641" /> fellow-countrymen, and then refuses to take his seat.  If you confiscate his deposit you more or less make a martyr of him, a very cheap martyr; and the wholesale making of cheap martyrs, by taking serious consideration of their grotesque antics, is largely responsible for a good deal of the undesirable things that are happening in this country at the present time.  In Ireland it is much easier to kill by ridicule than by coercion.  The clause as it stands is a very feeble and ineffective form of coercion, at least coercion of a kind, and it will prove absolutely ineffective for the purpose for which it was intended.  It would look as if there was a certain anxiety on the part of those who framed the Bill as to the future of Parliamentary Assemblies. I hope the Seanad will show their confidence in their future by adopting this amendment and by saying to anybody who wishes to abstain, although elected, that he can do so, and that they are quite prepared to hand him back the hundred pounds deposit, instead of confiscating it, as is proposed.  That is the view in which I would look at it, apart altogether from the question of principle. I do not think there is very much principle involved in this case at all.  It is really a storm in a tea cup, and it is making provision for some line of action that is not likely to develop in the future. I would hold out no financial consideration of any kind, because I believe that Parliamentary institutions will for some time to come, in any case, be the only institutions, from a governmental point of view, that will be respected.  The inclusion of this clause shows a certain lack of faith in the stability of these institutions, and I think the Seanad, by adopting the amendment, will show that they have more faith in these institutions than the people who inserted this particular provision.</P>

      <P>There are two things to be said in connection with it.  First, we propose in this Bill that only one deposit shall be returned.  If a deposit is to be returned immediately a person is declared elected we defeat the intention we had in view in the case of a person who is elected for two constituencies, because that person would immediately be returned his deposit, and the intention of preventing people going up for two <Col N="642" /> seats at one election would certainly be defeated.</P>
      <P>There is the other thing, and the main thing, to be said against it, and that is that the purpose of an election, the holding of a General Election, is to provide a Parliament, an organ of Government, for the nation, and not to provide any political party with an opportunity for demonstration.  It is prostituting the purposes of an election for any person to go forward and, if elected, to refuse to take his seat.  If a person cares so to abuse the machinery provided for the purpose of providing a Parliament for the nation we think he ought at least to pay the amount of the deposit for the pleasure he has got.  That is really all there is to be said about it.</P>

For instance, if the intention is not to allow a constituency to continue unrepresented it does not deal with the possible case of a candidate who refuses to take his seat.  I do not know what would happen if a candidate refuses to declare or resign his seat.  If any candidate takes his seat I presume he can only take it in respect of one constituency, and the Dáil will declare a vacancy in the other constituency and order the Speaker to have a writ issued. I would prefer, if the Senator were willing, to consider this matter and see if we could put forward a clause that might be even better than his clause.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the question of ballot papers being sent to postal voters.  These papers may be intercepted and may not reach the voter in his home, so that they would be returned to the Returning Officer.  I consider a great deal of abuse might crop up in that way.  I think that some order should be made that these letters containing such ballot papers should be sent under registered cover. That might not check the abuse but it would minimise it.  The Minister might also order that there should be a very heavy penalty to anyone presenting these papers who is not entitled to fill them.  There will be a means afterwards of discovering whether the postal voter filled up the papers.  I think the onus should be thrown on the Post Office so far as possible by sending the papers under registered cover and an instruction should be given to the Postmaster-General and through him to his officials to ensure as far as possible the safe delivery of the letters.</P>

Section 26 refers to the Dáil and Seanad election ballot papers, etc.  When you come down to Section 27 you notice that all the ballot papers and everything else go to the Clerk of the Dáil.  There are two other elections which these are regulations for; one is the election of the Seanad and <Col N="645" /> the other is the referendum.  It would look as if some such words as these ought to be added to Section 27: &ldquo;to be elected and return their or his names or name to the Clerk of the Dáil or the Clerk of the Seanad, according as the election is for a member of the Dáil or Seanad and in the case of a referendum to both.&rdquo;  It looks as if some such words as these would be required, otherwise the whole of the ballot boxes in connection with the Seanad elections would go to the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad would know nothing about the election for the Seanad or about the result of the referendum.</P>

      <P>I move to delete Sub-section 3.  This Sub-section gives power to candidates to hold their meetings in an elementary school.  I think it is very undesirable that a public school in any district should be in any way used by any party.  I think it should be retained as neutral ground for the children of all parties.  Furthermore, I do not think there is any urgent necessity for providing a schoolroom for a meeting of any of the candidates, because all parties who are likely to come forward at an election have either their Committee Rooms in every village or, if their meetings are larger than could be held in these rooms, they have the open air for their public meetings.

I remember quite well that election time in Sheffield there were six or eight inches of snow on the ground.  The Committee Rooms of the candidates were quite small, and you could not possibly hold a meeting in them.  If we had attempted to hold a meeting in the open air we would certainly have been frozen.  I have not the slightest doubt that in Ireland, as in Great Britain, there are many places where a school is probably the only room in the place in which you could hold a meeting.  Meetings are always held at night, when the children are at home.  Schools are convenient places, as you have a platform in them. Why should you force the people out into the open air, probably in extremely bad weather, for their political meetings when there is a school there?  The school is open to both sides, and it seems to me that this Section is a most sensible one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMES DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the case is pretty simple.  The case for a public holiday for the elections to the Dáil is, I think, unanswerable, as the election will be held on the one day all over the country.  As everyone concerned <Col N="650" /> knows, very large numbers of persons will be taking an active part in the elections, but for the Seanad you will have a small number of persons to be elected over the whole area, and it does not seem to me to be a case where it is necessary to insist by an Act that it must of necessity be a public holiday. Public holidays, unless generally desired, cost a good deal of money. Wages are lost for that time and work is stopped, so that unless there is a very clear case, as I think undoubtedly there is for elections to the Dáil, I do not think we should enforce by law that there must be a general holiday for Seanad elections.  The same argument applies to referendum.  A referendum might conceivably be on a very important question, but even then I cannot see that it is so essential that it should be a public holiday, while being taken.  It may be on a relatively unimportant question and would cost a considerable amount, especially if we had two or three referenda, as I do not anticipate, in one year.  Personally, I support the amendment because I think it is not necessary to make it obligatory, but if it is found in practice later on that it is, it will be very easy to pass a small Act, or probably a proclamation of the Executive would be quite sufficient to ensure a holiday.</P>

    <P>What I want to achieve is this: There may be, in anticipation, a certain number <Col N="652" /> of referenda in one year.  It is possible that the Minister could arrange to have two or three held on the same day if the assent of both Houses could be obtained.  If a referendum was on a subject of great importance it could have a special date to itself, but if the matters are not of such great importance the Minister would not suffer a great deal if, by assent of both Houses, he postponed the holding for a period not exceeding nine months.  I think I am correct in stating that in some other countries where the referendum is in vogue a certain amount of delay is allowed before the actual referendum takes place.  I think if you read the Bill you will find the time is pretty drastic and the 21 days is too little as a safeguard. My main object is to try and save expense in having frequent referenda.</P>

      <P>I have nothing to say about the constituencies, but the number of members for each constituency strikes me as rather strange.  Take the case of Mayo and Galway.  These are very large counties, and the same number of members are to be elected for both; but in the case of Mayo it is divided into two constituencies, five members for the one and four for the other.  In the case of Galway the whole county is one constituency, for which nine members are to be elected.  It is an enormous county, containing all Connemara, and I do not know how anybody is to know about all these members. In the last County Dublin election not one-tenth of the people who elected the Deputies knew who they were or anything about them.  Many of the electors came to me in trams and elsewhere and said, &ldquo;Who are these people?  We never heard of them before.&rdquo;  Now, if that is the case in connection with the County Dublin election, what is to happen in the case of a county like Galway, with nine candidates before the electors that most of the people never heard of before, who are to be elected upon a very <Col N="654" /> complicated system of election?  I think it would be much better if very large counties like Galway and Donegal were each broken up into two constituencies. The suggested method of election is very cumbrous, and I think if you have too many candidates for one constituency it would be impossible to manage it properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty in the case of Galway was with the existing county electoral areas.  It was found impossible to divide Galway in the way that a division was made in Mayo.  If such a division were made in Galway it would mean either the creation of new boundaries, which would be somewhat troublesome, or the losing of a seat to the County.  This matter was discussed by a Committee of the Dáil which was appointed to go into it, and they were satisfied to leave the constituencies as they stand.  Some members expressed the opinion that they would like, for one election at least, to have an election in a 9-member constituency, because such a thing is new and in a sense experimental in the counting.  One advantage of an election in a 9-member constituency would be that it could be seen how it would work out actually, and how intelligently, or otherwise, the people would vote at such an election.  As soon as the census can be held there will have to be a revision of the constituencies, because the allocation of seats is based on population.  There has been no census taken since 1911, and the population may have shifted very considerably since then.  There is no doubt that, as soon as the census can be taken, and as soon as the returns come in, it will be necessary to put through a short Bill reallocating seats.  Consequently in this division as ít stands there will only be the one election, and from the rather variegated character of the constituencies we will learn what is the best size of <Col N="655" /> constituency for carrying out Parliamentary elections under the Proportional Representation system.</P>

This is only a temporary Bill, and perhaps this would be the time to make the necessary arrangements whereby the people I have in mind may be given adequate representation.  I notice that 153 members are provided for under this clause, and that representation is to be allotted in proportion to the population.  It will be necessary, I expect, to make provision for the representation of that proportion of the Six Counties transferred to the Free State in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not stand by the words of the amendment; in fact, I do not think they are satisfactory.  I have got an idea which I think is of considerable importance, and I hope it will be adopted later on, and that suitable words will be found to introduce it into the section.  I find <Col N="657" /> in this clause that a person is disqualified from standing for membership if undergoing a sentence of six months' imprisonment. That I quite approve of.  I find also in the clause that if a member of the Dáil is sentenced to six months' imprisonment he is immediately disqualified from membership.  I understand there are many cases in which a magistrate can impose a sentence of six months' imprisonment without a jury. That means that you are giving to a magistrate power to sentence a man for an offence which would disqualify him from acting as a public representative. In my opinion, that is too drastic a power to give to a magistrate.  I am not suggesting that public representatives should not be liable to imprisonment for drunkenness or anything of that kind, but I say there are often cases, such as drunkenness, in which the charge might be debatable.  I do not think that power should be given to a magistrate.  My suggestion in this amendment is that the disqualification should not take place for 30 days after the date of the sentence being imposed, or of the final hearing of any appeal against such sentence that might take place in the ordinary course of the law in the case of a member of the Dáil.  I would also suggest that the Dáil itself should have the power by resolution to state that the sentence was one which should not cause disqualification.  The words I put down in the amendment were too strong.  I think it is not desirable that the resolution should state that the sentence is unjust, but I suggest that the Dáil, by resolution, should declare that the member shall not be disqualified.  I think there are quite conceivable cases where sentences for more or less trivial matters would not be good grounds for disqualification, although it might be a good ground to prevent the man standing for membership of the House.  It is also a temptation to the magistrate or even judge and jury to be somewhat influenced by political considerations if they actually had the power to sentence. I think it is really an infringement against the rights of the House to deal with its own members.  I think in the case of the Dáil that some such amendment as this should be adopted.  I intend to bring on a similar amendment later to apply to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>There are one or two matters to be considered in connection with it.  One is the possibility that a member of a minority party would have the guillotine coming down upon him, and the friends of a member of the majority party might come to his rescue.  It is difficult to draft a Clause that would be entirely satisfactory, but probably a Clause could be drafted and I do think it is undesirable that a magistrate should have the power, if he chooses, to increase the sentence a month more than he might have imposed in other circumstances.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;In order to effect that, sufficient particulars of every candidate, to distinguish him from every other candidate, shall be printed in large type, when two or more candidates have both the same first Christian name or fore-name and the same surname, the most distinctive part <Col N="662" /> of the address of each such candidate shall also be printed in large characters, and if the address as well as the surnames and the first Christian names or forenames of two or more such candidates shall be exactly the same, then the Christian name or fore-name (or names) and surnames, and the description of each such candidate, but not any part of the address of any such candidate, shall be printed in large characters.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The following is a model for the form of the front of a ballot paper where there are more candidates than one with the same surname, and also more candidates than one with the same first Christian name or other fore-name and surname, and more than one with the same first Christian name or other fore-name, and the same address:&mdash;</P>

    <P>This is really a desire to make voting simpler, or at least to make voting plainer for the average individual.  I was glad when, at an earlier stage, I heard the Minister refer to the possibility of complicating the voting papers by nominating candidates of the same surname. This model ballot paper which I handed in with the names changed is <Col N="663" /> actually a copy of a ballot paper which was used in my own county in a Local Government election.  In the case of the first two candidates the surnames are the same.  The next three surnames were the same.  Then the next two Christian names were the same; and in the case of the next two both surnames and Christian names were the same.  That may seem an exceptional case, but it actually happened in the Callan Union area in County Kilkenny.  The presiding officer at the time had nothing to guide him, and if the same thing occurred again there would be no guide except something of this sort is done to make it quite clear. What prompted me to move this at all is the fact of it having occurred in my own area, and that brought it more forcibly to my mind.</P>

      <P>I think the purpose of Senator de Loughrey's amendment is to be commended.  There may be certain verbal alterations to be made in it, but I would suggest that if he would postpone the moving of it to the next stage, I would arrange that the Parliamentary draftsman would look over it in the meantime and perhaps put it in a form in which no further changes would be necessary.</P>

      <P>On the question as to when we shall meet again, I understand that the Government have a Money Bill which they are sending up to the Seanad, and which is urgent.  It will not be ready for to-morrow.  I understand it will not be ready before next week.  They also anticipate that the Malicious Injuries Compensation Bill, will be out of their House and in the printer's hands as finished by Monday next.  It has been suggested to me that it would be desirable that the Seanad should give that Bill at least a Second Reading next week.  In that event, it would not be necessary for us to meet to-morrow, but it would be necessary for us to meet on Wednesday. <Col N="665" /> I think, probably, one day would be sufficient to get through the work we would have.  Then we could adjourn over the Easter Recess.</P>

      <P>I am not giving any opinion about that, but I understand from Senator Douglas that the Compensation portion of it&mdash;what I might call the legal provisions of it&mdash;are dealt with in one Bill, and that then there is a Supplementary Money Bill to carry out the money provisions.  Apparently the compensation portion of it <Col N="666" /> would not be a Money Bill.  That is the position as I understand it.</P>
