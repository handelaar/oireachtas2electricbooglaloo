      <P>I propose that we should, in the first instance, take into account a communication I have received from the Clerk of the Dáil in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Eireann have directed me to acquaint Seanad that they have appointed a Committee to consist of the Ceann Comhairle, the Minister for Local Government, Deputies Burke, Hughes, McGarry, Murphy, Gorey, Johnson, Davin, and Magennis (five to form a quorum) to join with a Committee of Seanad Eireann to consider how suitable accommodation for the Oireachtas may best be provided and to examine such plans as may be submitted to them, and it is an instruction to the Committee to report upon the matters submitted to them at their earliest convenience, but not later than the 27th July; and to request that Seanad Eireann will be pleased to appoint an equal number of Senators to be joined with the Deputies of Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of that communication I think it is essential that we should now proceed to appoint a Committee which will act jointly with the Committee of the other House.  It is not stated precisely in this communication that it is to be a Joint Committee but it is stated that they are to work jointly, which may practically come to the same thing.  At the same time I think it is framed deliberately to preserve, if necessary, the separate action of each Committee.  Accordingly I suggest to the Seanad that they should now proceed with the appointment of a Committee of their own House, corresponding in number with that selected by the Dáil, and with the instructions to the Dáil Committee&mdash;that is to say, that they should report upon the matter <Col N="1390" /> at their earliest convenience, but not later than the 27th July.  I suggest that the following members of the Seanad form a Committee to act in accordance with this communication: Senator Sir J. Griffith, Senator Guinness, Senator Mrs. Stopford Green, Senator Mrs. Wyse Power, Senator O'Farrell, Senator Yeats, Senator de Loughrey, Senator McKean, the Deputy Chairman and myself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamYeats" hpid="Mr. YEATS Mr. YEATS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. YEATS</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose that that Committee be formed.  I think that it should be clearly understood that in appointing this Committee, or in agreeing to sit upon it, we do not in any way commit ourselves to any decision about the site. I understand that plans are being prepared for Kilmainham, but I think it must be understood that we are quite free to object to that site, even as a temporary site.  I do not say that I would recommend that, but we must go into it quite freely.  I think most of us have a feeling that it is undesirable that Kilmainham should be the permanent site of an Irish Parliament. People coming up from the country, we feel, will want to find themselves nearer the Parliament than they would be if you put it out into a remote suburb.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest to you, Senator Yeats, that this is not exactly the occasion for entering into a general discussion on the subject. That discussion will inevitably arise when we get the Committee's report. The question now before the House is simply whether we ought, in response to this communication from the Clerk of the Dáil, to appoint a Committee to act in co-operation with the Committee already appointed with the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be in order if I pointed out that I had a communication from the Ceann Comhairle to-day in which he said that lest there should be any misunderstanding he would like to make it quite clear that the Committee was perfectly free to report any way they thought fit, and that they were in no way bound by the terms of reference, and that any references in the Press to-day which might lead one to believe that they were in some way bound were quite incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, Senator Yeats, it would be more convenient <Col N="1391" /> if you simply move the motion for the appointment of the Committee and then when their report comes up it will be open to the Seanad to deal with it as they think fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamYeats" hpid="Mr. YEATS Mr. YEATS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. YEATS</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I would like to say is that the time is very short to report.  I understand the reason for its urgency, but it is undoubtedly very short, and it may be necessary to take expert opinion.  For instance, if we were going to the Royal Hospital temporarily, changes would be made in that building that would be of very great architectural importance, and it might be desirable for us to take expert opinion as to whether the permanent value of the building will be in any way affected by these designs.  So I think that it will possibly be necessary for us to ask for an extension of time.</P>

      <P>As regards the Committee, the first name you mentioned was that of Sir John Griffith, and so far as I understand, Sir John Griffith is abroad at present, and I doubt very much if he will be able to act on the Committee.  I think, with a small Committee, it would be well, in that case, if you would name somebody else.  I think we should be certain that every member of the Committee could be here between now and the 27th.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I had that in view in the selection I made.  All the Senators are resident in the vicinity of Dublin with the exception of Senator de Loughrey and Senator McKean, but they represent interests which I think ought to have a representation on this Committee.  That is the reason why they have been put on.  Would you yourself act in place of Sir John Griffith?</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important matter, and it may be a question on which very strong feeling prevails.  We are all a little in the dark about the situation generally.  The Dáil has appointed a Committee, and that is quite right and proper, and it invites us to form a similar Committee.  There is only one remark I would like to make about the size of the Committee&mdash;they are appointing ten, and we are appointing ten, and that is a very large Committee. If a Committee is really to do business, a smaller Committee would be better. It may be that it was desired to give representation to various interests or various opinions on this Committee, and therefore, it was made a large one.  Then, I see that it is to report by the 27th July. That is a little more than a fortnight hence.  It does seem to me that that is a very near date to settle a question, which may be of very great importance. I do not know why it is necessary to appoint the 27th of July. Would it not be possible, say, to appoint the 27th August?  Is it because it is not convenient to the public that the Dáil and the Seanad should remain in their present location for some weeks or months longer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can gather, Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde, the reason of the pressure is twofold.  In the first place, the accommodation existing here is found to be greatly inadequate.  In the next place, the public are complaining that they are excluded for such a long period from the <Col N="1393" /> National Museum.  In addition to that, there is another reason, which I think must be one of considerable urgency.  If the Committee is to report in favour, even as a temporary expedient, of the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham, substantial alterations will have to be made, and it will take a considerable time before that building is available, either as a permanent or temporary home of the future Parliament, therefore, the matter is really very urgent on all these grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much.  But, with great deference, what I was about to suggest was that inasmuch as we have been sitting here for some time, and inasmuch as the public have been for a certain time excluded from the National Gallery&mdash;I know it is very hard upon them, but then these have not been very pleasant times for anybody&mdash;would it not be possible to keep the Museum and the Picture Gallery closed in the meantime, although I do not see why the Picture Gallery should not be open, or even portions of the Museum.  I should think those new premises would not be required until after the General Election.  It is in view of the new Parliament that certain provisions will have to be made.  I do not know the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham very well. I have not been there for many years, and I do not know what the accommodation is likely to be, but I should imagine it would not be necessary to make gigantic alterations there.  However, that is a matter for the Committee to decide.  We are a little bit hazy about the terms of reference, and I do not know exactly what they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Sir T. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not quite clear about this.  Is this Committee going to examine into a site for a permanent home for the Legislature.  That raises a great issue at once.  I take leave to say that I might find myself in very violent conflict with a decision, should it be arrived at, to make the permanent home of the Legislature at Kilmainham. I have not the least objection to this Committee.  I welcome inquiry very much indeed, but I do not want to commit <Col N="1394" /> myself.  I should like to have a perfectly free hand in this matter in case there are other developments of which, individually, I might not approve.  If we agree to the appointment of this Committee, I hope it is on the understanding that the Seanad as a whole, retains its full liberty of action to deal with the report of the Committee as it thinks best. I would not like when the report would come before us, to be told that we are committed to some programme or otherwise.</P>
      <P>There is a paragraph in a paper which reached me this morning, which may, perhaps, have some significance: &ldquo;The question whether as an alternative the Bank of Ireland, College Green, should be taken over depends largely on the expenditure which would be involved in compensating the Bank,&rdquo; and so forth.  It the question of the Bank of Ireland to come before the Committee?  Is the Committee to decide finally on behalf of the Legislature on this question of the future site of the Parliament?  Some Senators have spoken to me on the question, and they seem to think that if we decide to go to Kilmainham we may be there for a very long time.  I have heard the period of ten years mentioned.  If we are going to Kilmainham for ten years. I think we might just as well go to Mountjoy straight off.  What I am very anxious about is that we should have complete liberty of action in this matter. I welcome the appointment of the Committee. I welcome inquiry into the whole question.  But I know there is very strong feeling on this subject in the country generally, and I do not want, to-morrow or the next day, to be told that either I myself have been committed or that the Seanad, as a body, has been committed to the acceptance of a certain site which might, for our time at all events, be the home of the Irish Legislature.  That is what I want to guard against.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKEAN</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Senators are very much surprised that from the list you read out the name of Senator Sir T. Esmonde has been omitted.  It is unfortunate that his name should be left out.  Naturally he takes a hereditary interest in the home of the Irish Parliament. His great ancestor watched over the cradle and followed the hearse of the Irish Parliament of 1782.  I think we ought to accord him the honour of taking <Col N="1395" /> part in the resurrection, or in finding a home for the new Irish Parliament.  I propose that his name be added to the Committee.</P>

If we add to that the name of Senator Barrington, in place of Senator Guinness, then I should think we would have all interests represented.

      <P>I was going to say that you allowed another Senator to prompt Senator Farren as Senator O'Dea referred to some Senator who had a knowledge of large buildings and another Senator wanted a member from the provinces. I suppose that prompted Senator Farren to think there should be someone else on the Committee.  If you are going that far, you might as well select people for their religion, or the town they live in.  I do not want to serve on the Committee.

If they are to be called together earlier they will be summoned. In any case they will probably be able to give a considerable amount of time to the matter during the next week, as, subject to what I may hear before the Seanad rises to-day, I think it is unlikely we will have business that would entitle me to have a meeting of the Seanad next week.  I hope to be able to state that more definitely before the Seanad rises, as, so far as I can see from the state of business in the Dáil, there will not be enough business for us next week.</P>

      <P>I did not put down formal notice, but I would like to draw the attention of the Seanad to two small recommendations that they inserted in the Bill last week.  It seems to me that we would be unwise in sending these two verbal recommendations to the Dáil when we have no recommendations of substance.  They are purely verbal, and I think the Senator who moved them thought it was not quite consistent to sometimes speak of the word Minister, and sometimes speak of the Minister for Defence.  I think it would be a mistake for the Seanad to send verbal recommendations, and I beg to move that we do not agree with the Committee in the two recommendations they made.  I was in the Chair when they were moved, and at the time it was not possible to know whether there might be other recommendations of substance.

The Minister who was here the last day gave us some information, but he was not in a position to answer my question.

I understand that the Minister for Defence is willing to give us some information.</P>

      <P>Generally speaking, our circumstances were radically different from those which had to be dealt with in the British Army&mdash;especially as regards the period of training and the period in which men were engaged on Army work.  The general training and position of our men were more or less on a level throughout the country, and the differences in rank and in responsibility were not as material with us as in, say, the British Army. For that reason we considered it advisable simply to strike a flat rate for all officers and, incidentally, a flat rate for all men. We thought it the most suitable and systematic way of dealing with the matter from the point of view of fairness to the general individual, and also for administrative purposes.  The working out of these rates was dealt with by a Government Committee set up to deal with all pay matters connected with the Army.  We took as our base line the total disability payment that would be made to officers or men, and we based it to a certain extent on the British figure.  In the British Royal Warrant for 1922 the rates for total disablement are given as follows:&mdash;Captain or Subaltern, £150; Major, £200; Lieutenant-Colonel, £250; and higher rank, £300, for officers holding temporary commissions. We have taken in our Schedule the figure of £200 per annum as the wound pension payable to officers totally disabled, as a fair one.  In the matter of men, we took the figure for total disablement as 42/- per week.  This compares with the <Col N="1402" /> figures in the British case, which are:&mdash; Private, 40/-; Corporal, 43/4; and Sergeant, 46/8.  The gratuities payable to widows were assessed from the base line of the amount payable in respect of officers totally disabled.  The same applies with regard to the men.  In the provisions for the education of youths, under the age of 18, and daughters under the age of 21, we followed to a close extent the amount paid in similar cases according to the British Warrant.</P>

      <P>We are much indebted to the Minister for giving us this information.  Although this is a Money Bill I think it is well to know that the Dáil and the Oireachtas as a whole are not burdening our Free State with pensions on a scale larger than that which was considered just in the Great War for those who were injured.  The information which we have got shows that the whole matter has been carefully thought out, both as regards the pensioners themselves and the State, and justice seems to have been done.  We are much obliged to the Minister for Defence for his information.</P>

      <P>I find here under &ldquo;Disablement&rdquo; that Class 2 is graded at a higher pension than Class 3.  In Class 2 the injury would be the loss of an arm and one eye (37s. 9d.), and in Class 3 the loss of both feet (33s. 7d.).  It is very difficult for one to decide whether a man who loses an arm and one eye is in a worse position for earning a livelihood than the man who loses both feet.  I suggest to the Minister that Class 3 ought to be moved up to Class 2.  I think that a man who loses both legs, unless he is in a skilled trade like that of a tailor, would be in a poor position to earn anything in the way of a livelihood. The man who loses one arm and one eye might possibly be useful and he certainly would be more useful than a man who loses both his feet.  I think it rather a pity that such a man should be put lower down the scale than the man who loses one arm and one eye.</P>

We certainly do not hope that we will have in this country the material for working out a Schedule of this kind which was provided by the European war.

I have been approached by a number of people employed in the Land Commission Department, some of them having a service up to 16 years.  They are temporarily employed, and have not the status of staff officers or permanent employees.

      <P>The difficulty the Senator has in mind, in wishing to effect this change, would exist if this Bill had never come forward, and there had been no change.  Men on temporary service have no rights whatever.  I do not see how we can call on the State to give them rights they would not have had. If we did we would land ourselves in endless difficulties.  There is no more thorny question than that of temporary employment in public departments, and if the Senator looks at it from every point of view, he will probably find that he would be doing more injury to that particular class by ending the employment rather than leaving them as they are now.  The men know their risks well, and take their employment.  At the end of many years there is a hardship.  Everybody knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But if you say they must become permanent at a certain time I believe you will be inflicting an injury on that class.  I do not think that the whole question of temporary employment in the Civil Service ought to be raised at this time on such an issue, because if we carried it we would undoubtedly be coming into conflict with the whole principle upon which these changes and these Bills must have been based, and raising a question which ought to be fought out in another way altogether, where somebody, who knows every interest of the people of whom the Senator is speaking, could speak with authority.  I do not think any of us here could now speak with sufficient authority to know whether we would be doing them <Col N="1406" /> a benefit or the reverse, and I do not think any of us would have the right to try to force the Government to make a change in this measure at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may say so, that is the real point.  The question which the Senator raised is of much wider application. In addition, the officials he referred to are paid, probably, something more than if the tenures had been permanent. They were employed on surveying work which it was considered would come to an end in five or six years, and the fact that they were only to be employed for five or six years was taken into account.  If every public official was to be permanent, perhaps, some other arrangements would have to be come to which would mean less employment.</P>

      <P>I should inform <Col N="1408" /> the Seanad that I have made a thorough inquiry and there is no probability of there being sufficient business to occupy us on Wednesday next, and, therefore, I propose that when we adjourn that the motion for adjournment should be until Wednesday week. I am not going to prophesy any longer with regard to these Bills, but I think it is fairly certain by Wednesday week we shall have two important Bills passed by the Dáil ready for discussion&mdash;the Land Bill and the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Bill.  These two are almost certain to be available for Wednesday week, and, of course, the moment the opportunity arises they will be circulated to members of the Seanad. But it is apparent we will have no business to justify the meeting of the Seanad on Wednesday next.</P>
