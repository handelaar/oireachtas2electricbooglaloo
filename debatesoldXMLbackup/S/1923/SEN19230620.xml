      <P>With regard to Section 6, I move: &ldquo;To delete in line 26 the words &lsquo;employer of such person&rsquo; and to substitute therefor the words &lsquo;Secretary of the particular Trade Union of which such person is a registered member, or, if he be not a registered member of any Trade Union, to his employer.&rdquo; I regret that I had not the privilege of being here last week to listen to the discussion on this important Bill, but I read the reports of it very carefully and I know what has happened.  I do not want to occupy very much time in speaking on this subject, but I desire to say that there is a very strong objection in the district from which I come in Cork, in the trading community and the Chamber of Commerce, to this idea of employers being called upon to enter upon an entirely new duty and become tax collectors, collecting from employees taxes which will not, obviously, be popular with them.  I know that the Government have had unparalleled difficulties to contend with, and everybody gives them infinite credit for the way in which they have carried on their duties and responsibilities throughout the past, and I know also that they are most anxious to work in the closet harmony with both employers and employees and to smooth over any causes for friction and difficulties that may arise between both parties.  They have given practical evidence of this even since they assumed office, and I, therefore, am taken by surprise that this suggestion, which is a <Col N="1254" /> novel one&mdash;I do not think it has been carried out in other countries&mdash;should be suggested to be taken up here.  Both the employers and the employees, for the most part, are united in objecting to this clause.  I have not had the advantage of communicating with the Trade Union Party, and I hope they do not think that I wish to spring this amendment on the Seanad by bringing it forward without consulting them.  I went into their offices, but I was not able to get into contact with any of the Labour Senators whom I have had the pleasure of meeting here.  I wanted to ask their advice before I brought it forward, and I hope they will not think that I wanted to take any advantage whatever by acting contrary to their wishes in the matter.  But, seeing that the Government has priority over everybody else in looking for what is due to them, I venture to hope that they will fall in with the suggestion, which, I submit, is rather a modest one.</P>

      <P>I am afraid, A Chathaoirligh, that I could not recommend the adoption of this amendment, which would not achieve the purpose that we have in mind.  We know that secretaries of Trades Unions have responsibilities and duties which are very different from that intended in this particular Section dealing with the deduction by employers of certain sums specified due to the Exchequer.  The main purpose of this particular Section is to get in this money.  In order to get it in we have adopted what appears to us, in the circumstances, to be the best method of collection.  We could go to court; we could put extra costs on persons who owe us this money; we could establish machinery which would enable us to collect this money with the least possible burden on the persons affected, and in that connection the duties that will devolve on employers are not particularly onerous, and in getting the assistance of the employers in those cases we are using them very lightly to discharge a public duty.  If it be admitted that income tax is a fair method of collecting revenue&mdash; and I think it will be admitted&mdash;is it not the duty of the Executive to adopt such machinery as will enable them to collect <Col N="1255" /> it?  Owing to the peculiar circumstances that have prevailed within the last couple of years large sums are in arrears.  It is open to the Government to recommend some alternative method of raising these two or three millions which are outstanding. They could impose an extra Corporation tax, or devise some other means of spreading a sum due by one particular section of the community over the shoulders of the whole of the community, but I think it would be admitted that that is inequitable.  It has been put forward by some people that because this money was withheld from payment to the British Government at a time when friendly relations did not exist between the British Government and the people of this country, these people, having performed what appeared to be a patriotic action at that time, should not now be penalised. People have paid during that period, some willingly and some unwillingly, but the liability was there in respect of all, and there is no extra liability on the part of those who have not paid&mdash;none whatever. They have simply escaped the liability which in the ordinary course was due for discharge over a certain period.  It has not been discharged, and the suggestion we have put forward under this clause appears to us to be the best to effect that.  Putting in the name of the secretary of the Trades Union or using his services for this purpose would not get us in the money.  It is no concern of his.  Probably he does not pay income tax himself, and it is no interest to him how it would be collected.  He certainly would be called upon to perform the duty outside of his ordinary work, but he would have no means of deducting from the salary or remuneration of persons affected if he were to get this added. Therefore I cannot see my way to recommend the acceptance of this amendment.</P>

Under the clause certain charities are exempt in respect of income tax derived from stocks or shares, and it is also proposed to give them relief from income tax derived from land or house property.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That amendment would be acceptable.  The British Government has put up an equivalent clause in their Finance Bill, and it is right and proper that we should give the same consideration here as they are giving over there in respect of citizens of the Saorstát having moneys invested in England.  We are giving the same advantage to other persons in Great Britain or Northern Ireland having investments here in the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>As regards Section 15 I beg to move: &ldquo;To add at the end of Sub-section (1) the words &lsquo;save and except that the Corporation profits tax shall be reduced from 1s. in the pound to sixpence in the pound.&rsquo;&rdquo; That will be a rather small concession, which I hope the Government will see their way to adopt.  The Corporation tax, as Senators will remember, was adopted on the other side of the Channel during the war period for the specific purpose of raising money, but it has been reduced to sixpence, and inasmuch as this Free State that we all desire, and the vast majority anticipate, will soon see prosperity dawning upon it and new companies being started&mdash;Limited Liability Companies&mdash;I suggest that the tax of one shilling will largely discourage people in the starting of these new companies.  The Corporation tax is only applicable, I take it, to Limited Liability Companies, and is applied for such companies as pay a dividend of 5 per cent. to their ordinary shareholders.  Then the shilling comes into force.  It largely penalises struggling companies, and especially new companies <Col N="1257" /> which are being promoted, and which I hope will be largely promoted in the country. I hope the Government will see their way not to charge more than what they propose to charge across the Channel&mdash;that is, sixpence.</P>

      <P>I beg to oppose this.  Money has got to be found without a shadow of doubt.  We are told by Senator Haughton that it only applies when 5 per cent. has been earned on the moneys invested.  That being so, as I am quite satisfied that farmers do not make such a sum at all in their investments, I feel that if this burden was reduced instead of being paid by big corporations, it would apply to poorer members of the community, which I think will not be equitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>We have adopted practically all the taxes and impositions which had been in force in the previous financial year 1922-23. There was a slight change in respect of certain duties which were imposed, by reason of the fiscal independence of the Saorstát, such as a tax on certain motor cars and a tax on other articles not previously imposed by reason of the fact that our fiscal system was bound up with Great Britain.  This year we have got to meet something like £22,000,000 or £23,000,000 of a deficit, and in order to meet that it will be necessary for us to borrow.  A good deal of that £23,000,000 is extra expenditure owing to the circumstances of the times. There is a very large expenditure on the Army.  Its own estimate, I think, amounts to nearly £11,000,000.  There is also included in respect of compensation the sum of £10,000,000.  That is to say, there is an estimated expenditure of £20,000,000 this year which can scarcely be regarded as anything but abnormal. The circulation of that amount of money in a particular year ought to bring in its train certain advantages to the business community.  No extra tax has been imposed on commerce or business by reason of this fairly big distribution of money. All the taxes, with the exception of the one I have referred to, are practically the same as they were last year.  A good deal of criticism was passed on this Bill in the Dáil because of the fact that some of the taxes pressed rather heavily on a <Col N="1258" /> section of the community least able to bear them.</P>
      <P>Recently in another place when there was a considerable balance in the Exchequer of the Government concerned, there was a sort of all-round reduction of taxation. That is to say that various sections of the community were benefited generally by a reduction in taxation.  To take off this particular tax, or rather to reduce it, would be a benefit to one particular section, and a section which is not taxed unless there are profits.  The tax was originally introduced, I understand, in 1920, after the war, during a year of remarkable business boom.  We are not now in a business boom. but we are certainly partaking in the distribution of a sum of money which we are handing on to our successors to pay.  Whatever the length of time may be for which the loan will run, it will certainly be passed on, and we will not bear the burden.  We are not even proposing in the Estimates we put up to bear our proportionate share of the interest on the money that will have to be borrowed this year.  The actual revenue from this particular tax is very small.  It is not worth much at all, and if it were reduced by sixpence we would be nearly inclined to make a present of it altogether.</P>

      <P>The next business on the Orders of the Day is the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Bill.  I would just like to say that the Bill is one that must come into operation before the 24th of this month.  The principle of it is hardly likely to meet with opposition in the Seanad, and up to the present there has only been one amendment.  I am in the hands of the Seanad as to what they would wish to do, but I think we ought <Col N="1259" /> to be able to dispose of the Second Stage and of the Committee Stage to-day.  I shall proceed now to take the Second Stage, and Senators might consider whether they would not be prepared to go on with the remaining Stages of the Bill.  If there is any desire to amend it, of course that is a matter that will have to be considered, but if there is no desire for any substantial amendment probably the Seanad will agree that it would be desirable to go on with it to-day.</P>

    <P>(1)  This Act shall, subject to the provisions of this section, apply to a house or a part of a house let as a separate dwelling, where either the annual amount of the standard rent or the rateable value does not exceed&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in the county borough of Dublin and the urban districts in the Dublin Metropolitan Police area sixty pounds, and</P>
    <P>(b)  elsewhere, forty pounds, and every such house or part of a house shall be deemed to be a dwelling-house to which this Act applies: Provided that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i.)  this Act shall not apply to a dwelling-house <i>bona fide</i> let at a rent which includes payments in respect of board, attendance or use of furniture, unless on an apportionment of such rent under this section the portion of such rent attributable to the dwelling-house alone equals or exceeds three-quarters of the rent, in which case this Act shall apply to the dwelling-house, or at the option of the landlord shall apply as if the dwelling-house had been let at the said portion of the rent so attributable to the dwelling-house alone;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> (ii.)  the application of this Act to any house or part of a house shall not be excluded by reason only that part of the premises is used as a shop or office, or for business, trade, or professional purposes; and</P>
    <P>(iii.)  for the purposes of this Act, any land or premises let together with a house shall, if the rateable value of the land or premises let separately would be less than one-quarter of the rateable value of the house, be treated as part of the house, but subject to this provision, this Act shall not apply to a house let together with land other than the site of the house.</P>
    <P>(2)  Any rooms in a dwelling-house subject to a separate letting wholly or partly as a dwelling-house shall, for the purposes of this Act, be treated as a part of dwelling-house let as a separate dwelling.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a dwelling-house is let, or was let at the date in relation to which the standard rent is to be fixed, at a rent which includes payments in respect of board, attendance, or use of furniture, the Court may, for any of the purposes of this Act, make such apportionment as seems just.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where this Act has become applicable to any dwelling-house or any mortgage thereon, it shall continue to apply thereto whether or not the dwelling-house continues to be one to which this Act applies.</P>
    <P>(5)  This Act shall not apply to a dwelling-house erected after, or in course of erection on, the second day of April, nineteen hundred and nineteen, or to any dwelling-house which has been since that date or was at that date being <i>bona fide</i> reconstructed by way of conversion into two or more separate and self-contained flats or tenements; but the rateable value of any such dwelling-house to which this Act would have applied if it had been erected or so reconstructed before the said date shall be ascertained as though the rent for the purposes of Section eleven of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, were the rent for which a similar dwelling-house might have been reasonably expected to let on the third day of August, nineteen hundred and fourteen, the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance, and other expenses (if any) necessary to maintain the dwelling-house in its actual state, and all rates, taxes, <Col N="1261" /> and public charges, if any (except tithe rent charge), being paid by the tenant.</P>
    <P>(6)  This Act shall not apply to any dwelling-house provided by a Local Authority under the Labourers (Ireland) Acts, 1883 to 1919, or under the Housing of the Working Classes (Ireland) Acts, 1890 to 1921.</P>
    <P>(7)  Subject to the provisions of this Act this Act shall apply to every mortgage where the mortgaged property consists of or comprises one or more dwelling-houses to which this Act applies or any interest therein, except that it shall not apply&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to any mortgage comprising one or more dwelling-houses to which this Act applies and other land if the rateable value of such dwelling-houses is less than one-tenth of the rateable value of the whole of the land comprised in the mortgage; or</P>
    <P>(b)  to an equitable charge by deposit of titled deeds or otherwise; or</P>
    <P>(c)  to any mortgage which is created acter the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>(8)  When a mortgage comprises one or more dwelling-houses to which this Act applies and other land, and the rateable value of such dwelling-houses is more than one-tenth of the rateable value of the whole of the land comprised in the mortgage, the mortgagee may apportion the principal money secured by the mortgage between such dwelling-houses and such other land by giving one calendar month's notice in writing to the mortgagor, such notice to state the particulars of such apportionment, and at the expiration of said calendar month's notice this Act shall not apply to the mortgage so far as it relates to such other land, and for all purposes, including the mortgagor's right of redemption, the said mortgage shall operate as if it were a separate mortgage for the respective portions of the said principal money secured by the said dwelling-houses and such other land, respectively, to which such portions were apportioned: Provided that the mortgagor shall, before the expiration of the said calendar month's notice, be entitled to dispute the amounts so apportioned as aforesaid, and in default of agreement the matter shall be determined by the Commissioner of Valuation and Boundary Surveyor.</P>
    <P>(9)  Any notice of the apportionment of the principal money secured by a mortgage, <Col N="1262" /> if and when the notice becomes operative under this Act, and the award of any arbitrator with reference to any such apportionment may be registered under the enactments relative to the registration of deeds or titles as the case requires.</P>

      <P>I beg to move: &ldquo;Section 3, Sub-section (1): To add at the end of Sub-section (1) the words: (iv.) This Act shall not apply to any dwellinghouse that has become vacant, or to any existing tenancy terminated by the voluntary act of the tenant.&rdquo;  I have been asked to propose this amendment.  There have been property owners who before August, 1914, built cottages or who owned cottages which they let at an uneconomic rent to employees or to persons whom they wished for personal private reasons to benefit. Many of these owners no longer have employees to house.  The persons they sought to benefit may die, or may choose, without pressure put or any suggestion made, to leave the neighbourhood and settle elsewhere.  It would certainly be impossible, it would surely not be fair, to compel such owners to continue to let these dwellings at the uneconomic rent which they accepted for reasons which no longer exist.  If the law makes it penal, and quite rightly, for the landlord to allow an inhabited house to fall into disrepair, it is surely only justice that he should be allowed to demand a rent sufficient to cover the cost of these repairs as well as to pay him a reasonable interest on the money sunk on these buildings.  In this Bill, as in the British Bill which it supersedes, no mention is made of a landlord in such circumstances, and the consequence of this omission is that it will work out that he will not be allowed, under any circumstances, to increase his rent beyond the amount specified in the Bill, which very likely in many cases will not bring it up to anything like the economic rent it ought to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked to bring this forward, firstly, because it will be another obstacle in the way of houses to let coming into the market, since a landlord in that position will in self-defence be obliged to refuse to let at an inevitable loss.  This was brought to my notice by a specific case which occurred not many months ago.  An employer had let a <Col N="1263" /> cottage at a ridiculously low rent, an avowedly low rent, to an employee whom he valued greatly.  After a couple of years that cottage became vacant, as the business came to an end, and the employee went elsewhere, to a distant county, where he was just as well paid, and where, being very skilled, he had no difficulty in finding employment.  A prospective tenant approached the landlord, a man who considered himself in status far above the man who had left. He agreed to take the cottage at a fair rent.  For some years all went well. Recently, however, this man also received a better-paid job in another county, and he gave notice that he was leaving. No difficulty was put in his way, although he was somewhat in arrears with the rent.  After he left a claim was made for the arrears, but the tenant retorted that under the Rent Restrictions Act the landlord had no right to ask for a rent higher than the previous tenant had paid.  A counter-claim was also made by the tenant for the difference between what he had paid and what the Act allowed the landlord to charge.  That wiped out the arrears, and counsel, on being consulted, explained that there was no mention of a landlord's rights in such circumstances in the Act.  If the landlord brought the case to court, a decision would probably be given against him.  This clause is to prevent such a miscarriage of justice, and to enable the owner to raise the rent to the limit at which it would pay him.  It is very obvious that when a landlord knows house property will not bring him in sufficient to pay for repairs, and that if he lets the house he must keep it in repair, being only human, he will let the house fall to pieces if he cannot sell it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I must oppose this amendment, as it weakens the fundamental principle underlying this Bill.  It means that where a house becomes vacant the landlord can profiteer as much as he likes on the incoming tenant. That is one of the main reasons why this Bill had to be introduced. Senator the Countess of Desart has put up one side of the case, but we have also to put up the other side.  It is notorious in the city of Dublin and in other large <Col N="1264" /> centres in the country that where a house becomes vacant landlords are not asking for rent.  It is not a rent they are asking for; it is blackmail they are demanding; and, because of the scarcity of houses, people are compelled to pay any price that the landlords demand.  In order to prevent such profiteering on the part of landlords it was essential that the Rent Restrictions Act be introduced. If we accept this amendment, it gets right under the whole principle underlying this Bill.  Senator the Countess of Desart has referred to what I assume is the case of an agricultural labourer who is living in a house owned by the employer. When the labourer had left the employment and gone to another county, people have demanded that they should get the house at the same rent as the previous occupier.  That is only one small case in comparison with the position of house occupiers in large centres. If this amendment is passed, I believe it would violate the whole usefulness of this Bill, which aims at getting at landlords who are profiteering by putting a huge increase on the rent of houses that become unoccupied.  As a matter of fact, at the present time it is notorious in the city of Dublin that when a house does by some chance become vacant the landlord will not let it at all because he is compelled to do so at something like a fair figure.  Instead of letting the house, the landlord sells it, and profiteers in another direction.  The Seanad could not conscientiously accept this amendment, as, if they did so, the Bill would be of no further use.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kevin O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree substantially with Senator Farren.  The object of the Bill is to control, not tenancies, but houses, and not all houses, but houses built under normal conditions. Owing to the European war and the stoppage on a large scale of building operations, and owing also in England to the flow of the population from the rural to the urban areas, the shortage of houses <Col N="1265" /> became acute.  In 1915 the State stepped in to limit and control the free play of economic forces between the contracting parties and to control houses. The effect of the amendment would be to exclude from the effects of that control certain houses.  A specific case has been quoted in support of the amendment. There is nothing quite so misleading as the specific case.  In the discussions of this Bill in the Dáil we had many specific cases, but they are always open to this weakness, that the person quoting them has a monopoly of knowledge concerning them, and is alone in a position to discuss them.  You cannot deal with a general situation on the basis of a specific case unless this specific case can be shown to be typical or can be shown to be merely one of many that exist on a large scale. The amendment says &ldquo;this Act shall not apply to any dwelling-house that has become vacant or to any existing tenancies terminated by the voluntary act of the tenant.&rdquo;  If these houses are released from control you are, as Senator Farren said, getting away from the effect of the Act&mdash;getting away from the whole purpose of the Act&mdash;which is to limit the play of economic forces, to limit the play of supply and demand, and to say that in the existing house shortage the landlord shall not be entitled to charge a rent which a scarcity situation would create.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be no sufficient reason for exempting a house simply because it has become vacant or simply because the existing tenant has voluntarily terminated his tenancy.  It is to deal with a grave social evil that this Bill is brought in, to meet a situation that would arise at the expiration of the 1920 Act on the 24th of this month, and to control which has been considered necessary in varying degrees as far back as 1915.  Remembering that it is control of houses, remembering that it is to meet a serious shortage which constitutes an evil in our social system, there is no case for exempting a particular class of house in circumstances that are purely accidental circumstances. Houses built since April, 1919, are not controlled; they were built in the shortage, and those who built them out of their savings or possibly out of their overdrafts at the bank took grave risks, and paid high prices for materials and so on, and it was not thought fit to control such houses.  But in regard to houses <Col N="1266" /> built back in normal times there is a case for control because of the shortage and because of the collective necessity exceeding the individual right.  It is on that that the Bill is based, and it is on that all prior legislation was passed, and there is no case for exempting the particular class of house which is sought to be exempted by this amendment.</P>

Like the previous Bill, this is one to which I think there will be no objection&mdash;certainly no objection to the principle&mdash;though it is possible some Senator might desire to <Col N="1267" /> move an amendment in Committee.  I do not exactly know when Senators got copies of the Bill, but I think it should have been in their hands this morning. It may, therefore, be that they have not had time to consider it, and might like a little longer time for its consideration. If, on the other hand, they have read it and are satisfied that there are no substantial amendments to be proposed, perhaps they would like to deal with it in the way they have dealt with the other Bill which we have passed.  However, I am entirely in the hands of Senators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is great urgency in connection with this Bill, because of the fact that it deals with the question of insured persons who are members of Approved Societies which have their headquarters outside the Saorstát. For instance, in the case of people who are members of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers or of some other Amalgamated Trade Union Society with its headquarters across the water, it is essential that this Bill should become law before the 1st July next, because these people are obliged to leave the Societies in which they were members and to transfer to a Society with its headquarters in the Saorstát.  For that reason it is extremely urgent, from the point of view of the payment of benefits and the carrying on of insurance work generally, that this Bill should be passed as speedily as possible.  Arrangements have been made by the Irish Commissioners here whereby all members of Approved Societies with their headquarters across the water are to be transferred into Societies here approved of by the Commissioners. In order to enable all concerned to get on with the work of transfer at once, it is necessary that this Bill should become law at the earliest possible moment. Until the Bill does become law the <Col N="1268" /> schemes for transfers which have been arranged cannot be put into operation. Anyone who has had experience of the management of an Approved Society can understand the tremendous amount of work that has to be done so that everything may be in readiness before the 1st July, and so that members who transfer from Societies with their headquarters across the water can come immediately into benefit.  So that the work may be done as smoothly and as quickly as possible, I would appeal to the Seanad to facilitate the passing of this Bill into law.  As one who has had experience at one period as secretary of an Approved Society, I know the very considerable amount of work which the transfer of members from one Society to another involves, and particularly in a case like this where the transfer concerns members whose Society had its headquarters in another country.  The Bill is purely formal in this sense, that it merely asks the sanction of law to certain arrangements which have become necessary. There is nothing contentious in the Bill so far as I can see, and I trust the Seanad will pass it as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator MacLysaght as to the general principle that we ought not to relax our rulings with regard to the taking of stages of a Bill at intervals.  As I have read the discussions which took place in the Dáil when this Bill was going through there, I think Senator Farren has quite fairly stated the effect of these discussions. The principle of the Bill did not arouse any hostility whatever, and possibly, under these circumstances, the Seanad would fall in with the suggestion made by Senator Farren.  I might also mention that copies of this Bill as it passed the Committee Stage were printed, and I think reached the hands of all Senators, or at least a great many of them, so that it has not been sprung upon Senators. No amendments or suggestions with regard to the Bill reached me from any Senator, except, I think, Senator Linehan. Under these circumstances I would suggest to Senator MacLysaght, while I agree with him on the general principle he has stated, that, in view of what Senator Farren has mentioned, we might dispose of this Bill to-day.</P>

I observe from the Estimates that there is a sum of £348,663 allocated for the purpose of carrying out this Act.  In addition to that, it would be well to know how much goes out of the fund from the contributions of the employers and the employees, so that we may be able to ascertain whether the cost of working this Bill is in proportion to the sum to be <Col N="1270" /> paid out in benefits or not&mdash;that is to say, whether it costs a large or a small sum to distribute the benefits that this Act is supposed to give to the people concerned, and whether it is an expensive or a cheap Act to work.</P>

And, conversely, persons living in England or in Northern Ireland who are members of Approved Societies in the Saorstát, their funds will be subject to the same analysis and segregation, and transfer will be made of the moneys due to the Irish members who are transferred here, and the money due to the others will be transferred across.

      <P>A great deal of difficulty arose almost from the beginning with regard to what particular description was to take the place of &ldquo;the United Kingdom.&rdquo;  There was, I believe, generally speaking, amongst a very considerable section of the population in Ireland an objection to that term.  It would not be an improvement to say &ldquo;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.&rdquo; It would have exactly the same disadvantages, and it was decided then, for brevity and for other purposes, that this particular form should come in, and that the expression would be deemed to include the two.  There is a very particular reason for it.  The same laws, I think, generally prevail, certainly so far as National Health Insurance is concerned, that a person can be a member of an Approved Society though living in Belfast, and though that Approved Society may have its head offices in England. There is a certain simplification in the use of the term embracing both. It has no political signification here.  It prevents continued repetition of &ldquo;Northern Ireland,&rdquo; and I think it will be admitted that we have no particular desire to be perpetually bringing these two terms before people's minds.  It is explanatory as far as this is concerned.  If this particular clause be taken out, it means going through the Bill, on one page of which, I think, the two words occur very often, and changing every one of these.  It was not meant in any way to be offensive to anybody&mdash;either those who stand for Northern Ireland or those who stand for the Saorstát.  It was certainly not intended to be offensive to Great Britain.  If that particular explanation be changed, then some other designation must be inserted everywhere through the Bill where Great Britain is brought in, and I do not know whether it would be an improvement.</P>

      <P>The amendment, as you have read it out, meets the point I have in view.  At the present time deductions have to be made weekly, which is very awkward both for the employers and the employees.  In the case of permanent workmen, in all the cases I have come across, the workmen and the employers would prefer the deduction to be made at the end of the period when the card has to be sent in&mdash;that is, the period of 26 weeks&mdash;than to have these calculations made every week.  The entire sum which might be deducted from an employee is only 8s. 8d. for the 26 weeks, and I do not think that deduction will be a hardship on anybody.  It would be a convenience to both parties if, instead of compelling them to make deductions weekly, they were allowed to do so at the end of the six months' period.  I beg to move the amendment.</P>

      <P>I have much pleasure in seconding the amendment. I would like to point out another reason why I think such an amendment desirable. Employees are not always paid weekly; in many cases they are paid monthly.  It is impossible in these cases to deduct the sum weekly.  As a rule, employees do not raise any objection to it being done, but I know cases in which they have raised objections, and it has led to friction and given rise to a great deal of trouble.  There is another matter that I would like to draw attention to, and that is the way in which Approved Societies evade their responsibilities.  In order to put the matter in order, I have drafted an amendment which might very well take its place immediately after that of Senator Linehan.  I do not want to say that it is perfect, but it expresses the idea, and if the Government would consider it and put it in its right place and in proper wording, that is all I would ask. There are numberless cases.  I have a case at the present moment of a servant, a girl who has been in our employment. She has paid the sums that she was liable for and the employers have done the same.  There is a clause in the original Act which requires notice to be given. This girl was in hospital, and it was impossible for her to give notice at the <Col N="1278" /> time, as she was too ill.  Her society have evaded any payment to her in consequence of the notice not being served. I know of another case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes.  I am afraid I have made myself rather a nuisance to the National Health Insurance Commissioners, because I have had to invoke their help on so many occasions.  I have had numbers of cases of men who went to hospital and who were entitled to benefit, and their societies refused to give it to them.  It was only by the good offices of Sir Joseph Glynn that on one occasion, at all events, I got one of my men paid who had been for a long time out of his money.  He had got all the certificates and everything necessary, but they actually refused to pay him.  I got the Commissioners to write, and they stated that it was necessary to have an arbitration.  The arbitration was held, and this man was awarded a further sum but they would not pay it.  After an immense amount of trouble finally we got the money paid.  It is in the interest of the contributors that I am raising this question, and not in the interest of employers. It is a perfect scandal the way a great many of these things go on.  The addition I propose to add is: &ldquo;That where an approved Society have evaded their liabilities to an employed contributor who is entitled to sickness benefit it shall be competent for the employed contributor to apply to the District Justice for an order compelling the Society to pay the benefit, and it shall be competent for the District Justice to inflict a penalty in addition to whatever sum he finds to be due, not exceeding the amount of the award.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I must oppose this amendment.  Senator Barrington said that Senator Linehan and he were worrying themselves on behalf of employed contributors.  I do not think any people who are subject to the provisions of this Act will be thankful to either of them or to the employer who will attempt to deduct 8s. 8d. in one week from their wages to pay a half-year's contributions.  Would a man with 30s. a week' in the country who is the father of seven or eight children like to be sent home with £1 one week, even though he may have steady employment? I do not think that this is going to improve the Act in any way, to deduct the insurance half-yearly.</P>
      <P>No insurance that I know of is paid half-yearly by the working people, and this Act only covers working people.  It is said that large numbers of these people are paid by the month.  That is not so. The great body of the people are paid weekly, and could not afford to wait a month.  They are not salaried, but are wage-earners, and their outgoings and income cover the seven days.  I hope it will not be possible for employers to stop the money half-yearly.</P>

      <P>In the case of any person who is paid monthly or half yearly there is nothing in the provisions of the Act to prevent the employer deducting the full amount for that period on pay-day. If you put in the provision that has been drafted by Senator Linehan it will mean that every employer who pays weekly will be empowered to do the very same thing.  The regulations of the Insurance Commissioners cover the point raised in the amendment and in my opinion there is no necessity for it. It is the common practice, whatever the period of employment, whether for a week or for a month, that the amount of the contribution of the employee is deducted on pay-day.  There is no necessity for the proposed amendment as it is already covered by the regulations of the Insurance Commissioners.  I have some little experience of the working of an Insurance Society and I am satisfied that the Irish Insurance Commissioners will not impose any hardship on any section of the community, whether employer or worker.  I must say from my experience of the officials of the Irish Insurance Commission that they are a most competent body, and go out of their way on every occasion to help everyone connected with that work.  I think it is only fair to pay that compliment to the officials.  Whether it was the representative of an Insurance Society or the insured persons everyone got fair treatment from the Commissioners. I suggest to the mover of the amendment that there is no necessity for it as if it is put into the Bill it will give power to people other than those it is meant to cover, and will be taken advantage of.  It will also lead to ill-feeling and will not be for the good of the employer or the working class people.</P>

      <P>This Bill was generously received in the Dáil.  In essence it is an Adaptation Bill with, what musical people call variations, and the variations are very slight.  I think <Col N="1281" /> this would be a change.  It would contemplate more than was certainly in our minds when we started the work of making up this Bill.  The Bill is to deal with the change that has taken place by reason of the setting up of the Saorstát. If there were no such change there would be no such Bill.  This branches into the question of National Health Insurance in a way in which it was not our intention to deal with it.  I do not think this amendment would have been accepted in the Dáil, at least it would not have conduced towards the easy passage of the Bill.  The Bill was passed <Col N="1282" /> through generously without any delay. It was because of its urgency and the necessity of having it done rapidly that it got such a swift passage.  It was purely technical and intricate, but if other matters are brought in, it certainly loses its character.  It is an amending Bill as well as an Adaptation Bill.  Although it says to amend it also says to adapt and if it were not rendered necessary by reason of the setting up of the Saorstát no such Bill would have been considered at all.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That where an Approved Society have evaded their liability to an employed contributor who is entitled to sickness benefit, it shall be competent for the employed contributor to apply to the District Justice for an order compelling the Society to pay the benefit, and it shall be competent for the District Justice to inflict a penalty in addition to whatever sum he finds due not exceeding the amount of the award.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not want to add much to what I have already said, except to say that Senator McPartlin and his friends will find that they are not the only persons who take an interest in the people of the country who are covered by these insurances. A great deal of my time is taken up in endeavouring to deal with the cases of contributors, and it is only with the assistance that I received from the insured persons that I was enabled to succeed in getting the benefits for them which is their proper due.  I think, until a sense of their duty is brought home to these people who are responsible, by enabling the District Justice to inflict a penalty, we will never get over these abuses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DEA</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be very useful if this amendment were given effect to.  My experience of insured persons is that the first 4 days of their illness are virtually, in 9 cases out of 10, the most serious, and I find that after that period, as a rule, the bulk of the workers are able to resume their work, and then we find the Societies in which they are insured denying liability.  I know it is a very serious grievance in the manufacturing industry, both in Dublin and elsewhere, that the workers do not get the benefits they are entitled to.  In fact I, myself, got so tired of it in a few cases I had to do with that I had to go so far as to appeal to Sir Joseph Glynn in <Col N="1283" /> order to get even common justice done to those people.  It appears to me as if those Societies, for some reason or another, wish to deny those poor creatures the benefits they are entitled to.  Every sort of difficulty and objection is raised to the benefits being paid.  I think it would be a very good thing for the country if this entire Insurance Act was recast.  It is not satisfactory either to the employer or to the worker, and we are very doubtful&mdash;at least I am very doubtful&mdash; about the amount of benefit that the workers concerned get out of the amount of money that is collected.  I would like, very much, to know the amount subscribed both by the workers and the employers, and I would, also, like to know what benefit the workers get out of the funds.  I think the whole system of insurance, as far as I know it both domestically and in other employments, is most unsatisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I must oppose this amendment.  I believe it is moved because of the want of knowledge of the Approved Societies and the rules and regulations laid down by the Insurance Commissioners regarding the payment of benefits, and that is responsible for Sena tor Barrington moving this amendment, because the amendment is altogether against the spirit of this Bill.  It is laid down specifically in this Bill that the persons who do not receive benefits are entitled to recover from the Society if the Society is in default.  A person has no power under the Health Insurance Act to proceed in a Court of Law.  He must proceed according to the regulations laid down in the Bill.  Therefore, I think, this amendment is entirely out of order and cannot be accepted.  Senators must remember that we are not dealing at the moment with the general principle of the National Health Act.  We are dealing with a set of circumstances that make it necessary and compulsory for the Oireachtas to pass certain regulations to bring into operation a scheme that has arisen under peculiar circumstances.  It is essential that these regulations should be introduced for the purpose of dealing with changes of circumstances that have taken place.  I explained before that the position is that there are approved societies with their headquarters across <Col N="1284" /> the water and the members resident in the Saorstát of societies having their headquarters in what is called Northern Ireland and <i>vice versa.</i> There are approved societies registered with headquarters in Ireland which have members at the moment in Great Britain, or in Northern Ireland, and owing to the change of circumstances brought about by the setting up of the Saorstát it is essential that regulations should be made whereby the people resident in the Saorstát who are members of approved societies with their headquarters in Great Britain or what is called Northern Ireland should be allowed to make the necessary transfer, and for that purpose it is necessary that the Government should make certain regulations.  I do not think it is in order, in the circumstances, to deal with the general principle underlying the National Health Insurance. If we were dealing with that some of us would have a good deal to say.</P>
      <P>Then with regard to the regulations of Approved Societies and their relations to their approved members, that is already covered in accordance with the regulations laid down by the Irish Insurance Commissioners.  Senator O'Dea referred to the question of men being four days sick and not paid benefit.  I would like to point out, for the information of Senator O'Dea, that according to the provisions of the National Health Insurance Act a person is not entitled to receive benefit for the first three days of illness.  If there is a continuing sickness or a person happens to fall sick within the specified period, then they have to wait three days for benefit.  If declared off benefit and a person becomes ill again within a certain period, he is not entitled for the three waiting days in the second period or the days already dealt with under the principal provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the payment of benefits, I must say that any person who is insured and in good standing in an Approved Society is entitled to receive certain benefits, and if a person does not get the benefits it is that person's own fault.  The provisions are laid down by the Commissioners for the payment of benefits by all societies.  We know that serious complaints and allegations have been made against certain societies because of the way the Act was being administered, <Col N="1285" /> but we cannot deal with that on this stage of the Bill.  If complaints are to be made, they should be sent to the Commissioners who will deal with them without delay.  I hold no brief for the Insurance Commissioners or their officials, but I have had experience of them from time to time, and I must say that I always found them anxious and willing to help not only the Secretaries of Insurance Societies, but also insured persons.  I do not think this amendment should be pressed, because, in my opinion, it is out of order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurJackson" hpid="Mr. JACKSON Mr. JACKSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JACKSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for seconding the amendment was because of complaints made to me in the West of Ireland by insured persons.  In some cases the complaints were of a very serious nature.  They were made by persons in domestic service, and in other kinds of employment.  The rules made by the Commissioners provide that the societies should pay to their members certain benefits during illness.  I think it ought to be the duty of secretaries to societies to assist their members to get these benefits when they are entitled to them because of illness, but I am afraid that does not happen.  I know of many cases where application for benefit was made week after week and month after month, and still the assistance was not forthcoming. If we can do anything to assist people who are entitled to benefit from these societies to get it promptly, we should do it.  The contributions are collected weekly from the members.  It is compulsory on them to pay it, and when claims come into societies they ought to be dealt with promptly.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  I have had experience of some of these societies, and I can bear testimony to what Senator Barrington has stated.  I know that in many cases it was practically impossible for insured persons to get the benefits they were entitled to.  In some cases the payment of the benefit was so long delayed that they had become worthless when paid to the insured persons.  I feel that if this amendment were adopted, whereby powers would be given to a District Justice to inflict a penalty on a society for the nonpayment of a benefit justly due, it would be of the greatest advantage in stimulating secretaries to Societies to pay up promptly the amounts due.  It is a pitiful <Col N="1286" /> thing, for instance, in the case of a poor woman at a serious crisis in her life when she may become entitled to a £1 or 30s. to have the payment withheld for, perhaps, two or three months.  I feel that if penalties could be inflicted on societies for committing flagrant breaches of the spirit of the Act it would arouse them to more enthusiasm in carrying out their duties properly.  I may say here that I was associated with Sir Joseph Glynn in trying to correct the errors of a society, but despite his great ability and determination, and that of the members of the Committee, it was found quite impossible to get things conducted as they should be in that particular case.  I feel that such cases are not isolated amongst societies, and I think if a penal clause were inserted, as suggested, in the Act it would make for the more useful administration of it.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Dea inquired as to the amount of benefits that had been paid.  The last audited accounts are for the year ending 1920, and they give the following particulars:&mdash;Sickness and Disablement benefits paid, £460,000; Free Medical Certificates, £90,000; Sanatorium benefits, £40,000; total, £590,000.  As regards contributions, I cannot give the amount as I have not got the return.  I fear that much the same position prevails with regard to this amendment as prevailed with regard to the last one, that is to say, it is one that is to some extent outside the scope of our intentions.  We have not examined this particular point that is being made. It is natural that complaints should be made with regard to certain societies. During my own experience of them I found that some societies were much more satisfactory than others.  I am not in a position to say that the Dáil had any intention of going into the merits or the defects of the Bill as it stood.  This adaptation of the Act was not intended by us to deal with that.  We had only to arrange the adaptation of this and other Acts that have been passed in such a way as to provide for the changes that have taken place.</P>

      <P>Before a vote is taken on the amendment I should just like to clear up one point.  Senator Farren has pointed out that, for the first three days, no payment is allowed.  That is quite true and I am not proposing to <Col N="1287" /> alter that in any way, but the Act also provides that within these three days notice must be given to the Approved Society.  It frequently happens, and I know cases myself in which it has happened, that people were too ill to give the notice within that time.  I think it is a perfectly scandalous thing that Societies, availing themselves of the fact that people are too ill to give the notification should evade payment of their liabilities afterwards.  As regards the other argument that it would affect Societies outside the Free State, I would not attach any weight to that at all.  It seems to me it would be very desirable to get people to join Societies that are within the control of the Free State.  If this amendment has the effect of making them leave other Societies to join ones under the control of the Government here I think it would be, by no means, an unmixed benefit.</P>

      <P>Before the amendment is put I desire to ask a question in regard to this Act which I see is to continue in force until the 31st December, 1924.  What I want to know is, if the whole question of insurance is to be reviewed after that date.</P>

      <P>I should like to call attention to what I understood was stated by the Minister, that the amount of benefit distributed under the Bill was, <Col N="1288" /> in one case, £400,000, and in another £40,000, or a total of about £500,000. From the Estimate that we have been furnished with I observe that the cost of this Insurance Commission is £348,000, so that in order to distribute £500,000 or £600,000 we have to pay £348,000. That is the point I would like some information on.  In the commencement of the proceedings to-day I asked for some figures as to the cost of the Act compared with the benefits distributed. These are the only figures that I have got and the expenses appear to be abnormally high compared with the benefits.</P>

      <P>I think, A Chathaoirligh, the Senator did not hear exactly what I said.  The last audited accounts showed that £460,000 were paid for Sickness and Disablement Benefit; also £90,000 for Free Medical Benefits, and £40,000 for Sanatorium Benefits, the whole sum amounting to £590,000.  The £348,000 referred to by the Senator is a State contribution towards the payment of benefits, plus the cost of central administration.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the Bill be now passed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
