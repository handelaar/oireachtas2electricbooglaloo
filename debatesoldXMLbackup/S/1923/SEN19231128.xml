      <P>The first business on the Orders of the Day is the election of a Senator to fill the vacancy caused by the death of the late Senator MacPartlin.  There has been only one candidate proposed, Mr. Thomas Foran.  He has been duly nominated.  He has also signed a consent to act, if elected, and his qualification is that he is President of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union. Under our Standing Orders, it will now be necessary to submit his name to a ballot.  The voting papers will be sent round, and the question will be whether Senators vote for or against Mr. Foran. They simply put down &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; or &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The voting papers having been collected and counted, an Cathaoirleach declared Mr. Thomas Foran duly elected a member of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the resolution passed at the last meeting of the Seanad, I communicated its terms to Sir Horace Plunkett, and at the same time I intimated to him that I thought the feeling of the Seanad was that, in his particular case, they would be satisfied with an even occasional attendance.  In reply I received the following letter:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Right">The Crest House,</P>
      <P Just="Right">Weybridge,</P>
      <P Just="Right">20th November, 1923.</P>
      <P>MY DEAR GLENAVY,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extraordinary kindness of the <Col N="132" /> Senate's resolution on Wednesday last, and the terms in which you have interpreted their feelings towards me, move me deeply.  They make it more than ever difficult to adhere to the decision to which I was forced by reasons stated in my letter of resignation.  Apart, however, from other considerations, I could not meet the very proper condition that I should &ldquo;promise an occasional attendance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure I need not assure the Senate that my resignation was due to no failure to appreciate the honour of the original appointment, which indeed they have enhanced. So essential is complete detachment from party politics to the Irish service I still hope to render, that I could not have accepted the honour but for the duty, as I conceived it to be in the circumstances of the time, to support the settlement of 1921 in any way the Free State Government might desire.  But as things are, I am sure I can best serve Ireland, both at home and abroad, by using such influence as may derive from the goodwill of my fellow-countrymen along the lines of my own special work.</P>
    <P>I am gratefully and sincerely yours,</P>
    <P Just="Right">HORACE PLUNKETT.</P>
    <P>Consequently it becomes necessary to proceed to an election in the ordinary course to fill the casual vacancy. Under our Standing Orders the date of that election should be fixed now.  It is not to be sooner than one fortnight from the date on which the election is fixed; that is to say, fixing it to-day, the first day the election can take place is this day fortnight.  There will probably be no meeting of the Seanad until then, having regard to the state of business in the Dáil.  Perhaps some Senator will move that the date of the election be fixed for this day fortnight.</P>

    <P>The next item on the Orders of the Day was a motion by Senator Sir John Keane (adjourned from the 23rd October, 1923).</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad, being of the opinion that an improved system of public accountancy would lead to more effective control of public expenditure, together with greater efficiency in administration, requests the Government to appoint a Committee of experts to examine and report upon the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to move the motion that stands in my name. It has been tabled for some time.  I contemplated bringing it forward several months ago, but delayed, thinking that the matter might be brought up in the Dáil, as being concerned mainly with matters financial, it would fall more within the scope and powers of the other House.  Of course, we, in this House, have also a certain status in financial matters &mdash; especially the powers of recommendation on Financial Bills.  So, it is not entirely inappropriate that this matter, which I hold is of considerable importance, should be brought up here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the motion mainly deals with accountancy, I hope Senators will not necessarily dismiss it as dull and uninspiring.  Accounts are something more than figures.  In their use and <Col N="134" /> operation they often have an essentially human value: a man managing a department of a business will tell you that accounts almost have an inhuman value.  They have a distinct bearing on the springs of human motives.  I might best approach this subject by quoting the words of Lord Haldane, when he recently presided at a meeting to deal with a question of army organisation in Great Britain.  You will remember, no doubt, that Lord Haldane years ago went as a Chancery Barrister to the War Office, and, by his great intellect and powers of organisation, reformed the then army and fashioned a small army&mdash;an army which was generally accepted as the most efficient army for its size that had ever been known.  In speaking the other day on this question of organisation, Lord Haldane said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The secret of efficiency is the function and assignment of responsibilities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope the Seanad will accept that formula as correct.  Its acceptance is essential to my whole argument.  If you want to get efficiency you must, according to this formula, leave your Executive Officer unfettered, as far as possible, and you must judge him, as far as possible, by the results of his work.  Examine that, especially in regard to what you mean by &ldquo;devolution.&rdquo; Devolution in practice really means only one thing&mdash;devolution of financial responsibility.  You cannot say to a person who may be, perhaps, running a motor repair shop and whose business it is to keep a number of cars in running order&mdash;&ldquo;Look here; we will not interfere with you.  You can do exactly what you like.&rdquo;  That would be obviously absurd.  What you must have is a de-centralisation of financial power.  You can say&mdash;&ldquo;Here is so much money,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Here is an account which shows how much our operations cost and we will judge you by the financial results disclosed by that account.&rdquo;  If you examine it, you will see that it is totally unreal to devolve any power of responsibility to an executive officer unless you give him also financial control, subject, of course, to general limitations.  He should be left as unfettered as possible, <Col N="135" /> subject to that financial control in the exercise of his task.  That financial control, as expressed in the account, provides the standard of measurement which is essential and by which you will judge of the results.  In some cases the standards of measurement are more easily devised than in others.  If a man is charged with the up-keep of a road, you have an easy standard of measurement&mdash;the cost per unit, whether it be a perch or a mile.  In running a hospital you have a fairly easy standard of measurement&mdash;the cost per occupied bed or the cost per patient per day. In an educational establishment the standard of measurement is easy&mdash;the cost per student per day.  Some classes of business lend themselves to measurement by account more easily than others.</P>
    <P>The next question I come to is: As our accounts are at present, is this devolution of financial responsibility possible?  The present accounting system is purely on a cash basis.  All receipts in the year, whether arising from the previous year or not, are brought into that year's revenue. Similarly with regard to expenditure, there is no distinction between outgoings of a capital and revenue nature. It is purely on a cash basis, and in no way represents what a commercial business calls revenue and expenditure accounts.  A Committee in Great Britain dealt with the whole question of national expenditure in 1918, and this matter of accounting was part of the inquiry.  The Committee, appointed during the war, and presided over by Mr. Herbert Samuel, with regard to present accounts, says: &ldquo;They are accounts of actual receipts and payments of the year in respect to the subject to which the sums voted by Parliament are appropriated, and they differ from commercial accounts in this important respect&rdquo;&mdash;I ask the House to note this&mdash;&ldquo;that all sums which mature for payment in the year are, so far as physically practical, actually paid.  The basis of all transactions of Government Departments is a cash one, dependent only on maturity of liability.  There is no method in the accounts which shows <Col N="136" /> the amount or the nature of the outstanding liability.  If anything is outstanding, if debts are due and not paid, they pass on again into the next account, and neither the Minister for Finance, the Legislature, nor the citizens have any knowledge of the fact from the published accounts.  Furthermore, the accounting is paid by subjects, and not by objects.  I shall try to explain that; it is not very abstruse. The best illustration, speaking for the Free State, is to take the Estimates of public expenditure for the year.  I take the illustration of the Civic Guard. Now, the accounts there are under some dozen heads as follows:&mdash;Salaries, allowances, travelling expenditure, clothing, accoutrements, rents.  So that it is purely an abstract classification. These heads really tell you nothing.  You know what the salaries of the Civic Guard are, but that does not throw any light on the method of organisation.  It is of no value to any Executive officer or Minister for the purposes of control.  A body like the Civic Guard is built up in terms of units.  I do not know what the control is, but there must be groups, and county organisations built up from the various stations through the county. If you had an organic account that would tell you everything, it would be arranged in such a form that the cost of the whole of the organisation in a county will be shown as separate head of the account, and even the component parts of the organisation would appear in the account, so that you could say to an officer in the county: &ldquo;You have the same number of men as another county alongside of you, and yet you are costing us so much more.&rdquo;  You have, in fact, the accounts built up by units of the organisation, instead of accounts shown by abstract classification, which are quite useless for the purposes of control. Now, that being so, you are thrown back upon one form of control, and one form of control only, and that is the form of central control.  You are unable to devolve, as the accounts are now, but if you accept my argument the control is centralised, and the Minister for Finance in his office, will be able to hold his hand on all the <Col N="137" /> strings, even down to the smallest detail in the matter of expenditure.  I think that is borne out by a speech by the Minister for Finance.  I am not finding fault with the Government. They are following the methods that always existed&mdash;methods they inherited from Great Britain, but if there is to be control the Minister for Finance himself must control everything, and so he said the other day that every new appointment made and every change has to be referred to him.  He is not able to say to the Departments: &ldquo;You are allowed so much, and as long as you do not exceed that, and as long as you observe the general rules, I do not want the matter referred to me.&rdquo; That is not the method adopted at present. Furthermore, the account, as I said, as it appears at present is not a complete account.  I may quote again from the same report upon that question:&mdash;&ldquo;Apart from such inconsistencies as those noted in the preceding paragraph, the Committee find that no Vote on Account includes the total cost of the service to which it relates.  Appended to the Navy and Army estimates, and to each Vote of the Civil Service and Revenue Departments Estimates, are notes showing that provision is made as follows in other Estimates for expenditure in connection with this Service....  In the two Votes (for the expenses of the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office), whilst the sums estimated in the current year are £65,547 and £58,626, respectively, the notes referred to show that in the case of the first mentioned a further £40,982, and in the second a further £20,925 are provided under other Votes for expenses of buildings, furniture, fuel and light, rates, stationery and printing, pensions, Postal telegraph and telephone services, etc.&rdquo; It is only when all these are added that you will get the true cost.  You are never able to allot the expenditure of the Executive Officer and judge him by results.  Now, the effect of this central control is really very important. It has a very deep psychological meaning.  If by virtue of the system of accounts the Minister for Finance has to control everything in detail, it necessarily raises a spirit of <Col N="138" /> hostility between the Finance branch and the Executive branches.  Anyone in the public service would admit that. You have an attempt on the part of the Executive branches to squeeze what they can out of the Financial branches and not to be candid and straightforward. Whenever they have a margin that they might release they say: &ldquo;No, if we give this up or if we surrender some people in our Department we will not get anybody else, and when we want an increased expenditure we do not know whether it will be given us, so we will keep quiet and will not tell exactly how we stand and we will try and get more if we can.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Anyone who knows anything about the inner working of the Civil Service in England knows that there is a spirit of hostility going on all the time between these Departments, which has a very prejudicial effect on efficiency, and creates a large amount of internal friction.  I think if the accounts have to be highly centralised and every detail as regards increased expenditure has to be referred to the Finance Branch, especially when you bear in mind that the Finance branch has not the technical knowledge of the requirements of all the departments, the result will be that in the end the departments generally will hoodwink the financial authorities.  There is another aspect of the accounts that is most important, and that is their value for Parliamentary work.  I think everyone who studies the accounts that I have just referred to, the estimates of the Free State, find them peculiarly uninstructive. Of course, you find them in the broad groups giving so much on the Revenue Department, so much on finance, so much for law charges and so on, but when you come to look into the details you find very little information.  You may find that information in the case of big subjects which are grouped, but my point is that the accounts in no way reflect the structure of the organization.  Take the Civic Guard for instance.  It would be much more interesting, I suggest, to show how the Civic Guard is composed, whether in units or in counties or in what way.  At present there is no <Col N="139" /> means of finding out how much the organization costs per unit, or how much it costs in each county.  What I suggest is that a system should be adopted showing the cost per county organization, the cost so much on the Central Depot, the cost of instruction, and so on.  If you had details of this kind you would probably be able to analyse the cost, say, of the Central Depot, what it costs to pass a recruit through it in the year, and so on.  You would be able to ascertain all the knowledge if, as I suggest, you had the accounts built up in an organic form, and this would also give you an idea of your outstanding liabilities.  It probably may be said that outstanding liabilities are much the same all the time, taking one year with another, but my point is that it is not good business to carry on with a system which does not show these outstanding liabilities, even if they are much the same one year with another.</P>
    <P>There is another point I wish to touch on, and it is that in these estimates there is no figure given for capital values.  A State which is being built up develops as it goes on, and naturally accumulates very big sums. These sums, in fixed property, represent a very considerable value, but no indication is given in these estimates as to what that value is.  Then, in the estimates there is no distinction drawn between recurrent and non-recurrent revenue.  You could, I suppose, ferret it out if you spent a considerable amount of time going through the accounts, but the point is that it does not appear specifically in the public accounts as such.  I desire to refer briefly to the system of accounts as an instrument of control, and would like to reinforce my opinion on the matter by one or two quotations by high authorities from evidence given before the Committee on National expenditure. Sir Charles Harris, the Assistant Financial Secretary of the War Office, says:&mdash;&ldquo;In criticising the existing scheme of appropriation of Parliamentary grants, it must be borne in mind that the control of expenditure, in the sense of securing that the various public services are efficiently administered <Col N="140" /> at a reasonable cost, was no part of the object which the framers of the system had in view.  You cannot get any real control of expenditure by cash issues or cash payments excluding such factors as liabilities, consumption of stores from stock and things of that sort.  You cannot control administration by controlling expenses on subjects. If you want to control administration by appropriation you must appropriate to objects.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. S. Dannreuther, the Accounting Officer of the Ministry of Munitions, stated:&mdash;&ldquo;I do not think estimates as furnished in the past to Parliament are worth the paper they are written on from the point of view of Parliamentary control.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I come now to the point of drawing a parallel with the methods adopted by commercial people, and these, I suggest, form an extremely good headline for public accounts.  I do not for a moment say that it is possible to take the commercial account and transpose it absolutely, as it appears, without modification into the public service. The objects for which the two systems are working are quite different.  The commercial man, of course, aims at two things, first to show the profits earned, but the object of keeping accounts with him does not end there.  I am sure my business friends here will say that they use their accounts for a great deal more than to ascertain the profits they have earned.  In any well-accounted business, the accounts will also be used as an instrument for control.  When anything goes wrong, the first indication that the directors of a business get of that fact is something that is unusual in the accounts themselves, and that is a view that I think is generally accepted.  To reinforce that point, I wish to give a quotation from so high an authority as Sir Gilbert Garnsey, who is a member of the firm of accountants of Price and Waterhouse.  He says:&mdash;&ldquo;In ordinary commercial practice the accounts are considered as of vital importance to the business as an index of commercial administration and sound management, and a very great deal of attention is given to the system of accounts in use, and to the periodical statements submitted <Col N="141" /> to the directors and to those in charge of various departments of the business affected by the results shown. It is doubtful whether there is any instrument of administration which receives greater consideration in a well-organised business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask you to come to the conclusion that the accounts of the State should receive the same attention that is set on them in any well-organised business, and that they should also receive considerable regard throughout the whole of the Government service.  Yet, the fact is that they are in the same straggling framework, apart from certain revisions, as they were in in the year 1688, when the cash system of accounting was adopted.  Since then the system has remained practically unaltered. The only change that was made in the system was to add an Appropriation Account, showing the sums that were expended before the year 1866.  Since then that system has not been altered, and we still have got the old cash system which was laid down after the Revolution in the seventeenth century.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, even if profits are not the object, the fact that you could bring out a true account and show the unit of cost, which is the normal commercial method, that system, I suggest, could be applied with benefit in the public service.  I would like to take one or two examples as to the use of the organic method of accounts.  The scope of such a method of account-keeping for control purposes is much greater in the big spending Departments than, say, in a Department like that for Foreign Affairs, which does different sorts of work, in no way productive work, but as regards diplomacy and so on.  In a Department such as that it would be hard of course to bring anything in the accounts down to a unit of cost, because the sums spent by that Department are comparatively small, but in the big spending Departments such as the Army, Civic Guard, etc., the organic method of account-keeping will prove to be of extraordinary value.  If you had such a method of dealing with the accounts of a store depot, it would show the cost per ton of the stuff handled, and in the matter <Col N="142" /> of transport it would show the cost of repairs in the case of a number of cars; in the case of local authorities it would show the cost of clerical services per rateable area, for roads, the cost per perch, and for hospitals the cost per patient.</P>
    <P>Finally, I come to this deduction that such a system of accounts would enable you to establish the formula that I have laid down in the words of Lord Haldane, who said that a formula can never be effectively operated unless the accounts are in an organic form.  Furthermore, unless the accounts are in the form I have suggested, you can never adopt the principle of rationing expenditure. I do not know what views Senators may hold on this, but it appears to me that the rational way of dealing with public expenditure is for the Government to decide on policy, and then say that there is so much money available.  Departments may ask how the money is going to be spent, but the Government should be in a position to say: &ldquo;There it is; we have got no more money.&rdquo; The Executive Council then could go through the various items, and taking the charges on the Central Fund and on other services such as pensions, would say that these must be paid.  Then you come to the subjects on which there can and must be give and take, such as Education, Defence, and so on. The Government, having decided their policy, would allow so much on each of these services.  The function of the Government would then be finished, but the Minister in charge of each Department, having a proper organic account, would take charge of the sum allowed to him, and would proceed to allot the amount until he had got the allotment down to a mere unit.  Then he would get the people functioning under him and more or less unrestricted in their own spheres, not referring every item to the Treasury, and in that way you would get a higher standard of zeal and efficiency in the Departments.  Certain scales of salary would be laid down, and if increases were to be given or salaries were to be modified, these <Col N="143" /> would go before the Treasury.  Similarly, if supplementary estimates were required the Department concerned could go to the Treasury, but if the system which I suggest is adopted, the Treasury position will be altered completely from what it is at present, and the position of the accountant who keeps the accounts will become intimately associated with the spending officer.  The latter will then come into close touch with the financial adviser of the Government with whom he is operating.  I hope the Seanad will not think that this is all a fad of mine. There is very considerable authority for these proposals.  This Committee on National Expenditure was composed of very eminent gentlemen, with Mr. Herbert Samuel as Chairman.  The terms of reference of the Committee were briefly to make recommendations in regard to the form of public accounts.</P>
    <P>They recommended that the estimate of expenditure of the year as shown in the Estimates, and the actual expenditure as disclosed in the accounts, should be on the basis of the income and expenditure and the actual cost of the services rendered.  They also recommended that the accounts of all Departments should comprise their total expenditure, including services rendered by every Department, and that the Estimates and the accounts should be grouped in their general scope and that there should be one comprehensive series of accounts for each service.  In fact, they recommended in broad outline what I am asking the Seanad now to accept.</P>
    <P>What has been done to carry these recommendations into actual practice? A good deal has been done, but in a limited sphere.  It is a very difficult thing suddenly to take an old-established account and alter it and modernise it, because while you are altering an account there must be very considerable dislocation, or a tendency to dislocate, in the working of the administration. It is a very expert matter to decide as to the best methods and the smoothest methods by which such a change could be effected.  In Great Britain the Army was taken as the <i>corpus vili</i> for the experiment, and I <Col N="144" /> was associated with the introduction of the method into the Army.  So difficult and highly technical did it appear, we tried the method out in isolated units.</P>
    <P>We took a Battalion Depot and Hospital, and we simply tried the method of this form of organic accounting that I have spoken of.  Having proved it there, it was gradually extended until the whole Army came within its scope. There was very considerable opposition, mainly from the Finance branches.  Naturally they did not like the changes.  They did not like their power of control lessened, and greater authority put into the hands of the Executive branches.  There have been a number of Commissions on the matter, and, finally, the last Secretary for State decided that it would have to be settled once for all, and added that he was going to appoint an influential Committee to decide it.  An influential Committee was appointed, of which Sir Herbert Lawrence, who was Chief of Staff in France to Sir Douglas Haig, and who was a man not only thoroughly qualified in business, but in military matters, was Chairman.  The Committee consisted of several accountants and military men.  The report of that Committee is not yet published, but as far as we can hear, the method of accounting I have mentioned is going to be fully vindicated.  Until the report is published we cannot speak with any authority.</P>
    <P>The practical proposal that I put before the Seanad is the formation of a Committee of experts to examine and explore what has to be done, and how, if a change is decided upon, it should operate.  The references to that Committee would be that the accounting should be organic and that it should show true costs of the services; that there should be an intimate association between the accounting offices and spending offices, and the Treasury's function should be that of general controller, and, finally, there should be an internal audit.  On the report of that Committee, definite practical steps should be taken.  My own view is that it is wiser to begin in the sphere of Local Government, because it is rather easier to handle.  The Local Government <Col N="145" /> accounts are singularly obscure and unwieldy; there is a great deal of figuring and a very small amount of information.  If the Local Government accounts were started with, there would not be any great upset in the machinery of Government.  There will be considerable experience gained there and the men you train could introduce the method gradually into other branches of the public service.</P>
    <P>This is not merely a question of accounting; it is a question of true economy.  You can cut down expenditure quite easily, but that is not sufficient. You want to get value for the expenditure, and you cannot get that unless you can control and know how the money is going, and judge the responsible officers by the result. There is a Bill which is going through the Dáil, the Ministries Bill, which is attempting to define and allocate, more or less on a scientific basis, the functions of the various Departments of State.  The reform of accountancy is an absolutely necessary corollary to that Bill.  The only way you can really implement the clauses contained in that Bill is by a reformed accountancy.  It is not easy to say to one Department: &ldquo;You have this function,&rdquo; and for the head of this Department to say to other people: &ldquo;You have these functions,&rdquo; unless these functions are really operative, and that cannot be a reality under the present system of public accountancy.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Sir John Keane has done very great service in bringing this matter before the Seanad and the country.  If we have not a reasonable and proper method of accountancy we lose everything. <Col N="146" /> Senator Sir John Keane's suggestions are very relevant.  He has dealt with the matter from a business point of view very well and very fairly. He certainly has a great deal of experience. Accountancy in small matters, I would like to point out, might be very essential.  The Senator has been dealing with very big matters.  My advice is that if you mind the pence, the pounds will take care of themselves. If, as Senator Sir John Keane suggests, a Committee were appointed that would revise this matter of accountancy, the country would be done an immense service.  The accounts at present are not kept as any ordinary business man would keep them.  I strongly support the Senator's motion.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the speech of Senator Sir John Keane, and, as Senator Fitzgerald has said, I think it is an extremely interesting one; and I doubt very much that we have had a more important speech made since the Senate began its sittings. He has pointed out to us, what I suppose, without any question, is true, that our Free State Government have inherited and practically adopted the system of Parliamentary accounting of the Government of Great Britain. He has pointed out to us very clearly the faults of that system, from the point of view of the ordinary business man.  He has proved his case by the reports he has read to us of the results of some of the Commissions that have been appointed to deal with the matter.  Undoubtedly, he is producing his motion at a most excellent time, because if the Free State goes on for a good while under the present system, and gets into a prosperous and happy condition&mdash;which, as far as we can now judge, we are rapidly tending towards &mdash;it will be a very difficult thing to alter the system of accounting which existed while we were getting into that state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are a new State, and, undoubtedly, if what Senator Sir John Keane says is right, and if the system which is followed in Great Britain is wrong, this is the time for the Free State to put its house in order and to see that we are not led astray by following other precedents and other methods. <Col N="147" /> We should adopt the most modern methods of keeping accounts, which all great businesses follow, and there is no business greater than the business of the State, with the success of which every citizen is intimately concerned. Learning from practical life, and profiting by the things with which we have to deal in business, I think the State would be well advised to favourably consider the resolution.  I personally have seen the accounts of great banking institutions completely modified in my time, and the system of audit which Sir John Keane refers to completely altered.  There is one thing that every business man in the community will agree is becoming more and more evident as we have gone on, and that is the great importance to us of a sound system of accountancy and internal auditing, supervised by outside accountancy, that accountancy being quite free from any control, except through inefficiency from any of the Directors or those who manage the business.</P>
    <P>I have also had another experience, and that is being connected with the Irish Lights Board, which works under the Board of Works control.  Indeed, there we thought our system was very good, and it was.  We furnished our estimates.  We gave our reason for every expenditure.  We controlled all the offices, stores, and everything of that kind.  We thought that excellent. The Board of Works went into this very system of accounting, and they have adopted a new system.  We have examined that and reported it to be a far better one than the old one.  We have adopted it, and it has now taken shape. A point which all business men recognise is that they cannot control their business if they have not a first-rate system of audit and accounting&mdash;if they do not know what each department and each individual costs them, and if they do not know what the cost of every service rendered is.  It may be that Senator Sir John Keane is wrong and that the British system is first-rate.  I am afraid that any evidence we have is that it is not so, and that Parliamentary control of expenditure is not efficient and is not the sort of control we would expect from any <Col N="148" /> Board of Directors to whom we entrusted the management of our affairs in any company in which we were interested.</P>
    <P>If that is so, then, undoubtedly, we ought to try whether we cannot establish our Free State system of Governmental expenditure on the most modern principle.  I can hardly see any objection on the part of the Government. We are not in the least impugning or saying that the individuals connected with it are not controlling it to the best of their ability.  But, undoubtedly, as Senator Sir John Keane shows, that way of control comes back so much into the hands of the Finance Minister alone that things are not in the state in which they ought to be.  No man can occupy the position of Minister for Finance, and be asked to look into details of all these payments and checkings and every bit of expenditure.  He ought be furnished by his subordinates, the proper departmental officers connected with accounting, with all these details and he ought be prepared to sit down and in quite a short time, as any of us in business know, be able to go through the details.  We have to accept and take these figures placed before us by the proper officials, men whom we can trust.  I would endorse every word that Senator Sir John Keane says.  I think this is a most opportune time to consult with the Government as to how this thing can best be done.  I expect to find our Government quite willing to take the opinion of the best men we can get in the Free State or anywhere else.  I do not think at all that in the Free State we have the very best brains that are going. There are undoubtedly men of immense experience and enormous business ability, whose services could be got and who, associated with some of our own people, would know the details of our own affairs and would place this matter on a proper footing.  I believe that an inquiry into our present system of accounting would be most valuable.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Sir John Keane deserves the thanks of the Seanad and of the country for having so clearly and lucidly put the question of accounting before us in the way he has done.  I gladly <Col N="149" /> support his Resolution, because while he may not have made a complete case for a change, he has made a complete case for an inquiry into the present system, which we have adopted from the other side.  An Englishman who knew this country fairly well said to me some six or eight months ago: &ldquo;I do not think you will be able to afford the British method of Treasury control.&rdquo; He may be biassed, but I think there is a great deal in his remark.</P>
      <P>Many people, possibly the best Englishmen, would change that system, but it is extremely difficult to do that because you are up against a great many vested interests.  The system has been there from year to year, and there are a great many people, with the best will in the world, who believe that because it is in operation in England it must be right.  We do not suffer from that here.  I think the Government would be well advised to adopt the suggestion in Senator Keane's motion.  Personally, I would like to refer to one or two points which he made and with which I am in entire agreement.  He referred to the amount of hostility which unquestionably arises between the Ministry of Finance and other Departments, and he said that that does not tend towards efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to illustrate that by a matter which comes within my own personal experience.  I do so because the matter has not yet been decided, and I can refer to it without appearing to criticise any particular persons concerned. In the Irish Postal Commission we had evidence very largely from Departments and other sources, and we came to the conclusion that while a large number of men were being paid a fair wage for what they were doing, they were, nevertheless, competent to do a great deal better work, and if that work were given to them it would be possible to give them a higher wage. Further, we could transfer to other departments men who were being paid a high wage, but who were doing work for which they need not be paid so highly.  The Commission recommended considerable changes in the whole system.  I am sorry Senator Moran is not here, as if he were, he would bear me out.  The Commission believed that <Col N="150" /> these changes would lead to considerable lessening of charges in the Post Office.  Officials on the other side whom I consulted, told me that they had advocated similar changes on the ground of economy, but they found it impossible to get them through the political machine.  I maintain that the consideration of that report should be a matter for the Post Office, and it should be its business to accept or reject it with the knowledge it ought to have through its officials, of the working of the Post Office.  What is the position?  It is the Minister for Finance who has to decide whether the report is to be accepted or rejected. The responsibility largely rests on him.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the point made by Sir John Keane is a good one&mdash;that it does not make for efficiency to have the Minister for Finance forced to make such a decision.  It is extremely important that economies should be made in the Departments concerned.  We also came to the conclusion that so far as possible the Post Office should be run as a business concern.  We emphasised the point also made by Sir John Keane that services rendered to other Departments by the Post Office should be credited to the Post Office, and it would be possible to find out&mdash;a thing we do not know at present&mdash;whether the Irish Post Office is really the loss it is maintained to be.  The Post Office, for instance, renders services to the Oireachtas, but it gets no credit for them, and the same applies to other Departments. The Stationery Department gives us something in return.  If you had a proper system of accountancy you could examine whether the Post Office is a paying concern, and suggest where economies should take place.  It would also make it possible if you had such a system for the staff of the Post Office to take a real interest in their own Department, and to feel that any economies effected would improve their own status.  At present you have officials quarrelling as to whether they are Civil Servants; you have comparisons with the scales of other Departments, and you have jealousies, but they all blame the Ministry of Finance for all their grievances.  Personally, I am sorry that the Minister for Finance is <Col N="151" /> not present, because I think this Resolution is framed in the interests of his Department, possibly more than those of any other.</P>

      <P>Would you pardon me for a moment, Senator Douglas, while I tell the Seanad that I know it was the intention of the Minister for Finance to be present during the discussion on this motion.  Sir John Keane had probably got half-way through his speech when a message was sent to me from the Minister for Finance, to say that he regretted that he was being detained and could not be here until about an hour's interval had elapsed.  I did not like to interrupt Senator Sir John Keane, because he had been baulked already more than once in his motion, and I thought he should be allowed to proceed.  The Minister was anxious to be here, and probably will appear later on after this discussion has closed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that explanation, because I felt sure from his remarks to me, that he intended to be here.  As I was saying, if a proper system of accountancy were evolved, not only would each Department be responsible for its own finances, within the limits laid down by the State, but also the Ministry of Finance itself would be able to be run on business lines, because it would not be meddling with the details of other Departments, but would concern itself with a definite Balance Sheet.  The proper business of the Minister for Finance would be to evolve a definite financial policy for the State, and put it forward at the right time, and answer criticisms.  The setting up of this inquiry of experts would also add to our credit abroad.  Our neighbours in England might not, perhaps, be so much impressed by an inquiry into a system which we inherited from them, but there are other countries which do not think that we are wise in following an antiquated system.  If the Committee of Experts suggested in the Resolution were adopted by the Government, and if that Committee was such as to command respect in this and <Col N="152" /> other countries, we would find our National credit going up by the fact of our showing a desire to place efficiency first.  Economy is of the greatest possible importance, but I suggest that economy which in any way loses efficiency is not economy, and will eventually cause greater expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Dáil has been very fortunate in having this Resolution brought forward in such an able manner.  Senator Sir John Keane speaks with inner knowledge and in a manner in which he possibly alone in this Seanad is in the position to.  His illustrations, therefore, are of very considerable value in their bearing upon the general position which he has outlined. The Resolution is, I think, particularly necessary at this time, by reason of the fact that the finances of the Free State are so much in the public eye.  The reason that the present system of accounting, to my mind, makes for laxity in all departments is that we do not follow our estimates through.  At the outset of each year estimates are made under various headings, and what happened during the year is not closely enquired into.  All we know is that if the amount allocated at the outset under any particular heading is not spent, it is practically merged in the general account, and we do not see it the following year.  Without taking into account whether you allocated it under a certain heading or spent or brought a balance forward, or whether there was an excess of expenditure under that heading, or how that excess was applied, we proceed with a clean sheet, as it were, the following year.  As it was said here, any business conducted like that would very soon go on the rocks financially. What happens in our public bodies with this particular system is that the responsible official in any department is not held to task at the close of the year or early in the following year, prior to the time the estimates are being made up.  He is not brought to account to show how he has expended money allocated to his particular department, what he has done with that money, what balance he has left over, or if he has had occasion during the year through unforeseen contingencies to exceed <Col N="153" /> the amount allotted to his department, and how he got the excess.  These are things we do not do, and that strikes at efficiency, because any man, who is untrammelled in that way, spends as he goes along, and there is no one to bring him to task.  It makes for a certain looseness in the administration of public bodies, and the effect is the same where other departments are concerned.</P>
      <P>I was reading, a little time ago, an article bearing on this question of accountancy. It is said that the English tax-payer at least had the comfort of knowing&mdash;and this was about the only insight he got into how his money was expended&mdash;that all the accounts are subjected to an independent auditor. Those of us who know anything of auditors know that there is not very much of a guarantee in that to the man in the street.  The auditor is a human machine, and such statements and figures as are put before him he has to accept.  In a bank you have your auditors auditing the accounts.  They go right through them, but they are not concerned with the valuation of your securities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking from an Australian Banking point of view, it may be of interest to the Seanad to know that in times of drought we had sometimes to write down the valuation of stations, ordinarily on our books at a valuation of £100,000 to £150,000.  We had to write them down, not to their depreciated value, because in times of drought their value is nothing, as in times of drought nobody would buy them.  We could not write down the security we had in our books for £150,000 representing station property as nil.  If we did, our balance sheet would show we were a bankrupt concern. A month after the drought with copious rains, your securities went up, and instead of the station property not being saleable, for the amount advanced upon it in your books it was saleable at three times the amount.  I am giving that illustration to show that an independent audit is not everything in showing the stability of any concern, but in a particular time it is, if all your departments are well manned, and every man is a master of his job.  Then such statements as he will lay before <Col N="154" /> the auditor, verified as the auditor would see, and with these statements collated and a balance sheet brought up to that extent, it is the best security the average tax-payer can possibly have.  Bearing on that, this devolution of responsibility is a very admirable thing, but I certainly would not advocate the loosening of the control of the Minister for Finance even in matters of detail.  I think the Minister for Finance and the Executive should hold their grip over the departmental official, as to the minor and simpler headings of such a department, because if you have a very good officer he might be a very poor administrator and a worse financier.  If you give a sum to a man and say, &ldquo;Run your department on that, and show what you are doing for it at the end of the year,&rdquo; that gives very wide latitude, and by the end of the year, things may have been done that cannot be undone.  He may find himself with three-quarters of the year nearly gone, with his money expended, and a lot more to be done. There should be a certain check of the Minister for Finance on the whole expenditure, not, indeed, to trace it all in small detail, but in a secondary way, right through the period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLove" hpid="Mr. CLAYTON LOVE Mr. CLAYTON LOVE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CLAYTON LOVE</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate closes I would like to join in it. During the last Session, I think you will all recollect, Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Jameson were most insistent on the necessity there would be to balance the Budget.  I think that bore fruit with ourselves, and I think that they have put before us, in a very clear manner, with a few simple figures, what it costs to run this country, exclusive of the six counties, and shown what our revenue would be, and what we could do, and what we would do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the idea of the accountancy suggested by Sir John Keane was to prevent us doing something which might be wrong.  It would certainly be very wrong to follow the old system of accountancy, altered in a very promiscuous fashion in the middle of the nineteenth century, and which has impressed upon the English Government itself its faultiness.  They had suggested a new system with which Sir <Col N="155" /> John Keane was perfectly cognisant, and which he believes will be the system possibly adopted as a necessity. Surely, if that is so, I do not see any reason why we should, as apparently, we do, follow on the lines of a system which appears to be inadequate, and I think that the greatest possible credit is due to Sir John Keane, not alone by the Oireachtas, but by the country generally, for producing this debate, and for showing so clearly to the Government the system which, if it is not actual perfection, is an improvement on the one operating, and I sincerely hope that the Minister for Finance will take very serious cognisance of what has occurred here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>From the remarks which have been made, perhaps I did not quite make clear that, far from condemning what the Free State Government have done, I think they made an honest attempt to improve the old system so far as it is capable of improvement.  They have put footnotes to Estimates to show under which Vote one can find every item of expenditure.  That is an improvement, but when you look to these votes you do not find any detail which elucidates the reference in any way.  One constant objection is advanced, and that is as to the cost of the new accountancy. Any experience that they have had in England in regard to it has tended to show that it has been costly, rather because it was impossible to reduce the operations of the Finance branch in proportion to the increase of the accountancy.  The Finance branch has always persisted in its old functions long after they were unnecessary. It is easy enough to introduce new officials, but there is very great difficulty in reducing or transferring them to new work.  That is only one of the mechanical difficulties bound to arise, but of course, a great safeguard in that direction is a strong Finance Minister, who will insist upon recommendations put before him being carried out in spite sometimes of somewhat determined opposition on the part of officials.  I do not think it is fair, of course, entirely to blame England for this system because, as far as <Col N="156" /> I know, there is only one Government in the world that has really modernised its accountancy, and that is the Province of British Columbia in Canada, and anybody interested in the matter can see their accounts.  They are practically on a new basis, and that was all the result of one gentleman, who was a municipal accountant in one of the prairie States.</P>
      <P>With regard to the audit, that, of course, will not be changed very much, except you have a unit system of accountancy.  If you have a different unit of costs in different districts the auditor, perhaps, could follow it up and make a report to the responsible authorities, who will enable an investigation to be carried out, but it is very dangerous to draw conclusions by comparison on their face value.  You have, first of all, to inquire very carefully as to costs.  It was found that it was costing far more to feed soldiers in one place than in another, but when it was gone into it was discovered that the soldiers had been starved in one place.  Senator Kenny is afraid that if you allocated expenditure to some official departmental head, he would run wild, and would incur all sorts of commitments before there was time to find him out, but in practice that cannot happen, because the Estimates have to be brought up and approved by the Oireachtas, and, of course, any drastic changes will have to be done carefully.  That is all I have to say arising out of any remarks that have been made, and I beg to thank the Seanad for the very favourable and rather unduly complimentary manner in which this motion has been received.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad congratulates Senator Yeats on his winning the Nobel Prize for Literature; and thanks him for the recognition which the nation has gained, as a prominent contributor to the world's culture, through his success.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that it will be as welcome and <Col N="157" /> as grateful a task to the members of the House to pass this motion of congratulation as it is to me to propose it. To my mind, since the Treaty the award of the Nobel Prize to Senator Yeats is the most significant thing that has befallen this country, and I will try to explain the reason.  There would be great room for misconception as regards the value of the Arts, and I suppose in no other subject has so much nonsense been spoken as on that very matter.  There are two ways of regarding artistic work: one is the individual.  A man may have a certain idiosyncrasy which is utterly worthless, or a man may have an output of work which is thoroughly valuable to the nation as regards its social angle, and it is, on that, I think, that the merit lies with Senator Yeats, because for over twentyfive years he set his face sternly against any false enthusiasm or idealism, or any attempt to make poetry into patriotism, and he has invited and sustained a great deal of unpopularity. But on no occasion has he ever written tawdry poetry in order to make his purse heavier.  When a detached and impartial nation, and a nation with discrimination such as the highly educated Swedes have, selected Senator Yeats for such an award, above and in spite of the recommendation of the Literary Committee of Great Britain, and in view of the immense body of literature, both historical and epic, at present in existence in France and Germany, and selected him from a race that hitherto had not been accepted into the comity of nations, at any rate socially, is an honour we ought to show our awareness of by making our congratulation to him take the form of Senatorial recognition.</P>
    <P>When we look back on the history of civilisation, when we survey rapidly the contributions to human culture which the different races of the world have made, one or two names, or perhaps three only, are outstanding.  In Greece we all know there are names outstanding, such as Plato and Aristotle. In Italy, Virgil and Dante, and, coming down to modern times, men like Marconi and Mussolini.  In the 18th century, we had Berkeley, Swift, and <Col N="158" /> Molyneux.  We can see the aridness of the nations which have no outstanding men.  I am not making any geographical references to our country, but to such places as Persia, where there are no outstanding names.  What is the meaning of these outstanding names? The meaning is that it is by men such as they our civilisation is assessed.  Our civilisation will be assessed on the name of Senator Yeats.  Coming at a time when there was a regular wave of destruction, hatred of beauty, a crushing out of perfection, and blindness to the national ideal in this country, it is a very happy and welcome thing.  True, perhaps, it was only led by a few ferocious and homebreaking old harridans, but the very fact that it was put forward as a political programme makes one anxious as to the sanity of some. One danger to the country is the large body who have never been made in any way aware of the enormity of the vote. Until we have instructed our franchise-bearers there will always be the danger that there may be a stampeding of people who are sufficiently removed from insanity in enthusiasm for destruction.</P>

      <P>I am very glad, indeed, to second the motion.  I think that every member of the Seanad undoubtedly felt personally that we have had a benefit conferred on us when we knew Senator Yeats had this honour bestowed upon him.  To know that one of our members stands really at the top of the best culture of Europe, which undoubtedly this means, makes everyone of us, I think, feel that we are proud to number him amongst our Senators.  Personally I am very glad of it, because Senator Yeats' father was one of the most intimate friends I ever had, and he himself was of course a great painter.  He painted some grand pictures, and he also had a wonderful literary quality in his prose, as you <Col N="159" /> may see in his letters which are now being published.  It happens that Senator Yeats' mother comes from a Sligo family who had also great qualities. I knew an uncle of his who had the wonderful literary quality of keeping you absolutely entranced for an hour by the method in which he would describe some incident, and afterwards when you came to examine it the only point of the thing was the wonderful literary description he gave you, and the way that he attached interest to it. It is quite easy to see that Senator Yeats is a typical Irishman in his breeding.  I personally, who am very much of a Scotchman in one part of my breeding and Irish in the other, think that all Irishmen ought to be very proud that one who is so purely Irish as Senator Yeats should have this great honour conferred on him.  As Senator Gogarty has said, it comes at a peculiarly opportune time.  We have to get our minds lifted away from some of the unpleasant and disastrous things we have seen happening in our country during the last few years.  If we could get into the atmosphere in which Senator Yeats lives, and into which he would like to guide us, we would certainly find peace of mind, and a part of our mind being employed, which latterly we have not had very much time to employ, and so I do not think there could be a more opportune motion than that of Senator Gogarty's. I think that no body of persons can more fittingly give voice to what I have no doubt an enormous number of Irishmen are feeling, that is, by tendering hearty congratulations to Senator Yeats on the honour conferred on him.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That it is desirable, in the interest of the loan now being negotiated by the Government, that a statement regarding the very considerable assets of Saorstát Eireann should be published for the information of investors.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I put down this motion on account of a letter which I received from the Minister for Finance, and which I think all Senators have also received, asking us to do what we could to forward the interest of the loan now being negotiated, because I do not see in what other way most of us could help the loan.  Some of us are not very great capitalists or experts, and we have no great means of helping except by getting a debate here, in which I hope certain experts of ours may be able to give a statement which would help it on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought that we might do some little thing in the way of propaganda. I shall confine myself to a few facts that are not generally known.  I believe if the assets of the Irish Free State were well known amongst investors everybody who has money to invest&mdash;even the most cynical capitalist &mdash;would only be too glad to put money into the Loan.  It is strange, while so much attention has been given in the last couple of years to politics, and the political aspects of the Treaty, little or nothing has been said about the financial side of it.  That may be the case because there is a reference in the Treaty to the war debts the Free State may have to meet.  On the other hand, there are claims, which will come before a Commission of Inquiry one of these days, to settle financial questions between the two countries. These are little thought of.  They are too complicated to be given in figures, requiring as they do calculation and <Col N="161" /> adjustment, but a few general facts can be stated that seem to me to be very important.  When investigated they will show that large assets are the property of the Irish Free State, and that the Loan we are now negotiating is a very negligible sum, one that could easily be repaid, almost at any time.</P>
    <P>We all know that before the Union Ireland was an independent State. When Ireland was included in the Union 123 years ago, it went in as an equal in right with England.  Between them the two countries built up a great financial system that extends all over the world.  Ireland was not a vassal State, but an equal in rights and a partner with Great Britain.  That great financial system was built up to a great extent by the energies, the brains and sinews of Irish civilians and Irish soldiers.  Ireland undoubtedly is entitled to a share of the assets of the United Kingdom, including a share of the arms, armaments, fleets, fortifications, Crown colonies, possessions, and every house and store put up by the Government of the United Kingdom in every part of the world.  After the Great War there was a surplus of perhaps £1,500,000 of munitions, most of which have since been disposed of and the proceeds put to the reduction of taxes and not the reduction of debt.  Ireland contributed about £50,000,000 a year during the war for the purchase of munitions, and is now entitled to a share of what was unexpended at the time of the Treaty.  I might also mention the Suez Canal shares.  They were bought many years ago for £3,000,000, and I believe they are now worth something like £20,000,000.  These shares were bought partly by Irish money, and Ireland is entitled to a share of what they are now worth.  These are only a few of many outstanding items that can be investigated when the Treasury accounts are examined.  They are valuable assets unless it is alleged that the United Kingdom or the British Empire is bankrupt.  Everyone knows that that is not the case, but that they are going concerns.  During the last 100 years an immense amount of Irish money was invested in keeping up that Empire. When Ireland separates from England, <Col N="162" /> England is not entitled to say: &ldquo;We agree to political separation, but we will keep all the assets.&rdquo;  Ireland is a separate nation with equal rights, and is entitled as a partner to a share of the assets.  England is not entitled to say, &ldquo;You must go out naked into the world, and you must borrow money to set up your new household.&rdquo;  We cannot allow the English Government, to use a vulgar phrase, to bolt with the swag while we are let in for the debts. I know that the English Government is proceeding as if it were the sole inheritor and the sole representative of the now defunct United Kingdom. That Government, as we know through long experience, is apt enough to seize upon what belongs to other nations.  It is for us to see that when the Commission is set up, Ireland claims her share of the assets of the United Kingdom. I think it is well that these things should be understood, especially at the present time.  It is well that it should be known we have vast assets which would easily pay the debt for which the Loan is required.  When the time comes, if our Government is worth its salt&mdash; as I am sure it will be&mdash;it will see that we get our share of these assets.  This, I think, raises Constitutional questions which are not thoroughly understood in either England or Ireland.  I feel confident that when our side is explained it will be seen that we are entitled to a share of the assets of the United Kingdom. The very fact that it is set down in the Treaty that Ireland must be responsible for a share of the debts of the United Kingdom is absolute proof that we are also entitled to a share of the assets.</P>

      <P>The next item on the Orders of the Day is the second report of the Joint Committee <Col N="163" /> on Private Bill Procedure.  Senators will remember that a Committee was appointed from both Houses to go into the question of the Standing Orders for Private Bills, and to draw up a suitable code.  That occupied a great deal of time and involved a good deal of attention.  A fortnight ago the draft was ready and was submitted to both Houses.  Certain suggestions were made, both here and in the Dáil, as to alterations and additions and I suggested here that, as the matter was so highly technical, it would be better if those suggestions were referred back to the Joint Committee, who would have the time and leisure to go into them fully.  I find that the suggestion I made, which was adopted here, was subsequently made in the Dáil and adopted there.  The result was that the Joint Committee met again about a week ago, and we had the advantage of the presence of Senator Sir John Griffiths, who made a number of suggestions. A good many of these suggestions were accepted by the Joint Committee, and are incorporated in the draft before you.  We also had the advantage of suggestions in writing from Senator Barrington, who was not himself able to be present.  We went through those seriatim, and some of them were adopted.  Others we were not in a position to adopt.  We have now completed our final draft, and it is for the Seanad to say whether it will adopt our report or not.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I have read very carefully through the very voluminous and, generally speaking, admirable Standing Orders which you have drafted in relation to Private Bill Procedure, and I think the sooner these Orders are adopted the better.  You have dealt with the procedure in regard to Private Bills in the Seanad from the Irish stand-point, and as far as I can judge your rules and regulations are made in accordance with Irish necessities and will lead, I trust, to an extensive Irish practice.  I think it is important that this matter should be settled as soon as possible.  It may be, as time goes on, that some of these Orders may have to be modified.  We can only discover <Col N="164" /> that by experience.  Taking them all round, they are an admirable code, and the appendices are extremely good. The scale of fees is decidedly on the side of moderation, and the sooner we set to work to put our house in order in these matters of development, the better for the country.  The sooner, too, we pass these Standing Orders, the sooner we will put some hope and cheer into that very meritorious profession in both branches&mdash;the Irish legal profession&mdash;which seem to be in somewhat despondent mood at present.  I am very glad that we have had the advantage of the experience of Senators like Senator Barrington and Senator Sir John Griffiths, who know a good deal about this procedure.  I think their advice and assistance in this matter are altogether to the good.  If I be allowed to do so, I move that this Report be adopted.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I would be allowed to intervene before the question is put.  As there is a considerable amount of public interest taken in this matter, I would like to draw attention to the fact that, in addition to the proposals put forward by Senators Barrington and Griffith, the Committee also considered the question of the amount of the deposit required in the case of certain Bills.  The result is that in the Report, which is now about to be adopted by the Seanad, they have very considerably reduced the cost. For instance, the deposit in the case of a very large corporation, reaching something like one million pounds, would be about half, or a little more than half, what would have been required on the other side under the old system.  The Committee were pressed very hard to reduce that further, but I should like to take this opportunity to state that the question was very carefully considered by the Committee, and they felt that this was the maximum in the way of reduction which they would be justified in giving. The Committee had to consider, on the one hand, that every possible facility should be given to any company desiring to promote development in the Free State.  On the other hand, they had to <Col N="165" /> provide a safeguard for citizens of the Irish Free State whose property that company might wish to take.  Therefore, they felt that the sum of £25,500, which is the reduced sum it will be necessary to deposit in the case of a company reaching a million pounds, was a reasonable amount, having regard to the two safeguards which were necessary.</P>
      <P>I would like, also, to point out that under Appendix A there is a further reduction in the cost of Stages of Bills involving large amounts.  In the case, again, of a company reaching a million pounds, the fees under this head would be £118, whereas for the corresponding Stages in the English House of Commons the cost would be about £260.  As there was some public criticism on this question, I would like to point out that the normal procedure under these Standing Orders relating to Private Bills will mean that there will be only one Committee Stage, which will be a Committee Stage by both Houses.  The Committee Stage will be taken by a Joint Committee of both Houses, and that should lead to very drastic and very considerable savings in the total cost.  It is well known that, especially in the case of large concerns, the employment of Barristers under the old regime, and the sending of them across to London, where they would first have to appear before Committee of the House of Commons or House of Lords &mdash;whichever came first&mdash;and then before Committee of the other House, entailed very considerable expense. Here, except in very exceptional circumstances&mdash;except required by either House, which will be of extremely rare occurrence&mdash;there will be only one Committee Stage for Private Bills, and there will be a corresponding reduction in the cost.  I emphasise these few points because I know that a great deal of public interest is taken in the matter.  It is important, in my opinion, that it should be known that the Joint Committee has done everything it possibly could to reduce fees consistent with not making Private Bill business a charge upon the State.</P>

      <P>With regard to the next meeting of the Seanad, from special enquiries I have made, it is quite plain that there will be no Bills ready for us by this day week. But I think, speaking without prejudice&mdash;it is not to be brought up against me if I am a false prophet&mdash; the Judiciary Bill will be ready for this House by this day fortnight.  I would very much like if in the meantime members of the Seanad, who take an interest in it, would make application to the proper place and obtain copies of the Judiciary Committee's Report. I lay special emphasis upon that, because, so far as I understand from the Bill&mdash;I have not seen it in its present shape&mdash;while it has practically adopted the recommendations of the Committee <Col N="167" /> in regard to the formation and composition of the various Courts, it contains no provision to carry out the recommendations further as to the re-organisation of the staffs of the Courts, or to cheapen and expedite the business of the Courts themselves; and I would be very anxious if members of the Seanad would obtain copies of the Report and direct their attention to this portion of it.  Would some Senator move the adjournment without mentioning any <Col N="168" /> particular day, leaving that to me? Something might turn up that might make it necessary to call the Seanad together by this day week.</P>
