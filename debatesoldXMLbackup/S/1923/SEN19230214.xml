      <P>The first business is a Bill that has been sent up &mdash;the &ldquo;Statutory Undertakings (Continuance of Charges) Bill,&rdquo; and the Minister for Local Government has kindly attended.  I will ask him briefly to explain what exactly is the nature of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Ernest Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Ernest Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with a matter which was overlooked when the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill was put through the Oireachtas before Christmas.  This is simply for the purpose of enabling temporary increases in charges which were permitted during the war to be continued.  It will only remain in force for 3½ months&mdash; until May the 31st.  The powers that continue these increased charges expire on the 15th, that is to-morrow.  When the Bill was introduced into the Dáil last week the Government asked the Dáil to suspend the Standing Orders, and to put the Bill through all its stages at one sitting. I know it is not desirable that any type of measure should be rushed through the Oireachtas, and I would not agree in the ordinary way to urge upon the Oireachtas to pass a measure without getting the usual amount of time in the various stages, but this is one which does not raise any principle.  It cannot be disputed that the charges which this Act authorises are necessary.  Some of the undertakings would have to close down if they were obliged to go back to the ordinary statutory charges, and the whole matter of the necessity for the powers of increasing the charges given by <Col N="304" /> this Bill can be reviewed at the end of three months, when the Act will expire. The undertakings dealt with are given in the schedules.  I do not know whether members of the Seanad had time to read through the Bill or not, but I might say that there is power under existing legislation to have the charges reduced, following a report to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce by an Advisory Committee on rates.  So the passing of this Bill will not mean that the charges at present in force on the part of those undertakings shall continue undiminished during the whole of the three months, but it gives power to have them continued, and these powers are necessary, and because of the fact that the present powers expire to-morrow I would urge the Seanad to follow the example of the Dáil in this matter, and by a suspension of Standing Orders to allow the Bill to go through at one sitting.</P>

      <P>In view of what the Minister has said is it the wish of the Seanad that the Standing Orders be suspended to allow the Bill through all its stages to-day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="SIR THOMAS ESMONDE SIR THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>SIR THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read this Bill and also the schedule.  I think it is quite innocuous from my point of view and from that of every other member of the Seanad.  If I understand it, it means that certain powers and undertakings expire to-day or to-morrow, and this Bill is to enable those charges to continue until such time as it is seen fit to alter them.  It may be altered the day after to-morrow or in three months' time, and, therefore, I think the Seanad would be justified in passing this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MAURICE MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say I have no objection to the measures in this Bill, but I would like to call attention to Clause 4, which seems unnecessary. In this Act &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Industry and Commerce. On reading through the Bill I do not see the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the section is required by reason of the use of the expressions in the original Bill of 1919.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if you will look at it you will find that is not so. <Col N="305" /> It uses the words &ldquo;Minister of Transport,&rdquo; but that is only in the beginning, and not in the Bill itself, and in no place does the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly does not make any harm to make clear who &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would look into it.  I do not wish to block anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the clause certainly is to give the powers that were in the Minister of Transport to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. All these powers have been transferred to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce by the Dáil, and the intention is to make clear by the Bill that the powers the Ministry of Transport had will now reside in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That Standing Orders be suspended.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
      <P>The Bill was then put through all its stages and passed.</P>

    <Title>ENFORCEMENT OF LAW (OCCASIONAL POWERS) BILL&mdash;COMMITTEE.</Title>
    <P>The Seanad went into Committee on the Enforcement of Law (Occasional Powers) Bill.</P>
    <P>Clause 1.&mdash;Appointment of Under-Sheriffs, was agreed to, and added to the Bill.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CLAUSE 2.</P>
    <P>(1)  From and after the passing of this Act it shall not be obligatory upon any Under-Sheriff to employ any bailiff to assist him in the execution of a writ of <i>fieri facias</i> or writ of <i>habere</i> or to employ any bailiff appointed under Section 5 of the Civil Bill Courts Procedure Amendment Act (Ireland), 1864 (27 &amp; 28 Vict., ch. 99), to assist him in the execution of his duties under that Act, but in lieu of or in addition to such bailiffs it shall be lawful for any Under-Sheriff to employ such and so many suitable persons as he shall think fit to assist him in the execution of any or every writ of <i>fieri facias</i> or writ of <i>habere</i> and of any or every decree <Col N="306" /> (whether for debt, possession of lands or otherwise) of a Civil Bill Court.</P>
    <P>(2)  Any person employed by an Under-Sheriff as bailiff under this section may be employed at a weekly or other wage to assist him generally in the execution of such writs and decrees as aforesaid, or may be employed specially to assist the Under-Sheriff in the execution of a particular writ or decree.</P>
    <P>(3)  Wherever persons are employed by an Under-Sheriff under this section to assist him generally in the execution of such writs and decrees as aforesaid the number and rate of remuneration of such persons (to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas) shall be subject to the approval of the Minister, and the sanction of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>(4)  Wherever any persons are employed specially by an Under-Sheriff under this section to assist him in the execution of a particular writ or decree the number and remuneration of such persons shall be in the discretion of the Under-Sheriff.</P>
    <P>(5)  Every person employed under this section by an Under-Sheriff to assist him in the execution of a writ of <i>fieri facias</i> or a writ of <i>habere</i> shall have all the powers which are by law vested in a bailiff employed by an Under-Sheriff for that purpose, and every person employed under this section by an Under-Sheriff to assist him in the execution of any decree of a Civil Bill Court shall have all the powers which are by law vested in a bailiff appointed under the Civil Bill Courts Procedure Amendment Act (Ireland), 1864 (27 &amp; 28 Vict., ch. 99).</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir THOS. GRATTAN ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is mentioned in this clause that the Under-Sheriff is to take a certain form of declaration.  I suppose it is too early yet to ask the Minister to give us that form.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so. Of course I could move the omission of the sub-section, but I do not intend to do so now.  I think, however, we are going rather fast.  Are we now on Clause 2?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Certain amendments have been handed in, and, of course, when I come to the sections to which these amendments apply I will mention them.  I have no amendments until I reach Section 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree; but this is a very important Bill.  However, I take it it will be the duty of the Minister to draw up a proper declaration.</P>
      <P>Sub-section 2 was then put, and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sub-section 3 was agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw attention to a matter in connection with Sub-section 4 of Clause 2.  That Sub-section gives power to the Under-Sheriff to employ assistants to any number and to decide on their remuneration. These matters are left to the discretion of the Under-Sheriff.  That is a very sweeping clause.  The debtor will have to pay the charges and expenses, and these Under-Sheriffs are not the ordinary Sub-Sheriffs who are accustomed to do this work.  They are special Sheriffs, and they may appoint a regular possé of people under this system.  In the country there will always be people appointed who are not very highly qualified men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>We must keep these things in order, and Senator Moore is not in order except he moves an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I will move after the word &ldquo;Sheriff&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;subject to the final approval of the Minister for Home Affairs.&rdquo;  The meaning of that is that the Sheriff will not be in the position uncontrolled and entitled to employ a large possé of people, for whom the unfortunate debtor would have to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be seen that you could not impose this task upon the Minister.  It would be a most invidious task.  I could understand the desire to have it referred, <Col N="308" /> on the application of the debtor, to the County Court Judge, but to impose upon the Minister for Home Affairs the duty of taxing every Under-Sheriff's bill would be a hopeless matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I would like somebody to do it, otherwise there may be wholesale hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate if you wanted to bring about an alteration that you did not bring the matter forward in a considered amendment. If the Senator agreed it could be taken on the Report Stage.  This Bill has been in the hands of members of the Seanad for over a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but now we are galloping through it, and unless you rule my amendment out I will move it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not doing that.  I am only pointing out how dangerous it would be to move amendments of that kind without notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think my change is a very drastic one, but this is a very drastic clause.  Indeed, the whole Bill is very drastic, and its operation should be watched very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not to be taken as dissenting from that.  I am now only dealing with the matter of procedure, and if the Senator thinks this is of such importance he can bring it up at another stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>Our position in regard to amendments should be made very clear.  There is a good deal of misunderstanding. Personally I think that amendments should be handed in in writing before 3 o'clock, and that otherwise only verbal amendments should be taken, especially as they can be moved later on the Report Stage.  If important amendments are proposed without notice it is impossible to know what they are, and they may lead to misunderstanding. They certainly will not lead to the efficiency of the Seanad.  This Bill has been in the hands of Senators for over a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection of our Standing Orders is, that there is power in the Chairman in special circumstances if he thinks an amendment <Col N="309" /> is one of importance to allow it to be accepted for discussion, notwithstanding that notice is not given in time. That is a discretion I should like to be very sparing in exercising, because there is always great risk that if I were lax, serious and drastic amendments might be introduced with very little discussion I suggest that Senator Moore should consider this matter further, and if he wishes to amend the Bill let him bring his amendment up on Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all saying the matter is not an important one.  The motion is: &ldquo;That Section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Seanad to support me so far as is reasonably proper in seeing that our proceedings are regular.  On the other hand, I am not in the least desirous of excluding discussion on any matter which any Senator thinks to be of vital importance, but we will get into hopeless difficulty if amendments of this kind are sprung on the Seanad when in Committee, when our procedure provides that due notice should be given, and that amendments should be in the hands of the Senators before asking them to discuss them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.W. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been called to the fact that only certain writs are mentioned here.  An Under-Sheriff has informed me that other writs reach Under-Sheriffs&mdash;writs of attachment and Crown writs&mdash;and it would be well to put in &ldquo;or other writs&rdquo; where necessary.  This only specifies certain writs.  In the second and third lines of Sub-section 5 the two classes of writs are mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it <Col N="310" /> meet your purpose to substitute the words &ldquo;or any writ&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>My point about that is, that this is a somewhat drastic temporary law, and it is called for to meet a special situation.  I do not know enough to know what other types of writs there are.  But we do not wish to extend these somewhat drastic powers beyond what we believe to be necessary to get the law and the execution of the law into operation once more.  If the Sheriff has power to use these drastic powers to enforce certain types of writ I think the effect will be, without any extension of the existing powers, that he will be able to execute all other writs.  As it was not felt necessary by the people consulted by the Minister for Home Affairs in drawing up this Bill to include writs other than those of <i>fi-fa</i> and <i>habeas</i> I would not advise the inclusion of the words suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider, before this Bill passes to the other House, whether it might not be considered useful to extend them to writs of attachment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the Minister to look into this point.  The Minister seems to me to be as hazy on this subject as I am myself.  You must think of the times we are living in.  If it was possible for someone to force an entry into a house representing himself as a Sheriff's officer, which, as a matter of fact he was not, it would be a serious matter.  Senators would realise the position in which the ordinary citizen would find himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out in Clause 4, and again in Clause 6, that it is provided that the Under-Sheriffs' officers must make out a list of chattels to be sold within 48 hours of the seizure, and, if practicable before, but later on the Bill says that within 24 hours he can sell these things.  So he can really go into a place, seize the stock, sell it within 24 hours, and give the man an inventory 24 hours after the goods are sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it should be done within 24 hours.  It seems to <Col N="312" /> me very reasonable for an Under-Sheriff to make out a list within 24 hours; 48 hours is a long time, and, then, later on we come to 24 hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case of seizing cattle on land.  It may be necessary for the persons concerned in the seizure to avoid, say, the possibility of bloodshed, and it may be necessary to take the cattle immediately away. The people concerned in the seizure will have their energy occupied in the taking of the cattle to a place of safety.  That might cause some delay in making out the itemised inventory.  That might be made out at some distance from the scene of the seizure.  Perhaps night-fall will come before the inventory is made out, and it may be necessary to send messengers to the person from whom the goods were seized, and 24 hours may be too short.  At present there is no obligation, I believe, on an Under-Sheriff to supply an itemised inventory.  This is a precaution introduced in view of the extended powers given to officers of the Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to call attention to the fact that this clause would inflict untold hardship on people that this Bill is not designed to meet.  As far as I see, this Bill is designed specially to meet the case of fraudulent debtors. It is not designed to meet ordinary debtors&mdash;people who get into debt through no fault of their own, and who are only going to be allowed goods to the value of £10.  That would mean that a tradesman would be deprived of his means of livelihood.  No tradesman could carry on his business with implements only valued for £10, not to speak of wearing apparel and furniture, to keep the house going.  I think the Government ought to reconsider this clause. In 1840, £5 worth of goods was allowed. That is 80 years ago, and we all know <Col N="313" /> that the value of money since then has increased four times.  We are prepared to help the Government in framing a Bill to deal with fraudulent debtors&mdash; people who are not willing to pay their just and lawful debts.  However, when you take into consideration the fact that many people will come in under this Bill, who are debtors through no fault of their own, owing to the abnormal conditions prevailing, I think it would be unjust and an outrage to deprive them even of the necessary household requirements to keep them going.</P>

      <P>So far as this clause of the Bill is concerned, it alters the law in favour of the honest debtor.  Supposing the Seanad struck this clause out, the effect would be that the value of the goods exempt from seizure would be only £5, as at present.  If this Bill was not introduced, and if we were dealing only with honest debtors, for whom no exceptional powers are required, they would be likely to have their goods seized, and there would only be exemption to the extent of £5.  There was a discussion in the Dáil on this matter, and two amendments were proposed.  One was that the old law should be restored, and that goods to the value of £5 should be exempt, and the other that the value should be £15.  A compromise was effected, and a figure of £10 was agreed to.  It is unlikely that any Under-Sheriff, unless there was an enormous quantity of bedding and tools, would seize down to the precise value of £10. It would be very hard for him, indeed, to go to that, and it was felt there was a safeguard here which would in practice work out in such a way as to leave actually more than £10 worth of goods untouched.</P>

      <P>I think the Government might reconsider this point.  Take the case of a farmer in arrears for purchase annuities, who, I imagine, is the type of person this Bill is supposed to deal with.  Say he is in a tillage county.  He has various articles of machinery, ploughs, harrows, and so forth.  It would not take very long to take £10 worth from him, but even to the extent of £10 he might not, as a result, have the necessary machinery to work the farm.  I think the Government should consider if the figure could not be extended, and the clause amended so that it would only apply in specific cases.</P>

      <P>It would be a mistake to make the clause nugatory, and you will do so if you contemplate making &ldquo;tools and implements&rdquo; cover machinery.  If it covers machinery, why not cover cattle, which are part of the implements of the trade, It seems to me you will be giving a bill of exemption to many debtors unless you are careful of the margin.  Hitherto £5 was the margin, and this Bill increased that by 100 per cent.  I think you ought to be careful before going beyond that.  If the Minister says he will have the matter reconsidered, perhaps the Seanad will be satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the amendments standing in my name, which, I think, can be taken together: Sub-section (1), line 1, page 5. To insert after the word &ldquo;publish&rdquo; the words, &ldquo;in his bailiwick,&rdquo; and line 5 after the word &lsquo;execution&rdquo; add: &ldquo;Provided notwithstanding that the Under-Sheriff shall publish in the district in which the sale takes place an advertisement or public announcement of any such sale not later than 24 hours prior to the commencement of the sale, but it shall not be necessary to publish or announce that any such sale is a sale by an Under-Sheriff, or is a sale of goods, animals, or chattels taken in execution.&rdquo;  These amendments are proposed merely to make the sale public in the ordinary commonsense acceptance of the term. We can appreciate the necessity in certain districts for removing goods seized outside the particular bailiwick, and we can also, perhaps, appreciate the necessity for not announcing that the goods, chattels and animals seized are being sold by the Sheriff, although one might reasonably question whether it was actually vindicating the majesty of the law to deny the fact that the goods were being sold through the enforcement of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I would respectfully submit that a sale or an auction cannot be a public sale or a public auction unless some advertisement or public announcement is issued to that effect.  It is very necessary to ensure that as far as practicable goods seized shall not be sold at one-third or one fourth of their value through lack of competitors owing to the sale being kept secret for all practical purposes.  It is also necessary, I think, to prevent as far as that can be done corruption or fraud on the part of the Sub-sheriff or Deputy who might be appointed to take his place.  We must not go on the assumption that every Sub-sheriff or his Deputy is a rogue, and neither should we start on the assumption that each of these is a saint or an honest man.  Consequently, I think, the best course to adopt is to place as little temptation in his way as possible, and this amendment is towards that end.  We can easily visualise a Sheriff seizing a <Col N="316" /> very large amount of goods or animals and conveying them outside his bailiwick to some unknown destination, and after the expiration of 24 hours selling these animals at a nominal public auction, of which nobody has been advised, to a friend or relative of his own at a fraction of their value.  That is the position which I think we should not countenance or facilitate in any way.  This amendment merely provides that an announcement somewhat on the same lines as an auctioneer announces the sale of goods, animals or lands, shall be published in the district in which a sale takes place without at the same time stating that it is a sale by the Sheriff.  The time limit has been inserted because I think it will be agreed that it is necessary that some little time should be given after the publication of the notice until the sale takes place.  Otherwise, you might have advertisements or a public poster issued at 10 o'clock in the morning and the sale taking place at 12 o'clock, thereby rendering the object for which it was issued nugatory.  Just in passing, on looking over the amendment again I think it would be necessary, with the permission of the Seanad, to insert after the words &ldquo;in his bailiwick&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;except when the sale takes place within his bailiwick,&rdquo; that is a matter that can be adjusted with the permission of the Seanad.</P>

It in no way weakens the Bill; it simply prevents the selling of goods at ridiculously low prices, and it protects the <Col N="317" /> judgment debtor from being defrauded of a great part of the value of his goods.  It also protects honest judgment debtors whose goods may be seized in mistake by the Sheriff, and gives them some opportunity of preventing the sale by pointing out the mistake that has been made.

You say you wish to insert after &ldquo;publish&rdquo; the words &ldquo;in his bailiwick.&rdquo;  Is it your intention that when the sale takes place within the bailiwick no advertisement or public announcement is necessary, but where it takes place outside the bailiwick an advertisement or announcement is necessary?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  My desire is that the last part of the amendment should provide that an announcement of the sale shall take place in any case, whether the sale is within or outside the bailiwick.  I am afraid the wording at present does not provide for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>You see your second amendment will be contradictory to the first one.  Because, if your first amendment is accepted, it renders it unnecessary for any advertisement or announcement wherever the sale is in the bailiwick.  That would be the effect of the first amendment you propose. Your second amendment, if it is to extend to sales in the bailiwick, would contradict your previous one.  If your intention is that, no matter where the sale takes place, there must be an advertisement and announcement of the sale, then you should move to reject the clause. Do you follow me?</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I am making it plain.  The latter part of your amendment will be very inartistic, because it would ask to have the clause which begins by saying that the sheriff may do something, winding up by saying that he may not do it and the remedy is not to put it in that way, but to ask the Committee to reject the clause and leave the law as it stands.  What I think you have in your mind, if you excuse me saying so, Senator, is this: You do not <Col N="318" /> wish to alter the clause so far as the announcement that it is a sale by public auction is concerned, but you want to provide that wherever the sale takes place some previous announcement of the fact of the sale should be given without necessarily disclosing that it is a sale by Sheriff.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Well that would be capable of being done by a proviso.  I think by leaving out the words &ldquo;to publish any advertisement,&rdquo; and to let the clause run &ldquo;It shall not be necessary for the Under-Sheriff to publish any public announcement;&rdquo; to leave out the words &ldquo;any advertisement&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;or,&rdquo; and then it would read in this way &ldquo;shall not be necessary for the Under-sheriff to publish any public announcement of any sale of such goods, animals or other chattels or to publish or announce such sale as.&rdquo;  You would have to leave out the words, &ldquo;any advertisement or publish announcement of any sale of any such goods,&rdquo; and say, &ldquo;it shall not be necessary for the Under-sheriff to publish or announce any such sale as a sale by an Under-sheriff or any sale of goods, animals or chattels taken in execution.&rdquo; That would accomplish your purpose, and then the law would compel the Under-sheriff to give an announcement of the sale.  This section would relieve him from the necessity of announcing that it is a sale of goods, animals or chattels taken in execution.  I think that is what you want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE.</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this Section has to be read in conjunction with Section 7, which contemplates that goods shall be sold by public auction. That is certainly the intention, that goods taken in execution shall be sold publicly. Now, it would be most undesirable, if goods were being sold in the neighbourhood of a place in which they were seized, that it should be obligatory on the Under-sheriff to give a public announcement of the sale.  Senator O'Farrell talked about selling goods at ridiculously low prices.  That is what always happens at the present time at an Under-sheriff's sale when there is a publication or when all sorts of announcements are made.  The people from whom the goods were seized, or their friends, go there. <Col N="319" /> They intimidate or terrorise the probable buyers, and the result is that nobody will purchase those goods except some hardy fellow who expects and, in fact, gets them at a great deal less than their value in consideration of the risk that he runs. It will really be much fairer to the judgment debtor if the goods could be sold by public auction, without any announcement of the fact that they were goods taken in execution.  For instance, what may be in many cases the best thing to do is to seize the cattle and transport them at once to the market, and have them sold in the market by public auction, without having to delay for any length of time in order to publish an announcement that may be made necessary by this Bill. I know that is the case of certain cattle that were seized&mdash;cattle which, it was pretended, strayed into other people's land.  They were brought to Dublin and sent to the market.  Within an hour or two of the time when these cattle arrived in Dublin six or seven stalwart men had arrived here to find out what had happened to the cattle.  If it had been necessary, before anything could be done in the way of disposing of the cattle, to publish an announcement of the sale, then probably we would have had the same form, or to some extent the same form, of intimidation as would have occurred if these cattle had been sold locally in the district where they were seized. This is to some extent a drastic provision, but it is a provision that in the ordinary circumstances would probably be as beneficial to the judgment debtor as to the judgment creditor, and I do not think that it is necessary, having regard to the fact that this is a Bill designed to meet a special situation&mdash;a Bill of which the duration will only be six months, and a Bill introduced for the purpose of getting the machinery for executing decrees going again.  I do not think that it is necessary that any restriction should be put in the Bill that would make it difficult for an Under-sheriff to realise, or would give opportunities for the old intimidation to be practised, with a view to rendering the Act nugatory to some extent.</P>

      <P>I find myself in agreement with both Senator O'Farrell and the Minister for Local Government.  I think that what is really <Col N="320" /> required is to satisfy us, and to make it perfectly clear that it will be impossible for the Under-sheriff to sell privately at a low price.  I think it is clearly undesirable that there should be any right or any obligation to state that the goods to be sold are seized goods.  I am at a loss to see why&mdash;&mdash;</P>

One is the announcement of a sale of seized goods; the other is giving the announcement that there is a public auction, and according to this Clause as it stands there is neither an announcement of a public auction nor a public sale, nor is there any announcement that the goods are seized by the Sheriff.  They are two distinct things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just attempting to try to point out what you have stated. That is a difference which ought to be made clear.  In a later clause it is provided that the goods may be sold by public auction.  It says in a previous clause that they may be sold at any time, but what I think is required is to make it clear that there will be some competition in the sale, and, at the same time, what the Minister for Local Government clearly wants to safeguard, and which you have pointed out is, that while there is the public competition it should be made perfectly clear, that there is no obligation to state to anyone that they are goods that have been seized.  I am rather at a loss to see why the amendment, in the form in which you put it, would not be made, and I think it should be.</P>

That is to say, the Section would then read: &ldquo;And it shall not be necessary for the Under-sheriff in the case of cattle or other live stock to publish any advertisements or public announcements of the sale, or in the case of any seizure to publish or announce that any such sale is a sale by the Under-sheriff, or a sale of goods,&rdquo; and so on. In other words, you would make the last part of the Section apply to every seizure, but you would limit the right to sell without notice to cattle and live stock.  I think that is what Senator Douglas had in his mind.</P>

In the Bill as it stands at present the Government <Col N="322" /> purpose to provide that in the case of any seizure the Sheriff, in his discretion, may avoid publishing any advertisement or public announcement of the sale of such goods.

      <P>As I understand the amendment, it means this: we all know there is machinery existing whereby cattle can be sold without the announcement of auctions.  In the Dublin markets <Col N="323" /> there are regular auctions every Thursday morning, and the necessary competition will be there.  There will be no opportunity for friends to come along and buy at a ridiculously low figure.  Your suggested amendment means, as far as livestock is concerned, that there is no necessity for a public announcement or advertisement.  The sense of the amendment is that, as regards other goods and chattels, an announcement should be made of the sale, but the Sheriff is not bound to put in the advertisement or announcement that it is a Sheriff's sale of seized goods.  I think under the circumstances the Seanad ought to accept that, because it meets the whole situation.  I do not want to differentiate between the owners of live stock and the owners of goods, but there is a machinery for disposing of live stock in the ordinary way without any danger of advantage being taken of it, because there is the usual competition like there is in the ordinary market.  On the other hand, you will have a public announcement of a sale of chattels, not necessarily stating that it is a sale of seized goods.  I think that would meet the whole case.</P>

      <P>I think it is very undesirable to differentiate between the different classes of goods which may be seized by the Sheriff, or the manner in which they should be disposed of.  It has been stated that cattle can be sold at auctions.  So can furniture.  There are such places in the City of Dublin, and in other towns in the country where there are periodical furniture auctions.  The same thing would apply to furniture as applies to cattle.  I think it is altogether forgotten that this is only a six months Bill.  It has been considered necessary by the Government that some drastic measures should be taken to bring about a recognition of the law by the people, and they have sent this Bill before us for consideration after discussion in the Dáil.  I think we should have very serious reasons for refusing to give them the powers which they ask in order to bring the country back again to a normal state.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw attention to what I called attention to before in No.  4, where it is laid down <Col N="324" /> that within 48 hours of the seizure the Sheriff must give a list.  Under No. 6 he can sell them within 24 hours.  I think if that 24 hours in No. 6 were changed to 48 it would give a reasonable chance to people.  We agreed to leave 48 hours as it stood in No. 4, and if we raise the 24 hours here to 48, they will not be able to sell the cattle until after they have given notice to the man from whom they have taken the cattle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>What I wished to say was that this is an emergency measure, and it might facilitate the recovery of these debts if there were some stay, seeing that under the Bill the title that the Under-sheriff gives would be an absolute one.  Hesitancy to purchase before was caused by the uncertainty that there might be some aftermath.  If a person purchased it might be proved that the <Col N="325" /> goods seized and sold were not the property of the debtor at all, and that the purchaser might be put to trouble and inconvenience, and, perhaps, legal proceedings. But now, seeing that he will have an absolute title, I think in the interest of the debtor and in the interest of the Under-sheriff, and in order to give further facility for the recovery of money, that it would be well if there was some stay.  We know that, all through the country, there are many farmers who are well able to pay their rates, and we know that the machinery of the Co. Councils is, practically dislocated through the money not coming in.  They are holding back.  They can pay their debts.  They have plenty of property, but they are holding back&mdash;some of them possibly because of financial reasons. They may be a bit pressed for a time, but there are none of them in that position that their friends would not come to the rescue if there was a matter of the seizure of cattle and the selling of them at a sacrifice, or a threat of it.  Therefore, I say that a slight stay of twentyfour or forty-eight hours&mdash;under the old system it used to be five days&mdash;would facilitate both sides.  It would facilitate the needy debtor in going to some of his friends who, in the last resort, would say: &ldquo;Well, seeing that I can, by a friendly arrangement, or by your consent, buy the cattle and get a good title, I will step in and release your cattle.&rdquo; A further facility in that case would be, that there would not be the exposure of the debtor, because the cattle may be left by arrangement on his lands.  His friends could leave them there by arrangement, and there would not be the local exposure or the odium attaching to the sale.  If you put up these cattle without letting anyone know where they are to be auctioned, and send them away hurriedly, his friends&mdash;if he has any&mdash; have no means or no time to interpose and save them.</P>

I think that it would meet the case if between the words &ldquo;sell&rdquo; and &ldquo;such,&rdquo; in line 62 on page 4, you inserted the words &ldquo;by public auction,&rdquo; and leave the rest of the clause entirely unaltered.  That will ensure that no Sheriff can sell privately. He must put up whatever goods he seizes to public auction somewhere, and they will be more or less advertised by being included in the sale.

      <P>As already pointed out, the cattle can be brought to Dublin and sold in the Dublin market; similarly other goods can be sold anywhere.  There is an auctioneer in almost every Irish town.  The goods can be handed to him.  It is not necessary to state they are seized goods.  That precludes the possibility of the Sheriff going to his friends and selling stuff to them at less than it is worth, dishonestly. I do not suppose that any Sheriff would do that, but the amendment put forward <Col N="327" /> by Senator O'Farrell is designed to prevent its occurring.

      <P>We have discussed this matter of amendments very fully, and there is evidently a great deal of doubt as to which amendment would be the most suitable.  We have had to alter them one after another; then we have <Col N="330" /> had a declaration from the Minister that public auction is in the minds of the Government.  I think we would be safer to rely on an undertaking from the Government that all principles of honesty will be observed in the debtor's favour, while keeping out dishonest interference. If we could get a promise from the Government to carry out this clause in that spirit, we would be safer to rely upon it, and, I think, on consideration, it would be very easy for such an undertaking to be given.  We have practically got it already in regard to fears of the Under-sheriff selling to his friends, and in regard to the open market.  If a declaration could be put in of quite a few words, indicating publicity, preventing any illegal dealing on the part of the Sheriff, or illegal action against the individual, and indicating that the Government were only relying on this clause for bare protection for the necessary carrying out of the law, I think it would be far better for achieving what the Seanad wants than any amendment we could possibly pass.</P>

Whether or not an amendment can be produced that will not hold up a legitimate and proper operation of the Under-sheriff, and at the same time provide on paper a safeguard, is a matter that is, perhaps, a little difficult.  It might be better if I would undertake to have it considered with care by the people who are dealing with this matter, and who have been in touch with the Under-sheriffs.  They could consider what sort of amendment, if any, they believed would strengthen the clause so as to prevent abuses, and at the same time not interfere with the effectiveness of the powers given.

      <P>I beg to move the following amendment: &mdash;&ldquo;In Subsections (1) and (2), to delete the words and whether within or outside the territorial boundaries of Saorstát Eireann.' &rdquo; This amendment, or an amendment somewhat similar, has been dealt with in the Dáil.  I think it is one that requires further consideration.  The adoption of the amendment does not make it impossible for goods seized to be taken outside of the territory of Saorstát Eireann.  The clause as it stands holds out rather too rosy or too strong an encouragement to a Sub-Sheriff to bring the goods outside of our territory altogether.  I do not think we should encourage Sub-Sheriffs to make trips across the Channel to sell cattle in English markets that might very well be disposed of in Dublin or somewhere else in the Free State.  In addition to that, it is within the power of any vindictive creditor to pile up the most unnecessary costs on the judgment debtor by suggesting to the Sheriff that cattle would be best sold on the other side of the Channel. There is no reason why that particular <Col N="333" /> passage should be left in the Bill, seeing that it is quite possible, by eliminating it, to bring the cattle outside if there are good grounds for so doing. There is also a question as to whether it is good policy to have to go outside our boundaries in order to vindicate the law within the Free State.  It certainly is not vindicating the majesty of the law within the Free State to have to go to England or Scotland to sell cattle seized under a decree in Ireland.  For that reason alone I think it is very inadvisable to leave the section as it stands.  We are told the Bill is rendered necessary in order to restore the national credit, but I would respectfully suggest that it will do more harm to the national credit to have to go outside our boundaries in order to sell goods seized than to fail selling them within our boundaries.  I think that anybody with a spark of national pride will say that these differences arising out of the present abnormal state of affairs should if possible be resolved within the boundaries.  It would be, in my opinion, an admission on the part of the Government that they were not able to enforce the law in the Free State if they have to go outside it to sell seized cattle.  They will simply be playing the part of cattle rustlers, rushing away across the border with the booty seized under the terms of this Act.</P>

      <P>I think possibly the only effect of this amendment, if passed, would be to open avenues of litigation. I am inclined to agree that the taking <Col N="334" /> out of this particular phrase would not prevent the Sheriff sending the cattle outside the territorial boundaries, but the words have been put in for the purpose of making it perfectly clear that he is entitled to do so.  If we look at the realities of the case I do not think there will be many who will be seriously inclined to object to this power being given to a Sub-Sheriff, and if it is given, there should be no reason why it should not be clearly given.  Take the case of County Donegal.  It may easily be extremely inconvenient and difficult to get cattle or other goods to suitable markets except markets outside the territorial boundaries of the Saorstát Eireann. That is one particular case where it might mean a great loss to the judgment debtor, as well as to the creditor, to have to transport goods to Dublin instead of, in the particular case it might be, to Derry.  Suppose goods or cattle are seized in the County Kerry, in which at times railway communication was impossible, it might be very much better to put the cattle on a boat and send them to Liverpool, Birkenhead, or some other suitable place on the other side rather than to Dublin or any place inside the limit of Saorstát Eireann.  The whole purpose of this clause is simply to make it possible for the Under-Sheriff to take the goods to where he thinks he can sell them best and where he thinks he can get the best price.  I think there is no danger at all that this particular power will be unduly availed of.  I think the Sheriffs will not send goods far away when they can sell them with equal advantage nearer home; and, as to the damage to the credit of a country, I do not think that is possible.  It will not be advertised on the other side that these are Sheriff's sales of goods seized in Saorstát Eireann.  There will be no public announcement of that sort at all. No one will be aware that it is a sale of goods or of cattle seized in Saorstát Eireann, and the credit of the country will not suffer in the least.  It is simply a matter of business convenience that this power should be given to the Sheriff so that he may have free choice of market, and be able to sell the goods he has seized to the best advantage, both for the benefit of the creditor and for the benefit also of the debtor.</P>

It is extremely doubtful whether the Sheriff, who, for instance, has seized cattle in the County Westmeath. can take them away and sell them in London. That is a matter the Government have considered, and it seems to me that if the Government were satisfied that the Sheriff had that power already, they would never have introduced the matter in this clause.

I am inclined to agree with the draughtsman of the Bill who, no doubt, did not put in those words without very serious consideration.

What Senator O'Farrell really tried to <Col N="336" /> point out to the Seanad was the fact that, while these powers already exist in the Act, there was no necessity for repeating them.  Their repetition, he contended, could only have one effect, and that was, to encourage the Under-sheriff to go outside Saorstát Eireann.  The repetition to the Sheriff that such powers exist, actually suggests to him that he must go outside Saorstát Eireann.  If the power is there already, there is no need to repeat it, and the Minister has admitted the power is in the Bill independent of this particular wording.</P>

      <P>I desire to say that I am in agreement with the amendment, because of the fact that I do not want to induce Under-sheriffs, or their assistants, to follow this practice of taking goods that have been seized to the other side for sale.  If that practice were to be followed, I think we would be advertising, to a certain extent, our shame.  I would remind Senators that various classes of goods, as well as cattle, are likely to be seized.  If cattle were the only things that could be seized, the impression might be conveyed that farmers were the only bad pays we have in the country.  I do not think that is fair to the farmers, and I wish to point out that all kinds of goods can be seized and sent across the water to be disposed of. I do not think that is right.  We know that public auctions are held on the other side that in reality are not public auctions at all, and that it is not impossible for a man who has advertised by public auction the sale of goods, cattle, furniture, pictures, etc., to have at that auction a friend, and to give him what they call the short knock.  I think that is the term used at the auctions.  The auctioneer sees <Col N="338" /> a friend present, and he knocks down an article quickly to him.  I do not think we ought to leave ourselves in that position. I think we ought to agree that the words would give power where necessary, and from what the Minister says I do not think it is the intention to take advantage of this power only in very exceptional circumstances.  If the words &ldquo;to sell outside his bailiwick,&rdquo; means that the Sheriff has power to sell in exceptional circumstances outside of Saorstát Eireann, then I think the words may be struck out as the amendment proposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">

      <P>I think that is what the clause already involves, because it only authorises him to do this when he thinks he would get some advantage from the sale, and in the majority of cases, I imagine there would be very little advantage.  Still in small percentages there may be a decided advantage.  The Government propose to leave this to the discretion of the Sheriff, so it is always governed by the principle that he was only to sell outside if he thought in doing so he would have sold to the best advantage.</P>

      <P>I think the principle of this entry and breaking into a dwelling house is a very dangerous one.  If it is the house of the debtor that is broken into well and good, but if I owe a debt and my neighbour's house is broken into I think it would be a very unpleasant thing for him.  It has hitherto been the rule of law, I understand, that the Sheriff could break into any house he suspects, but then he would have to take the responsibility.  If he does not find anything in the house that he has a right to seize he has to suffer.  Of course, if he does find anything he is clear, but this particular clause will enable him to break into any house, and whether he found anything there or not he would be clear of any responsibility.</P>

      <P>I think this amendment of mine covers the provision stated by Senator Moore. In Clause 10 the Sheriff is given almost unlimited powers, and in so far as they affect the judgment debtor we are not objecting, but the amendments which I propose are to try and give some protection to third parties, or what I may term the honest man.  As far as we can read the clause it empowers the Sheriff, if he has any information that he thinks reasonable to break into the house of any individual believing that there are goods belonging to the judgment debtor in that particular house, and the only safeguard that seems to be given at all to the third party is that the Sheriff is supposed to provide reasonable grounds for his action.  I do not know what reasonable grounds are, or are not&mdash;anything might be reasonable grounds.  Information given by a vindictive neighbour might be reasonable grounds, or the political prejudices of the Sheriff or his officials might influence him in breaking into a house, and it does not seem to me that there is any chance for the third party getting any satisfaction at all for any act performed by the Sheriff.  We propose these amendments in order to confine the powers of the Sheriff from breaking into and entering the house of a third party and saving that person from injustice.  As this question was discussed one day before we want to find out whether the Seanad is favourably disposed to giving such unlimited powers to any particular official.</P>

The Under-sheriff has no right to take into execution <Col N="342" /> goods other than those of persons against whom he is enforcing a judgment, so that nothing will be achieved by adopting Senator McPartlin's amendment.  As the law stands, and as it will stand after the passing of this Bill, Senator McPartlin's desire is really met by the existing state of the law.</P>

He wants to alter the section in such a way as to deprive the Sheriff of power of entering the premises of a stranger.  Is not that so?</P>

      <P>The amendment is to the effect that if the Sheriff breaks into the premises of any party other than the judgment debtor, and if he finds none of the goods for which he is looking, then the person into whose premises he has broken shall have the right of action.  At the present time he has no redress if the Sheriff can show reasonable grounds for breaking in.  As the mover of the amendment pointed out, it is always reasonable grounds if a vindictive person comes along and says that certain goods for which the Sheriff is looking are concealed in some other house.  That is what we want to prevent.  This is a Bill proposing to deal with debtors, but there is no reason why people who pay their debts should be penalised to the extent to which it is in the power of any Sheriff to penalise them.  It is for that purpose the amendment is moved.</P>

      <P>The clause deals with much more than houses.  It deals with any sort of premises.  If the amendment were to be adopted it would mean that if the Sheriff or his officer pulled a bush out of a gap and went into a neighbour's field to see if the cattle had been driven there for the purpose of not being taken by the Sheriff, he would be liable to an action.  I think it would be certainly crippling the Under-sheriff in the exercise of the new powers which we are going to ask him to undertake in the present circumstances, if an amendment such as this were adopted.  In regard to houses, there is a somewhat different argument, but certainly, so far as going into a field or into a yard or a close is concerned, I think it would be most undesirable that the Seanad should adopt an amendment which would prevent the Under-sheriff from carrying out his very difficult, arduous, and dangerous duties, if we should add to this the possibility that if in making a search which will do no damage to anybody he will make himself liable to an action for damages. I think that the Seanad certainly would <Col N="344" /> be doing something unnecessary, and might hamper very greatly the execution of the law if the amendment is adopted. In regard to the other question, that is the matter of reasonable cause, certainly that would not be satisfied if, say, a boy in the street told him that the goods were in so-and-so's house.  That would not protect the Sheriff if he came before the Court.  He would have to show something definitely reasonable in order to satisfy a jury.  That would be quite sufficient protection for a third party.  That is not in the amendment before the Seanad, as the clause deals with premises other than houses.</P>

I do feel very strongly on the question of dwelling-houses, and I hope the Minister will consider the point, and see if he cannot do something, or insert some words to make it clear, so that it would not be possible for anyone to break into a person's house merely on suspicion.</P>

      <P>This Order is one which under the Adaptation of Enactments Act requires to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The title is one which gives no indication of the purpose of the Order.  At present land taken for allotments under the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916, cannot be retained beyond the 31st August without the consent of the Railway and Canal Commission.  Now, if land held for allotments is to be let out this year it must be held beyond the 31st August, because the produce grown on it cannot be cleared by the 31st August.  It is the intention of the Government to deal with this question of allotments by a measure which will be introduced to the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  In the meantime it is necessary that it should be possible to re-let the land held at various places for allotments for this season.  The Railway and Canal Commission have acted as arbitrators between the Department of Agriculture and the holders of the land in regard to compensation.  The Railway and Canal Commissioners, however, have ceased to have any authority in Saorstát Eireann, and it is proposed to set up a Commission for the purpose of this particular business, to be called the Railway and Canal Commission (Extension of Time) Order, 1923.  The Commission will <Col N="347" /> consist of the Secretary of the Department of Local Government and the Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs.  They will do the work in this regard that has been done heretofore by the Railway and Canal Commissioners. I think the Order is a rather formal one. It is simply to set up a stop-gap body to do certain work which was done by the Commission, which has ceased to operate in Saorstát Eireann, until such time as permanent provision is made.</P>

      <P>The Executive Council is empowered to set up a Statutory Board of Commissioners to take the place of any existing Statutory Board of Commissioners.  It can do that by Order, which does not require to be laid before the Oireachtas, but if it divides the jurisdiction of one existing Board among two or more Boards, then it requires that the Order amalgamating or dividing the jurisdiction of the Boards shall be laid before the Oireachtas.  The reason that this particular Order has to come before the Oireachtas for confirmation is that it divides the jurisdiction of the Railway and Canal Commissioners, and gives part of their jurisdiction, namely, that in regard to the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act of 1916, to this new body.</P>

      <P>This again comes before the Seanad because, under Section 7 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, it is necessary where two Boards or Commissioners are amalgamated by order of the Executive Council, that that Order should be approved by a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas before it comes into effect.  This deals with revenue and taxation, and somebody has said that it might more appropriately have been introduced first into the Dáil. However, the Seanad has met first, and as we do not wish to have any delay in setting up this Board of Revenue Commissioners we have introduced this into the Seanad.  In the United Kingdom there were two Boards of Commissioners, that is, Commissioners of Inland Revenue <Col N="351" /> and Commissioners of Customs and Excise, each Board consisting of four Commissioners. We will not have enough work to justify the maintenance of two Boards of highly paid officials.  We propose to amalgamate these two Boards, to give to the Board of Revenue Commissioners the duties of Commissioners of Customs and Excise and of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue.  There will be three Commissioners, who will be Civil Servants with considerable experience of Revenue work, that is, they will be highly qualified men.  They will be subject to the Minister for Finance so far as the general control of their staff is concerned, their qualifications, and hours and conditions of service, but the Minister for Finance will not have anything to say to the assessment of the taxes payable by any individual.  So far as that is concerned the Commissioners will act independently and judicially.  I think that the Seanad will have no difficulty in agreeing that if for the late United Kingdom 8 Commissioners sufficed to do the work, 3 Commissioners would do all the work in both branches that is likely to arise in Saorstát Eireann.  This bringing of the whole revenue under one Board will lead to certain other economies.  For instance, I think, perhaps, there would be a common Accountant-General, and it will lead to certain economies in actual administration, as well as to the economies that will be effected by having one Joint Board, instead of two Boards, doing this particular work.</P>

      <P>We certainly will support the Government in any proposal they may bring forward for economy in public administration. Their idea of amalgamating the Board of Inland Revenue and the Commissioners of Customs and Excise is certainly a step in the direction of economy, and we will welcome that.  This question is really very complicated, and it is not a matter that we can rush into without some little consideration.  Do I understand that the re-formed Revenue Board, or whatever you like to call it, will act under the supervision of the Accountant-General, whom we have already appointed? I understood the Minister to say something of that sort.</P>

      <P>That point is clear.  It is a special Accountant-General for the Revenue Board itself, who is a different individual altogether from our own Accountant-General. We are to have three Commissioners I understand.  These gentlemen shall be appointed by the President of the Executive Council, and shall be removable only by the Executive Council. Is that quite a satisfactory tenure? Supposing that either the Dáil or the Seanad objected to some of these gentlemen or their administration, does that mean that they would have no say as to whether these high and important officials were to remain on discharging their duties or not, if either House were satisfied that these gentlemen were not carrying on their duties properly?  Apparently Clause 7, I think it is of Part 2, makes these officials the appointees of the President for the time being, and removable only by the Ministry.  Will that mean, for instance, that if there was a change of Ministry all these officers would go out, or could go out, and supposing they were carrying out their duties properly and were put out, will they have any right to compensation?  We should know something about the tenure of these officials.  Then, supposing these officers were not satisfactory, I think there ought to be some power other than the mere <i>ipse dixit</i> of the President and of his Cabinet to remove these officials if it were thought that their removal was necessary.  I should like to know more about the conditions of tenure of these gentlemen.  We are told they are to be Civil Servants, who are already accustomed to carrying out this work, and who are proficient in its execution, and certainly from my experience of your public officials in this particular direction I think they are most efficient, and extremely anxious to carry out their duties. At the same time it might well be that a <Col N="353" /> wrong appointment might be made.  That is a question that I think the Seanad ought to devote a little time to.  It is very important.  It means the efficient collection of a very large portion of the revenue of the Irish Government.  I do not know that the time has come when we could ask the Government to tell us who these gentlemen are to be.  Perhaps the time has not come for that.  The appointments should be made very carefully, and should not be made in a hurry.  Inasmuch as this measure has been brought before the Seanad first, and that in some respects we are responsible for its introduction, I think we ought to investigate the matter rather carefully and get full information on these various points from the Minister in charge.  He has told us many things already, but he has not, if he will allow me to say so, gone to the root of the question, and there are a good many details we might have an explanation about.</P>

I would also like to ask the Minister if he can tell us&mdash;he may not be in a position to do so&mdash;who are the three Revenue Commissioners it is proposed to appoint.  There are two Clauses here, No. 13, in Part III., and No. 16, in Part IV., which, I think, introduce rather a dangerous procedure. They have evidently been put in because under the old law the conditions were not the same.  No. 13 reads&mdash;and No. 14 is practically the same wording&mdash;&ldquo;In every case in which any Order, decision, instrument or document is required by law to be signed by, or to be under the hand of two or more Commissioners of Inland Revenue, it shall be sufficient if such order, decision, instrument or document is signed by one Revenue Commissioner.&rdquo; I think that is putting unnecessary power into the hands of one Commissioner. If the law formerly prescribed <Col N="354" /> two in the matter I think we should be very careful that we do not change that law so as to throw responsibility on a single individual, instead of on two or more.</P>

      <P>It would be well if the position could be made clear as to these Orders.  I am not perfectly clear myself, but I was informed last week that our position in regard to these two Orders was that they were statutory Orders of the Executive Council, to which the approval or assent of both Houses of the Oireachtas had to be obtained before they could become operative, that we had no power to amend, but that we could withhold our assent.  I presume that if such assent were withheld on a specific point the Executive Council would have to make out another Order accordingly.  The Dáil has no power to amend either.</P>

      <P>We desire a resolution passed approving of it, and we will also ask the Dáil to pass a resolution approving of it, so that we can proceed to act upon it, and to have the Revenue Board set up to make the appointments, to make sure the matter will not be upset, and so that we will not have the infinity of trouble which might be caused if we were to act on this Order and if one of the Houses of the Oireachtas were afterwards to upset it.  It is urgent from the point of view of the Ministry of Finance that the machinery provided should be put into operation without any further delay.  The only thing I would like to say is that, as you have spent some time in discussing it, it might be as well to come to a decision rather than postpone it, and, perhaps, get no further on the next discussion.  I have no objection to deferring it until to-morrow, because it has to come before the Dáil, but if the <Col N="356" /> Seanad were to pass it to-day the Dáil, I believe, will pass a resolution approving of it on Tuesday, and we will be able to act upon the Order.  The power of the Seanad is simply the power of annulling this particular Order.  As Senator Douglas has put it, if the Dáil were to refuse on any particular point to agree to the Order, a new Order would have to be made, and the new Order would have to come before the Seanad, so that no right or power the Seanad would have would be prejudiced by adopting it in the first instance.  With regard to the point raised by Senator Guinness as to one signature, the reason that has been given for that is that we have fewer Commissioners, and that at present a large number of documents, such as warrants to collectors and statutory declarations and purely formal documents have to be signed by two Commissioners.  That is described as a troublesome and archaic provision, for which there is no justification, by people who have been closely in touch with revenue work.  In view of the fact that we will have a smaller number of Commissioners, with more diversified work, it is intended that the signature of one Commissioner will serve on certain documents.  The whole Board will act together when dealing with matters of principle; but only one Commissioner will have power of doing formal acts.  I think there is no danger whatever in that, and it will facilitate business to some extent.  As to the tenure of office of these Commissioners, they will be Civil Servants, and will hold Civil Service tenure.  In Great Britain they are appointed by Royal Warrant.  They have no security of tenure other than when any of them might be dispensed with a new Royal Warrant will be required for a successor.  As an alternative to having a Revenue Board, all the business of assessing liability on citizens for taxation would have to be done directly by the Minister for Finance.  In point of fact it could not be done directly by the Minister for Finance.  It would be done by some unnamed and unknown Civil Servant in the name of the Minister. When we have a Board of Commissioners the work will be done by known and named Civil Servants, who will be given a special and responsible position.  It is a protection, from that <Col N="357" /> point of view, for the citizen and the taxpayer. Moreover, it is a protection for the Minister for Finance against appeals from citizens on matters that should not be the subject of such appeals.  It would be improper, for instance, that the Minister should be appealed to by citizens and, perhaps, constituents, to alter their assessment, say, for Income Tax.  The satisfactory way to do that would be by Civil Servants, who would have a special and independent position, who would be allowed to carry on judicially, and whose names would be known.  It is not necessary or desirable to give the Commissioners any greater fixity of tenure than is given by putting them into responsible positions in a public way.  Suppose the Revenue Commissioners were carrying on their work satisfactorily, and any Executive Council dismissed them, such action could not be carried out by stealth.  It would create an outcry, and it is very unlikely that any Executive could expect to do such a thing.  On the other hand, if the Commissioners are not given the same security of tenure that the Accountant and Auditor-General has, and if they are not carrying on their work satisfactorily they can be got rid of. This is an arrangement which corresponds with the arrangement in Great Britain.  It is an entirely satisfactory arrangement and one which I do not think could be improved on.  The Auditor-General is in a very special position. He will exercise his authority over these Commissioners just as he will over every department of the Government.  It is necessary that he should be independent and should have a definite judicial position. It is not desirable that executive officers, whose function has a certain judicial character&mdash;no doubt those who are executive officers will be those on whom the collection of the revenue depends&mdash;should have any greater fixity of tenure than that by which they got the appointment for those very responsible offices.</P>

      <P>This Order seems to be a very drastic one, and I think the Seanad would be well advised to hold it up, at all events for a few days, for consideration. It is an Order which gives great power, first to the Minister for Finance, and secondly to the three Commissioners <Col N="358" /> whom the Minister thinks it well to employ in this capacity.  I do not know what provision, if any, is made for the safety of the taxpayer.  Is there any court of appeal, or have we to go back to the Commissioners who levied the taxes, to get relief?  I would like to have more information about this matter. Who are the Commissioners, and what are they?  Evidently they are put into a very powerful position, and what might not be the very penalising effect they could have on the people of Ireland, the people who are, and the people who are not, subject to taxation?  Very drastic methods have been employed in the past for assessing enormous amounts on poor people, who have been actually prosecuted. I should like that there would be safety, not only for the large taxpayer, but also for the small taxpayer.  They ought to have some court of appeal or some protection from the rashness and anxiety of Civil Service Commissioners who endeavour to take all the money they can out of the pockets of the people.  There should be some court of appeal, and more information should be given us before we could be satisfied to give effect to this Order.</P>

      <P>As regards the question of time, I speak with great diffidence, for I have not seen a copy of the document we are discussing.  Part of it, at any rate, is intimately connected with the business in which I am concerned&mdash;the Customs and Excise Department.  The Minister has stated, and I take it for granted it is quite probable, that the appointments will have to be made. Coming to the question of Customs and Excise, hitherto all the regulations in the Brewing and Distilling business, connected with methods of manufacture and other kinds of things, have been ruled upon by the Commissioners of Customs and Excise.  At the present moment we are in discussion with the Commissioners on such matters connected with the business with which I am concerned.  We have there a board of several individuals intimately acquainted with the whole business in which we are engaged.  Now, I take it that in the desire to effect economy probably only one of the three individuals to be appointed may know anything whatever about our business and our methods of manufacture, and I <Col N="359" /> wonder whether in that desire for economy the Government are quite right. I recognise from the point of view of the Government alone that there are questions, as to revenue and things of that kind, which we may have to discuss, and which may involve considerable sums of money, and it is quite easy to see how one individual may either block, accelerate, or do something that is quite wrong, in the consideration of these matters.  Hence, I think we should have some time to look into this matter.  I know nothing about it except what I have heard here this afternoon, and, personally, I could not give an opinion as to how it would affect the interests with which I am connected.  Before we agree to have the numbers cut down to three, the matter should engage our serious consideration, and for that reason I would like to have more time to look into it.  Some one will have to be appointed to the position, but to give such large powers to one individual is a matter that merits much consideration.</P>

      <P>My reason for suggesting an adjournment until to-morrow was that I understood the Government wanted to have the Bill ready for the Dáil to discuss it next week.  I was trying to meet the Government's convenience.  I formally <Col N="360" /> move now that we adjourn until to-morrow.  If the members of the Seanad are not agreeable to that, we can fix some other day.  There are one or two points the Government might give us some information on when we come to discuss it again.  We understand that these very important officers are going to be appointed practically by Ministerial warrant, and that they will be removable by Ministerial warrant.  That is quite satisfactory because it does not give them fixity of tenure if they fail to carry out their duties properly.</P>

      <P>What I mean is, they would be removable by Executive Order, or whatever the proper name is.  They would be removable, I suppose, by warrant from the Cabinet, or from the head of the Government, so that, at all events, there is that check on the carrying out of their administration.  The Minister also told us that in certain matters one signature would be sufficient, and I quite see his point.  I understand from the Minister that the one signature would only relate to purely formal matters of routine and detail in which no principle was involved.</P>

      <P>That is the point I was trying to come to, that we should get some undertaking from the Government that only in formal matters, in which no question of principle was involved, one signature would be sufficient.  In purely formal matters we might not object to that, but then there is the question of safeguarding the right of appeal of the taxpayers.  That is very germane to the question we are discussing, namely, the right of appeal from the decision of these Commissioners.  What we want to know is, if the ordinary citizen feels himself aggrieved where is he to appeal to, and if there is to be an appeal, and I presume there will, is it going to be a cheap one and one in which the ordinary citizen can have easy access to.  This proposal seems quite simple, but it is very important, and to-morrow or next day the country may wake up and find itself saddled with an administration against which it may kick.  Therefore I say it is hardly fair to ask us to dispose of so important a document as this on the spur of the moment.  We should have some assurance on this question of an appeal, and we should also be assured that those are real appeals within the reach of the ordinary citizen, so that he will be protected and not find himself in the hands of the bureaucracy over which he exercises no control.  We are living in very difficult times and passing very special laws, and how do we know that these laws may not be part of our permanent constitution.  We must go slowly, and whatever liberty remains with us let us be very slow to part with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be very easy to exaggerate the meaning of this particular order.  It leaves the rights of appeal exactly as it was heretofore. If we intend to make any changes in future it will be done by deliberate legislation.  This is an order that provides machinery to carry on. There is practically nothing in it except it sets up one instead of two boards. With regard to the signatures, the power is vested in the whole Board of the Commissioners.  A Commissioner cannot sign unless permitted by the whole Board to sign, but we are removing <Col N="362" /> the legislative bar to a single Commissioner signing certain documents.  That is merely an administrative matter and it concerns the administration and convenience when it is unnecessary that there should be two members signing.  If one signs he must have got immediate or general authority from the whole body of Commissioners to carry out any work. Consequently I think there is no danger at all in that.  In regard to the matter that was raised by Senator Jameson, I think you will never have Commissioners who are technical experts.  The Commissioners who will be dealing with this work will, one or two of them, have as much experience as any Commissioners could have, but you cannot expect the whole body of Commissioners to have technical knowledge on all matters. They will have to rely upon the technical experts.  If you have men dealing with this particular type of business from day to day you would not improve it very greatly by putting on four instead of three.  One may have more knowledge on particular matters than another. Others will be dealing with the problems and will rely on their technical advisers.  You cannot get men who are chemists&mdash;that is, with a particular type of knowledge that would enable them to form their own judgment.  All people engaged in administration have to exercise common sense, and for that particular knowledge they require in dealing with technical problems from day to day to rely upon the opinions of experts.</P>
