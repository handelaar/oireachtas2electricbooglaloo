      <P>Only two amendments have been sent in in writing to the Enforcement of Law (Occasional Powers) Bill as it now stands for the Report Stage.  Others have been handed in since the Orders of the Day were printed.  I take it it will not be necessary for us to go through the Bill Clause by Clause.  Perhaps it would be better if we take the amendments in the order in which they stand as regards the various Clauses.  The first amendment is Senator Moore's.</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;&ldquo;Section 2, Sub-section 4, after the word &lsquo;under-sheriff&rsquo; to insert words, &lsquo;subject to the sanction of the County Court Judge on appeal by the debtor.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reason I propose that, is because it seemed to me that under this Clause the under-sheriff might employ a great number, a whole posse, of people unreasonably, and the debtor would have to pay.  He would have no appeal.  The under-sheriff might do this and the debtor would have to meet the expense, however unreasonable it was.  I propose to leave a certain discretion to the debtor.  If the debtor considers himself unjustly treated and that the expenses put against him are too high, he should be entitled to appeal to the County Court Judge to know whether the sum involved was reasonable or fair.</P>

      <P>I have much pleasure in seconding the amendment.  I think the object of it is perfectly clear.  I am sure it will commend itself to the Seanad. This Clause, I would remind the Seanad, sets a new precedent in regard to civil claims, inasmuch as it institutes in relation <Col N="366" /> to these claims the old <i>posse comitatus.</i>  This is a precedent which is quite unheard of in our legislation so far, and the more this Clause can be guarded the better.  Senator Moore tries to guard it in one respect, and I think he deserves credit for endeavouring to do so.  I support him.</P>

      <P>I think this amendment is really not artistic enough to carry out Senator Moore's object.  I think it should provide for an appeal.  It is put in a curious way.  &ldquo;Subject to the sanction of the County Court Judge on appeal by the debtor,&rdquo; in other words, it rather suggests that in every case the debtor is to appeal.  I would suggest it would be put this way: &ldquo;Provided always that the debtor, if dissatisfied with the amount of expenses incurred, might appeal to the County Court Judge of the County in which the debtor resides, and the decision of the County Court Judge shall be final.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  If I understand its object, it is after the proceedings are completed, and the Sheriff furnishes his bill to the debtor, that the debtor may say to him: &ldquo;It was quite unnecessary for you to put me to such expense by employing such a large number of assistants.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>No.  That was why I considered the amendment was not artistic, and it will be necessary to alter it, if Senator Moore will pardon me for saying so.  It is not easy for laymen to appreciate those nice legal points, but I want to assist as far as possible.</P>

      <P>Probably when the Bill goes back to the Dáil, if the members there accept the spirit of <Col N="367" /> the amendment they will put it into a shape which according to them will coincide with the Bill and at the same time carry out their purpose.  I would suggest this alteration: &ldquo;Provided that the debtor, if dissatisfied with the amount of the expense incurred, may appeal to the County Court Judge, whose decision shall be final.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;&ldquo;Section 3.  To add at end of the Section the words &ldquo;Provided that no Sheriff, Under-Sheriff, Bailiff, or any other person employed under Section 2 (1) of this Act, shall make any entry or seizure under this Act, except between the hours of sunrise and sunset.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know that it is necessary for me to elaborate the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I unintentionally misled you in regard to this, because I stated offhand that my recollection was, in the case of these ordinary seizures, they could only be effected between sunrise and sunset.  I was wrong in that.  That applies, I think, only to distress.  The ordinary writ of <i>habere</i> can be executed by the Sheriff at any time except on Sundays. This amendment would limit the ordinary law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes my case all the stronger, and it makes it easier at all events for the Seanad to agree with me.  We know quite well the times we are living in.  We know what is happening to people's houses throughout the country, and we are giving a very dangerous opportunity to people who are not Sheriff's officers, but who may represent themselves as Sheriff's officers, to break into houses, loot and do other abominable things, unless we safeguard, as far as we can, the liberty or the sacredness of the domicile.  I think the Seanad will be doing a good thing if they make their views on this matter perfectly clear, however the ordinary law may be affected.  Whatever the rights the Sheriff may have under the ordinary law, he has no right to break into anybody's house under this Act except between the hours of sunrise and sunset, <Col N="368" /> so that there should be no mistake.  It is quite conceivable somebody may come and try to break into a house in the dark, claiming to be a Sheriff's officer. The individual whose house is broken into, if he could resist would.  It might be the Sheriff, and, if it were, then this individual would be liable to very serious penalties.  I think it is much better to prevent the possibility of any such occurrence, and with that view I move the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second that amendment.  It is only a temporary Bill to deal with the circumstances under which we are living now.  These circumstances are such as Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde has just described, and they are, that at any moment people may come to your house, knock at the door and seek admission.  I, for one, would not open my doors to anyone now at night; that is, when I can help it. The other night people came to my house and tried to get in.  I did not know who they were, and when I asked them to tell me they would not answer. The result was I did not let them in. They may have been detectives for all I know, but when they would not answer and tell who they were I did not let them in.  Later on a whole <i>posse</i> of people came to the house.  They were dressed as soldiers, but still I objected to let them in.  When questioned, they said they were soldiers, but, as we had no means of knowing whether they were soldiers or not, we did not let them in. There was one man in the party dressed as a policeman.  Someone struck a match and held it up to the policeman's head, apparently with the object of showing that he was a bona fide policeman.  Still, we had no means of knowing he was a policeman.  We do not know to this day whether they were soldiers or not; but that is the sort of thing that may happen, and I think this is no time to invest Sheriffs or anyone else with authority to break into houses at all hours of the night.  It would be quite a different thing to give such power in peace times. This amendment only applies to the present circumstances, and therefore I have much pleasure in seconding it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. ANDREW JAMESON Mr. ANDREW JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANDREW JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I could gather from the speeches of Sir Thomas Esmonde and Colonel Moore the <Col N="369" /> amendment was put forward with the plea of meeting the dangers of the present times.  The Bill is also put forward by the Government to enable them to deal with the dangers of the times, and if the Seanad choses to rule that a sheriff cannot go, during the night hours, into a house they are going certainly against the opinion of the Government, which has laid it down that it is a necessary authority for the Sheriff to enable him to carry out the law.  As far as one knows of the breaking into houses at night, I have not yet heard that those who do break in, stop to consider whether they go in as Sheriffs or, in fact, how they go in.  They go in quite regardless of the circumstances, and then why should we put restrictions on Sheriffs which those who break into houses do not consider?  I do not think it is at all wise to put such an emphatic restriction on the action of the Sheriff which the Government, by putting it into the Bill, have clearly declared they consider a necessary power for the Sheriff to enable him to deal with the situation at the present moment, and for the next few months.  Therefore, we merely have a difference of opinion between the two Senators who have moved this amendment and the Government. The difference of opinion amounts to this: Is it, or is it not, a power which the Sheriff ought to have?  The Government tell us they consider the power necessary, and that the Sheriff ought to have it.  I am inclined to agree with that view, and I think the Seanad ought to consider the matter very carefully before they proceed, under these circumstances, to vote against what is practically a decision of the Government.</P>

      <P>I beg to support the view expressed by Senator Jameson.  The Seanad should remember that the entering into an open house for the purpose of making a seizure is not a breaking in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. THOMAS FARREN Mr. THOMAS FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the amendment.  I could quite understand the objections that have been raised to the amendment if the question at issue concerned arrests or anything like that, but here we are dealing with the seizure of goods or other property.  These are things that cannot go on the run.  There is nothing in the world, in my opinion, to <Col N="370" /> prevent the Sheriff making the necessary seizures between the times specified in the amendment.  As the proposer and seconder of the amendment put it, we are living in very dangerous times, and I think it is not fair to give permission to the Sheriff&mdash;though I do not say the Sheriffs would use the power unduly if it were given&mdash;to break into a house at any hour of the day or night.  We ought to safeguard the rights of the people, and not give any such power to the Sheriff. The people of the country are suffering enough at the present time without adding to their troubles, and I do not think any benefit would be gained by giving the Sheriffs the powers proposed.  With all respect to the statement made by Senator Jameson, I hold that in virtue of our position here we are entitled to offer our criticisms of any measure that is put before us.  That is the function of this Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, and the only argument put forward by Senator Jameson is that the Government say they want this power.  We are here to help the Government to carry out their arduous work to the best of our ability, but surely when we offer criticism of a Bill, and make suggestions that in our opinion would be helpful, we are not doing an injury to the Government.  I believe it was in that spirit the amendment was put down, and personally I am in favour of it, because I think any seizure required by the Sheriff can be made during the hours mentioned in the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kevin O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not attach particular importance to the amendment, but it is as well that we should understand clearly just what is and what is not involved.  The Senator who spoke last was under a slight misapprehension. The existing law does not permit of seizures or distraints except between the hours of sunrise and sunset.  It does permit of entry on a writ of <i>habere</i> of the High Court or a decree for possession of the County Court.  That is the position as it stands.  This amendment would restrict the existing law, the law as it stood before this Bill was introduced, and would say that a Sheriff <Col N="371" /> could not obtain entry on a writ of <i>habere</i> except between the hours of sunrise and sunset.  I doubt the wisdom of the amendment.  It is occasionally the only way in which a Sheriff can obtain peaceful entry.  If we had statistics I think we would find that the number of cases in which a Sheriff effected entry except between the hours of sunrise and sunset would be very few indeed.  It is not a thing the Sheriff would do as a matter of routine, and in the ordinary way, but if you pass this amendment to say definitely that he must enter only between the hours of sunrise and sunset, no matter what the circumstances are, you debar him from entering otherwise than between these hours.  There is not here a question of entering a man's house by night and ransacking it, making seizures.  There is no question of making seizures.  Distraint can only be carried out between the hours mentioned in the amendment. It is a question of obtaining entry and it might very well happen that the best time to obtain peaceable entry would be after sunset.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what he is to go into the house for at all if he is not going to seize.  That seems to me rather an extraordinary statement. He is to get admittance to the house for no purpose at all according to what the Minister states.  This is as far as I understand him.  I may be mistaken. It seems to me that in these times Senator Jameson's statement that because the Government have made this proposal we should accept it, is the entire basis of argument from some Senators whenever anything is proposed. The Government put certain proposals before the Dáil.  They draw them up as best they can; but then during discussion in the Dáil, or in any other place, amendments are proposed and properly considered and the Government sometimes change, if they think wise to change, and sometimes they do not.  I do not see why we should be prevented from making any amendment.  I quite agree with what the Government does in general in this as I think these are times when we do require strong measures. This is only a matter of a certain technicality which may or may not be approved. <Col N="372" /> I am suggesting this as one little item which can by a change of words improve the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. J.T. O'FARRELL Mr. J.T. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>From my point of view this amendment is necessary in view of the fact that the existing law has been encroached upon to a very considerable extent by the present Bill and, consequently, it is necessary that some improvements should be made in the existing law with the object of protecting the individual citizen in his home.  It is not the Sheriff or the Sheriff's bailiffs that we are so much afraid of as people who will represent themselves as these people.  The Minister has admitted that in the natural course of things entry by night will very rarely be necessary and consequently the obstruction, or alleged obstruction, caused by the passing of this amendment will be of a very negligible character. Everybody will agree, particularly now as the matter has been raised and it is public knowledge that a Sheriff or his bailiffs can make an entry at any time or demand admission in pursuance of the provisions of this Bill, that a lot of people throughout the country may take advantage of the fact and demand admission to any house; because it must be remembered that admission can be demanded into the house of a person who is not a judgment debtor at all. That is one of the very serious aspects of the situation and one which could be relieved to a certain extent by the adoption of this amendment.  I entirely concur with what has been said in regard to certain arguments that are advanced here from time to time and which have been adduced again in regard to this amendment.  The best argument and the only argument that some Senators seem to have is that the Government say &ldquo;this is the position and this is what should be done,&rdquo; and that consequently we have nothing to do except to adopt that.  Personally, I should be very sorry for the prestige or the usefulness of this Seanad if they are to turn themselves merely into a sort of tailors' dummies to come here and act as a registering machine for whatever is done in the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. MacLOUGHLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The only argument which appeals to me is that this has been the existing law and there <Col N="373" /> have been no reasons advanced by any of the Senators in support of the amendment to change it.  They have simply raised bogies that there is nothing in. None of us has ever heard of any abuses under the existing law, and we think that this amendment will not bring out any now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>My view about this business is that the existing law is bad.  I think that is perfectly clear, and that it ought to be changed.  This is not the time to change it, but this is an exceptional Bill, and we think that is all the more reason why what is bad in the existing law should be changed in this exceptional, and I am glad to think, transitory Bill. We are not desirous of impeding the Government in their administration in any way.  Goodness knows they have difficulties <Col N="374" /> enough, and we have already shown over and over again that we are anxious to help them in every way we can.  But we as a Seanad have certain duties, I will not say rights, and what position would we stand in in the eyes of the country if when we have strong opinions about things of this sort we do not express them.  I am not moving this amendment in any spirit of opposition to the Government.  I am much obliged to the Minister for Home Affairs for his attendance here, but I will ask the Seanad to vote for the amendment.  If the Government think well they can change it. If they examine the question they will find that instead of this being a hindrance to them it will be a help.  It will do something, at all events, to remove misunderstandings and to obviate the dangers which are sure to arise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was prompted to put down this amendment by the feeling that what was really a trivial matter might be lost sight of in the consideration of the graver and more material matters in the Bill before us.  It strikes me that the claims of the judgment creditors have been very fully considered, and all their rights and aspirations, I might say, fully conceded, whereas small solatium given to the judgment debtor was glossed over very slightly.  We were told by the Minister in charge of the Bill here that there were rival proposals even in the Dáil, and a compromise was agreed to.  The effect of the rival proposal was, I take it, the common <Col N="375" /> system of barter at fairs.  &ldquo;Will we give this poor fellow £5 or £15?&rdquo; They cut it, and they gave him £10.  This little sum was intended as an act of clemency, intended, I take it further, to be the sole provision of this unfortunate debtor for his future, because your machinery has been made as adequate and as full as it can be to secure all the just claims of the creditor, and the poor debtor has been cast aside with £10 to provide aid for the future.  We must assume that the machinery of the law is sufficient to secure that.  There is nothing else in the world to protect him but that miserable £10. But what will £10 secure for him?  I take it it is meant this man and his family should have a bed whereon to lie.  But, having the bed, he should have the machinery to carry on his trade.  I submit that the sum of £10 is quite inadequate.  I submit that the sum of £15 is equally inadequate, but as it was, in the wisdom of somebody in the Dáil, considered to be a sufficient sum to give this unfortunate debtor to protect him against the cold and hunger and to prevent him from going on the rates in the future, I submit that the sum of £15 should be substituted, and the sum of £10 deleted.  I think in such a time as this, when we are beginning to lay the foundations of a State, so to speak, that clemency is a very valuable attribute, and I think that this sum of £15 ought to be substituted.  It is a temporary measure, but we know that precedents are taken advantage of on future occasions, and I think the substitution of £15 will make for improvement in the Bill, and make the position of the debtor nearer to what it should be in a case of great duress.</P>

      <P>We had this under discussion the last day, and I think it was understood that Mr. Blythe said the Government would give favourable consideration to the alternative figure of £15.  It was pointed out clearly on the last occasion that the sum mentioned in the Bill would not be sufficient to allow a person to get a decent start in life, and we were taking into consideration the honest debtor, and that he should <Col N="376" /> get a fair chance.  The Minister undertook that the Government would reconsider the provision, and I should be glad to hear what the Minister has to say.</P>

The allowance specified, £10, is very moderate, and in fact the amount would not represent £5 pre-war value, and would not by any means purchase even bedding or a set of tools for a workingman.  I think this is a very reasonable amendment indeed, and that it ought to be accepted without further discussion.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister in charge for a clear definition.  There is some doubt as to what is the meaning of the words exceeding &ldquo;in the whole.&rdquo;  Does that mean that if a debtor has no more than £15 worth of implements of his trade, bedding and wearing apparel, then he will be immune from seizure, or does it mean that if he has £30 worth that the bailiff or bailiff's man may at his discretion sell down to £15 or £10 the tools, bedding or anything else?  The words &ldquo;in the whole&rdquo; would simply imply that it is only intended to apply to a man who would have in value wearing apparel and tools not exceeding £15 or £10, as the case may be.  I want to know from the Minister in charge here if the man has £30 worth can the bailiff sell down to £15 and select at his will whether he will sell the tools, bedding or wearing apparel.</P>

      <P>I understand that Mr. Blythe gave an undertaking here on the Committee Stage that this question of the amount would be considered.  It has been considered, and the result of such consideration is that I have a slight preference for the lower sum.  Like the previous amendment, it is not a matter of vital importance, but I have that slight preference for the lower sum, and I have it because <Col N="377" /> I know that in practice it is not going to be a matter of getting down to the exact amount of value, but simply a matter of approximation, and that £15 left to stand there on the Bill as the amount would in practice mean £20 or £25, just as the £10 in practice will mean £15 or £20.  Now, Senator Kenny's point about not exceeding in the whole the value of so much, I take it that simply means that when it arises that the total property left to the judgment debtor will be the amount stated in the Bill, whatever decision is come to ultimately on the matter.  There has been talk of honest and dishonest debtors. Well, no Government and no agent of the Government possesses any talisman which will show him who is honest and who is a dishonest debtor. There are dishonest people who pay their debts, and <i>vice versa</i>, but it is simply a question as to who is the man who cannot pay, and the man who cannot pay his debt is the man who has nothing that he can sell to enable him to pay his debt.</P>

They are: &ldquo;Whereas it is expedient to protect the tools and actual necessaries belonging to judgment debtors, be it enacted that under any judgment decree or order the wearing apparel, bedding, tools or imple- of his trade are to be exempt, provided that the value of such apparel, bedding, tools or implements do not exceed in the whole the value of £5.&rdquo;  In other words, the maximum allowance in respect of these things as fixed by the existing Act is £5, irrespective of the amount and position of the debtor. Obviously, of course, it was intended to protect only the very poorest class of debtors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move in Section 6, Sub-section (1), to substitute the figure &ldquo;48&rdquo; in lieu of the figure &ldquo;24.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We discussed this matter previously during the last debate on the question, and it was put aside for discussion later on.  The reason I propose this amendment is that under Section 4 the under-sheriff is bound to give the debtor a list of the articles that have been seized within 48 hours.  Well, under Section 6 he is entitled to sell them within 24 hours, so that it is a very small consolation for the man whose property is being sold at the end of 24 hours to be given at the end of 48 hours a list of the things that have been sold.  It seems to me very clear that if this Section 4 is of any use whatsoever the list should be given to him before the articles are actually sold.  I moved formally to reduce the &ldquo;48&rdquo; to &ldquo;24,&rdquo; but it was left at 48, and now I propose that in Section 6 &ldquo;24&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;48&rdquo; in order that the two times should coincide, that the man should get, before his property is sold, a list of the articles to be sold.  It seems to me to be a matter of commonsense.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the amendment.  I am not quite clear as to what my friend wants, but I know that Section 4 is a most dangerous provision.  The sub-sheriff or his officer has to give you a list of things that are seized upon, and he has to do this within 48 hours.  If this protection is to be of any use whatever this list should be made out upon the spot at the time, or before, and should be approved by the person whose goods are seized.  Clause 4 having practically been agreed to, I do not know that my friend would do much good by his proposal, but in the hope that he may I beg to second it.</P>

      <P>I cannot reconcile the attitude of the proposer of this amendment with his desire to maintain the principles of this Bill.  I take it this is an emergency measure, where speed of action is essential to the effective carrying out of the intentions of the Sheriff, and that if they give 48 hours notice before action can be taken to sell, there is <Col N="380" /> time for evilly disposed people to collect, and perhaps materially embarrass the purpose for which the Bill is intended. As regards the comparison between Sections 4 and 6, I do not see how it can be sustained on the plain reading of these two sections.  The inventory has to be made within 24 hours.  The maximum period is 48 hours, according to the section, but if the goods are sold before 48 hours the inventory can be made within 24 hours, in which case it is the maximum period.  But it does not mean that action in other cases cannot be taken within the shorter period.  Therefore the amendment should be rejected, because it impairs the essential principle that this Bill, which we have accepted in general terms, is intended to carry out.</P>

      <P>The proposed amendment does not indicate how to attain the object which the mover professes to have in view.  He said that it was desirable that before any sale takes place the owner of the goods should have the itemised inventory.  The amendment that has been moved only secures that simultaneously with the sale he would receive the itemised inventory, and his position would not be substantially improved thereby.  Within 48 hours of the seizure Section 4 provides that he must have received from the under-sheriff an itemised inventory of the chattels seized. It is proposed that Section 6 shall read: &ldquo;That the under-sheriff shall have power to sell such goods, animals, or other chattels at any time after the expiration of a period of 48 hours.&rdquo;  It is not desirable to bind the under-sheriff to keep seized chattels or live stock on his hands longer than is absolutely necessary.  A seizure might take place in the country on a Wednesday afternoon.  There might be a market in Dublin on the following day, at which it would be desirable to sell the live stock, if it be live stock that is seized.  If you bind the under-sheriff to keep seized property on his hands for more than 24 hours, and keep them for, say, 48 hours, then you add to the difficulties and embarrassments of the situation. This Bill was brought in to obviate certain difficulties and embarrassments.</P>

      <P>If I had had an opportunity I should have preferred reducing <Col N="381" /> the 48 hours to 24 hours.  For one reason or another I did not get that opportunity.  In my opinion what the Minister has stated just now is not quite accurate.  According to Clause 4 there must be a list supplied before 48 hours, and, in fact, as soon as possible.  The utmost limit given is 48 hours.  That limit was pleaded for because the under-sheriff might be in a hurry, and a proper list might not be made out.  I think the 24 hours is unreasonable.</P>

      <P>In that connection I have received from the Minister for Local Government a Memorandum setting out certain undertakings which he thought it advisable to give here on the Committee Stage.  The Memorandum is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the Committee Stage of the Enforcement of Law (Occasional Powers) Bill I undertook to bring to your notice the following suggested amendments for consideration:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Clause 2, Section 5.  To alter the Section so as to include writs of attachment and other writs as well as writs of <i>habere</i> and of <i>fieri facias.</i></P>
      <P>&ldquo;Clause 5.  To alter the value of goods exempt from seizure from £10 to £15.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Clause 6.  To add after the words &lsquo;to sell&rsquo; the words &lsquo;in market overt&rsquo; or &lsquo;by public auction,&rsquo; or other words which would make it clear that the goods would not be disposed of by private sale.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have amendments here more or less in compliance with the undertakings which the Minister for Local Government gave on my behalf.  There is an amendment to Section 6, Sub-section 1, and it is to insert after the word &ldquo;sell&rdquo; the words &ldquo;by public auction.&rdquo;  There is another amendment in Sub-section 1 to delete the words &ldquo;to publish any advertisement or public announcement of a sale of any such goods, animals or other <Col N="382" /> chattels.&rdquo;  The Sub-section would then read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be lawful for any Under-Sheriff who shall after the passing of this Act take any goods, animals or other chattels in execution under a writ of <i>fieri facias</i> or under a decree of a Civil Bill Court to sell by public auction such goods, animals or other chattels at any time after the expiration of a period of twenty-four hours after he shall have taken the same in execution, but so that he shall not allow any unreasonable delay to occur; and it shall not be necessary for the Under-Sheriff to publish or announce that any such sale is a sale by an Under-Sheriff or is a sale of goods, animals or chattels taken in execution.&rdquo;</P>

You have got to remember, as the Act contemplates, that the Sheriff will be a man of responsibility who will act intelligently, but, even if he does not act intelligently, I suggest to the Seanad that the only effect of this amendment will be to open the door to a most vexatious kind of litigation.  How will a judge or jury&mdash;I do not know which it will be&mdash;be satisfied whether in a given set of circumstances, in which the Sheriff himself alone has discretion and knowledge, the Sheriff has acted reasonably or not.  I suggest that the words themselves fail, from the legal point of view, from their vagueness, and that in practice they would not effect any other purpose but to encourage some litigious persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the following amendment to Section 10. After the word &ldquo;in&rdquo; add &ldquo;provided always that in accordance with the letter and spirit of Article 7 of the Constitution no inhabited dwelling of any person other than the judgment debtor shall be forcibly entered by any sheriff or other officer appointed under this Act except in so far as the same may be allowed by the existing law.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, in view of the wording of the Constitution, this amendment is necessary. In fact, I have adopted the wording of the Constitution, that a man's house is, to a certain extent, sacred.  I <Col N="384" /> am excluding from this amendment the house of the judgment debtor.  I admit that the house of the debtor himself must be entered, but I am only dealing in this particular amendment with the house that is next door to his, or somewhere else, because in the law, as it stands, the sheriff may break into any house he chooses to go into, whether it is the debtor's house or any other house. But if he does not find any property belonging to the debtor on the premises of other parties, then he becomes liable to an action, whereas if he does not find any on the debtor's lands he is not liable.  If he goes into a strange house, or into the house of some other party, and by chance finds some of the debtor's property, he is entitled to seize and sell it, but if he goes into someone else's house and finds nothing there, then he has to stand the chance of a law suit in that case.  In this amendment I am not trying to alter the whole of the clause; I am not making any objection to the Sheriff going into any field he likes, whether the debtor's or anyone else's, nor am I objecting to his going into various premises and out-offices of people who are not debtors at all.  I am only limiting it absolutely to the case of the dwelling house of the non-debtor, the man with whom he has nothing to do.  If the sheriff breaks into the house of a person he has nothing to do with, and finds nothing there, then he must take the consequences of the law.  The amendment is very limited, but in drafting it I have followed the wording of the Constitution.  The Constitution says practically that a man's house is his castle.  In this case I am not trying to maintain that a debtor's house is his castle, but that the house of a person who is not a debtor at all is his castle, and that it ought not to be broken into merely for the purpose of looking for somebody else's property.  In these times especially breaking into a house is a very serious matter, and it ought to be guarded, I think, in every possible way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The law as it stands contains an anomaly in a sense, because it provides that while a judgment debtor's house is his castle, and cannot be broken into, entry must be obtained in the orthodox, conventional way.  The house of a third party is not his castle, if goods of a judgment debtor are, in fact, found therein.  In other words, the under-sheriff may take the risk of breaking in, and the question of justification for that depends on whether he finds there goods the property of the judgment debtor.  That is the existing law, I think, and there is just that anomaly, that, while he cannot obtain entry by violence into the house of the judgment debtor, he can obtain entry into the house of the third party, and he will be justified and immune from action if he finds there goods belonging to the judgment debtor.  Now, that is the law as it stands.  The proposed modification contained in this Bill is that the judgment debtor's house should be no longer his castle to the extent that entry may not be obtained otherwise than by knocking at the hall door; that the under-sheriff shall be entitled to break and enter the house of the judgment debtor, and also the house of the third party, provided, either that he finds there goods belonging to the judgment debtor, or, a second alternative, is able to show reasonable grounds for the belief he had that there were goods of the judgment debtor there. It simply adds one more proviso to the existing law, that he can break and enter, and will be justified if he finds there goods belonging to the judgment debtor. We propose to say now that he can break and enter, and will be justified: (<i>a</i>) if he finds there goods the property of the judgment debtor; or, (<i>b</i>) if he can show reasonable grounds for a belief that there were goods belonging to the judgment debtor there.  That is the proposal. Senator Moore proposes an amendment to the Bill which throws us back on the existing law, and says that while the under-sheriff may take his risk, the only justification would be if he found in the house of the third party goods the property of the judgment debtor.  In practice that would mean that an under-sheriff would never take any such risk. The words &ldquo;break into&rdquo; in connection with the house, imply really more violence <Col N="386" /> than is in fact the case.  It is not proposed that the under-sheriff should obtain entry by means of a land mine. It is a technical term, because any mode of entry to a house, except by the conventional process of knocking at the door and being admitted, is called breaking and entering.  Senators ought not to allow their minds to be unduly swayed by the word used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry the Minister could not give a more sympathetic reception to the idea contained in this amendment. Clause 10, no doubt, is an extremely dangerous Clause and I think that really the proper amendment would be to omit all the words after the word &ldquo;provided&rdquo; in line 27, because just look at the licence you are giving to the Sheriff's Officer.  It is not as if this Act were going to be administered by the old Sheriff's officers, who knew the neighbourhood and all the people and probably as much about their secrets as they did themselves.  You are going to appoint now all sorts and conditions of men.  You are going to use the <i>posse comitatus</i> for carrying out this particular Act and you may have all kinds of people employed as deputy Sheriffs.  It is quite conceivable that some of these people may not be very squeamish as to what course they adopt or as to what information they act upon.  I think it is extremely dangerous to give to anybody, even one of the old Sheriffs, the opportunity of breaking into a man's house on the plea that he has reasonable suspicion that there are goods in that house belonging to somebody against whom somebody else has obtained a decree.  Reasonable suspicion in this country opens a very wide vista.  It might be conceivable that somebody's enemy might lodge information with the Sheriff against him&mdash;false information &mdash;and on the strength of that proceeding his house would be broken into on the plea that he was harbouring goods belonging to somebody else.  I know that these times are very difficult and I know that the position of the Government is a very difficult one, but, after all, we are doing such amazing things in this Act, such extraordinary things, that I am quite <Col N="387" /> certain if the Seanad understood what they are doing by part of this Act they would not pass it at all.  It is a most shocking Act in one sense according to our old-fashioned ideas as to constitutional liberty.  I know the Act is only for six months, but all the same I do not like it.  I think something ought to be done in this respect and I ask the Government, not in any hostile sense, to consider this point if there is to be any further stage of this Bill in the Dáil. Otherwise I think the Government will be wise in allowing us to knock out the whole of Clause 10 from the word &ldquo;provided&rdquo; in line 27.  I think the powers you give these Sheriffs and deputy Sheriffs are much too dangerous.</P>

Under the law as it at present stands the Sheriff can enter a third party's house taking his risk if no goods of the debtor are found there, and the Senator does not ask to interfere with that state of the law.

      <P>I should like to say, if Senator Barrington will allow me, that I think his amendment to this section is quite unnecessary, because under the existing law persons who are placed in the position of those to whom he refers are entitled to do what is called interplea, that is to say, they inform the Sheriff by notice that the goods he has seized claiming them to be the debtor's are not the debtor's but belong to them.  I do not think that Senator Barrington proposes that the Sheriff should have a discussion on the spot with the claimants.  I think he only means to give the claimants a legal remedy.

      <P>I should like to ask the President if he can give us the names of the proposed Revenue Commissioners, and also is it a fact that a British Civil Servant, who did not opt for service in Irish Free State prior to 6th December, 1922, has been invited to accept an appointment on the Board, and if this is to be a precedent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>As soon as the Order has received the approval of both Houses the personnel of the Revenue Board will be announced, and I am not at present prepared to anticipate that announcement. I must point out that the Order merely creates machinery for the administration of revenue.  I may, however, say that the Government has in mind for appointment as Commissioners three Civil Servants who are highly experienced in Revenue matters, and who, in the opinion of the Government, are the best qualified officers available for appointment. Two of the Commissioners proposed have served in London, one in the Inland Revenue Department, and one in the Customs and Excise Department. In neither case did opting for the Free State arise, as there was <Col N="390" /> no vacancy in their grade in the Free State requiring to be filled.  I am advised that these officers hold better qualifications for appointment than any others in the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>The only question that is not answered is, is it to be a precedent that those who have not opted within the prescribed period can be brought into the Irish Free State?</P>

      <P>I think he should be kept within very strict limits. What I was pointing out to Senator Moore is that the President has already by anticipation answered this question, because he has pointed out that this consideration about these gentlemen opting did not arise, and could not have arisen having regard to the position they occupied.

      <P>I think as the Minister for Home Affairs is here we will take this Revenue Commissioners Order, 1923.  If you remember that was on a former occasion fully discussed, but the question was reserved as to whether the names of the gentlemen who were going to be the Commissioners would be announced.  That has been dealt with now by the President. I do not know whether any Senator wishes to speak on that.  The question now is that the Seanad approves of this Order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word or two on the subject.  We discussed this question the other day, and we discussed it not very intelligently, because the notice was very short and we did not exactly know what the situation was. <Col N="391" /> We agreed to one of those resolutions, but we held up the other one for the purpose of getting some further information. We have heard an announcement from the President as to who those very important officials are to be. And as I understand his statement I think we have every reason to believe, and to be satisfied, that the Government will succeed in obtaining the services of the best men available.  That apparently is the situation, and that certainly is very satisfactory to the Seanad.  But we must remember that in agreeing to this resolution we are now setting up one of the most important administrative portions of our machinery, and that those Commissioners of Revenue, or whatever they are going to be called, touch every single tax-payer of this country in his tenderest point.  These are the gentlemen who will have control, I understand, of the taxation of the country, both revenue and excise.  At all events, they will be the authorities in the matter of assessments and so forth as far as the taxpayers are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I would like to be quite clear about is&mdash;is there to be any appeal to anybody from the decisions of those gentlemen?  And, if so, what is the nature of that appeal to be?  And is the appeal to be so arranged that it will be within the reach of the ordinary citizen?  Because we know quite well in these matters of administration the ordinary citizen knows nothing whatever about his rights.  He is busily engaged in the ordinary business of life, and he has not time very often to inquire into the <i>minutiae</i> of office, nor has he time to take note of dates and things of that sort.  Therefore, we are asked to pass this Order or Warrant, or whatever it may be called.  But we do not quite understand it.  We do not understand how far it goes and what exactly it means.  It is based, I take it, upon English practice and English arrangements.  I have listened to very many Budget speeches and taken part in discussions on the framing of Budgets on the other side, and I have always thought that, however good their machinery was, it was not certainly applicable to Ireland; and that, whatever arrangements were made for the collection of taxes on the other side, they are not the sort of arrangements <Col N="392" /> that would be agreed to readily if this country had a Government of its own.  What I would suggest to the Ministry is this: could they not have some sort of enquiry into the whole system of the collection of taxes in this country?  and could they not see whether in some respects the machinery could not be simplified or could not be amended so as to enable the taxpayer in this country to understand more clearly what his liabilities were?  and also whether the claims upon him could not be made more in accordance with the fiscal or financial or commercial or agricultural system of this country?  I hope that if we agree to this Resolution we are not stereotyping the system that has prevailed with us so far.  We are anxious to assist the President and his Government in agreeing to this Warrant of theirs, and I hope that they will bear the question seriously in mind and investigate the entire system of taxation in this country, with a view to making the operation of the taxing machinery more in accordance with the feelings and interests of this country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of appeal, I should like to be given some information, and possibly the President may be able to give it.  I do not want in any way to hamper him or the Government in the carrying out of the administration in this respect.  I do welcome one proposal they make, that is to amalgamate the two Commissions, as thereby we shall have a fewer number of officials, and our administration will be less expensive.  No matter what Government you have, and no matter what party they belong to, the foundation of that Government is their fiscal policy. I have often thought that the entire fiscal administration of this country should be reorganised, amended and improved, and made more in accordance with Irish feelings and needs.  I hope the President, if we agree to give him his Warrant to-day, will give us some undertaking that this matter will not escape his attention, and will receive the serious and prompt attention of the Government he represents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ANDREW JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>We adjourned the consideration of this Order until to-day because some of us could not understand it.  We did not really <Col N="393" /> know the inward meaning of it, and it shows us, I think, where, in matters coming before the Seanad, we somehow or other want somebody to look into them before they are considered, because placed in our hands as it was, merely allowed us time to read the order and the references in it to a large number of Acts.  It was totally impossible for any of us to see what was really meant. Now I have had time to look into it since.  As far as one can judge there are only two or three things that alter the practice, and alter it considerably from what it has been in the past.  I take it for granted that all the whereases on the first page refers to the various Acts that are continued, as for instance in the Income Tax Act of 1918, Sections 57 and 58, as to the General Commissioners, and 67 as to the Special Commissioners, will apply, and that other persons who, according to that Act, may be appointed to assist and act with the Commissioners of Inland Revenue as Special Commissioners, will also apply the powers given to the Special Commissioners of Income Tax by that, making them the persons to whom people who are aggrieved as regards income tax can appeal, and the power is given to associate certain other individuals with them.  The Supervisor, or whoever the leading official of the Income Tax Department is, makes the claim on the individual.  It is through these Special Commissioners that the individual can appeal as against that, and there have been several cases, I believe, where the Commissioners acting as a Court of Appeal have given a decision against which the taxing authorities have appealed, and have gone to the High Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I am not at all sure, and I doubt if any of us reading this could be clear that all those privileges which are given to the taxpayer by the special Income Tax Act of 1918, are given to them as clearly in this country when this Order is passed.  Again, when we come to the Revenue Commissioners, this is under Clause 7, you will see that they are removable only by the Executive Council.  Now, the Commissioners in Great Britain, who have acted hitherto for the United Kingdom, are appointed, I believe, under the authority of <Col N="394" /> the King's pleasure, and they can only be dismissed for some breach of their duty.  If they are placed under the control of the Executive Council, and if you follow into Part 3, there are various sections of the Inland Revenue Act of 1890 which do not apply to the Revenue Commissioners. I believe, as far as one can see from reading it, that that practically amounts to making the Revenue Commissioners officers who practically go in and out of office with the Government of the day.  I may be wrong, but as far as one can read it it seems to be so, and I doubt if this is a wise provision that officers of that high standing dealing with these matters should have this disability applied to them.  Of course, if they have under the Order which we are now asked to pass just as good a standing as they have in the United Kingdom, which means that when appointed at the pleasure of the King only a breach of duty can put them out, then I am answered. But as far as I can read this Act their status is entirely altered.</P>
    <P>The point I said something on the last day about, that is, as to two or three Commissioners is, I believe, a technical thing, and there is not a great deal in it.  I think the answer that was given by the Minister that day, that that signature would only be given on the advice of his departmental officers, was quite correct, and I really do not think there is very much in it. But as to the question of the standing of these Commissioners, there is another point, which, I think, probably arises from the fact that we have really no Treasury Department in Southern Ireland at present, because this Order takes the Commissioners from under the control of the Treasury and hands them over entirely to the Finance Minister.  Now, that is a very considerable departure, but I believe it may be necessary, because there is not a properly constituted Treasury or Treasury Commissioners at present in Southern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite right, the Free State.  If the present regulations of placing these Commissioners entirely at the disposal of the Finance Minister is a necessity because of the present condition <Col N="395" /> of affairs in the Free State, then one could understand it, but it is not accompanied by any undertaking that they will be put back under the Treasury if the Treasury is established.  There is no mention of any sort in this that we are ever going to have a Treasury and Treasury officials, so that really to my mind this Order requires a discussion, which I doubt very much it can be given unless all these questions are so simple, that I may be wrong in putting them, and that the answers are quite simple.  It seems to me a more complicated thing than we could possibly pass after a few questions had been asked.  I do not know whether I am right or wrong, but if we had some Committee which could have gone into all these technical matters in the Order and quietly discussed them, and then gave their opinion to the Seanad, it would have been far more easily dealt with than by having the Order sent down, which certainly on the face of it has all these defects, and makes it harder for us to make up our minds in a hurry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelODea" hpid="Mr. O'DEA Mr. O'DEA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DEA</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish also to deal with the subject that Senator Jameson has dealt with.  I have no fault to find with the gentlemen I have heard named; neither have I any fault to find with the Finance Minister, but I think it is a mistake for the Finance Minister to take all the responsibility that he will have to take with regard to the direction of these Commissioners.  It is very possible that he might find himself in very needy circumstances, and it is also possible that he would have to give stringent orders to his Commissioners to turn on their big guns and get in a large amount of taxes.  I myself and some others here know that business at present is in a very rickety condition in this country, and never in my experience, which I am sorry to say extends over a very long time, have I known business to be in as bad a state as it is at the present moment in this country, and particularly in the twentysix counties.  Wholesale merchants are not forcing the collection of their accounts, for the simple reason that if they did so it would mean bankruptcy.  We are holding back, but certainly if the Minister for Finance and his Commissioners are going to stampede this country <Col N="396" /> for taxation it will be a very serious matter for the country.  I understand that in a large number of counties income tax is due for the past three years. Now, I do not think that any person in business in this country to-day could possibly afford to pay any more than one year's tax.  I think that to collect three years', or anything approaching three years', would mean general bankruptcy in the country, a condition of things, I assume, that neither the Minister himself nor his Commissioners, nor this Seanad want brought about.  The ordinary course, I believe, under the British Statute was that the British Treasury appointed those Commissioners. They were not appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer; they were appointed or they were suspended by the British Treasury, by the British Parliament. It is proposed to take the appointment of those Commissioners from the Executive Council, which is the substitute we have for an Irish Treasury, to vest the appointment of those Commissioners in the Minister for Finance. Nobody objects to the Minister for Finance at the moment, but we will not always have the same Minister for Finance, and we do not know who we may have.  I do not think myself that it is a prudent thing that he should take all the responsibility that this duty puts upon him of appointing or directing, nominating or suspending these Commissioners.  I think that this duty ought to rest on a broader basis, and the broader the basis the sounder the edi- .  It ought to rest on the Executive Council of the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point raised by Senator Jameson is very important: that when the income tax and other taxes were assessed in Ireland, and when any tax-payer had cause to dissent from the amount of the assessment, he had the option of an appeal.  That appeal was heard by Commissioners known as Special Commissioners, men of the very highest standing in the service.  Usually they were Secretaries of the Ministry. They were drawn not from the lower grade of the Civil Service, but from the very highest, and we all know that in hearing cases these men acted in a most humane manner.  In some instances the British Treasury absolutely appealed against their decisions.  That is the type <Col N="397" /> of men we want, who will hold the balance evenly between the taxpayer and the Treasury.  Therefore, before we let this Order go through, I think we ought to have a very full and a very satisfactory explanation from the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with the last speaker that the appointment, and also the removal, of these very important officials should be carefully safeguarded and if the removal is vested in the Executive Council so also should the appointment, but I am not prepared to go further in the matter of limiting the powers of the Finance Minister.  It has been suggested that we might set up a body somewhat analogous to the British Treasury.  The British Treasury is a thing which has evolved out of very old traditions and out of very old and somewhat out-worn conditions, and I do not believe if they had a clean slate to-morrow in England they would necessarily re-appoint it in its exact present form.  I think there is a great danger and we are missing a great opportunity when we have got a clean slate if we do not start on the most business-like and economical basis. I do not know if many members of the Seanad have had experience of the Treasury, but I have suffered under it on many occasions and I cannot say that in all respects their methods are those which we could usefully, or with economy, copy.  As regards the appeal, I would ask the Minister who replies to reassure the Seanad on that point.  I understand that the existing law, so far as the appeal is concerned, remains, and I understand also in the present case that there is an appeal from the judgment of these Revenue Commissioners, in the form of Special Commissioners of Income Tax, to the County Courts, but no doubt the Minister for Finance will inform us on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the last point that has been mentioned first. There is no restriction of any of the powers or authority or rights of taxpayers interfered with by this Order. We are simply setting up machinery to enable the taxpayers to benefit by any such powers or appeals that they would have had in the present instance if the Saorstát had not been brought into existence. <Col N="398" /> In other words, it may be taken that the rights and privileges and appeals which hitherto prevailed, when the collection of taxation was under the British Government, are kept for the taxpayers if this Order should be passed.  The machinery for appeals is not affected in the least by the Order.  Until the Oireachtas otherwise determines we will have Special Commissioners and the taxpayer will continue to have all the rights of appeal to the Courts, including the right to appeal to the County Court. The Commissioners in England are appointed under a Royal Warrant on the nomination of the Chancellor of the Exchequer; that is my information.  In this case this particular Order was considered and passed by the Executive Council.  The Executive Council was satisfied that the appointment should be made in the manner set out in the Order and it would have been for them, I think, in the first instance, should there have been any misgivings as regards future appointments by the Minister for Finance, to have taken them into consideration. I would like to point out to the Seanad in considering this Order, that having been passed by the Executive Council it could only be changed by the Executive Council.  That is to say, it is not open to amendment.  It was not open to amendment in the Dáil and it would be nullified if amended and if it had not been so passed by the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the appeal, as I have stated, lies to the Commissioners of Income Tax.  It is, I am sure, appreciated that it would be rather difficult to meet one point that was raised by a Senator who complained that the fiscal system as adopted and practised in England does not suit this country.  I think it will be scarcely possible for anyone living in the present generation to see the day when a Minister for Finance will adopt a fiscal system which will appeal to, and get the cordial support of, every section of the community.  At present there are two Boards, the Board of Inland Revenue and the Board of Customs and Excise.  They are amalgamated here.  We have not got anything like the same extent of business for the operations of the two Boards as exists in England, and it would not improve matters for us to have two Boards instead <Col N="399" /> of one.  The urgency of this matter will be appreciated when it is recollected that we have but a short period between this and the beginning of the financial year.  There is also a matter which must be borne in mind.  There is a very heavy task in arranging for the collection of Customs and Excise, which includes the setting up of a Customs frontier on the Six County boundary.  The customs must be temporarily collected on this boundary pending the decision of the Boundary Commission.  There was a reference made here to Southern Ireland.  I do not know what particular part of Southern Ireland Donegal is, but it certainly is not in Southern Ireland.</P>

I am inclined to agree with Senator Sir John Keane that there is scarcely any necessity for a Treasury, and in any case I would put it to the Seanad that it would be more advisable to see how the machinery of the Ministry of Finance would work before you consider the appointment of the Treasury, which there might be some difficulty in getting rid of once it was appointed.</P>

      <P>I desire to raise one matter in connection with the appeal.  As I understand the situation an appeal now lies by an aggrieved tax-payer to the Special Commissioners of Income Tax, and if there is a disagreement <Col N="400" /> with that, the taxpayer on the one hand, or the Surveyor on the other hand, has a right to ask for a case to be stated. That case being stated the matter can be brought before the High Court.  I then understand if there is, as there is always bound to be, disagreement between two litigants, one or the other may wish to appeal.  Then there is a further appeal to what, under the Constitution, corresponds to an appeal to the House of Lords.  It has to go, I think, with the permission of the Executive Council. The point I want to emphasise is that some of the Senators are under the impression that there was no appeal from a decision of this Board of Revenue Commissioners, whereas, in fact, the appeal lies to all the Courts that any taxpayer had access to previous to the establishment of the Free State.</P>

      <P>I should have stated that there may have been some misinterpretation in the Order regarding the Treasury.  The Finance Ministry is the Treasury here.  The Treasury as mentioned ordinarily is the British Treasury. An appeal does lie to the High Court, and appeals to the Court still continue. There is no restriction, no limitation, and no interference whatever with any right a person had previous to the passing of the Order or previous to the setting up of Saorstát Eireann.  There is no right or privilege which the taxpayer formally had that he is deprived of once this Order is passed.</P>

      <P>The Special Commissioners for Income Tax were English officials.  Some time last year, I think it was during the period I was acting as Minister for Finance, a Special Commissioner of Income Tax was appointed. He is one of the highest graded Civil Servants in the service of the Government, and has had a long and varied experience of administration.  I think he has accountancy qualifications.  I believe he has, and he was appointed.  It was proposed at the time that he should sit for this term with one of the Special Commissioners to be sent over from England, so that he would gain the necessary experience of that sort of work during <Col N="401" /> that period.  He is one of the Commissioners. His name is Mr. F. J. McCarthy, and he was in the Local Government service.</P>

It is evident that this Special Commission has not yet been constructed, and there is plenty of time, I hold, to consider the suggestion I make.  I am certain it would give considerable satisfaction to the taxpayers of Ireland if they had a Board to appeal to composed of their own class.  That is not the professional class, but the large business men of undoubted standing.  I ask the Minister to consider the suggestion.</P>

It is also the duty of the proposer to state the qualifications of the gentleman he nominates.  In this particular case, I think very properly, the proposer and seconder have put forward a gentleman who represents practically the same interests as the retiring Senator represented.  I think the members <Col N="402" /> will agree with me, other things being equal, it is desirable that the interests which a retiring Senator represented when the Seanad was originally constituted should, as far as possible, be retained. In that connection I may say that the gentleman proposed for this particular vacancy is identified, to a large extent, with the same interests as the retiring Senator.  There is only the one nomination for the vacancy.  The gentleman proposed is Mr. William Cummins, of Newbridge, Co. Kildare.  His qualifications are as follows:&mdash;Chairman Town Commissioners, Chairman Kildare Trades Council, Chairman North Kildare Irish National Teachers' Organisation; he was for many years associated with the Gaelic League, and officially conducted the first Gaelic League Choir established in Belfast; organised and judged at many of the Feis celebrations held throughout the country; acted as Secretary of An Fainne, and also as Secretary of Feiseanna in Counties Carlow, Kildare and Wicklow; acted as Professor of Irish Teachers' Course at Athy under the Board of Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the following motion standing in my name:&mdash;&ldquo;That, in view of the grave unrest amongst all sections of Lay Secondary Teachers employed in Irish Intermediate Schools working under the Ministry of Education, on the grounds of inadequate remuneration, absence of pension arrangements, and insecurity of tenure, the Seanad requests the Minister of Education to give the earliest possible attention to the question, with a view to the early extension to this important section of the teaching profession of rates of pay and conditions of employment more commensurate with the services rendered than at present seems to be the case.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion should not require any elaborate statement or closely reasoned argument to commend it for adoption. <Col N="403" /> One can only feel ashamed of the responsible authority, and ashamed of the country generally, that there should be a necessity for having to move a motion of this kind at this stage.  We have heard and read much about the obvious necessity of raising our educational standards to the highest possible level. Everybody seemed to be agreed as to the necessity for giving greater educational facilities in the primary, secondary and higher stages, and in attracting to the teaching profession men and women of the ability and character calculated to give training to the pupils likely to make them good citizens.  No one, with any sense of responsibility, has attempted to minimise the importance of the position which our Intermediate schools occupy in the chain of education.  Not only are they the feeders of our Universities, but, in the vast majority of cases, they also of necessity constitute the final stages in the education of the young men and women of the country.  They have very good reason to be proud of their work.  Year after year they turn out into the world thousands of pupils, male and female, with an intellectual equipment and general training which are a credit alike to the teachers and to the pupils themselves.</P>
    <P>It is safe to say that the preponderating majority of the Civil Service, Banking and Commercial appointments in the country are held by people who completed their education in the Intermediate schools.  Consequently it is unnecessary to dilate upon the importance of the profession responsible for this vital national work.  They require to be people with high educational qualifications. They must have the gift and the technical ability of imparting their knowledge to others, and they must be, or at least they should be, people of a high mental and moral standard, so that they may teach not only by precept but also by example.  If we judge by results it is quite evident that the Irish Secondary Teachers enjoy at least a share of these very necessary qualifications.  Yet how do we value the services of such people as an important national asset? How do we assist them to devote themselves whole-heartedly to their work and <Col N="404" /> to give their attention of a personal character, to the intricate and delicate task they are entrusted with?  A few figures will show, I think, more effectively than anything else the manner in which the services of Secondary Teachers are valued by a people so fond of talking histrionically about the Island of Saints and Scholars.  I do not know, personally, whether the Saints ever had any material existence, but if they had they must have all died or emigrated. It is clear, however, that there are yet a few scholars and the wherewithal to make scholars.  This is how their services are valued by the Nation.  For the year 1921-1922 the average salaries paid to lay Secondary Teachers in Ireland in Intermediate schools was only £175. This is merely an arbitrary figure, too, because there are no fixed scales in operation.  There are scores of men with high educational qualifications and with long service to their credit and they are paid only a salary of £160 a year at the present time.  Fancy offering a salary of that kind to a man or woman requiring a College training and possessing the abilities necessary for a teacher of Intermediate education!</P>
    <P>Although, on the whole, adverse to making comparisons between one set of workers as against another, I think it will help to show the cruel and deplorable manner in which Secondary Teachers have been treated by mentioning a few figures regarding the rates of pay of other grades of workers whose work is not more important from a national point of view than the Secondary Teachers.  Male National Teachers employed in the National Schools start at a salary of £170 a year and go up to £370 a year in the eighteenth year of service.  This means that a teacher starting in a National School at the age of 22 or 23, gets as high a salary as the Secondary Teacher with 20 or 30 years' service to his credit. Nobody will seriously assert that National teachers are paid too highly, but this being taken for granted what a commentary it is upon the miserable salary paid to a Secondary teacher!  Irish bank clerks rise to £450, with a bonus regulated according to the cost of living.  Dublin Corporation clerks have a salary and bonus of £455 in their twenty-second year <Col N="405" /> of service, and the Dublin County Council clerks go to about £450, with some bonus attached.  The rank and file member of the Civic Guard starts at a salary of £178 a year.  The Dublin Corporation street workers have £195 a year. I only quote these figures to show the cruel and inexcusable manner in which Secondary lay teachers in Irish Secondary Schools are treated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>In some cases mentioned they do not.  In the case of bank clerks the salary is £450, with a bonus regulated on the cost of living according as it rises or falls.  In the case of the Secondary teacher the salary is a basic salary.  They have had no bonus except last year, when their position was somewhat relieved by the payment of a bonus of £50, but for the coming year no provision whatever has been made.  In addition, they have no pension arrangements, and it is hardly necessary to say that a person living on £175, and possibly trying to support his family on that, can make no provision for the time when infirmity or old age will render him unfit for future work.  In addition, they have no security of tenure. Though their work may be of the very highest order, they are liable to have their services dispensed with on three months' notice, and in many cases even that notice is not necessary.  New Regulations have recently been introduced rendering it necessary for Secondary Teachers to have a University degree diploma in education and three years' approved experience before they are entitled to Registration as Secondary Teachers. It is hardly likely that there would be a great rush of suitable people who will go to the expense and the work involved of preparing themselves as such with a prospective salary in the end of £175, with unemployment constantly in the background, and with no pension to look forward to when they are no longer able to work.  It is quite clear that in these circumstances there is a serious danger of a shortage of teachers in these particular schools, or a danger of people only of an entirely unsuitable character offering themselves, and the result will <Col N="406" /> have the most far-reaching and disastrous consequences for the children of the Nation.  A new programme is to come into force about next September, and the teachers rightly claim that a corollary of this new programme should be improved conditions of employment. A case has been brought to my notice, and I believe it is only typical of more than one, of a Secondary Teacher dying in a workhouse hospital.  He was only saved from a pauper's burial by the generosity of his impoverished colleagues.  I suggest that this condition of affairs is a disgrace to those responsible, and is a shame and menace to the people of the Nation as a whole.  It has been the proud boast of our historians that in ancient days in Ireland the aristocracy of intellect was placed on an equality&mdash; on an equal level with the aristocracy of birth, wealth and military renown. Bards and teachers figure almost as prominently on the pages of Irish history as the kings and chieftains.  They were the guests of rulers, and they were respected and admired by all sections of the people.  Has the national outlook altered to such an extent that to-day their services are valued at a lower price than the services of the man who sweeps our streets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Saorstát Eireann there are about twelve hundred or thirteen hundred Secondary Teachers altogether, of which about fifty per cent. are lay teachers. The amount necessary to give them a fairly decent standard of existence is, in view of the services they render, comparatively negligible.  Poverty brings many disadvantages and sufferings in its train to those who fall under its yoke, irrespective of their education or training; but it is safe to say that it falls much heavier on those who are sufficiently educated to realise to the full the many good and useful and beautiful things they have lost by their poverty. It is always a pathetic spectacle to see a man or a woman with high intellectual attainments, with a wide knowledge of literature and art and science, an asset and an ornament and a delight to society, without, at the same time, the wherewithal to live in decent apartments, to purchase the raiment necessary to make them comfortable or presentable, or the food to support themselves and <Col N="407" /> their families.  You can easily see the bad effect such a spectacle can have upon the impressionable minds of the youths whose education is entrusted to the care of such people.  It is easy also to fancy the cynical outlook upon life which such a condition of abject poverty produces in the mind of the teacher, and he, in turn, can quite unwittingly impart this cynical outlook to receptive youthful minds entrusted to his care.  Therefore, from the point of view of justice, from the viewpoint of statesmanship and of nation-building, and in the interest of the young boys and girls who will constitute the men and women of the future, it is only right and proper that this condition of affairs should be discontinued, and that there should be established in its place a set of conditions more befitting a people who, in their greatest tribulations, in their sorrows and in their joys, have always paid a tribute of homage at the shrine of learning and knowledge.</P>

      <P>I desire earnestly to second the resolution proposed.  I feel quite sure that there is no one here who needs any earnest appeal for the cause of the teachers.  I am familiar with two things.  One is the history of learning in Ireland which has a story more remarkable than that of any country in Europe. I am, also unhappily, familiar with the dense ignorance which has been the cause of many of our misfortunes now.  I feel that after the long suffering, and the limitations which were imposed upon education by the foreigners, that we should now show that we have a serious purpose, and a real intention to make a country worthy of the old history of Ireland. I do not know whether I should propose that a Committee should be appointed of this Seanad who should have power to call into consultation other people so as to devise or advise upon a scheme.  How we are to work this out must be considered by those who are more capable in actual affairs than I am. This Seanad should wipe cut the reproach throughout the Free State that there should be any hindrance to learning.  We should recognise what I have learned in the course of many years in England that there are no teachers so esteemed as the Irish.  They have a quality, they have <Col N="408" /> always had it, and they have it still. Our first effort should be to preserve here for the upraising of our own people, and the making of Ireland worthy of the Free State the teachers that we are sending to other countries.  I do not know whether to propose that a Committee should be appointed.  Perhaps others may consider that point, but that the question should be one of those most earnestly considered by us I have no doubt.</P>

      <P>The mover in his opening remarks said, I think, that education was being thrust somewhat into the background out of public sight at present.  I venture to suggest that finance is not allowed to occupy a very important place, and that the balancing of our Budget is even more important than is the admittedly urgent question of adequate salaries.  It is very hard as a practical body&mdash;and I try to look at this from a practical point of view&mdash; to deal with this <i>ad hoc</i>, separated from the general question of our financial resources. For that reason, and in order to show the Government that we do realise the practical aspect of this problem&mdash;we must pay cur way, and you cannot increase one lot of salaries without getting the money; and also without regard to what effect these increases may have in other quarters, and what claims they may be opening the door to&mdash;I suggest as an amendment that the following words be added to the motion &lsquo;provided always that the finances of the Free State permit of such increases.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If it had not been for the last speech I would not have said anything.  I thought we should have been perfectly unanimous on this question at least.  We know that salaries have risen all over the country, and people have been given high salaries and bonuses of all sorts.  The only people left out have been the Secondary Teachers.  It is not a question of to-day or yesterday, but of many years that I have been hearing of these complaints.  I think the method under which all these schools are managed is to a great extent responsible for this.  There is an extreme competition to pass examinations which, I think, is <Col N="409" /> extremely detrimental to education and to finance and everything else.  I am sorry to see that anybody should propose an amendment that merely means passing by these people who have been shown to be so deserving.  Of course, we all know that if we have not money some classes of people will not be able to get as much as they ought to, but we are not an executive body, and we are merely passing a resolution expressing our sympathy with those people whom we know to be badly paid.  The proposer of the amendment even recognises that they are under-paid, and we ought not to go beyond saying that we sympathise entirely with them, and urge the Executive who have the power of the purse to proceed in the matter as fast as ever they can.</P>

      <P>It is my duty to be present in order to hear the views of the members of the Seanad on the question, which has occupied public attention and is occupying the attention of the Government. Those who are in close touch with it know that the case undoubtedly, as shown in the figures placed before us, requires a remedy, but the remedy is not by any means a simple one.  The history of the growth of this present state of things in secondary education is, I am sure, familiar to everyone present, as it has come about in the time of most of us.  Until, I think, the Intermediate Act of 1877, there was no public provision at all for secondary education in Ireland.  It relied entirely on private endowment and private contributions, and out of that it has arisen that all, or practically all, the secondary schools in Ireland are private institutions, and again, from that it has followed that the relation between those who have charge of these schools and the lay Secondary Teachers who teach in them, has been a purely contractual relation of the most open kind.  It is only within recent years that any attempt has been made, under great public pressure, to come, in <Col N="410" /> any degree, to the relief of these Secondary Teachers, and the shortness of financial support has fallen not only on them, but on the schools generally in which they are engaged.  I think it is quite true to say that the very existence of Secondary Schools for some time, owing to the change of value consequent on the European War, was made almost impossible. As it has been pointed out to you, the remedy in this matter is mainly a question of finance.  The mover of the resolution expressed some pain of mind on behalf of those responsible for the state of things as it is at present.  Well, I think that I might safely say, and the present Government might safely say, that that leaves their withers unwrung, because they certainly are not responsible for the state of things in the Secondary Schools as it exists at present.  The endowment of Secondary Education in Ireland has never been adequate, and I am glad that that resolution has been brought forward, for it will help to focus the public mind on the necessity of making full and adequate provision for secondary education.</P>
      <P>I do not know that it is necessary for me to add anything more.  I have said that the matter of making this provision is under the consideration of the Government.  In the last resort public financial provision depends on public opinion, and upon the public understanding of the importance of the object for which the provision is to be made.  I do not think, addressing myself to the amendment, that there ought to be any great apprehension on the point of making such provision.  There will be calls on the public to make provision for many things in the immediate future, some of them exceptional things arising out of the defects of education, and some of them normal and carrying normal increases, but with regard to making ample provision, which has never yet been made for secondary education in our time, I think it would be quite sound for the people and their representatives to look to the provisions so made purely in the light of an investment, and one of the soundest investments which it is possible for them to make of their resources.</P>

It is quite obvious that no money can be paid unless the money exists. That is quite an intelligent interpretation of the motion.  The Minister has assured him that he need have no undue apprehension on that head.  We have passed motions here where finance was concerned, and where we were personally concerned ourselves, and we omitted, and Senator Sir John Keane omitted, to insert any such proviso.  Later on there will be other matters coming before the Seanad regarding compensation for destruction. I am wondering whether the financial conditions of the country will get the same consideration as this proposal to give tolerable conditions of service to five or six hundred people has received.  I would, therefore, oppose the amendment.  I hope that the Seanad will not boggle and hair-split in the manner suggested by tacking on this meaningless and unnecessary amendment to the resolution. In conclusion, I would appeal to the Minister to make some temporary provision to assist the men and women who are in such a very deplorable economic condition at the present time, pending the establishment of a permanent character.</P>

      <P>The difficulty about this day week, I understand, is this that it is quite possible that when you assemble I would have to tell you that there was nothing for you to do, and that depends upon the progress that may be made with certain more or less controversial Bills at present going through the Dáil.  It is quite possible that if you fix to meet this day week you might find you had no business to do.  Should you leave the matter to me, with the assistance, perhaps, of the Deputy Chairman, if we find by Monday, or by Saturday, that we could have business for you on Wednesday sufficient to justify calling the Seanad together, of course, we would do so.</P>

      <P>I think that under the circumstances it is possible that this would be the right course to adopt.  There is one Bill which I certainly would not like to see delayed unnecessarily, and that is the Electoral Bill, and I think there is a very good reason why, as soon as it reaches us, we should not delay by putting it off for a week.  There is another matter of some importance, and that is, when we receive a Bill, there should be at least one week or thereabouts to consider the Bill before it reaches the Committee Stage.  I think after what we saw to-day&mdash;if I am in order in pointing it out&mdash;we virtually made the Committee Stage out of the Report Stage of a Bill.  If we had properly amended the Bill in Committee, then on the Report Stage there would only have been consequential amendments which would have been more or less to set right discrepancies that would have arisen in the Committee Stage.  The suggestion was made when you, sir, were away, that a fixed day each week should be set down for meeting of the Seanad, say Tuesday or Wednesday, and if by the <Col N="414" /> previous Saturday business has not been handed in, that a telegram should be sent to each of the members conveying the fact that there would be no meeting that week.  The advantage of that would be that when there was no business Senators would not be brought to Dublin and incur expense.</P>

      <P>Of course that is another alternative, that is to say, to fix the meeting for this day week at 3 o'clock, unless I was satisfied by Saturday that there would not be a sufficient programme, in which case you would then receive a telegram.  I am not certain myself that that is the most business-like way of doing things, but it is a matter entirely for you.</P>

      <P>If the Senators are to have Bills in their hands a week in advance, so as to consider what amendments may be desirable, would it be possible to hold weekly meetings?</P>

      <P>It is immaterial as to how I shall put it to the Seanad.  I shall ask the opinion of the Seanad as to whether we should adjourn until this day week, or until a date of which you will receive notice later.</P>

      <P>It is proposed that the Seanad do now adjourn, and do not meet again until they have received notice convening them for a special date, issued by the Chairman.</P>
      <P>Motion put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6.8 p.m.</P>
