      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret having to approach the Seanad this morning in view of the circumstances of the last twenty-four hours and to ask consideration of a Bill&mdash;the Public Safety (Emergency Powers) (No. 2) Bill, 1923, which the Government has considered it necessary to introduce into the Dáil.  The Dáil passed that Bill last night with a resolution declaring that it is necessary for the preservation of the public peace and safety and that the provisions of Article 47 of the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann shall not apply to the Bill. I do not think it is necessary to enter into any elaborate explanation of the causes of the necessity for this Bill to become law without delay and I think a perusal of the morning papers will show at once the vital need for passing this measure so as to enable us to carry on our responsibilities with a view to the preservation of the public peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You can quite understand that, with a large number of prisoners, a considerable number of whom would be very active if they were at large just now, and a considerable number of whom are not in a position to accept amnesty&mdash;which we are prepared at any moment to extend to them, granted that it is accepted in good faith&mdash;we do not consider that we are justified at this moment in bringing forward for the consideration of the Oireachtas an amnesty for prisoners.  If we had any hope that it would be received in the same spirit in which it would be made it would be one of the pleasures of our existence to bring it in but we are not so satisfied, and I think from the view of the citizens outside that they would not be satisfied if we <Col N="2070" /> were to tamper with the rights we have secured after a long struggle at great expense, loss of blood and treasure to the nation.  We have been forced at very short notice to submit this measure to the Oireachtas.  We are advised that it will meet the necessities of the case, and I have only to apologise again for having drawn so much on your patience with regard to the consideration of this measure which the circumstances of the last twenty-four hours have rendered absolutely necessary.</P>

      <P>We have listened to the President's grave and impressive though short statement, but the Seanad realizes that we are living in critical times and the question that he raises and asks us to decide upon involves wide constitutional issues and for my part, and I imagine I am speaking the feelings of the Seanad, I would very much like to have the benefit of our Chairman's advice on the situation. Therefore if I may be allowed to suggest I think we would be very glad if he would tell us what he thinks and advise us as to how we had better proceed in connection with the subject before us.</P>

      <P>Would it not be better to look into the Standing Orders on this matter?  What Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde has said is undoubtedly right. There probably never was a case in which our Chairman's advice would be more valuable, but I doubt if he could give it as well from the Chair.  I think in this matter Standing Orders regulate the way we should act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like before the Chairman leaves the Chair to know in what respect his advice is sought. Sir Thomas Esmonde asked that he should give us his advice, but he has not stated in what respect.  The President seeks to introduce a very important motion and he has stated very briefly his reasons for it.  Nobody has spoken for or against that motion so far and I would like to know in what respect the advice of the Chairman is sought.  Is it legal advice or advice as an ordinary member of the Seanad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>In my humble judgment the situation before us now involves grave constitutional issues <Col N="2071" /> and I think it would be well to have the views of the Chairman with his trained mind and knowledge of these matters.</P>

      <P>Under a Standing Order that was adopted by the Seanad many months ago it is unnecessary that any request should be made to me as a condition precedent to my right to address the Seanad.  I have the right conferred upon me under that Standing Order subject only to the condition that I vacate the Chair while addressing the Seanad.  Personally I have up to now deliberately avoided taking any advantage of this privilege which the Seanad thought fit to confer on the Chairman not at my request nor at my invitation. I did so deliberately because I think it is in the interests of the Chair not only for its present temporary occupant, but for those who will fill the position hereafter that they should be as little as possible identified with current politics and controversies of the day.  It is on that account that even to-day I should not for a moment have thought of intervening in this discussion had it not been for the request that has come to me from the Seanad itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course it is perfectly obvious that anything I say to you is purely by way of suggestion, not by way of dictation. I have no right to dictate to the Seanad in any way, and I certainly have no desire to do so, but in as much as the Seanad think that I may be, perhaps, in a position to explain clearly to them the constitutional position at which we have arrived and possibly from a lengthy experience to make suggestions to them I have without hesitation acceded to their request.  Of course I am not in any way involved with the policy of the Government.  I am not a member of the Government.  I have no voice in their counsels.  I have no responsibility whatever for their policy.  At the same time, speaking with the utmost candour, <Col N="2072" /> I think it is greatly to be regretted that owing to a certain want of foresight on their part we and the country should find ourselves faced with this grave constitutional position.  I do not venture to say anything more by way of criticism because it is very easy to be wise after the event, and I think one has very little cause for surprise when one realizes the tremendous amount of responsibility and work, the difficulties and dangers which beset their path during the last six months.  Perhaps we have more cause for surprise that the mistakes they have made should be so few.</P>
    <P>The position before the Government to-day as I understand it is that they have passed a Bill&mdash;the Public Safety Bill&mdash;in the interests, as they believe, of the safety of the general community, and in a matter of this kind it is perfectly obvious that as in other well-regulated communities and countries we have to take that on the credit of the responsible Ministers of the day.  We in this Seanad and people outside have neither the opportunity nor the knowledge that they must possess as to the internal conditions and the dangers involved to the public safety.</P>
    <P>Therefore, responsibility is cast upon the shoulders of the responsible Government of the day, and under normal conditions and in ordinary days it seems to me that not only this House but the country have to give them credit for their intentions, and have to assume that in their conjoint wisdom they have arrived at the solution which fits the situation.  Accordingly they passed this Public Safety Bill which apparently looked as if it was sufficient to deal with the situation, but unfortunately they overlooked a rather evident, as I would have thought, patent Section in the Constitution, Section 47, which practically prescribes an interval of seven days before any Act of the Oireachtas can come into force, the seven days being plainly inserted with a view to enabling steps to be taken to have a referendum on the question should the community so desire.</P>
    <P>In order that that interval of seven days should not be allowed to interfere with the public safety in days of difficulty and danger, the Constitution goes on to say that this interval of seven days <Col N="2073" /> can be voided by a resolution passed by the Oireachtas that the Act in the interests of the public safety is to come into operation at once.  Had such a resolution been passed by the Oireachtas at the time when the Bill was going through its final stages this Constitutional question, in my opinion, could never have arisen, but, as I say, unfortunately that provision seems to have been overlooked by the Government and its advisers, and it is for that reason we are faced with the position we are in to-day.  Naturally advantage is taken of this by those interested in obtaining the discharge of political prisoners at present under detention, and application was formally made for what is known as a writ of Habeas Corpus to obtain the release of those men on the ground that there was no Act of Parliament which justified their detention, once the Courts came to the conclusion that a state of war no longer existed because as you know the only justification for the detention of any citizen without trial is the fact that a state of war is existing in the country.</P>
    <P>There is an old Latin maxim which illustrates what I am explaining &ldquo;<i>Salus reipublicæ suprema lex</i>&rdquo; which, shortly translated, means that the public safety is the paramount and supreme law of the land and all other considerations of law have to give way to it. But as I have said once the Courts came to the conclusion that a state of war ceased to exist it thus became inevitable that if the powers of detention were to be preserved even for the shortest period, an Act of the Oireachtas was necessary.  That Act was the Act known as the Public Safety Act, and if, as I say, a resolution was passed in both Houses at the time it was going through its final stages certifying that in the interests of the public safety the Act should come in at once, the seven days interval would have been wiped out and the position would be normal and regular.  That not having been done the Government is faced with the position in which they cannot during the seven days and until the expiration of seven days detain in custody men and women who have not been put on trial in the ordinary way</P>
    <P>The Government tell us it is for them to decide.  Certainly I for myself would not venture to suggest I had any opinion <Col N="2074" /> on the subject or was in any position of any kind either to say to myself or to say to you that the existing conditions demand and require a measure of the kind.  I say that in every civilised community we have got to trust our Ministers for that.  If the Seanad believes as the President has told us that it is essential to the public safety that the powers conferred under this Act having regard to the recent decision of the Court should come into operation at once then, it is for them to bring before us and ask us to pass the measures they think would rectify the position and bring about that.  I am not here and it is no part of my duty as Chairman of the Seanad to give legal advice to my colleagues.  All I would say is that they should act with deliberation and care in this matter. They should tread very warily and should be satisfied that the proposals the Government now make will close down the curtain on the last act of what I may call this tragedy of errors, that within the last few weeks enveloped the Constitution, and was mainly due to the extreme haste and pressure by which we are compelled to discharge our work.</P>
    <P>I must again repeat my regret that with this position present in their minds as it must have been the Government did not introduce the Public Safety Bill and other measures at an earlier stage so as to enable not only the Dáil but this Seanad to give them the consideration and deliberation that they require. However that is passed and again there is no use in regretting the past.  We have to provide for the future. If we get the assurance of the President that he is advised by his responsible legal advisers that the present proposition he is making to us in this Bill we are asked now to pass together with the resolution which will be submitted to you under Section 47 of the Constitution, will be the position normally and constitutionally, and that we shall not be asked to repeat the proceedings we are going through to-day by reason of some other gap or defect in the Government's policy, then all I can say to you is: take the Government in the faith of those assurances and let us give them the additional protection they require, leaving the responsibility upon themselves.</P>

      <P>(having resumed the Chair): To put this in order <Col N="2075" /> now I shall move that the Bill that has been introduced be read a Second time, that is to say the Public Safety (Emergency Powers) (No. 2) Bill, 1923.  Perhaps I should say that this Bill consists of three sections.  The first section incorporates in the Bill the recent Public Safety Emergency Powers Act.  The second section declares that this new Bill is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace and safety, and that the provisions of Article 47 accordingly are not to apply to it.  The last section provides that it is to come into operation immediately upon the signification of the Royal Assent thereto.  The motion is that this Bill be a read second time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Seanad should be grateful to the Chairman for having made the speech that the President should really have made for the purpose of explaining the Constitutional position, in regard to this extraordinary motion before the Seanad.  It has been stated several times that there are abnormal conditions obtaining outside, but the real fact is that the only place in which abnormal conditions are obtaining is in the Oireachtas itself.  I am not going to say anything to add to the remarks that have been passed, both here and in the Courts, as to the extraordinary confusion and the lack of foresight which has characterised the actions of the Executive Council during the past few weeks, but merely to express the hope that for the future, at all events, we shall witness no such humiliating exhibitions as we have all been treated to during the past few weeks.  There are I agree extenuating circumstances. Whether these extenuating circumstances are sufficient excuse for all that has happened or not is of course a matter of opinion.  This motion which we are asked to pass this morning in the form of a Bill is somewhat confusing. Yesterday, Senator Jameson introduced a resolution providing for similar contingencies as far as the Defence Forces Bill was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were assured that that declaration was necessary in order to make the Bill immediately operative or to bring it outside the ambit of Article 47 of the Constitution. I do not know if it is intended to introduce a No. 2 Defence Force <Col N="2076" /> Bill here also or whether it is intended to take the two bills separately, but certainly a great deal of confusion is bound to arise in the mind of people like myself with no legal knowledge and with only common sense powers to bring to bear on matters of this kind.  I understand that there is a certain amount of doubt that this Bill before us will effect the purpose for which it is introduced.  But we have it on the authority of the Government that it will.  Perhaps it would be better for the Government and better for the country that it did not effect the purpose for which it was introduced. It is looked upon as a fearful calamity by some people if the prisoners were released. It may be or it may not.  There may be amongst those men a number of criminals.  Perhaps there are amongst them a large number of criminals, and it would be regrettable if any number of criminals like that were allowed to stalk the land unpunished.  But I take it that the Government have not up to this failed to classify the prisoners in their custody.  Surely some classification must have been made between the ordinary political prisoners and the criminals. The Government have now a very effective Detective Department, and that should be able to classify intelligently the prisoners into their proper category.  The criminals on one side and ordinary prisoners on the other.</P>
    <P>If the contingency again arose that the Government fear if the whole of the prisoners should be released there is nothing to prevent them re-arresting these prisoners immediately and charging them with the crimes of which they have been known to be guilty, or at all events alleged to have been guilty.  But I do believe that advantage might be taken of this fortuitous incident to release the ordinary political prisoners. After all, we must realise that they are our own fellow-countrymen and fellow-countrywomen. We cannot keep them permanently in prison.  Let us realise that we have got to live with them and their relatives and friends.  Anybody who knows anything of Irish mentality or indeed of political mentality anywhere will know that many of these prisoners will remain there until they rot rather than give the simple undertaking simply because it is required by the Government which they look upon as their political opponents.  In nearly all amnesties <Col N="2077" /> that have taken place in this country in the struggle with the British Government in the past, lots of prisoners were released without giving an undertaking, and the man who did give an undertaking was looked upon as a traitor, and was ashamed to show his face amongst his friends.  We must take into consideration that mentality. We are assured now that if these prisoners are released we will have a recrudescence of hostilities.  I do not know anyone can convince himself that that is the case.</P>
    <P>From everything going on around the country one can see that notwithstanding that gory letter read here the other day, the country as a whole is sick to death of hostilities and violence.  I honestly believe that if the prisoners were released to-morrow you could not muster 100 of them that would have the heart to enter upon hostilities again. The whole feeling and moral tone of the country is against it.  The prisoners would be themselves glad to get out and return to their homes.  There were very favourable conditions which encouraged the trouble last year, and naturally as things went along it developed the primitive instinct in man.  One of the greatest reasons was that there was no law, no arm of the law to enforce justice and order.  These conditions are very considerably changed.  One has only to read the newspapers to find a gradual and increasing return to constitutional activities.  We have the statement of a permanent Irregular leader that only one candidate would be put up in each electoral division to test the feelings of the people.  We find now that that statement is being departed from. It is quite evident that there has been a general change of mind and heart.</P>
    <P>The absolute hopelessness of physical violence has manifested itself.  The bitterness of heart and passions reached at the time hostilities ceased have gradually softened down, I hope on both sides.  Might it not be a generous gesture of statesmanship now to take advantage of this, particularly in view of the forthcoming election.  I do not believe that it would in the least injure the interests of the country.  It certainly would not hamper or injure the interests of the Government to take advantage of it.  We know what was the attitude of Lincoln after the American <Col N="2078" /> Civil War, when he told Parliament that the insurgents of the South were to be treated as if the war had never occurred.  It is, I think, in the highest interests of the country that a similar statement or a similar policy should be adopted on the part of our Government to-day.  We are a very small country with potential enemies on our border. We cannot afford to rest for any considerable period of time with 12,000 or 14,000 prisoners locked up in internment camps. As I said, we can keep them there indefinitely, and in the end it will have to be realised that they will have to be released, without the undertaking they refused to give.  Meanwhile they will be gathering up powerful influence outside, from the mere standpoint of sympathy. We know from amnesty movements in the past what will happen.</P>
    <P>After the Fenian rising had failed it was the amnesty movement that rallied to the support of the prisoners, thousands of people who were absolutely opposed to them when they took up arms. It requires only ordinary common sense to know and to realise that holding the prisoners at the present time will simply defeat the very object which is sought to be achieved by keeping them interned.  Apart from that there are thousands of people in these internment camps who are absolutely innocent.  I have had myself scores of communications with the Minister for Defence in regard to prisoners who have  arrested and detained for months, and he has kindly consented to release these prisoners after finding that they were absolutely innocent.  Unless these people had somebody who took up their cases for them they would be detained up to the present time.  If they were unknown people, without friends they might remain for years there, merely because there was nobody to advocate their case and see that it was investigated. That is a deplorable state of affairs, and one that would turn into rebels people who were loyal citizens.  Their friends cannot understand why they are detained and naturally they will have a feeling of bitterness and hostility.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, there is the ruinous economic effect which the detention of these prisoners is causing.  There are large families suffering cruel hardships because their breadwinners are detained. <Col N="2079" /> It was not like this when it was a popular movement, when we were fighting against the British.  There were then large funds for the support of the dependants of these people.  There are no funds of any consequence to support them to-day.  The people themselves are not subscribing to them because they look upon the relatives of the prisoners whether innocent or otherwise with suspicion and hostility.  Therefore, quite unintentionally very serious wrongs and hardships are being inflicted, and from that point also the arguments are in favour of a generous gesture on the part of the Government.  I believe although this decision was not foreseen, that the law should be allowed to take its course without any extraordinary unconstitutional action such as it is proposed we should take this morning.  From that point of view I propose to vote against the Bill not in any spirit of hostility at all against the Government, not in any spirit of obstruction, but simply because I think and it is the opinion of thousands of people outside that the incident might well be taken advantage of to release the prisoners and thereby take one great step towards restoring peace and normal conditions throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>May I intervene for a moment to correct an interpretation that may be put upon the speech of the Senator who has just spoken.  In the first place, I do not, the Government do not, and the people of this country do not accept the parallel that he has drawn between the position of the Government at the present moment and the position of the British Government, which has been operating in this country for the last hundred years in the matter of amnesties.  We do not accept that parallel.  The position is not the same.  There is no parallel and it is not fair to the people of the country to draw any such parallel or to let the people form the impression from the statement that has just been made, that we are exactly in the same position as the British Government was in during the period to which he has referred.  We are exercising our authority as a Government from the votes that were cast in June last by the people of this country. The Senator may, perhaps, claim that <Col N="2080" /> that was not a fair election, that it was not a free election, and so on.  I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, may I state that I said nothing at all about the election on the last occasion.  I did not say it was not a free election and in regard to the British Government I certainly did not draw any analogy.  I said the mentality of the people would be the same and that on that occasion people who were violently opposed to them when they took up arms became friends of the prisoners in jail, and I said we could not overlook the fact that a similar mentality exists to-day.  It is but natural in human nature itself that people opposed to the prisoners may become very friendly to them through sympathy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the mentality which for six months of last year we endeavoured by kindness and persuasion and by every possible means open to human ingenuity to bring to a state of normality.  It did not succeed, and then, finding ourselves confronted with violence, we brought into play a little more violence than they had possibly contemplated.  The result is that you have a very much healthier mentality, not alone amongst the prisoners, but amongst many of their friends and I would question very strongly any undue sympathy for a policy which has been so disastrous, not alone to the material resources of the country but to the moral future of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Again on a point of explanation, I will not allow the President to misinterpret me.  He talks of me as if I were expressing sympathy with those who have carried out destruction in the country; I have none.</P>

      <P>Do not let us get too sensitive in these matters. There is always a certain amount of criticism and argument, that is always legitimate, and if whenever there is any view suggested of one speaker's sentiments or words that does not quite agree with what his own view of them is, surely it it is not worth while interrupting. The Seanad will be the best judge as to whether the criticism is just or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the President interpreting his own <Col N="2081" /> feelings, but I cannot have him interpreting my feelings and stating to the Seanad and to the country that anything in my speech savoured of favouring the policy which he condemns and which I equally condemn.  That is what I object to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Senator's speech that he criticised the action of the Government with regard to those prisoners and with regard to the policy that they have advocated.  I take that as a matter of some importance, because during the whole of last year, on more than one occasion we laid it down that we were prepared to withdraw entirely from the arena of Government and from the political sphere, if I may say so, granted they on their side would also withdraw.  At no time during that period were we met by the people on whose behalf the Senator has certainly asked for some consideration and sympathy, with any corresponding accommodation.  Certainly now that they have seen the error of their ways and that they have felt some of the disadvantages of the policy they have adopted, and which they ruthlessly imposed on the people of the country, and now that they are feeling the iron heel that they pressed for a long time upon others, and now that they are commencing to squeal, I say that this is the time to let them bear some of these disadvantages for at least a little while longer and let them realise that the people of the country are not going to tolerate any such nonsense in the future. That, I submit, is not at all unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator has stated that those people are so high-minded that they will not agree to sign certain forms.  I may tell the Senator and any others who may be interested, that we have let out prisoners who did not sign a form at all. We have also allowed out prisoners who have signed forms and we have not published their names.  We are not looking for any credit for those things.  We are not at any time desirous of imposing any indignity or any humiliation upon those people; all we want is fair consideration. All we want is a fair bargain. If they say, &ldquo;We will not sign the forms but we will not destroy and we will adopt constitutional methods,&rdquo; the whole thing is over, and there is no more <Col N="2082" /> to be said.  But we, on our part, say that the dignity of the people has to be considered.  Those erring children who have been such an expensive luxury in this country, finding their patriotism does not appeal to the people now, finding that there are no more banks to be robbed and that it is not so easy to rob banks at present, finding there are no more sympathetic purses to be drawn upon because the people are sick and tired of them, and finding that they are placed upon their own resources and are short of funds are now, we are told, to be considered in a sympathetic manner. Is this the time for us to say to them, &ldquo;Poor erring sisters and brothers, we take you to our bosoms and if you do not rob us, if you do not stab us, if you do not shoot us any more you will be the leaders in this country.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Seanad that nobody is more anxious than I or the other members of the Government to see the slate wiped clean.  We wish this thing over.  As far as any persecution of these people is concerned, I may say that we do not wish it, but just as a father sometimes corrects his child, and perhaps feels that correction as much as the child does, so do we consider it is right that these people should feel this thing in such a way that it will not be likely to be brought on again in the future.  I could not honestly say to the Seanad that there would be safety in releasing those prisoners.  From information I have and from information which is at the disposal of the Government, I could not say so.  Nobody would more willingly release those prisoners if it were advisable to do so.  Some people may think that there is great pleasure in having surmounted the difficulties of the moment.  I may tell you <Col N="2083" /> that even at this moment nothing would please me more than to withdraw and get back into private life and have done with all this thing if I were sure that by doing so I would have contributed something towards the establishment of peace in the country.  I may assure you that it has not been any pleasure to us to oppose those people with whom we have been associated in the past and to adopt harsh methods towards them.  We did it all in the interests of the country and we would do it again to-morrow if it were to secure safety and stability in the country.  The Seanad may be quite certain that if at any time it appears to us to be safe to release those prisoners we will do so, but at this moment we would be failing in our duty and we would not be insuring the safety of the country if we were to do it.</P>

      <P>There are just one or two points I would like to dwell upon. One is the rather irregular parallel that Senator O'Farrell drew with America. He forgot altogether to remind us of the result of the clemency of President Lincoln. It resulted in his assassination. There was another slightly confused expression which savours rather of the suppression of the truth, and it is this. The peace which we are enjoying at present, how was it brought about?  It was brought about by the superhuman resolution and courage of a small group of men who represent the Government of this country.  In the enjoyment of the fruits of that courage we are now being asked to embarrass that Government.</P>

      <P>I am sorry this debate has taken this turn on the Second Reading.  The real point we have to decide is whether we are going to pass this extra Bill or not.  With most of what Senator O'Farrell has said I agree. I cannot, however, agree with his parallel about the insurgents of the South, because although they did not approve of the Government they at least recognised the State.  However, we need not go into this matter.  On the Second Reading of the Public Safety Bill I pleaded for an amnesty for the prisoners. My point was that it should be a generous gesture&mdash;to use the words of Senator O'Farrell&mdash;on the part of the Government, but I hold that to let them <Col N="2084" /> all out now as a result of this fortuitous circumstance would not achieve the same result.  I was opposed to the other Bill and I voted against it in all its Stages.  I think the proper attitude that I should take on this measure is simply to abstain.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Tis an ill wind that blows nobody good.&rdquo;  While I agree with all that the Cathaoirleach has said in regard to regret as to the present circumstances and the circumstances that have arisen which were the cause of this Bill, it may be there are some compensations. I for one as a believer and a firm believer in the Constitution, am not altogether sorry to see those who did their best to destroy it taking advantage of it and finding now that it may be used even for their protection.  I take the same attitude towards this Bill as I did on the other one.  I do not, however, intend to oppose the Bill, because I hold when we passed the other Bill it would be ridiculous not to take the necessary steps to allow it to have the force of law.  It is rather regrettable that we have got into a discussion as to the question of the release of prisoners.  I, too, agree with most of what Senator O'Farrell said, with just this exception: if and when those who have been tackling the State are prepared to recognise the State and return to absolutely constitutional methods, then I will agree with him.  I absolutely welcome the statement of the President that when that occurs the Government is prepared to consider an amnesty.  I think it would be well that we should receive an assurance, even more explicit than we have received from the President, that after careful consideration he is satisfied the Bill does what is required of it.  I am not a lawyer, and I have been somewhat puzzled by the meaning of certain phrases.  I am not quite sure, and perhaps it would be safer to make it clear that both this and the previous Act were declared necessary for the immediate preservation of peace, health and safety. I throw out that suggestion as one that should be considered for the purpose of clarity.</P>

      <P>I want to raise one point in connection with the Bill.  I have a distinct recollection that when this Bill was going through the Committee Stage the Minister in charge <Col N="2085" /> accepted an amendment that I proposed. In reading the Bill which is published on the White Paper to-day I do not see any reference to that amendment.  I would like to call the attention of the Seanad to the amendment that I proposed. I proposed in Section 5, Sub-Section (3) to delete in lines 46 and 47 the words &ldquo;nor less than £50.&rdquo;  Immediately I got up to propose that amendment. The Minister in charge of the Bill said he would accept it, and I said I was much obliged and sat down.  The amendment was accepted by the Minister. That is a distinct recollection of mine, and those with me.</P>

      <P>I only wish to remind the Seanad that once a Bill becomes an Act of Parliament you cannot alter it by discussion or by suggesting that something has been left out by a mistake, or that something has been inserted through an inadvertence.  If that is so, and the Oireachtas is satisfied that that is so, then the remedy is an amending Bill.  If the Senator thought it worth while it might be possible when we get to the Committee Stage of this Bill to put in an amendment.  I have myself some doubts whether it would be sufficient here in this Bill to say that such and such a Section of the incorporated Act shall be amended and the following substituted for it.  It might be open to do that because we are dealing with a Bill which incorporates the Act referred to, and before we incorporate the Act referred to it might be-possible to amend it.  I do not advise that course as I think it would be very awkward and somewhat irregular.</P>

      <P>Senator Farren made a statement that he understood the Minister in charge of the Bill accepted an amendment of his with regard to this £50.  If he accepted that amendment that is in our Official Report and if it is not in our Official Report then he is mistaken.  I wish that to be made perfectly clear because I have known these things to occur before.  Members having to consider amendments to an intricate Bill in a great hurry very often thought that the Minister had accepted an amendment, or had not accepted an amendment.

It is very likely that Senator Farren's recollection may be wrong.  I am in a position to clear up the point raised by Senator Farren now.  This question of £50 arises in two places in the Act.  It comes in under Sub-section (2) of Section 5, and, as originally introduced in the Seanad, the words were &ldquo;and may in addition be sentenced to a fine of £50.&rdquo;  Senator Farren moved an amendment striking out the word &ldquo;of&rdquo; and substituting &ldquo;not exceeding.&rdquo;  That amendment was accepted by the Government and it appears in the Bill, and I think it is possible that the Senator may have confused the two, as they both relate to the same subject matter.  Certainly the record of the Seanad is that the second amendment dealing with the £50 was not accepted by the Government.</P>

That amendment was put to the Seanad and defeated.  Immediately afterward I got up to move a similar amendment where the words occurred later in the same clause and the moment I got up to move the amendment the Minister said &ldquo;That is accepted,&rdquo; and I said &ldquo;I am much obliged,&rdquo; and sat down.  We were astonished here that he did not accept the previous amendment which was on identically the same terms.  That is my recollection of what transpired.  When the Minister said &ldquo;I will accept it.&rdquo;  I <Col N="2089" /> said &ldquo;There is no necessity to bother you with a speech.&rdquo;  It was never put.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I move in line 25 to substitute for the words &ldquo;any act, matter, or thing&rdquo; the words &ldquo;military acts.&rdquo;  The meaning of my amendment is that the Indemnity shall only be in respect of &ldquo;military acts&rdquo; committed during the trouble.  A similar amendment was moved in the Dáil but was turned down, and I have not the least doubt that a similar fate will meet this amendment here.  To quote an illustrious Senator, &ldquo;I only want to let the Seanad know what it is doing when passing this Bill.&rdquo;  This Indemnity Bill as passed by the Government is going to indemnify the Government and its forces for everything they did, without giving the chance to any other Parliament to say whether these things were right or wrong.  The Bill proposes to indemnify everybody acting on the side of the Government during the struggle for &ldquo;any act, matter or thing&rdquo; done.</P>
      <P>An Indemnity Bill is necessary.  That is understood, but this Bill is, I think, in many respects one of the most sweeping, if not the most sweeping, ever introduced. We know that there were many grisly tragedies enacted during the recent struggle and people acting on behalf of the Government are at least suspected. Some day it may be proved that they did acts which were not in the public interest and which certainly were not done in good faith, and which were grave crimes against human life and ordinary human and public morality. This Bill seeks to indemnify any person for any act he may have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite inaccurate.  For example if acts were done as you suggest in bad faith they are expressly excluded from the operations of the Bill because one of the provisions is &ldquo;provided it was done in good faith.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not overlooking that, but the person making a claim has to prove that it was not done in good faith.  The extraordinary thing is that you have got to prove the negative. <Col N="2094" /> A man can state he did the act in good faith and you have to prove that inwardly in his mind the act was done for some other reason.  If the expression &ldquo;military act&rdquo; was used one could understand, but the Bill gives absolute <i>carte blanche</i> to people to do acts and deeds of any sort, ridiculous deeds, such as going in and smashing up the furniture in a house.  A man who did so can say he was doing it in the interest of the State and in good faith.  It leaves a citizen open to be maltreated and subjected to all sorts of violence and abuse if these words are left in.  I think the Bill should be confined to &ldquo;military acts&rdquo; committed under orders of a superior officer or someone on their behalf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Seanad that much the same opposition as we have here was offered in the Dáil to this Bill, and much of the same sort of vague amendment was put down.  If a military act be intended to mean an act performed by a person in military uniform, or a person under the control of the military or something of that sort we would understand what was meant by it.  I think the Seanad must consider the nature of the opposition to the Bill in the Dáil and the nature of the opposition here.  In the Dáil we were informed that quite a large number of what has been termed in the Seanad &ldquo;grisly affairs&rdquo; have occurred during the last twelve months.  One would naturally come to the conclusion that during the last twelve months a list of heinous offences could be alleged against persons acting, or purporting to act on behalf of the Government, in the suppression of the rebellion.  I deny that point blank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few, or a comparatively small number of cases have been alleged against the Government or against Government supporters&mdash;a relatively small and insignificant number.  These are held up <Col N="2095" /> to public odium and criticism and to the discredit of the Government and the military without one single sentence of condemnation for the other side, leaving people to believe that practically all the acts of aggression during the last twelve months were committed either by or on behalf of the Government.  I submit that that is an unfair picture of what we have experienced during that period and a very unfair picture.  There were cases in which furniture was broken up.  From what investigations I have been able to make the number of cases amount to about nine.  I did not countenance and do not wish to get immunity for any person or for anybody so engaged, but I do say that in one case in the constituency that I represent a house was burned by Irregulars.  The following night the houses of three Irregulars were burned.  The night after every Irregular in the country had his furniture in the out-offices.  No other houses were burned there.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said so, nor do I know whether the Senator would approve it in the same case.  I present the picture for the consideration of the Seanad, and even with that experience before the Government we did not adopt what, in the view of a great many people of this country, would have been the correct method of dealing with a matter of that sort.  As far as I know six cases were reported to me in Dublin. I do know that on one occasion when a house belonging to a very dear friend of mine was burned the proposition was put to me that the houses of a half-a-dozen Irregulars should be &ldquo;sent up.&rdquo; I said no, certainly not.  If that had been done I believe it would have stopped the thing, but we could not mortgage the good name of the people of this country by such methods, and we had to put up with the loss that was occasioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not seeking in this Bill for immunity for offences committed by persons under our control.  There are many exhaustive provisos in the Bill.  We are asking for an indemnity for our troops and for our officials similar to that we granted to the British troops and to the <Col N="2096" /> British officials in January or February of this year.  I think the Bill is in its terminology practically the same, with scarcely any difference between them. Having regard to the hard, difficult and arduous time that our troops and our officials have had this is the least we could ask on their behalf.</P>
    <P>In September last year, after due notice, several resolutions were passed in the Dáil directing the Army to provide committees, tribunals, or military courts to try certain persons.  There was no statutory authority given to those committees, tribunals or military courts.  The military officers appointed to these courts did their duty by the terms of the resolution we passed.  It was not statutory. They had not come to us to ask for this Bill and they made no conditions, when they were discharging their duties, that a Bill of this kind should pass.  I put it to the members of the Seanad, knowing the difficult time through which we have passed, and the circumstances through which we secured the co-operation of these officers, are we justified in going to the country without an indemnity Act of this kind?  If they are satisfied that that is a matter which should be dealt with by the next Parliament that is their responsibility.  I say that it is our bounden duty to present this Bill for the consideration of the Seanad and ask them to pass it, to vindicate the honour of the Government, not the political Government but the State, and to show the people, who have assisted us in suppressing this disturbance, that their act has met with the approval of the highest institution in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has said that we were only attacking the acts of the Government, or rather the party to which he belongs, whatever that may mean.  He thought that we were not saying one word about the other side and we thereby imputed all the crime, if there be any, to the Government.  I do not think that is fair.  I do not think that anybody in either House has made such a statement.  I believe that members of the Seanad condemned strongly, perhaps more strongly, what has happened on the other side than what has happened on this.  I would say that, probably, a thousand times more has been done by the other side than had been done by this, and I make no secret of that, nor do I <Col N="2097" /> slide over it in the slightest bit, but if the other side&mdash;the Irregulars&mdash;were to come forward with an Indemnity Bill to this Seanad I would insist on some sort of enquiry, and I would refer to their actions as I would refer to these which I have had occasion to refer to.  I make no accusations against the Government or against the Army in these matters.  We are under the difficulty of not knowing what is in this Bill.  If this Bill means an indemnity to a great many things that have been done I am willing.  If it means the acts of any officers, police or anybody else under direct orders of superiors I am willing.  It may be all in the Bill.  If it means an indemnity to all sorts of irregular things done by all sorts of people without orders, and done merely because they had good intentions I do not agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Moore before he spoke had read the sub-sections of Clause One he would have seen that the criminal actions so far as one could judge are not indemnified by the Bill. The sub-section means, apparently, that anybody who has been injured criminally, and not in genuine good faith and not under orders, has a right hereafter to plead the clauses of this Bill.  I do not think that criminal action such as Colonel Moore has pointed to will be protected. I was rather astonished to hear Senator O'Farrell opposing an Indemnity Bill of this class because there is no doubt that we were with him on a good many of his remarks, and regarding the indemnity which we hope to see on both sides.  We must remember that before very long I have no doubt we will have proposals on the subject of an indemnity as regards the political prisoners now in gaol from Senator O'Farrell.  He will, undoubtedly, try to get us to back him up, and at the proper time and when it is safe he will receive our cordial and most appreciable consideration of the case when he puts it, but when he does that he will have to remember that if he opposes this Bill where, undoubtedly, the ordinary citizen believes that the men who committed these acts ought to have this indemnity we might hold the same views of the acts of those now in gaol.  It will take a great deal larger measure to pass an indemnity for all those in prison than it will to pass an indemnity for those who by their acts have secured the peace which we now have, and I do not think it is wise for any <Col N="2098" /> section of the Seanad at present to oppose an indemnity for those who acted under Government orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of Senator Jameson's statement because I think it is the general feeling of the Seanad that it would not be in the interests of peace or good Government to refuse this Indemnity Act, but we should make it clear when passing it that we are acting as in the case of other Bills because of its urgency, and that there has been no opportunity of considering it in detail. The question of good faith is the kernel of the whole Act and I would not like to suggest it here that the breaking of furniture could have been done in good faith or that the persons who sent these persons intended them to do so.  There is one point I should like the Minister if possible to make a little more clear.  In Section 2 it makes it clear that a statement signed by the Executive Council shall be evidence of certain matters.  That I think is reasonable.  The second Sub-section of Section 2 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any such act, matter, or thing as aforesaid, if done by or under the authority of a person holding office under or employed in the service of the Provisional Government or of the Government of Saorstát Eireann shall be deemed to have been done in good faith unless the contrary is proved.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If that applies to an act certified by the Minister I would not quarrel with it.  But if it refers to all the acts I certainly would.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The meaning of my amendment is explained fully by the statement of the President who is always pleasingly frank in his opinions.  He drew the picture of the houses of Irregulars being burned and said that immediately a marvellous improvement took place in the district.  He did not quite state that it was a proper act which could come under this Indemnity Bill, but he asked the Seanad to draw a moral.  It is quite conceivable that all such acts of that kind would come in provided that you could prove that the person committing them was acting in good faith.  One can visualise to what extent that could be carried.  A man could be slaughtered in his house simply because it was thought that he was an Irregular.  As a matter of fact he might have been the reverse.  That is not an extreme case because such things have been done.  We have all heard the terrible tale of the three men who were found <Col N="2100" /> on the outskirts of Dublin.  I heard of a case where one unfortunate man was taken out and done to death simply because he happened to be of the same name and lived in the same district as another.</P>
      <P>Does not the Seanad see that encouragement might be given to irregular acts of members of the Army?  The President says that the houses of four Irregulars were burned.  How was it known that those were Irregulars?  Does not that leave the whole community open to be the subject of acts of this kind owing to the alleged misconduct of the Irregulars?  Senator Jameson is not right when he takes it for granted that I am to introduce a Bill for the amnesty of prisoners.  I have no connection with them and if it were not for the people I represent neither the President nor Senator Jameson would be in their places to-day.  If Labour had not stood solid and remained firm the public safety would not have been assured merely by the passing of an Act.  It is an old custom for the Minister to fling taunts of this kind at us that we are aiding Irregularism. That is very unfair, and Senator Jameson, although he did not intend it, seemed to insinuate that we had sympathies with Irregularism.  We are becoming inured to that, and no taunts or criticisms of that kind are going to to debar us from moving amendments and making criticisms when we think them proper.  If it were not for the attitude we have adopted both Houses would be merely a sham from the point of view of being representative institutions. We have discharged our duties and Ministers, if they think fit, may taunt us with sympathies with Irregularism, but that will not deter us.</P>

      <P>I quite understand the difficulty that non-legal minds have in following this procedure. Might I say that the explanation is this. A resolution of this kind must be passed apparently at the same time as the Bill is passed.  The resolution with regard to the Public Safety Bill was not passed in this Seanad when the Bill was passed. It was overlooked in both Houses, and that is the reason why this Bill was dealt with this morning in the Seanad. Now, we had a new Bill and the Government are not going to make the mistake they made with the other one in not having the resolution of urgency contemporaneous with the passing of the Bill and accordingly this resolution has to be contemporaneously passed with the Bill now before us.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Government's Law Advisors and themselves are to be congratulated on the amount of wisdom we have witnessed this day.  As to the necessity of the resolution, is it seriously contended that it is necessary?  If it was necessary to put this extraordinary Indemnity Bill through it is extraordinary why this Bill was not introduced at an earlier stage.  One cannot get out of one's mind the suspicion that a lot of these Bills, some of them small, some large but all very important, have been held up to the very last days of the session of the Oireachtas and then rushed through obviously precluding us from having any proper discussion on them or <Col N="2104" /> putting up any amendments to them. It is of course a pretty old game and one that has been carried to excess in this case.  Now we are faced with this resolution moved here to-day without notice of any kind.  Even when the Bill was introduced there was not a word about a resolution of this kind being introduced, consequently I am going to vote against it.</P>

You could tell us perhaps that if this Bill is not passed a lot of people would be put into prison but that has nothing to do with peace and the preservation of peace.  I am not voting for or against this Bill because I have not read it, and decline to have anything to do with it.</P>

      <P>I would like to assure the Seanad that the Government has not wilfully or otherwise kept back legislation with a view to deluging both Houses of the Oireachtas with it now. We have introduced legislation according as it was ready.  I think it will be admitted that during the last 12 months very much more work had to be done than mere legislation.  The consideration of legislation before it is brought forward here takes a very long time and it is quite possible in the first few years of our existence that some complications may arise.  I do not at all subscribe to the interpretation that has been put upon such legislation as has been passed either here or in other places but that is a matter to be dealt with at another time.</P>

One cannot help thinking, or making comparisons erroneously it may be if this resolution is to be passed what has been done with the Military Defence Bill must be wrong.  I think we will have to have another amending Bill to-morrow morning in the case of the Defence Bill.

      <P>I might mention to the Seanad that the only remaining matter to be disposed of to-day is the Report Stage and the passing into law of the Land Bill, 1923.  I understand that considerable concessions are to be made by the Government when the Bill is being considered in Report and the official staff are at present engaged with the Minister in drafting the necessary amendments carrying out the agreed changes.  That will require a little time and I think Senators would require to have copies of them in their hands before they are asked to pass them.  Accordingly I suggest to the Seanad that it would be convenient after this motion has been dealt with to adjourn until after 2 o'clock when I understand from the Minister that he will be prepared to go on with these amendments, and that meanwhile they will be available to Senators.</P>

I would like very much that both Houses would sit out to-night and finish the business.  Failing that I will have to encroach upon the undertaking I gave to Deputy Johnson in the Dáil that we would not sit next week.  I had to qualify that by saying that it would be necessary for us to sit one day.  If that be so, I should say that we will sit on Wednesday. It will not occupy much time, and Thursday will be the latest day on which the Dissolution could take place.</P>

      <P>Before I take up the ordinary business, perhaps, I might be permitted to say that since the adjournment, it must have come as a great shock to Senators, and also with a deep sense of sorrow and regret, to hear that the President of the United States has passed away.  In view of the close and intimate relations that have always existed between the people of this country and the people of the great nation of the United States of America, perhaps, the Seanad may think it proper that a resolution should be passed expressing our sorrow and tendering our sympathy to the people of the United States on the death of one who was a great statesman, a great leader and a man of unblemished reputation both in public and private life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir T. ESMONDE Sir T. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir T. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil will shortly be engaged in passing a resolution of sympathy with the people of the United States on the sudden and lament able death of President Harding, and it is only right and fitting that the Seanad should adopt the same course, if for no other reason than the long ties of sympathy and affection which have bound our country to the United States.  Ireland owes very much to the United States.  On the other hand the United States owes not a little to Ireland.  Whatever happens in one country reacts in the other, and whatever grief one country has the other country feels.  It is not my place, and this is not the occasion, to go into an obituary of President Harding, but what we do recognise is that he was the official head of that great nation with which our country has always been on the best terms of friendship, from the days of the War of Independence down to the present time.  It is only right and proper, therefore, that we should express our sorrow at this sad event.  In that spirit I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Eireann desires to place on record the expression of its deep regret at the sudden death of President Harding, and to convey to the people of the United States of America its deep sympathy with them in the national loss they have thereby sustained.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the vote of sympathy.  Ireland and America are united together by every bond of sympathy and blood.  The people of America are more Irish than they are anything else.  America received our people when they were starving and dying.  They went there in thousands and built themselves up into a great nation. There is hardly a single family in the West or South of Ireland that has not got relatives or friends in America.  Every <Col N="2109" /> village in Ireland almost gets letters from America every day, so that we are in constant communication with every part of America.  Therefore, we feel very deeply everything that may strike at the Government or people of the United States.</P>

      <P>Section 19, Sub-Section (2): To add after the word &ldquo;year&rdquo; in line 22 the words &ldquo;save that in a case where payment of the yearly rent in one annual sum after the second gale day of the year is customary, one half-year's rent out of the amount paid after the second gale day in the year 1920 shall not be so appropriated.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment was one which the Minister I think said he would accept but he did suggest that we might disturb the whole of the arrears Clauses by inserting it.  I understand, however, that the Dáil cannot re-open the whole Section and can only deal with this amendment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question I would like to leave absolutely free to the Seanad.  I will just put the case as I see it quite frankly.  The proviso which Senator Sir J. Keane seeks to amend reads: &ldquo;Provided that any payments made by the tenant after the second gale day in the year 1920, shall be appropriated to the rent which accrued since the first gale day in that year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That might be looked at from two points of view.  One point of view is this: a tenant is paying his rent half-yearly, regularly for 10 or 15 years. Some 6 or 7 years ago he got into two or three years' arrears.  The landlord might not have pressed him for one reason or another.  The receipts given on the basis of the arrears showed that the rent was anti-dated by 3 years.  It would be hardly fair that such a man should be asked to pay the three years' arrears now.  He would have to pay if the Section remains as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. That was one point of view from which this proviso might be looked at.  The other is that any rent paid within three years should be appropriated to the three years.  It was argued from both points of view.  This proviso was carried, and I am sure was supported both from the first and second points of view.  From the point of view of the people who voted, that any rent paid within a three years' period should be appropriated to that period, the amendment would not carry out their wishes.  I am not saying whether that is right or wrong, but I say that different reasons actuated different people for leaving the arrears clause as it stands.  If a man voted for this proviso: &ldquo;Provided that any payment made by the tenant after the second gale day in the year 1920, shall be appropriated to the rent which accrued since the first gale day in that year,&rdquo; on the ground that any rent paid within the three years should be appropriated to the three years' period he would say that a man who paid a year's rent in November should get a receipt up to the following May, I will be quite frank and say that was not my meaning.  I know there was the other point of view, but I did not anticipate the case which Senator <Col N="2111" /> Sir John Keane quoted to me afterwards. Under all these circumstances, and in view of the fact that agreements about arrears are always agreements based on expediency and could be attacked, from a great many points of view, and in view of the fact that there are all sorts and conditions of people, who want to open up the arrears question for all sorts and conditions of reasons, I put it to the Seanad to consider whether it would be good business to re-open the arrears question, for the sake of the comparatively few cases where the loss of a half-year's rent in three will be suffered as a result of the proviso.  If the Seanad approves of Senator Sir John Keane's amendment I will do my best to have it carried in the Dáil.  I will put the question before the Dáil as strongly as I can. If the Seanad on the other hand thinks the other thing should be done, it is a matter for them.</P>

      <P>I move: Section 24, Sub-Section (2) to insert after the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; in line 8 the words &ldquo;town park used solely for dairying purposes or.&rdquo;  The object I wish to attain in this amendment is to enable people in the country towns and also in the big towns, if possible, to obtain pure milk close to where they live.  My reason for wishing to have this amendment added to the Sub-Section is that it is almost impossible for the poor people in poor parts of a country town to obtain milk easily and with dispatch.  The result is that children are not attended to properly.  They do not get proper nourishment, and in many cases they are often given the most extraordinary liquid.  I mentioned this case to the Minister, and I wish to mention it to the Seanad.  In a town in my part of the country a young mother was in a bar attached to a grocer's shop. It was a place where women of the country very often drink.  She had a puling infant in her arms.  She was drinking porter and put the porter to the infant's lips and the infant drank some of it. Someone said to her, &ldquo;Why did you do that,&rdquo; and the mother answered, &ldquo;Sure it would not do any harm.&rdquo;<Col N="2112" /> Later someone told the district nurse of this as the child was getting thinner and thinner.  There are funds to deal with this sort of case and a bottle and milk were got for the child and it is now living and well.  I know the difficulties that attach to the Minister in regard to this.  He will say in some cases that the town parks are wanted to increase the size of the town and in other cases it might interfere with the tenancies of tenanted or untenanted land.  I should like to hear what he says to my amendment before I answer him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We dealt with these questions very fully on Colonel Hutcheson Poe's amendment.  Tenanted land near a town will not vest as such if it has any potential or actual value as building ground.  That disposes, I think, of the question of public policy about town parks.  There is then the question of tenanted land that has no potential value as building ground and on which cows are grazing.  The fact that we vest the holding in the tenant under the Act will not prevent him from keeping cows. Now if there is untenanted land near a town which is of any potential or actual value as building ground and which has been used by the landlords for the use of cows in order to sell milk to the towns people the Land Commission has power to take land invested in Trustees including the public authorities for pasturage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment opens up the question that has been debated for some time with regard to appeals from the decision of the Judicial Commissioner.  That is to say he is a judge and we know who he is and this is an appeal to that Judicial Commissioner under this Sub-section. This was debated over and over again, and there is a feeling amongst those who hold land in this country that there should be some sort of appeal because&mdash;I do not wish to state it but it <Col N="2113" /> has been stated&mdash;the Judicial Commissioner will be judge, jury and general decider upon everything connected with the Bill.  We want a Court of Appeal, a superior Court, and I myself have every confidence in the Court of Appeal of this country, and therefore that is the reason I wish for this appeal.  I hope the Minister will inform me what he is prepared to do with regard to this question which I consider an important question and which I heard argued in another place across the water many a time on many and many a Land Bill.</P>

And then I will go on and ask him if there were a single perch of land bought under any Land Act at the price resulting in such an annuity, would land purchase have been possible at all?

      <P>I do not see why, that being so, land that has never been through the furnace of land purchase should merely by reason of that fact be acquired at a different price from land which is retained as tenanted land under this Bill.  I cannot see the justice of that <Col N="2116" /> case.  The Minister has pointed out the difficulties of financing any scheme of settlement if he pays the market price, but he will have to do so in the case of any holdings that are resumed and he will also have to do so in the case of equivalent holdings, presumably, purchased at a market price, and in the case of any holdings which may be acquired for the relief of congestion.  If that objection applies in those two cases surely it should apply also to the third case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Strictly speaking, there is something to be said for Sir John Keane's point of view in an academic way.  But remember now he is just arguing against land purchase since the Ashbourne Acts were first passed, for some reason or another.  I do not propose to cover the whole period of Irish history since 1885.  For some reason or another it has been decided and is a closed issue that as a matter of public policy all untenanted land should be transferred from the land-owners to the tenants.  That is an issue that has been before the public for 30 years, and it is accepted now by all parties.  You do not expect me to argue the whole general question of Land Purchase and the reasons which actuated the various English Governments since 1885, in adopting a policy of the transferring of land from the land-owners to the tenants and congests.  That is exactly the case.  The reasons he opposes it now are reasons that are equally potent against every Land Purchase Act that was ever considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that point of view.  In the case of land purchase it is admitted that the tenant has acquired the tenant-right, and the basis of purchase is quite different.  The landlord's right is only limited by virtue of the fact that the tenant has been given tenant-right.  There is also the equivalent of tenant-right attaching to untenanted land.  The owner of untenanted land has effected improvements which are in equity similar to those put into the land by the tenant.  For that reason I would argue that the two cases are not in any way comparable.</P>

      <P>Perhaps before moving the amendment, you would allow me to state that I do not think that the Minister has fairly met the case that was made yesterday, that a man ought to be a judge and jury in his own case. It is perfectly idle to say that the Judicial Commissioner of the Land Commission&mdash;I know that in the present holder we have the greatest confidence&mdash;but he will not always be there, and it is perfectly idle to say that he as head of the Land Commission is not responsible for the efficient carrying out of its policy. Like Senator Jameson, I cannot agree with the Minister when he said that the Bill would be wrecked if an appeal were allowed.  I do not care to whom the appeal is.  All I want is an appeal to some other person than the head of the Land Commission.  That is absolutely essential.  I have already said this, but even at the danger of reiterating things I say it again.  I would like to point out that there would be no more use in going to the head of a body of that sort and asking for a revision of what had been done by subordinate officials, than there would be in going to the chair-man of a company asking him to reverse the decision already arrived at by his own officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a most unjust thing and from the view point of the Free State it would be a most injurious thing for the credit of the Free State if it went out to the public and the people outside Ireland that we were prepared to do an injustice to anybody.  Undoubtedly an injustice under this section might arise.  I told you of a case yesterday of which I was aware in which the Congested Districts Board had power to take certain lands.  They proposed to take these lands and they proposed to take them at a price which was fixed by an inspector of their own.  Now the returns of what that land had yielded were available for 30 years.  The price suggested was utterly inadequate having regard to those returns which were unimpeachable. When they found that they would have to face a petition to some independent <Col N="2118" /> party they abandoned the purchase altogether. On the question of compulsory purchase I have never known of a case in which any Public Department was given power to expatriate compulsorily a person at an infinitely less price than the property was worth.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly certain that if a clause of that sort is allowed to go through in this Land Bill that the effect of it on the credit of the Saorstát is this: We have enemies elsewhere who will argue, &ldquo;Oh what is the use of lending money to a country that is prepared to confiscate the property of individuals?  Here in their own Acts which they have just passed they take power to do so and what security can they offer for a further loan?&rdquo; That argument will be used and in the interests of the Free State, as in the interests of justice which is a thing that this Seanad holds very dearly. I am perfectly satisfied and certain that it would be inadvisable to allow a Bill of this kind to go through without allowing an appeal from the decision of the Judicial Commissioner, to somebody else.  I do not care who that somebody else is so long as he is independent.  I do not care if it is a Judge of the High Court, a valuer, or whatever he may be, or if it is the Court of Appeal.  But I want to be able to appeal to an independent umpire, and I am perfectly certain that by allowing that appeal, confidence will be increased in the fair dealings of the Free State by the introduction of such a clause.  My amendment is that an appeal should be allowed from the decision of the Judicial Commissioner to the Court of Appeal.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I am really going out of my way in saying what I am going to say.  But I am very anxious that the Seanad should realise the difficulty of the position in which the Minister is placed, and at the same time I would like to press upon him a suggestion which I think would meet all the legitimate suggestions to be urged by this Seanad, and which would be a distinct and substantial improvement in the Bill. <Col N="2119" /> I have had for my good or evil fortune to take part in administration from the point of view of the lawyer in all these Land Purchase Appeals since 1881, and I must say this that I never knew or heard of any just cause of complaint against the Judicial Head of the Land Commission in regard to the fixing and ascertaining of compensation.  I can well understand the advantage the Ministry will see in having a judicial personage who, by daily contact with this question will be able to lay down certain principles of valuation and compensation and not leaving the thing to be largely a matter of haphazard decision of a different judge to-day and another to-morrow.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I also find that as a result of practical experience and with the very best intentions a Judicial Commissioner, like any other judge, would go wrong in considering the question whether certain elements of property that the owner alleged had a value, and where questions of that kind involving matters of law would come up, it is inevitable that the Judicial Commissioner's opinion would be from time to time, as it turned out to be on investigation by the Court of Appeal, erroneous.  In all the interests of justice, I suggest all the difficulties in this matter, that have surrounded this complicated question, would be met if the Minister was prepared to accept an amendment which could be put in at the end of the Bill to the effect that the Judicial Commissioner should be the sole Judge of all questions of fact, and that an appeal should be allowed to the Court of Appeal on pure questions of law.  Again, I want to point out that the Minister is considering that, and he ought not to be rushed.  He will have full opportunity to consider it before the Report Stage is over.</P>

      <P>What was suggested by the Cathaoirleach would certainly be a strong improvement.  Senator Barrington referred to depreciation of security by confiscation.  I think, from the concessions which the Minister made and promised to us, that any person who is disturbed from his holding is to <Col N="2120" /> get an equivalent holding elsewhere, and that will delete any possible chance of confiscation.  On that point I take issue with Senator Barrington.  I do not think there can be confiscation, and I do not think the security of the country, once we get the amendments promised by the Minister, will be affected.</P>

      <P>Even though I cannot say without a little consideration what I have to say on the very important question which the Cathaoirleach has raised, I do want to say that it is nothing short of absurd for a responsible Senator like Senator Barrington to stand up and say that if this Bill passes in its present form people outside Ireland will say &ldquo;What is the use of lending Ireland money when over there they are confiscating the people's land?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a cheap thing to say, in view of the fact that at least five times it was stated here that thirteen millions out of the twenty million acres of land in Ireland are purchased. It is also being repeatedly stated that it is mandatory on us under the Bill, in the event of our touching any of that thirteen million acres, to give an equally suitable and not less valuable substitute holding.  In face of that you will have a responsible Senator stating here that outsiders will say we are confiscat- the land.  Confiscation is a word that has been bandied about.  I had to use it myself, and I did so, I may claim, with effect when I was preparing the Bill.  I was faced with it definitely, or with something approaching it.  Now we have Senators coming along and talking about confiscation in view of what has been said.  All that I have to say is that Senator Barrington is living in a fool's paradise, and he is actually asking for it.  I pointed out to Senator Counihan that he was making a demand which was never made by the most conservative landlord in the House of Lords at any time.</P>

      <P>I may say on that question that the Senator's price was scarcely approached by that of the most conservative and relentless enemy of land purchase since the Act of 1885. There is just one other point.  Apparently all the difference between confiscation and something that is not confiscation is an appeal from one High Court Judge to another.  Senator Barrington's speech comes to that.  I am not going to waste the time of the Seanad in saying what Senator Barrington is unable to contradict, except by making general statements, that the Judicial Commissioner's position has been carefully safeguarded by every Act that referred to him, and that his functions as an arbitrator between the Land Commission and the vendor are being carefully safeguarded and carefully defined with a view to leaving him as impartial as possible.  If Senator Barrington thinks that human nature is so weak that because a man lives in the Land Commission, and because he happens to be called a Judicial Commissioner&mdash;I invite him to state any other reason that he may have&mdash;even though he is a Judge of the High Court, he will not be so impartial as any other High Court Judge.  If that is the suggestion, then I cannot get next any man who holds that opinion, and consequently I cannot argue against it.</P>

He says he is astonished that a man in the responsible position of Senator Barrington should make certain statements, and that apparently I have not read certain Bills.  If I wanted to make a cheap point I might say very much against a Minister in his responsible position who is so unaware of the criticisms that are abroad all over the world.  I have just come back from another country, where I have had to take up the cudgels in favour of the Free State over and over again, and I have had to answer criticisms of the very sort that the Minister is astonished at.</P>

There are allegations that we are confiscating, and there is no doubt whatsoever about that.  I gave a concrete case, which the Minister up to this has failed to reply to.  In that case, if an appeal did not exist, some more of the land would have been confiscated. There is another point.  In any of these large undertakings the provision of capital has to be provided for.  No sane man would provide capital when he knows that next day the Minister might come in and deprive him of half, or almost the whole, of that capital, and the only protection that exists against that being done is the provision of an umpire.  I do not care who that umpire may be, but there should be an appeal to somebody else on the question of price.  That is absolutely essential. There should be an appeal to somebody else on the question of price if the Bill is not to be a confiscatory Bill.</P>

      <P>I venture to suggest that the Judicial Commissioner himself might not be unwilling to have somebody behind him who might give an opinion on these matters.  Surely he is being put in an extremely difficult position. With every desire that he naturally would have to do justice, he would be confronted in many cases with what might very properly, from the office point of view, be a conservative and rather low valuation of the land in question. On the other hand, he would, no doubt, get from the owner probably an inflated idea of the value of the land. There would be thousands of cases, and it would be quite impossible for him to go into all the details.  He would naturally <Col N="2123" /> be very unwilling to let down those who are under him in the office.  If he felt that his opinion might not always be absolutely right, and that there was somebody behind him to whom an appeal could be made, I should think it would be rather a comfort to him.</P>

      <P>The real difficulty in this case is, as Senator MacLysaght has put it, that we are debating a question which the Minister has given his opinion on.  He has told us how far he is inclined to meet this question of appeal. I take it that matter is now before his Legal Adviser, and the Chairman has stated that, in his opinion, the question of law is the one thing that would really check iniquities.  What Senator Barrington is forcing a decision on now is on the question of whether we will oppose the Minister on this matter of an appeal on price.  The difficulty there seems to be this.  If a decision was given one way by the Judicial Commissioner one class would at once begin appealing against every decision of the Commissioner. If a decision was given the other way, another class would rush in with appeals.  I admit that when speaking on the subject before I did not think there would be many of those appeals, but I recognise now that if a decision was given on appeal, one way or the other, it would entail at once a large number of appeals, and it would interfere with the working of the Bill.  I was trying to find out whether we would be injuring the working of the Bill if we adopted amendments such as this, and I am convinced now, if an appeal is allowed on the question of price, that quite a small decision may lead to an interminable amount of law and delay. Therefore, I am not prepared to vote against the Minister on this amendment. We have debated it so completely and absolutely that I do not think we are helping matters by discussing it any further.</P>

It is a matter of the principles upon which the price is based, and that is the point he raised.  If the Minister is willing to concede that, I think there would not be <Col N="2124" /> very much more to discuss.

      <P>A surprising statement has been made by Senator Barrington that people in other countries are considerably agitated by the confiscatory principles contained in this Bill.  I do not know whether copies of the Bill have been circulated to all classes all over the world or even in the neighbouring countries, or how this confiscatory idea came to be so generally discussed.  We have now got to the point as to whether there should be an appeal on the matter of price from the decision of the Judicial Commissioner.  Anybody having any practical experience of Land Court business&mdash;I have had a slight experience&mdash; will know that there is everything to be said for the view taken by the Minister, and endorsed by the Chairman, who has had a very lengthy experience of the matter, that it is the man who is brought into touch daily with the fixing of prices who is the most competent.  The evidence given by valuers on one side or the other in these land cases is very puzzling indeed to the casual listener, and makes him wonder whether, under any circumstances, any Judge, no matter how astute he might be, could arrive at a fair decision in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time and again I have heard evidence given by the valuer for the tenant that the land had only a prairie value&mdash;no value at all&mdash;and, on the other hand, the valuer on the other side giving what he considered to be a fair value.  The wide difference between the two baffles the ordinary man and makes him wonder how any Judge could arrive at anything like an equitable decision.  So that it becomes a sort of intuitive thing on the part of the Judge in assessing the value and weight to be attached to evidence of that kind.  The human element comes into the consideration of it.  It is only by being in constant touch with these matters and sizing up the weight to be attached to witnesses, that a Judge arrives at something like a fair decision. That particular equipment and experience <Col N="2125" /> does not come within the range of the Court of Appeal Judge, who, five days in the week, is engaged on Probate and other matters of law.  He would be confronted with this sort of impossible evidence, and that is the only evidence he has to go upon.  He has not got the training of the Judicial Commissioner, and the intuitive instinct born of dealing with these matters daily.  I think that an appeal to a Judge less equipped than the Judicial Commissioner would entirely dislocate the whole structure of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to agree with the last speaker on the question of appeal.  Personally I do not see that a great deal is to be gained by an appeal on the question.  The amendment does not remove my objection. What I object to is the definition and the direction to the Judge as to how the price is to be assessed.  I have been trying to put myself in the position of the Judicial Commissioner.  The matter depends upon what the proposals of the Government are with regard to financing the transaction.  We have had no indication of that.  If the Government say to the Land Commissioners, &ldquo;We are prepared to finance the buildings or any additional expenditure on the land out of the taxpayer's pocket,&rdquo; the position of the Judicial Commissioner would be altogether different to what it would be if the Government say, &ldquo;You have got to fix a price that will enable the tenant to pay an annuity and interest which will not only cover the price paid to the vendor, but also the price to cover perhaps a house or buildings.&rdquo;  That is a very important point, as to which we have had no indication of the policy of the Government.  If the Government say, &ldquo;Our intention is not in any way to finance housing or stock-in-trade for the incoming settler,&rdquo; I do not see how that can be done when it is the intention to put on these lands landless men. Unless the Government are to place an intolerable imposition on the taxpayer they will have to fix such a price on the land as will enable them to finance it, as the Minister said, like a Stock Exchange transaction.  That is left in the hands of the Executive.  We have no indication of the policy of the Government in the matter, and for that reason I have a great apprehension that the direction <Col N="2126" /> to the Judge will create apprehension in the minds of people who are accommodated by banks and other accommodating houses.</P>

      <P>It is easy to propound dilemmas.  One would think we were legislating in a vaccum, or playing draughts, and could bring in any sort of ideal scheme that would be without any defects.  It comes to this, must land purchase be completed?  In all the circumstances of the case, and in view of the influences that are likely to be brought to bear on that question, not to-day or to-morrow, but for the next three or four years, can this question be left unsettled?  Must certain land be bought for the relief of congestion?  Do you think we can afford to leave things as they are; in other words, to let things drift?  As business men, do you think that the situation can be left as it is? Must we do something to complete land purchase and buy a certain amount of untenanted land to relieve congestion? If you think we must, and that we cannot stop and say, &ldquo;That is the sort of thing the English Government would do, but an Irish Government is not going to do anything of the kind,&rdquo; I think you would have to admit that we must make some attempt to buy some untenanted land for the purpose of relieving congestion.  We have to buy land.  You know perfectly well that even if this Bill is not passed, another Bill will be passed, and that some other Land Commission or some other Government or Dáil will deal with the question. What is the price?  Senator Sir John Keane put me in a dilemma.  I will put him in another.  He wants to know if it is the market price, and shows how the landlord will not get exactly the price he might get under other circumstances. He wants to know what will be taken into account and what will not be taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator stated that the whole thing depended upon the price we could give for the land.  I want to ask the Senator this question.  Does he remember what happened all during last year, and the agitation about the price <Col N="2127" /> of tenanted land?  Even within the last fortnight, much to my surprise, certain people changed their minds on the question of price very radically who formerly thought that the tenants should buy their holdings for half their value or for next to nothing.  We stood up to that tendency with some success, and put certain figures in the Bill with regard to price.  I suppose if we examined it very carefully we could put figures in the Bill saying what should be the price of untenanted land.  It would be difficult to do it.  I want to ask Senator John Keane does he think he will get a fair do from the Land Commission presided over by a High Court Judge called in as arbitrator in a dispute that must be settled, as to the price of a certain acreage of untenanted land, and told to fix a price which should be fair to the landlord and fair to the tenant in all the circumstances.  That is what we are doing now.  I do not know any other way of doing it, if I might say it, that would be fair to the vendor.  I make no secret that we did try to protect the vendor's interest, and we tried to give him fair play.  The best arrangement that could be made was to leave it not between the landlord and the Unpurchased Tenants' Association, or some other body, but between the landlord and a tenant who wants the holding, with the High Court Judge as arbitrator.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of ancient monuments contained in Section 14 of the Irish Land Act of 1903 shall include any monument which in the opinion of the Land Commission is of archaeological interest and shall where the <Col N="2130" /> Land Commission so declares also include the site for the monument and such portion of the land adjoining it as is necessary to prevent injury and afford access.</P>
    <P>I think it will be unnecessary for me to waste the time of the Seanad in dealing with the subject.  I had something to do with the insertion of a somewhat similar clause in the Land Act of 1903. I understand now that the Inspector of the Land Commission himself reports on these monuments, and I hope the Government will see that he does so thoroughly, for I know cases where admirable monuments have not been inspected.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Yeats for assisting me on this matter, and I also thank the Government for the reception they have been good enough to give to the proposal I recently put forward before them.  I beg to second this motion.  There is no doubt our ancient monuments are amongst our most precious national possessions. Heretofore efforts have been made to preserve such monuments, and we have not altogether been unsuccessful, because the Board of Works have done valuable service to Irish antiquity, and, thanks to them, we have succeeded in preserving our chief monuments of antiquity.  There are a number of extremely interesting minor monuments, which, however, have escaped the notice of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ordnance Survey for many years have consistently and persistently done what they could to inform us as to the position of our ancient monuments, and in the revised sheets of the Ordnance Survey there is a splendid index to a great deal of our archaeological possessions. It is our duty, and that of the Oireachtas, to preserve our historical monuments, and we cannot afford to lose any chance we have of promoting their preservation.  This Land Bill gives us an opportunity of which naturally we are bound to take advantage, and what we are trying to do is more or less in the nature of a temporary expedient.  What should happen is, there ought to be a comprehensive Act passed for the purpose of preserving our national monuments. Until such time as the Oireachtas can devote attention to this I think we should do the best we can, and take <Col N="2131" /> advantage of the opportunities before us. This proposition goes somewhat further than anything up to the present that has been attempted.  It enables the Land Commission, with the assistance of the Board of Works, to take steps for the preservation of our minor antiquities, and to take further steps for the preservation of our greater antiquities that stand in need of repair and protection. Whatever cost is entailed in the protecting of our monuments or the scheduling of them, or making easier access to those monuments, will be borne by the Commission of Public Works.  When the Irish Government controls the Board of Works we expect they will be generous.</P>

I do not know a single one of those farms recently which has been a success.</P>
      <P>If that is the proposal, it will lead in a few short years to another group of congests.  In my native County of Kerry what has created the greatest congestion there is the fact that the owner of a small farm dies, and the farm is divided up between the sons.  Sometimes the places were worked jointly, and in some cases until they were purchased under the 1903 Act they were worked as individual holdings, and in no case were they a complete success.  They led to endless litigation and trouble.  What has occurred all through the years is that small holdings have been split up and divided amongst half-a-dozen families.  The Minister and the Land Commission ought to consider those facts very carefully when they are reviewing this matter.</P>

      <P>The powers for the apportionment of an annuity, or the discharge of portion of a holding from liability in respect of an annuity conferred on the Land Commission by Sub-section (3) of Section 38 of the Land Law (IreLand) Act, 1896, as extended by Sub-section (1) of Section 67 of the Irish Land Act, 1903, may be exercised by the Commissioners of Public Works as regards an annuity charged on a holding in repayment of an advance made by the said Commissioners for the purpose of the purchase thereof pursuant to the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870.</P>

      <P>I move the following; which I think the Minister agreed to in principle:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 70.  To add at the end of the Section the following: &ldquo;Provided always that any regulations made to carry out the provisions of this Act, in so far as they concern the relief of congestion, shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and if either House shall, within twenty-one days of such regulations being tabled, pass a Resolution annulling such regulations, such regulations shall be annulled; but such annulments shall not prejudice or invalidate any matter or thing previously done under such regulations.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment which deals with Section 70.  Now in fact that Section was not necessary at all, because there is already an Adaptation of Enactments Act passed giving the Executive Council power to adapt certain existing enactments to the new circumstances.  For instance, under the old Acts, particularly the Act of 1896, which refers to the matter, in the event of a Judicial Commissioner being absent the Lord Chancellor assigned another High Court Judge to do the work.  The Lord Chancellor's office is abolished and the Executive Council has power to adapt the particular Section of the 1896 Act which deals with that matter.  They make an order saying that the functions of the Lord Chancellor under that Section shall in future be carried out by the Lord Chief Justice.  I am sure in the new situation, when the old office is abolished and a new office created, it will be necessary to make various adaptations in the wording of the old Land Acts.  For instance, when some particular functionary was supposed to do a certain thing, and that functionary was no longer in existence, it will be now in the power of the Executive Council to make orders empowering the functionary which has been put in his place to do the work.  If we did not put in that Section their Orders in Council would have to be laid on the Table.  With a view to making it perfectly clear I am <Col N="2137" /> putting at the end: &ldquo;That every such order shall be laid before the Oireachtas in compliance with Section 19 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not think that quite covers what Sir John Keane wants.  You see these are orders of the Executive in dealing with migration and the exchange of offices.  What Sir John Keane is aiming at is the rules of court.  I think the regulations are too narrow of the Land Commission, because that would compel them to lay on the Table of the Oireachtas the most minute regulations.  The rules of court, I think, he has in mind.  I think if you provide for the rules of court that will be sufficient.</P>

It might, of course, enable them to introduce legislation for the purpose. In the form that Senator Sir J. Keane wants inserted it would be open to either House, once they are laid on the Table to move that they be annulled.  If any such resolution were carried they then would cease to have any effect.

The Land Commission make rules and regulations very often and it was never suggested before, except in one very important Section of one Act, under which they had to make regulations, that the rules should be laid on the Table of both Houses&mdash;that is the Irish Land Act of 1909, Section 4.  The regulations are the priority regulations, which are the most important ones.  Under that Section there was a Sub-Section (3) which stated &ldquo;every regulation made under this Section shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament as soon as may be after it is made.&rdquo;  That is the only case in which the Land Commission were ever asked to lay their rules on the Table of the Houses and that was in connection with a specific Section on a very important matter. Under this Bill a great number of rules will be made as a matter of administration&mdash;rules to say whether an appeal should be within four or five days and so forth.  All of these things are to be laid on the Table, and I am quite willing. Every rule and regulation that the Land Commission make we will lay it on the Table.</P>

If, as I say, the Seanad wants every rule that the Land Commission make laid on the Table, and to have the pleasure of annulling it, I take it, if it is not annulled, that the effects mentioned in the last few lines of Clause 10 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act take place, namely, that &ldquo;such Order shall have effect as if enacted under this Act.&rdquo;  Supposing these rules are laid on the Table and not annulled do they become Statutory? As I say, there are all sorts and conditions of footy rules of the Land Commission <Col N="2141" /> on very small points.

The Houses could not amend them, but could only reject them.  If, at the end of 21 days, they were not rejected, then they become law.  The Minister is now speaking about Rules of Court and other rules which I take it would be laid on the Table for the information of the Houses, but not for annulment, acceptance, or rejection.</P>

      <P>I move&mdash;Second Schedule&mdash;To delete the words &ldquo;6 Ed. VII. Cap. 37, Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1906.&rdquo;  This is the little repealer tucked away in the Second Schedule to which I drew attention yesterday.  It takes out from Clause 19 of the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1906, these words &ldquo;provided that any pre-existing tenancy under the Labourers Acts of the applicant for the advance shall be determined before the advance is made, and that the applicant has paid all rent due by him in respect of such tenancy.&rdquo;  As I said before that can be made into an encroachment on land on which a labourer's cottage is built.  In my part of the country there are labourers' cottages built on very big annuity tenants' holdings.  My impression is that if this is repealed, so to speak, from the Labourers Act of 1906, the labourers' cottages which now have a half an acre of land can have a great many acres of land attached to them.  That land will be taken from the owner or occupier of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result we would have a labourer's cottage on a fairly good sized farm and the labourer would become a farmer.  Some Senator said that would be a very good idea.  If it was carried out the logical conclusion would be that you would have a continuation of this, that all the land in the hands of occupiers would be taken away gradually.  What happens then? As the Minister stated yesterday the land is very often left to a widow.  If she is a young widow she marries again and has a family.  That family wants more land. They are in the old homestead&mdash;a labourer's cottage.  Each of them wants another labourer's cottage on the same land.  You then have another labourer's cottage on the land acquired from the tenant.  There is a family there also, and they want more land further on.  That is the effect.  It does not affect me, but as it is in the Schedule it means taking more land from people who had no idea <Col N="2144" /> there was such power in the Bill.  The owners of the land expected that the labourer's plot would remain as it was. I say, without fear of contradiction here, or on the other side of the Channel, that nothing has improved the condition of the poor people of Ireland more than the Labourers Acts.  I have seen extraordinary improvements.  As a rule they keep their cottages neatly, and you see nice little flower gardens about them.  The cottages are a credit to the country.</P>

      <P>I beg to support the amendment.  I do not think I could put the case more clearly than Lord Mayo. It was also put clearly before us by the Minister yesterday.  I understand that if this Section of the Labourers Act is repealed then any labourer is entitled, if he can arrange it, to have land given to him in addition to keeping the labourer's cottage, but if the Section is not repealed then if he gets a farm he has to give up his cottage.  Is that not the situation&mdash;that if the words stand here then the labourer retains his cottage and gets the farm?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if the original section stands and if the labourer gets a parcel of land he has to leave his cottage. If the section is amended he gets the cottage as well as his parcel of land.  It is a question of policy whether from the labourer's point of view when a man becomes a farmer he should leave the cottage and allow a labourer to come into it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDuffy" hpid="Mr. DUFFY Mr. DUFFY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Earl of Mayo is not quite right in the view he has taken as to the position of the labourer under the Act without the passing of this amendment.  So far as I understand the Act it enabled an agricultural worker to become a land holder whether he has a cottage or not.  The object of the repeal of this part of the Labourers Act is to enable the Land Commission where they divide a big farm with two or three labourers' cottages on it and when deciding the giving a parcel of this land to any of the men occupying those cottages it enables the labourers to get the parcel of land without going through the formula of giving up his cottage to the Rural District Council and going in and building a new house on that parcel of land.  I contend that this is a perfectly reasonable proposal because when you divide up a large holding where these men were in all probability <Col N="2145" /> previously employed and on which their cottages were situated, you are wiping out their means of employment. They are not going to get much employment under the new Bill.</P>
      <P>In all probability in the majority of counties there will not be more than 20 acres given in one of these new holdings and people getting possession will not be in a position to employ the labourers and will not need them.  In my district there are a number of cottages held by the Rural District Council which are idle and derelict for the past 5 or 6 years on that very account.  The people who accupy them have lost their employment owing to the land being divided.  I contend that the amendment asked for by the Minister is reasonable and will only be exercised where large tracts of land are taken on which there are cottages and it will not enable a man with a cottage on a holding already purchased to demand land from that farmer.  To bear out my contention and to show the Seanad how this question of giving a cottage to a man works out&mdash;some Senators seem to think if he gets possession of a cottage he is getting something very valuable for nothing&mdash;in the particular district I come from during the past few years the cottages have cost considerably more to keep in repair than the amount collected in rent.  Unlike a considerable lot of property held by farmers there are no arrears upon them but the rent fell short last year of the amount required to keep them in repair by £1,400, so that even if every cottage was to be handed over to the labourers it would be a relief to the rates to that extent.</P>

      <P>It seems to me there is no reason if there is land to be distributed why a labourer should not get his share with everybody else. I do not know whether the amendment would provide that.

      <P>Senator Duffy has mentioned the state of things in a district which is practically all in grass.  If those large ranches are divided I do not think it will increase employment, and I do not see why if the farms are divided up those labourers should not have holdings on those farms.  I think <Col N="2146" /> it would be grossly unjust to prevent it, and from what we are told by Senator Duffy, it would be a great economy to the rates, because the ratepayers would not be then liable to keep those labourers' cottages in repair once the labourers were in occupation of an economic farm.</P>

      <P>If I rightly understand this question, I differ from Sir Nugent Everard, not because I do not want to see a labourer deserving of land getting it, but because it seems to me to run against the main principle of the Bill, that is the relief of congestion.  By leaving in those words you will be making every one of those in possession of labourers' cottages a congest for the purpose of this Act.  I am not quoting Sir Nugent Everard.  I think that would be disastrous, because from what the Minister tells us, when the congests are provided for there will not be much land left.  If you are to encourage all those in labourers' cottages to come in at the beginning it would be very bad for those with whom the Bill is intended to deal. I know there are cases where labourers' cottages are now empty.  There are also cases where labourers' cottages are held by people who do not do any work outside since they got those cottages.  I know cases where they lived happily cultivating their potato garden and taking the grass of a few cows outside. They have not contributed in the sense intended by giving their labour outside.  They are perfectly within their rights in doing so.  It is another thing that they should be allowed to put in a claim for land which is intended for congests.</P>

      <P>I have had considerable experience of the working of the Labourers Act, and as regards Senator Duffy's contention that the cost of maintenance in many cases exceeds the cost of rent, I quite agree.  I think that was owing to the inefficiency of local Boards. There can be no doubt, form any point of view, that if you present a labourer with a cottage the property of the ratepayers, you are making him a present.  Whether that is advisable or not is a matter we should consider.  If the labour point of view is that land is to be divided in a certain way, and that a certain course of action is the best, the responsibility is theirs.  From my point of view I think <Col N="2147" /> that what the Earl of Kerry says that you are making a number of potential congests is true.  On the other hand, when Sir Nugent Everard states that when a big farm is divided up a labourer should get his share is equally true.  I think it would be a wise policy to allow a labourer to get such land.  There are other cases where men are hungry for cottages, and we, unfortunately, know many of those cottages were given for a certain reason. Would the Labour Party like to deprive the real labourer, who has not been able to get a cottage, by taking with one sweep all the existing cottages and hand them over to men in a position to make good their claim for land.  What would be the position of the others?  If all the cottages that are now available are given to men what is to become of the rural labourer who must exist on the land?  Senator Duffy alluded only to Section <i>(a)</i>, but to go further to Section <i>(g)</i> and say &ldquo;any other person,&rdquo; I am not with him.</P>
      <P>Surely that means any labourer in any cottage anywhere.  Even to my mind you are not limited to the labourer who lives on a farm outlined by the amendment of Sir Nugent Everard.  But whenever there is a labourer, if he has sufficient influence, he can get a farm though he may be miles away.  He may live in the cottage and exclude the rural labourer.  I would ask the Labour representatives in the Seanad to consider this.  If they decide it is wise to do this, and that they can go to their people and tell them it is wise, I am with them. I shall not oppose them.  But viewing the matter in its largest aspect, having a real anxiety that the rural labourers should be properly housed and their position made better, I think they should consider this side of it.  If every labourer who enjoys a cottage should also be made a farmer, then the rural labourer's position would be retrograded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>When we hear that the rural agricultural labourer is entitled to a farm, and that facilities be given to him under any Act in order to enable him to reach that position, I think that with that principle no Senator would be at variance.  Generally speaking, I think that a great number of small economic holdings, worked intensively on the French system, would make for a more uniform distribution of wealth and a <Col N="2148" /> more uniform distribution of energy, and would be better for the country as a whole.  But I am concerned with the altered relationship which this clause will bring about as between the Rural District Council and the present occupier of a labourer's cottage.  These cottages, as we know under the Labourers Act of 1906, were built for a certain purpose, in order to provide housing accommodation for genuine agricultural labourers.  These were distributed as uniformly as could be, in order that the agricultural labourer's house would not be very far away from where he could secure work, not more than a radius of one or two miles around. That was the purpose of that Act.  After some time the definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; was broadened and widened. A man came to be an agricultural labourer if he only worked one day in the year as an agricultural labourer.</P>
      <P>The result of that was that there are tradesmen, fishermen, and all sorts of people, who are not agricultural labourers, now occupying these cottages. The Rural District Council, and the ratepayers in the area, mostly farmers, have been burdened with the expense of building these cottages. They have taken the liability and responsibility, extending over a great many years, in order to pay off the loan and interest on the original debts incurred. These cottages have all been a source of loss to the Councils.  The general Council of the County Councils has for some time been considering whether some measure could not be introduced by which the agricultural labourers could be made proprietors and owners of their own houses.  It would be a good thing. They would take some interest in them. They would have a proprietary interest in their houses.  It would stimulate others who are careless of their cottages to make an effort to improve them.  I admit that what Senator Duffy has stated is right, that some tenants keep their cottage and plot in good repair, and it is quite a pleasant thing, as you pass through the country, to see some of these cottages and plots kept in the very nice way they are kept.  You may go a little distance further and you meet with other cottages in which the owners take very little interest, and where the plots are overgrown with weeds.  They are derelict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason why one tenant <Col N="2149" /> should not keep his cottage and plot in as good a repair as the other.  Under this Act, which proposes to alter the whole relationship of the Rural District Council with the tenants of these cottages, it is proposed to encroach upon the security of the ratepayers.  Under the provisions of this Act they propose to convert a labourer into a farmer, thereby encroaching upon labour in the district. By doing this you reduce the number of labourers in that district and shorten the supply of labour.  The man who occupied a cottage is converted into a farmer.  Then it devolves upon the District Council to build more cottages, so that further labourers may be induced to come there to provide for the wants of the district.  I think the Minister for Agriculture should allow some clause to be inserted in this Bill in the words which he could frame, but in extending the status of these men converting them from labourers to farmers, he should not commit any injustice to the ratepayers of the Rural District who at present have provided these men with cottages. The ratepayers look to him to save them from some portion at least of the loss on their investment.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is prepared to accept some amendment of this sort it would meet the case.  I have communications from two or three Rural Councils on this matter.  They take a serious view of this thing.  The amendment is this, &ldquo;that the tenant of a cottage under the Labourers Act of 1906 shall, when acquiring land under this Bill, make satisfactory arrangements with the Rural District Council concerned for the purchase of his present holding.&rdquo;  That would relieve the Rural District to the extent of maintaining the holding.  The cottage loses its entire character and becomes the homestead of a farmer.  We claim that there should be a termination of their relationship with that occupier.  As to what arrangement the labourer could make with the Land Commission, I am sure the Land Commission would make an advance to the labourer to convert him into a small agricultural holder, that they would also make such advances to him as would enable him to purchase out his holding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is carrying the thing much further.  I think the debate is proceeding on a misunderstanding. Labourers will get advances for parcels of land under this Act.  There will be land bought and land available, and labourers will be given advances for that land.  If a labourer who happens to be in a labourer's cottage happens to get a parcel of land he is turned into a small farmer.</P>
      <P>The question here is this: If a labourer who happens to be in a labourer's cottage gets a parcel of land, he is turned into a small farmer, and he has under the existing law to clear out of the cottage.  Now, will we repeal the Section and let him remain in the cottage given him by the Rural District Council, and still hold his land, or shall we leave the Section unrepealed? If he gets a parcel of land as he will in various cases, because there will be advances made to labourers, must he clear out of the cottage and let in another or will he be entitled to remain in the cottage and at the same time get the parcel of land?  If the Earl of Mayo's amendment is carried, the labourer if he gets an advance for a parcel of land, will have to clear out of his cottage.  If the Schedule remains as it is he can remain in the cottage and yet be in a position to take an advance for a parcel of land.</P>

      <P>The issue at stake here is one as between the Rural District Council and the tenant.  The tenant has this cottage and plot at the rent varying from 10d. to 1s. per week, and so far as the Rural District Council is concerned, I know they are losing on an average £6 a year on each cottage.  When you convert that man into a farmer and give him a greater earning power&mdash;we fixed that rent because of the limited earning power &mdash;and if you give him this extra land, what right has he to stay in the cottage at the expense of the ratepayers?</P>

      <P>Representations have also been made as to the hardship to the District Council, and the suggestion was made&mdash;I throw it out though I do not know whether the Minister will see his way to accept it or not, but it seems fairly reasonable&mdash;that there are numbers of tenants who have been employed on farms largely for tillage purposes, and if these farms are now split up those men will lose their employment. Although those men would be entitled to get a share of the land, to disturb them from their houses would be unfair.  Could not the Land Commission arrange also to buy the plot of land the labourer has from the Rural District Council?  That would, I think, solve the difficulty.  It would relieve an injustice to the labourer and an injustice to the ratepayer.  I have no doubt the Labour Party will agree on the reasonableness of the suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>That is going very much further than was ever contemplated by the Land Commission.  Where this proviso was left in the Act it is proposed to repeal it.

      <P>This is a question which arose and only became apparent while we were discussing the Bill.  It seems very reasonable and would relieve the hardship to the labourers a great deal; they would be deprived in the manner suggested and they have no right to be so deprived.  It would also relieve the District Councils from the disability they are at present under.  Other Senators have referred to the fact that the cost of maintaining the cottages amounts to considerably more than the rents received. I do not know why the tenant should not in future accept that himself. He no doubt would repay the Land Commission for the money they spent in acquiring the cottage and holding from the Council and I have no doubt the Councils would be glad to get out of the bad bargain.</P>

      <P>There is a great deal of unanimity in the desire to deal with Senator Duffy's case.  I think the way that is done in the Act is about as badly done as it could be.  It is applying to a particular case a general rule which will <Col N="2152" /> upset the arrangements about every labourer's cottage all over Ireland. Senator Duffy has put forward a case which was already dealt with in the Bill, and he has pointed out that it was necessary to have this part of the Act repealed to enable a labourer who is on a farm, where he will no longer have any labour, to get a piece of that land. If this Section is not repealed he will have to go out of his cottage.</P>
      <P>There is another point.  If this Section is repealed it will put an end to the building of labourers' cottages all over Ireland, because every District Council will know that if they build a cottage for a labourer they give him the right to take that cottage in future and get land under this Act and they will have none of the protection which the Act, specifically passed to allow of those cottages being built, gave them.  To my mind you will see no Council, if you repeal this Section, building labourers' cottages in future, because they know they will be building them for the individual labourer who will get land and take the cottage in spite of the Council.  I believe it is doing an injury to the country labourers of the future to repeal this Section.  It will be quite possible to meet Senator Duffy's case and all the cases that arise through this Act if the Government will assist us to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said cottages are lying there no good to anybody, and that the men who used to inhabit them, or are in them now, have no employment because of the state of the neighbourhood.  If there was a provision put in that in such cases the Land Commission had a right under Sub-section <i>(d)</i> of Clause 31, in spite of the Clause in the Act of 1906, to leave the labourer in his cottage when they were dealing with any labourer whose employment had been taken away from him, it would meet the matter. If you make a general excision of it and take it clean out of the Act I hold we would be doing an injury to all the labourers in the country who want labourers' cottages built in future.  It would be possible to meet the case of all labourers who have their occupation interfered with by the action of this Bill by putting in some provision in Sub-section <i>(d)</i> of Clause 31, which will give power to the Land Commission to waive that clause of the Act of 1906 in certain cases.  That is on the lines of Senator <Col N="2153" /> Kenny's proposal.  It could be added that the persons they would have to deal with in the matter would be the District Council.</P>

      <P>I contend that on any farm on which there is a labourer's cottage, and that the labourer's employment is done away with by the division of that land, you are in reality making a congest of that labourer.  You are putting him, with one acre of land, in the middle of 9, 10, or 20-acre holdings. A labourer is absolutely useless there. Where land is held in small farms only one house in a thousand is a labourer's cottage.  Where there are large holdings there are, perhaps, ten labourers' cottages for every one landowner's house.  The reason the cottages were built was to provide cheap labour for large holdings.  You are now doing away with large holdings, and, as I contend there is no further work for the labourers they should be able to be turned into small farmers.  I would ask that the words &ldquo;or on which his cottage is situate&rdquo; should be inserted.</P>

      <P>The Seanad had better be careful about this, as you are turning the Bill into one to change agricultural labourers into farmers That is the effect as I understand the position.  Already under Clause 31 there are two sections, one by which the agricultural labourer is enabled to get an advance for land if he is deprived by virtue of sales under the Land Purchase Acts of employment, and the other, any other person.  If they come within either of those provisos there is ample opportunity in such cases as the Land Commission thinks fit of doing this.  If you proceed to put in what is now proposed you practically make it <Col N="2157" /> almost obligatory that every agricultural labourer who wants to turn himself into an agricultural farmer should get the opportunity.</P>

      <P>Surely my amendment cannot do that.  I am adopting Sub-section <i>(d)</i> word for word.  In the case of a labourer who has been deprived of his employment the Land Commission would merely have the right in such cases to waive that Sub-section in the Act of 1906.  I cannot see how that opens up a case for every holder of a labourer's cottage.  I may be wrong.  I am only meeting Senator O'Duffy's wishes, so as to enable these people to hold their cottages.</P>

      <P>Senator Jameson's amendment would exclude a large number of people who live on big tracts of land but do not work on them.  There are many cases of people living in cottages but not working on the land where they are built.  The fact of splitting up such land would not deprive such people of work.  I think the intention of the Minister would be to deal with labourers who have their residences on the land, irrespective of where they work.  I would ask if there are no discretionary powers given to the Ministry in repealing this Act?  I take it that they would exercise sufficient discretionary powers to deal with all deserving workers where land is split up.  The housing problem is a very serious one in this country, and I think you will make it more serious if you take such power away from the Commissioners. If you put a labourer on a small tract of land and put him out of his cottage you have to provide some home for him.  That, of course, will impose a very heavy burden on the man, who will have a struggle in his early years of farming, notwithstanding any help he may get from the Government. Such a man will also have to pay interest on the loan.  A burden will be imposed upon him that I think is not called for.  I think a District Council could deal with labourers whose little holdings are enlarged.  They have all the powers to increase the rents of those cottages. I would suggest that this clause, which <Col N="2158" /> the Minister proposes to wipe out, be retained in the Bill, and let the District Councils deal with the labourers.</P>

In Waterford we would have to pay a rent to cover an average loss of seven or eight pounds.  I am sure, if Senator Barrington's suggestion that the Rural District Council could be easily approached with a sort of sporting offer of £100 or less were adopted it would facilitate this Land Bill.  The cottages could be purchased and included in this Bill, rather than leave it to the District Councils to impose an economic rent.  There is another point.  You are now dealing nationally with this question, and the burden involved in this conversion should be a national one.  The burden entailed by this conversion should not be localised.  You are now penalising ratepayers.</P>

It was never the intention that the Land Commission should get any powers in any way of buying over labourers' cottages for farmers.  There will be enough of labourers to fill those cottages, and to spare.  In the event of a man being in a labourer's cottage and getting an advance for a parcel of land, is he to remain in the cottage and keep the parcel, or keep the parcel and clear out of the cottage?  I would suggest to Senator Jameson that he would not make any special provision outside the simple question of all labourers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated here, I considered the question of an appeal on price very carefully, and I stated my views on the matter and the reasons that prevented me giving any appeal from the Judicial Commissioner on price.  A considerable number of Senators realised the situation and recognised the extraordinary difficulties of giving any appeal on that particular point.  The <Col N="2161" /> Cathaoirleach made a suggestion that possibly we could meet the case if a simple provision were added giving an appeal on any question of law from the Judicial Commissioner to the Court of Appeal.  I have considered that very carefully, and have taken advice on the question.  Giving an appeal on any question of law arising under the Bill or any section of the Bill would be a very big one.  It would be, I am advised, opening the door to possibly a tremendous number of appeals.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to go as far as I can in this direction; I have considered it carefully, and I will say at once, with the best advice I can take on the matter, what I am prepared to do.  I stated already that I had agreed an appeal should be given to the Court of Appeal on any matter arising under Sub-section (3).  My proposal now is that, excepting price, an appeal on any question of law arising on the whole of Section 24, which is really the section that deals with the acquisition of land in the first instance by the Land Commission, should be given from the Judicial Commission to the Court of Appeal, specifically excluding price.  On any question of law, remember that this section deals with the acquisition in the first instance of any untenanted land.  Sub-section (3) entitles the Land Commission to acquire compulsorily for the relief of congestion any of these eight classes of land.  I have accepted amendments the effect of which make it clear that any of those excepted eight classes can only be acquired if no other land is available.  Another amendment was accepted stating that if land is acquired which is or forms part of a purchased holding, then an equivalent holding must be given of not less value to the tenant purchaser.  Therefore, at least sixty or seventy per cent. of the total issues of the Bill arise on that section, and I am prepared to agree that an appeal be given on any question of law, specifically excluding price, because law and fact in this or any other Bill like it are inextricably mingled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What their effect is is this: where you have a provision that there shall be an appeal on law it goes to the Court of Appeal, and there is a long argument as to whether this is a question of law or fact.  That has to be decided first before you come to the real question that you are asking the Judge's opinion on. <Col N="2162" /> Law and fact are so inextricably mingled in a Bill like this, where there are so many issues arising, that I do believe if there was an appeal from the Judicial Commissioner, who is a High Court Judge, on every issue of law arising from the Bill, or if there be a group of appeals, it would very seriously hamper the work of the Land Commission. What I would suggest now goes a longer step than the suggestion I made this morning on every question of law arising not under Sub-section (3), but under Section 24 as amended.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, therefore, the following amendment to Section 24, to be added as a new sub-section at the end of the section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Judicial Commissioner on any question of law arising out of this section may appeal from such decision to the Court of Appeal, but there shall be no appeal from any decision of the Judicial Commissioner on any question of price.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It only remains to us to congratulate ourselves on the conclusion of our day's work.  I hope it will be some time before we are again invited to deal with the Irish land question.  This question has occupied a certain amount of my attention for a considerable number of years.  Every Act that was brought in was, we were told, going to settle it, but the question is not yet settled, and I doubt if it will ever be settled.  We may <Col N="2163" /> hope, at all events, that for some years to come we shall not hear any more of it.  I would like to congratulate the Minister on the very clever way in which he got his Bill through.  A long Bill like this, a very contentious Bill like this, and a very involved Bill like this, required a good deal of handling.  I am sure that the Minister will admit that the Seanad assisted him to the best of their ability.  I think we did.  I think we may say that certain valuable amendments have been incorporated in the Bill.  For the time being we have settled the Irish land question, and I hope that the next business the Minister will seriously consider will be the general question of Irish agriculture.  Agriculture must always be our most staple industry. It must always be our greatest industry.  Our agriculture is capable of improvement.  We should devote more scientific methods to our system of dealing with the land, and I hope when next we are asked to consider an agrarian measure of any sort it will be one for the purpose of enabling the youth of the country to obtain better agricultural education. I hope it will be one also to enable farmers generally to devote more scientific consideration to the great business they have on hand.  I congratulate the Government on getting the Bill through.</P>

I believe the stability of the country, had the Bill remained as it was, would have been very much injured.  The Minister's subtle intellect was quick to realise that, and to realise what he thought would be justice.  His knowledge of the Bill was most amazing; on no point could he be <Col N="2164" /> caught, and whenever a channel of thought reached him he was able to get to the bottom of it.  I believe it is a measure that will substantially settle the land question.  The great question will be, of course, administration, and I hope Mr. Hogan will be there to see the Bill administered.

      <P>I rise with relief, but not with pleasure, to move the rejection of this Bill.  I shall be as brief as I can, but there are certain points that I must develop.  A student of political science who watched our proceedings would certainly have been much troubled by the paradox that presented itself in the Seanad.  He would see almost unanimous consent amongst parties naturally divergent in their efforts to secure the passage of this Bill.  It excited very considerable comment in the Dáil that the representatives of the farmers and the Labour Party were found in the same lobby.  I think it must excite equally interesting comment that a number of landlords and labourers are also found in the same lobby in the Seanad.  It has been put to me from many quarters by persons whose judgment is much respected by me that my action in opposing this Bill, which has even been described as an attempt to wreck this Bill, is very unwise.  I have given due and weighty consideration to those proposals, and the more I think them over the more I am confirmed in the course I now take, and the more I am confirmed that this Bill is not in the best interests of the country.  The action of the Labour Party in this Seanad in voting for this Bill I appreciate.  The action of those who, without in any way surrendering their independence, say that it is a wise bargain to support the Government is an action I can understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am more perplexed to understand the attitude of the landowning class.  I realise that the failure to pass this Bill may have serious effects on the material and financial position of their class.  On the other hand, I cannot understand how, acting presumably on behalf of the proprietory classes, they can set their seal to a measure which contains large powers of compulsory acquisition on such unsatisfactory terms.  I do not suggest, or wish to suggest, that those gentlemen <Col N="2165" /> have not given full consideration to all the aspects of the case.  I do not wish to suggest that they have been actuated or dominated solely by the more immediate financial considerations. I am sure it can be argued that they have set the whole in the balance and come to the conclusion that the measures contained in this Bill to carry out an ideal policy for the settlement of congestion, and many other aspects of the landlord question, dominated and justified their decision.  To those few of us, and we are few, who took the responsibility of moving the rejection of this Bill&mdash;and personally I do it with the greater relief when I know that my motion will not be carried&mdash;I think it is only due to this Seanad, and to the outside public, that we should state the reasons for our action.</P>
    <P>First, I consider this doctrinaire measure of a very sweeping and far-reaching character, and I consider it is unwise, to such extent as has been done in this Bill, to disregard the experience of other countries.  If I knew of any country where a far-reaching measure of this kind had been operated successfully, and where a very large movement of populations with a view to redistribution of landed wealth had successfully operated, I should regard these proposals with less concern.  I may be wrong, but I feel that this is what has happened.  I will not suggest, because I do not think it would be fair to the Minister to do so, that he is solely responsible for this Bill. In his own interest I prefer not even to suggest that he is the prime mover.  In any case, the Executive Council must claim responsibility, and I fully appreciate that with the highest motives, they have acted according to their lights in setting out to remove this blot of congestion.  They have done so, and they purport to do so by very drastic means. In all countries in different forms politicians have felt the problem here presented, the uneven distribution of wealth.  It especially takes in this country, expression in the form of land. It is no new thing in principle, for large urban populations in other countries, many of them bordering on a state of necessity, are analogous.  None of these countries has yet discovered the Rosetta Stone by which that solution may be found.</P>
    <P>Yet here we are asked to believe that <Col N="2166" /> the Government, well intentioned but not possessing great experience, has done so.  I cannot sustain that belief. The problem of congestion is undoubtedly a great one.  I contend that there are ample powers already to tackle it in a thoroughly satisfactory manner for many years to come, and I believe it was the greatest mistake to introduce far-reaching measures, which will have a most unsettling effect upon the country, before voluntary methods have been exploited to the full.  The existing Act of 1909 conferred certain limited compulsory powers, and these powers have not been hitherto fully developed.  It is a matter of common knowledge to-day that there is a large quantity of land in the Saorstát which is in the hands of the Government and is awaiting settlement for some time.</P>
    <P>I also do believe that if the voluntary negotiation proposals, with the powers of the 1909 Act&mdash;compulsory powers&mdash;in the background, had been developed and exploited, that would have enabled this grave danger that I apprehend is upon us to have been averted.  It has been put to me that from the point of view of the national interest there is no greater revolution in the Bill we are now asked to pass, as compared with what went before, than there was in the 1881 Land Act on what went before that.  I say the case is totally distinct.  In the case of the 1881 Act you were confirming security of tenure to the worker, who is the wealth producer.  In this Bill you are unsettling the security of tenure of the small owner, the farmer, who is the wealth producer of the country.</P>
    <P>We heard a great deal yesterday about this question of insecurity, and when I heard the Minister arguing the point I got some indication of why it was he was not so alarmed as I am on the question of insecurity.  Arguing with the two leaders of the banking community&mdash;who. I think, are becoming somewhat uneasy on the position&mdash;he said &ldquo;What is there to be afraid of?  You take a man from one farm and you give him a farm of equal value somewhere else.  There is nothing disturbed.  That man's assets are as good as they were before.&rdquo;  That line of argument, to my mind, shows a complete misconception of the word &ldquo;insecurity.&rdquo;  Insecurity is not a physical conception except to a very limited extent.  If you go back to the Latin derivation <Col N="2167" /> of the word, I believe scholars differ, but the best instructed say <i>sine cura</i>&mdash;without care.  Does the Minister or anybody else suggest that these provisions which are going to unsettle, and which give the power to take any land, anywhere, are going to leave the owners of land without care?  None of us are without care, but anything that tends to deepen and confirm our anxieties might be translated or described as insecurity.</P>
    <P>Insecurity in its fullest sense is an atmospheric condition.  You cannot describe it.  You cannot bring it down to firm words.  It is a sort of feeling of uneasiness which makes you loath to employ your savings to the best and fullest advantage.  It makes you tend to keep your capital liquid.  Bankers understand that well.  One of the features of banking is liquidity, and any man who is insecure aims at keeping his wealth liquid. That condition of liquidity is the very worst condition when viewed in the light of wealth production.  National wealth is not money in the sense of currency, and is not land.  I took the Minister to believe that mere land is national wealth. It is only land when worked to the best advantage that is national wealth.  You may have land and do nothing with it, and it is not wealth at all.  The enormous reserves of gold in America are not wealth, because they are lying there in vaults.  It is because this Bill is making for less production that I oppose it.</P>
    <P>Take an owner of untenanted land in the congested districts.  As soon as he understands this Bill he knows that on a certain day that land will any longer cease to be his.  Further, he knows that according to Ministerial statements all that land will be wanted for the relief of congestion.  What is the owner of that land going to do?  Is he going to continue farming to the utmost?  Of course he is not.  He is unsettled, and is thinking of where he will go next.  He is going to cut down tillage to the utmost, and put his land back to grass.  Probably operating first in the congested districts, that is liable to extend all over the country, and I anticipate that you are going to have a very large increase of grass farms when the provisions of this Bill are known.  It will be this way.  In many cases these farmers will get unsettled. The Government may not require <Col N="2168" /> their land for years.  They may never require it.  But these men will be so uneasy that once they have put their farms in grass they will let them remain in grass.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the effect of the Bill will be materially to impair food production and industry in land, which, of course, everybody wants, and which is the real source of national wealth.  As regards the immediate effect, I honestly feel in regard to the congested districts, where the acquisition of the land by the Land Commission is certain, that the most active person very shortly will be the furniture remover.  It is an occult force, and I honestly feel that the insecurity the Bill will create and the damage it will do will be only second in effect to the positive damage that has been done by the action of the Irregular forces.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect.  We all know the extraordinary interest there is attached to the possession of land and the passion it excites when you are going to take land on a general doctrinaire scheme; to move people about and put people on land who do not appear to have, in the ordinary plain sense, any more title to it than anyone else.  You raise all kinds of cupidity and undesirable forces, and you will get men on the border of land to be broken up exceedingly hostile to the introduction of strangers and people from other counties.</P>
    <P>The Minister says, &ldquo;Oh, that is all right; we have got the forces of law established, and we can deal with that.&rdquo; I am not so sure that you can.  I do not think you can deal with that merely by the positive forces of law.  If he said &ldquo;We have got a mentality that accepts the law and yields to and respects the law,&rdquo; I would not be so uneasy.  But when he says &ldquo;We have got the forces fully developed and we are going to do it by force,&rdquo; then I am uneasy.  I do not think the country can afford to keep an Army for this purpose, and I do not believe, so great will be the passions, that it can possibly be done by such a body as an unarmed Civic Guard.  I would be sorry if anything I say would be taken as an attempt to incite people. I am only stating what I believe to be the fact, and what will be the effects of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the worst portion, in fact a feature of this Bill which is novel, <Col N="2169" /> and which, I think, is exceedingly dangerous&mdash;that is the acquisition of land automatically.  Under the old powers you proceeded by negotiation.  You came to a person and said you wanted his land for this purpose, and tried to make a friendly arrangement about it if possible.  It was only in the last resort that you used compulsion.  Under this Bill you take the land automatically, although you may never want it, and then after a time maybe you give it back. That is absolutely the wrong way to do it, because you create uneasiness in the minds of people by the mere fact that they feel that on a certain day the legal title to their land is not theirs.  That will have a most damaging effect.</P>
    <P>The greatest injustice under this Bill &mdash;and I use the word advisedly&mdash;is in the case of these retained holdings&mdash;the unpurchased tenants.  I have been at a loss to discover why the unpurchased tenant is, by the operation of this Bill, treated essentially differently from the purchased tenant.  The unpurchased tenant's land is taken first for sub-division and relief of congestion.  The purchased tenant apparently remains on his land, which is only taken as a last resort. What is the position of the unpurchased tenant?  The unpurchased tenant all over the country, not merely in the congested districts, but every unpurchased tenant who owns land in excess of £3,000 &mdash;and for the purpose of that calculation you take into account any land on which he pays an annuity elsewhere&mdash; will have the whole of his land retained. I really think that is a sad picture, viewed in the light of those who love their homes.</P>
    <P>Picture a man who has lived for generations on his farm.  On a certain date the title of the land must pass.  He lives with this sword of Damocles hanging over his head, week after week, month after month, possibly for two or three years, never knowing when it may descend, never knowing when the morning post will bring him a letter saying &ldquo;We are going to take your farm. You can seek a place elsewhere.  We are going to give you the market price for it&rdquo;&mdash;a place that that person would not sell for three times the market price. The Minister will, I have no doubt, say that this would only operate in exceptional cases.  I am prepared to accept that for what it is worth, but how can <Col N="2170" /> he answer for those who are to come? The power is there in the Bill, and I refuse to examine this Bill from any other point of view than what is contained in it.  To say that the Government will not do this or that, or that the Land Commission will not do this or that is not enough.  The Land Commission will do all that the Bill empowers them if they get orders from the Government. In respect of these retained holdings, and in respect of the Bill generally, I think there is a tremendous lot of sentiment for the congests at the price of humanity to the individual.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Judiciary, I still am not satisfied on two points.  One is the absolute independence, beyond yea or nay, of the Court of First Instance. The Minister himself admitted yesterday that the Judicial Commissioner was, at least to a small extent, concerned in administration.  Of course, nominally he is a member of the Land Commission. That alone leaves me unsatisfied.  I am further unsatisfied with the limiting powers of these appeals on points of law, and I am unable absolutely to assess the value of the concession given by the Minister.  It does not cover the whole  the question of retained holdings; it does not cover the question of parcels of land and who are not to get them.  It does not cover farming in the interests of food production, which I say is a most litigious question.  I am not satisfied that the present Judicial Commissioner has not been consulted in the preparation of this Bill.  It stands to reason, on the face of it, that he must have been.  He is a member of the Land Commission. The Land Commission must have been consulted, and if he has been consulted in any way on the Bill it is doubly worse. He will be asked to rule and give a final decision on points of law and on questions on which he has already been consulted and on which he has given his opinion.  I think that is a very grave feature in this Bill, and one to which the Seanad should attach grave importance.</P>
    <P>On the question of price, we have heard so much about it that I have not much more to say.  You take a man's home and all he loves, the hallowed associations and memories, and you give him the market price.  It may be said that, compared with previous Acts, it is not bad.  To take another comparison&mdash;that <Col N="2171" /> of tenant right.  Untenanted land carries the equivalent of tenant right.  Many expensive improvements were made on holdings on the assurance that land taken compulsorily would not be taken below market value, and in the belief that land taken compulsorily would carry with it compensation given under previous Acts.  Taking that land and not giving even market price is doing exactly the same thing in essence as in the case of retained holdings.  When you come to that definition I think the matter becomes ludicrous.  You give a definition which cannot possibly be fair to either side.  You have two people; one who wants to get it&mdash;the Government, to do their duty, should get it very cheap&mdash;and the other person who owns the land and who has a right to get its full value.  To give a Judge a direction to be fair to both when it is impossible to be fair to either is to reduce the whole thing to absurdity.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, therefore, because the measure is a doctrinaire attempt to do by revolution what should be done by evolution, because there is compensation given in cases where land is acquired compulsorily for public purposes, because it excites passions when it should be the object of legislation to allay passions, and because the independence of the Judiciary is not adequately safeguarded, and because last, and this is the most important, it strikes at the economic life and at the productive power of the nation, I shall have to ask the Seanad to divide on this measure.  I do so with a full sense of responsibility, and I would not do so unless I believed that the consequences would be very serious.  Believing them to be serious, I have tried to exploit this question to the utmost, and I would still ask whether it is not possible to give a breathing space. Under the Constitution, I think Article 47, there is a provision under which any measure upon which the Oireachtas has a doubt can be put to a poll of the people.  If that provision was ever invented for a purpose it is for this one. I am not going to do anything further than make the suggestion.  It rests with the Government.  If the Government like to take the responsibility of this Bill it is in their hands.  I should have thought that the Government, realising their responsibility as trustees for generations <Col N="2172" /> to come, would exploit every avenue before they ran this grave risk, would refer this matter to a poll of the people, so that they could say to the people later on, &ldquo;You have had it before you, the responsibility is yours.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I beg to second the proposal.  I do so reluctantly, because, as I said, there are very excellent clauses in the Bill.  At the same time, I believe that there are other Sections which do away, in their possibly evil effects, with the effect of the good Sections.</P>

      <P>During the passage of this Bill through its various stages my colleagues and I took hardly any part in the discussion.  Unfortunately when we proceed to support any particular measure we seem to excite opposition to it, and <i>vice versa.</i>  This Bill has, in our opinion, the germs of statesmanship, and while not coming up to what we would like, we realise that it was a substantial contribution towards a settlement of a long drawn-out question, the ownership of land.  Sir John Keane talks about some unholy alliances that have manifested themselves in both Houses, but if there be such an alliance here, it was wholly unconscious as far as my colleagues and I were concerned. There was one quality displayed by the Labour Party that was not displayed by the Farmers' Union.  Sir John Keane's colleagues in the other House thought that the Bill was not sufficiently drastic, and they proposed amendments which would have made it for us much more objectionable than it really is.  The opposition to this Bill has come from the big ranch holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone listening to Sir John Keane's denunciation of the Bill, and having an elementary knowledge of the history of the Land Question in Ireland, is amazed that the Bill is so good as it is.  The land question has been wrapped up with Irish history.  It has exercised and agitated generation after generation of Irish men and women.  Lives have been lost, hearts have been broken, and splendid careers have been devoted to attempts to undo the wrongs of centuries so far as land is concerned.  Those representatives of the ranchers who opposed this Bill, if the sins of the fathers were visited on the sons, have as much right to these ranches as the men have to the <Col N="2173" /> money they take from the bank at the point of the gun.  We know that the ranches were created by filling the emigrant ship.  We heard about the hardship of taking a man from his holding and planting him in another holding at least as good.</P>
    <P>We heard nothing about the hardship that was inflicted on our forefathers when they were driven from their holdings on to the emigrant ship.  They were not supplied with equally good houses and equally good holdings. These considerations should not be forgotten in considering the Bill before us for final consideration.  We must have some consideration for the days in which we live.  Even successive British Governments made attempts, feeble I agree, to try and right a great wrong.  The Bill before us introduces no new principles so far as I can ascertain except it makes compulsory provision which British Governments agreed were right, but were not prepared to introduce.  The result was the problem dragged on from one generation to another and was left unsettled at the time of the Treaty.  There is much talk about insecurity, as it is called by this Bill. The insecurity caused by not passing this measure would be out of all proportion to that created by its passing.  It is an extremely generous measure, taking all the circumstances into account.</P>
    <P>It must be realised that a revolution has taken place and the majority of those who own those great ranches which created congestion are the real obstacles to the solution of the problem of congestion. In other countries were such a revolution successful we know what would happen.  Here the question has been treated as if past history was forgotten, and the ranchers are being treated in a manner in which no injustice is being done.  They have been treated on a basis agreed to in the Bill of 1920, as the Minister has reminded opponents of the measure.  Taking all these things into consideration, I think the opposition to the Bill has been wholly unjustified.  It is a measure which is absolutely essential, if we are to avoid chaos throughout the country.  It is a measure which no Government with any conception of its responsibility could avoid introducing at as early a date as possible.  Sir John Keane need have no anxiety as to the terrible uneasiness <Col N="2174" /> existing throughout the country.  He suggests a referendum.  I wish him luck if he puts it to the country.  He will come back a sadder but much wiser man. I cannot understand the standpoint of giving credit to the Government for what it has done in one Bill and distrusting it absolutely on the next.  There is no consistency in that.</P>

      <P>I wanted to deal with that but I forgot.  May I say that the circumstances are totally different? Exercising one's judgment in one case one considers that the Government is right and should be supported, especially on matters of law and order.  On exercising one's judgment on a totally different set of facts, one is of opinion that the Government is wrong.</P>

      <P>I say that on one particular occasion Sir John Keane and other Senators give the Government credit for doing everything right, and they trust them for the future, then why not trust them for the future so far as this Bill is concerned?  While the Bill does not come up to our expectations, we support it as a substantial contribution to the solution of this long drawn-out question which, as I have said, has agitated generations of our people, and those I think who have lived to see the day will at least be gratified to see that there is a majority in both Houses to carry this measure through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words in support of the passing of this Bill.  I do not think that anybody expected when this measure was introduced that the Minister would be able to put forward a Bill that would please every section concerned.  I have recollection of the passing of previous Land Bills, and I am not aware that any one of them pleased all parties.  I regret that on a few amendments the Minister was not able to see his way to fall in with my views regarding the reduction of arrears of rent, and that he could not do more for the evicted tenants, but I realise that in other respects he has fairly met other amendments proposed by Senators.  I can see the Bill now is vastly improved from what it was when originally introduced. <Col N="2175" /> I give the Minister the greatest possible credit, especially for the introduction of Sections 7 and 38, which, by his ingenuity, although they do not give the occupiers entirely the same terms as the ordinary tenant, enable them to redeem the rents for which they are liable and to have the amounts of the purchase money paid off in 4½ per cent. stock.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the action of the Minister in bringing these classes of persons into the Act.  I think the idea he started with when bringing in this Act&mdash;to provide that after the passing of this Act there would be no agricultural tenant and no landlord in the country&mdash;has been brought into effect, and I congratulate him on being the Minister who has finally terminated the situation of landlord and tenant in Ireland.  Several of his predecessors in the framing of the Land Acts, from Lord Ashbourne to Mr. Wyndham, attempted to do that, and I congratulate him on being the author of the Hogan Bill which has terminated the state of landlord and tenant in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I have no intention of wearying the Seanad by answering the various points raised for the fifth time by Sir John Keane, and answered for the seventh or eighth.  I am extremely sorry that the Bill should have to be discussed in the Seanad under such unfavourable circumstances, that it should be rushed in this fashion and that the Seanad should not have had an opportunity of discussing it at more leisure.  I want to say that I realise that the Bill leaves the Seanad really improved, especially, in a very important Section&mdash;Section 24, and really improved in regard to the points which Senator Jameson and Senator Guinness raised at an earlier stage.  I think the Seanad realised that the Bill did need improvement in that direction.  I think it <Col N="2176" /> is a big improvement.  I have only to thank the Seanad for the invariable consideration they have shown to me during the discussions.</P>

      <P>May I say a word of congratulation to the Government, and especially to the Minister, on the skilful way he has piloted this Bill through the Dáil and the Seanad.  The relief that it brings to my county, Co. Donegal, is principally the relief of congestion, a definition of which Sir John Keane succeeded in putting on the Statute Book.  If the Bill relieves only one-third of the amount of congestion it will appreciably ease the pressure on the rest. I desire to pay tribute to the splendid attitude of the majority of the representatives of the landowners towards the Bill. These men have given a noble example of unselfish patriotism in the way they voted to give powers to the Land Commission to do what other Senators described as confiscation.  I hope their example will not be forgotten by the country, and that they will long enjoy the happiness of living in peace in a contented Ireland.</P>
