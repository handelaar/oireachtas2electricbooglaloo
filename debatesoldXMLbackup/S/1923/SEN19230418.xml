      <P>Since the Committee Stage there have been three new amendments sent in, but not in time to appear on the Order Paper.  What does appear on the Order Paper, and what I thought would be a convenience to have set out for the members of the Seanad, are the amendments which the Government undertook to consider and to deal with on the Report Stage.  It will not be necessary for us to go through the Bill Clause by Clause, but I shall just take up these amendments in the order in which they appear upon the Order Paper until I reach the new amendments, and then I shall call the new amendments.</P>

      <P>The amendment set forth here is simply carrying out an undertaking by the Government to accept the substance of an amendment proposed by Senator Guinness.  I think it differs only in phraseology from that amendment.  It means that where a case is being re-opened the Minister for Finance shall state the grounds for making the application and whether he admits that the applicant is entitled.  That will prevent litigation where it might be possible, if the Minister for Finance serves a notice to re-open and states his grounds.  It might permit also of an arrangement being made whereby the applicant would agree to take a lesser amount, and the whole thing might be settled out of Court without the expense that the re-opening of the case would entail.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should read the proposed amendment of the Government, as it came in very late, and there was not an opportunity of having it printed and circulated.  The amendment is to substitute for Sub-section 3, Section 2, the following:&mdash;&ldquo;and may in such notice state the grounds on which the application for re-hearing is made, and whether the fact that the applicant suffered any injury in respect of which he would be entitled to compensation on re-hearing is or is not disputed, and, if such fact is not disputed, the notice aforesaid may also contain an offer of such compensation either subject to or free from a reinstatement condition, as the Minister shall deem proper, and in case such offer or any amended offer is accepted within fourteen days after the service of the notice aforesaid, or such further time as the Minister for Finance may allow, a decree shall, subject to the provisions of Sub-sections 5 and 6 of this Section, and to the provisions of the Act relating to reinstatement conditions, be made for the amount of the compensation mentioned in the offer or the amended offer so accepted.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The amendment of the Government is:&mdash;Section 2, Sub-section (8)  To delete Sub-section (8) and insert in lieu thereof a new Sub-section (8) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8)  On any re-hearing under this section the Judge may, in addition to the costs of such re-hearing, award to the applicant the whole, or such part as the Judge shall consider reasonable, of the costs incurred by the applicant of or incidental to the previous application, and the costs so awarded shall be paid at the same time and in the same manner as the costs of the re-hearing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is to remove a doubt as to the payment of costs on the re-hearing.  It would mean that the costs or such amount as the Judge may allow on the previous hearing would be paid in cash to the applicant, and not in bonds, as they might be if they had been included as part of the award.</P>

I am not sure that it might not have been deleted without any change being made in the subsequent Sub-section, but I am told that pre-Truce there were cases where destruction really took place with the connivance of the owner, and that demands are being put in for payment of compensation in such cases.  We propose to delete Sub-section 1 and to insert this amendment in Sub-section 2.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash; Section 10, Sub-section (1) (ii.).  &ldquo;To delete the words &lsquo;the full amount of compensation awarded&rsquo; in the Sub-section as amended on the Committee stage, and to substitute therefor the words &lsquo;not less than the amount of compensation to which the reinstatement condition is attached.&rsquo;&rdquo; As the amendment was originally drafted by me, and accepted by the Government, it was pointed out that it appeared to imply, or that it might be construed as implying, that the applicant would have to put forward a scheme, and that such a scheme would have involved re-building up to the total amount of the compensation.  The Judge would have had no alternative but to accept the scheme in that form.  That was not my intention.  What I put down in the new amendment makes that point clear: that the applicant in putting forward an alternative scheme must provide for not less than the amount of the reinstatement decree, or as much more as he likes.  I think it stands to reason that if an applicant had to spend the whole of the compensation on rebuilding nobody would apply to rebuild.  They would certainly want a certain amount of money in cash to replace furniture or other contents.</P>

      <P>To delete the amendment to Section 10, Sub-section (1) (ii), inserted on the motion of Senator J.J. Parkinson (No. 13 on the Orders for the Day, 12th April, 1923), and in lieu thereof to insert a new Sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Whenever the Judge attaches a full reinstatement condition or a partial reinstatement condition to his decree he may, on the application of the Minister for Finance, attach to his decree a further condition that such part of the cost of reinstatement as may consist of necessary building materials may be deducted from the amount of compensation awarded, and such building materials may be supplied by the Minister for Finance, to the amount or value of the sum so deducted, and at such time as may be reasonable, having regard to architects' certificates. The prices to be charged by the Minister for Finance shall not exceed the amount at which materials of a similar quality could be bought in the open market.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This amendment in the name of Sir Thomas Esmonde is one we will accept.  It makes a small change in an amendment previously passed on the motion of Senator Parkinson.  I would be glad if some member of the Seanad will move this amendment.  It simply means that before any condition as is contemplated in the amendment which was passed in the Seanad the other day is made, the Minister for Finance must apply.  Obviously it might happen that the Minister for Finance could not see his way to provide the machinery, and great difficulty might occur if the Judge attached a condition of this sort without application being made by the Minister for Finance.  If the Minister for Finance finds he can provide building materials the amendment would leave him free to insert that condition.  On the other hand, if the Minister did not find himself able to carry out the work under the Sub-section he would not apply.  I think such a condition should not be attached, imposing as it does very onerous duties on the Minister for Finance and his Department at a time when he would not feel himself able to undertake the work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I really do think the Seanad ought to reconsider the principle involved in this amendment.  They are turning the Minister for Finance practically into a building department, and not even an independent, sole authority in the matter of building.  They are making him a sort of fifth wheel to the coach in building operations, in which there will be the contractor and the architect, and, in addition to these parties who we ordinarily understand in business, there will be the Minister for Finance, who has the power to supply, under certain conditions, certain materials. Well, I think it is very important to know how that is going to operate. If he is to supply that material, presumably he will have to keep a stock of it. If he stocks that material, and at a given moment wants to unload it to the contractor, he will have to do so at market price.  We all know the difficulties of buying wisely, even if a man spends his whole life at it.  I venture to suggest that it is not business, nor is he necessarily competent to go and buy in fluctuating markets, hold stocks of materials, and realise them at an advantage to the State, because he has got to put them in at not less than the market price. Now, &ldquo;not less than the market price&rdquo; sounds very nice.  As any practical <Col N="900" /> builder knows, and there are some practical builders here, the question of quality has to come in as well.  There are various grades.  You will be involved in referees to judge whether cement is good quality and whether it comes within the terms of this clause.  The contractor may say that this cement which you are offering him as a certain quality may not be that quality of cement at all. The Minister for Finance will say it is, and you will open the door to endless litigation, which will involve special tribunals, referees, or what not.  I wonder whether the Government have realised what this may quite likely entail. It is practically applying public money to the purchase of building materials, with all the losses and fluctuations of the market attendant thereon, and the well-known record of failure of all Government Departments when they pretended to go into matters of trade.  I would seriously move that the whole principle should be reconsidered, and I do so in the form of a direct negative to the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.S. GUINNESS</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad to know from the Minister whether the Minister for Finance is really anxious to undertake the duties which are set out in this amendment, because he is Minister for Finance, and not Minister for Public Works.  I endorse entirely Sir John Keane's remarks.  To make the Minister for Finance into a kind of building contractor is not exactly one of the duties which the Constitution envisaged. The Government has accepted the amendment, and I understand that they accepted it somewhat reluctantly, and would possibly be glad if the Seanad negatived it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will state quite frankly that I accepted this amendment because it took the sting out of the thing which was put into the Bill by the Seanad.  This thing, which was put into the Bill on the motion of Senator Parkinson, would force, under certain conditions, the Minister for Finance to undertake the work of a building contractor, although he might have no organisation, and might be totally unable to do it.  I accept the amendment because it means that the Minister for Finance could not be forced to undertake this duty unless he had the organisation and was willing to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The Seanad must recollect what their position is. When this Sub-section was before the Committee an amendment by Senator Parkinson was carried, and that amendment apparently made it obligatory on the part of the Minister to do this in certain cases.  The Government, while accepting the principle of that, have framed a new amendment, so as to make it not obligatory.  That is the distinction, so that you are dealing now with a Government amendment to the amendment that was carried to the Sub-section on the motion of Senator Parkinson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that makes the position quite clear.  I moved that this amendment be adopted because, although I was one of those who voted against Senator Parkinson's amendment, I did so because I believed it would be unworkable in the form in which it was proposed.  I quite agree as to the inadvisability of forcing the Minister for Finance to become virtually a contractor, but I think there is something to be said for the case that was put forward by Senator Parkinson, and that is that an occasion may arise when the Government could insist on the utilising of Irish materials, and, provided that it was not done to the detriment of the person who was building, I see no harm in giving the power in the form in which this amendment gives it.  It is not obligatory, and it simply leaves it in the power of the Government to do so if it thinks fit.  I think this amendment removes the main objection which Sir John Keane raised, and which in any case was not in the original amendment which we passed.  If you were to negative this, as he suggested, you leave the original amendment, but, then, according to his own argument, you would be in a worse state.</P>

      <P>I think that it is hardly consistent with the dignity of the Seanad to pass that amendment, which admittedly, on the face of it, the Government will not accept unless they are given leave to refuse to act on it.  It seems to me that for the Seanad to send to the Dail an amendment based on such a state of affairs is really hardly consistent with the dignity of the Seanad.  If it were to insist on something which really means business it would be different, but I think this does not mean business. <Col N="902" /> I do not think there is a busiman in this assembly who thinks that would for a moment put such a duty on the Minister for Finance as to hold stocks of materials, but it leaves him, by this amendment being passed, the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; being inserted, in the position that a person who has cement or timber, or any other thing can go to the Minister for Finance and annoy the life out of him to enable him to accept it.  It would upset all kinds of contracts, and it leaves a man quite unable to see whether the Minister for Finance is going to interfere or not, and it seems as bad a business amendment as I ever heard in my life. I hope that the Seanad will certainly not have anything to do with such a bad piece of business.</P>

      <P>I did not quite understand the situation before, but it is quite a different thing to know that we are talking on an amendment accepted by the Government.  You know what the situation was, and I really forget which way I voted, but at any rate I ought to have voted against it if I did not, but then we thought that the Government probably would not accept it. Now we are talking about a totally different thing, because we are now up against an inevitable thing, that if it is allowed to pass is going to be law, and all that I have been saying beforehand is going to happen.  Therefore it is a totally different situation to an amendment being merely passed by a majority in the Seanad.  It is this amendment now put forward with the Government sanction that the Seanad should seriously consider.  It is a much more serious thing than it was when the Seanad were only discussing the amendment which would be considered both by the Dáil and the Government, consequently I think we should be very slow to put forward a motion to rescind Senator Parkinson's amendment.  Let the Government and the Dáil consider it, but when we are now on an amendment agreed to by the Government, which presumably is going to be carried in the Dáil, then we are really considering something that is going to be a fact, and we should hold the view that this ought not to be acted on, although we might not move to rescind the original motion leaving it to its fate, when it came to the Dáil.  I think we are justified in letting both the Government and the Dáil know that certainly by some members of the Seanad it is looked upon as an extremely bad proposal.</P>

Senator Jameson has admitted that. The amendment was carried by, I think, 18 votes to 6, and I see the possibility of this amendment saving us from the position we were about to be placed in, and that is chiefly the reason I support the amendment.  The hardships of the Minister for Finance competing with the wholesale merchants were all included in Senator Parkinson's amendment, and it was carried by a majority of the Seanad.  If they did not know what the amendment meant, then there is no reason why it should be opened up to-day.  I think the Government has acted wisely in getting out of a difficult position.</P>

If you recollect the original amendment, that point was <Col N="907" /> very much stressed by Senator Parkinson. The permissive idea ran right through his amendment and in the amendment suggested the same reservation is made, so there is nothing obligatory in either the original or the Government amendment on the Minister to cause him to intervene or take up these duties which are permissive.  It would be a dead letter clause if the Minister finds that he has not the machinery to carry it into effect.  There will be no distinct advantage either to the State or to the parties concerned.  It is there for him as an authority to act within his own discretion.  What is the use of labouring the matter if it does not cast upon him in a mandatory form a certain obligation?</P>

If the Seanad will look at this amendment it will find that it is absolutely innocuous. The horrible possibility of the Minister for Finance becoming a building contractor can only come about on the application of himself.  You will find in line 3 that this condition cannot be attached to any decree except on the application of the Minister.  This is all verbiage, and unless you have a very energetic Minister who has a taste in that direction it will never operate.

I may call attention to the fact that in the printed journal of the Dáil, as well as in that of the Seanad, the figures are not entered in the case of a show of hands.  I think, in view of the difference of opinion which this amendment has created, that the Seanad should be given an opportunity of expressing its opinion on the general principle.

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I do that with increasing force after the remark of Senator O'Farrell, where he suggests that an energetic Minister might be tempted to take on building operations. I hope that our Ministers will be energetic, but I hope they will not be energetic in that direction.  It certainly opens the door; in certain circumstances the Minister for Finance may be tempted to embark on those building operations, and I think that is a great danger.  Anyone who goes in for building must know all about it.  The architect specifies accurately the nature and quality, and tests the material.  Everything must be gone through, and contracts are made and prices are established.  During the period building is going on, to give the power to anyone else to say, &ldquo;Here, I have material to substitute,&rdquo; would raise the whole question of whether that material is a satisfactory substitute for what the architect has specified.  I am not sure that you do not give a loophole to the contractor to break his contract. What I do suggest is that it will lead to litigation, and certainly it would not redound to the practical good sense of this Seanad.</P>

In this case we have already verbally amended in the Committee Stage, and now it is suggested that we should wipe out what we have already done in Committee, and amend on the Report Stage.  That will be altering a principle to which the Seanad has already committed itself, and I suggest to those who have already spoken about the dignity of the Seanad, that they should bear that in mind.  The whole discussion has been provoked in the interests of people who did not realise what they were doing a week ago, and who if they paid close attention to this amendment might have done then everything they are trying to do to-day.</P>

      <P>The Senator seems to conclude that I have voted in favour of this amendment.  I do not believe I did.  Now, talking about the dignity of the Seanad in altering the amendment, the reason we are speaking against it is that this is not an ordinary amendment put forward by this Seanad, and agreed to in the Report Stage by the Seanad. In this the Government had accepted the amendment, and accepting it in the form in which they have done so, they have practically told us that they will not accept a mandatory clause.  In the discussion I have not heard one single argument against the really vital principle. <Col N="911" /> It was perfectly safe to pass an amendment because the Minister had the matter entirely in his own hands. He need not act unless he liked.  But we have no right to pass an amendment of that kind.  That is why we are now proposing to delete it, because it is an amendment that will not enhance the dignity of anyone concerned.  It is not to the dignity of the Government to accept a thing they may or may not act upon, which is not &ldquo;shall&rdquo; nor &ldquo;will,&rdquo; and which is a bad clause.  It is difficult for a Judge, with such a clause in front of him, to know whether he will or will not act.  It looks to me rank bad lawmaking to pass an amendment in such a shape, and therefore I speak of the dignity of the Seanad, because I cannot see that we should stand here and pass a clause like that.</P>

It is suggested, however, as a result of the discussion, to eliminate Sub-section 9 altogether.  Sub-section 9 was put in originally for the protection of various people whose property had been injured or destroyed, and who, the Government thought, might not be sufficiently fairly dealt with in the other provisions of the Section.  The Sub-section itself has been changed and expanded from time to time since it was first drafted, and other changes have been made in Section 10 itself, and we have come to the conclusion that, as the rest of the Section now stands, a slight amendment will make Sub-section 9 unnecessary.  A person under this Section is entitled to have a full re-instatement condition attached to his decree if he shows reasonable cause. We believe that where any place was occupied as a residence or maintained as a residence the Judge would certainly agree that it was a case for a full re-instatement condition.  There are circumstances in which a Judge, of course, might not agree that a re-instatement condition was reasonable, or might not agree that the cause shown was reasonable cause; that is, where there was a very large house which had been only partially occupied, a house, say, with 100 bedrooms.  The Judge would not regard the evidence put forward in regard to that house being used by the applicant or his family as a case in which there should be a full re-instatement condition.  In that case it would be open to the Judge to give a partial re-instatement condition and to allow a substituted building to be erected, a building that would be suitable to modern times and the circumstances that exist at present.  As Sub-section 8 previously <Col N="914" /> stood in such a case the total amount that might be awarded was limited by the estimated market value, to the amount by which the market value of the injured building was reduced by the injury.  We are dealing with a case where the fixing of the market value would be exceedingly difficult.  If it is a very large house there is no market value that can be arrived at as there is no sale for that kind of a house.  These houses from the point of view of saleability are certainly white elephants and it would be practically impossible to arrive at anything like the market value.  It is proposed then to alter Sub-section 8 and to deal with it in this way; Section 10, Sub-section (8): to insert after the word &ldquo;but&rdquo; in line 51, the words&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nevertheless so that</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a)</i>  in any case in which the injured building was at or about the time of the injury ordinarily maintained as a residence for the applicant or his family the total amount of the compensation shall not be less than the probable cost of the erection of the substituted building; and</P>
      <P>
        <i>(b)</i>  in every other case.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 10, Sub-section (9)</P>
      <P>To delete the whole of the Sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then it goes on to say that in every other case it shall be limited as previously. There still remains the case of the person who might not desire to re-build a residence, and we thought of such people in drafting the original Section 9.  However they are provided for, I think, in two ways.  In the case of some of these buildings there might be a market value.  There would be a very low market value, that is the market value that would arise from the possibility of the acquisition of such buildings by institutions.  We know that big houses that would not be used for anything else have been acquired by institutions and a certain price has been paid for them.  If the owner did not want any reinstatement condition attached he might rely on Sub-section 7, which says &ldquo;The compensation in any case in which no reinstatement condition is attached to the decree shall not exceed the amount by which the market value of the buildings was reduced by the injury.&rdquo; That deals with the case of a person who does not want to re-build <Col N="915" /> anything.  It was felt that there were peculiar circumstances and that we should not think solely of the Government point of view in dealing with people whose houses had been burned out and who might not wish to reside again in the neighbourhood or to erect any building.  The point of view has been put up from time to time to the Government that where no rebuilding was going to be done there should be no compensation.</P>
    <P>Of course that is not a point of view that has been accepted by the Government. Compensation could be given on the basis of market value where any market value could be established. Under Sub-section 5 the Judge might attach a partial reinstatement condition if the person did not wish to rebuild a residence there.  He could under the provisions dealing with partial reinstatement, which are 10 (2): &ldquo;A condition (in this section called a &lsquo;partial reinstatement condition&rsquo;) that the compensation shall be applied in or towards the erection on or near the site of the injured building of another building (in this section called a &lsquo;substituted building&rsquo;) of a nature named by the applicant and specified in the decree and differing from the nature of the injured building.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An amendment proposed by Sir John Keane has been accepted, which enables a substituted building to be erected anywhere in the Saorstát, provided it will serve a housing need.  The Definition Sub-section of this Clause 10 states:&mdash;&ldquo;A substituted building may consist of one or more attached, detached or semidetached houses, whether dwelling houses, offices or business premises or such other structure as the Judge may approve.&rdquo;  It may be a building of any nature approved by the Judge and erected anywhere provided it serves a housing need.  In dealing with cases where people might not wish to rebuild residences where they were destroyed they could erect other buildings on the spot and get their compensation in that way.  They may erect a substituted building anywhere they will serve a housing need in the Free State, and in case they were not going to rebuild at all, or made no case that would appeal to the Judge for the attachment of even a partial reinstatement condition, they <Col N="916" /> would have to rely on the institution price that might be paid for the building that was destroyed.  I think if the amendment was adopted, if Sub-section 9 is deleted, and if this amendment is made to Sub-section 8, any possible cases that may arise will be fairly covered by the Bill.  On the other hand the Government is sufficiently protected, because under Sub-section 5 the Judge will not give a partial reinstatement condition where there would be an unreasonable discrepancy between the cost of erecting the substituted building and the market value thereof when completed. That would prevent the erection of enormous structures.  In the case of a house partially destroyed with the walls standing we are quite satisfied that under 3 B the owner is covered.  There certainly will be reasonable cause for a full reinstatement condition, which will mean that the applicant will get the full cost of putting the building back into its original condition, minus the difference in value that may arise, because in the reinstatement the value of the building may be very considerably increased.</P>

      <P>I move in Section 13, Sub-section (5), after the word &ldquo;section,&rdquo; in line 41, to add the words &ldquo;with interest at 5 per cent. as from the date of the award.&rdquo;  This was left over from the Committee Stage, the Seanad will remember, because the Minister raised the point that surely interest could not be expected on money earmarked for reinstatement. <Col N="918" /> Of course, I might have answered, if I had been quick enough, that it does not apply to such money. This section merely applies to the cash part of the award, and I submit in all fairness that the cash should carry interest as from the date of the award. We hope that there will not be delays, but one never knows, and it is within the knowledge of the Seanad that many of the sufferers are almost destitute, and that they are entitled to the money from the awards, and until they get the money it would be only equitable that they should have interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I promised to consider this matter.  I have gone into it since, and I am afraid that I will have to oppose it.  I believe there is a technical difficulty in passing it.  I understand that this is not one of the amendments which, if it went through the Seanad, could come before the Dáil in the ordinary way.  It would be a case in which we would require to have a message from the Governor-General and a Financial Resolution of the Dáil before it would be in order for consideration by the Dáil.  That is, of course, not an insuperable barrier, but it is one reason we have against it &mdash; that is, that provision was not made for this in the Financial Resolution.  I think it is really quite a small matter, because in future there would be no necessity for any great delay in these cases.  There will not be this question of the difficulty of getting releases and so on that have occurred in the cases before the Shaw Commission. When the award is given, if no doubt arises, the amount of the award can be paid immediately, and the question of interest would be practically negligible.  In case of any doubt there is the provision in Sub-section 9 of Section 13 for the payment of the amount of the award into Court.  I would submit to the Senator that if interest were payable probably we would have many more awards lodged in Court, and the applicant would have the difficulty of getting the money out of Court and the costs that that would entail. Of course, if the amount is paid into Court, I am not sure whether it will be invested automatically or not, or whether an application is necessary for its investment, but in any case money paid into Court will, I take it, be invested, and interest <Col N="919" /> will accrue on that.  That will not be interest that the Minister for Finance will have to pay, and I think you will find that if interest were to be payable in all cases from the date of the award. if any difficulty were to arise, instead of holding back a little and attempting to have the matter straightened out, so that to make payment direct, the Minister for Finance would get rid of the liability for interest and of his difficulties by paying the money into court and allowing the person entitled to it to take the necessary steps to get it out.  If the Minister for Finance had been able to be here to-day, he would have assured the Seanad that he intends to take every possible step to have the money paid with the greatest promptitude.  He realises that there are many people in great difficulties and distress through not being able to have their cases settled, and to get their money before this, and his intention is that, so far as he can manage it, and so far as the machinery of his Department is concerned, once the award is made there shall be no delay in making the payments.  He does not anticipate that except in such cases as those in which it would be necessary to pay the money into court, there would be any delay that need be seriously considered.  I think that the matter is not a very big one, and I consider it is one that, from the point of view of its results, would scarcely justify us in going through the procedure necessary to have it adopted if it were to be put through the Dáil and adopted by the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I beg to propose:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That a message be sent to An Dáil when the Damage to Property (Compensation) Bill, 1923, is returned as amended, to the effect that it is the opinion of the Seanad that it would add to public confidence if the provisions proposed by the Government for compensation for personal injury and for payments to dependants of persons killed, were embodied in a separate Bill and submitted to the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to argue the point of the resolution as the matter was effectively and at some length debated in the Seanad, but I would just like briefly to point out that I have endeavoured in this resolution to state as clearly as I could what was the difference of opinion that I think exists between the Seanad and the Dáil, if I am correct in judging the expressions in the recent debates.  A good deal of misunderstanding, in the public Press and elsewhere has arisen, I think, out of speeches which might be taken to suggest that the Government were not giving or prepared to give compensation to injured persons, or were not prepared to make payments to the dependants of persons killed as a direct result of the fighting in Ireland.  That, as we know now, is not the case.  As Mr. Blythe put it quite clearly on the last occasion, it is not even a matter of money, for they expect to pay quite as much money under their scheme as would occur if this were made legal.  The view I take personally is that in order to prevent this misunderstanding, and also as a general principle, that it would be much better <Col N="922" /> if they see their way to give legal effect to their proposals, with the substance of which I agree, and with the tribunal of which I have absolute confidence so far as its personnel is concerned.  I think they should introduce a Bill making provision legally, and what I propose is, I think, the view of the Seanad.  If I am correct, I suggest this is the wisest way we can act in the matter.  We thus make clear what our view is without attempting to use undue pressure, which I do not think would be the duty of the Seanad, constituted as it is.  We do not press an amendment to the Bill before us, but on a matter closely related we suggest that another Bill should be laid before us by the Government, and not by a private member.</P>

      <P>I have pleasure in seconding the motion. I think it is desirable that on this point there should be no misunderstanding whatever, not only in Ireland but on the other side of the water, where there is a great disposition on the part of a large section of the people to consider that the whole intention and object of the Bill are to penalise certain sections of the people here.  When reading the papers last week I thought it was made clear that the volume of opinion in the Seanad was that so far from the Government desiring or having any intention of penalising any section, they are animated by the most earnest desire to do what is right by everybody.  I think to clear up any misunderstanding, the suggestion of Senator Douglas should be accepted, and if possible the Government should bring in a separate Bill; it would be very advantageous.</P>

      <P>In commenting on what the last Senator said, I wish to say that a letter appeared in the London <i>Times</i> about three weeks ago from some person acting for refugees, saying the Government was excluding compensation for personal injuries in order that loyalists injured in the late war might be left penniless.  I think that is an example of the kind of misunderstanding the Government has to face over this Bill.  I do not think anyone of us doubts for one moment that the tribunal the Government will set up will be perfectly just in this matter.  It is a question of dealing with a country which is exceedingly suspicious, and refugees <Col N="923" /> who are exceedingly suspicious, and the circumstances are such as likely to leave these suspicions in existence for a considerable time.</P>

      <P>There was so much unanimity in the Seanad in this matter that, as far as the Seanad is concerned, there is very little doubt that the motion, put forward as it is by Senator Douglas, will pass, but I cannot forget that in the discussion the Government told us that the injured parties would be dealt with in their opinion better and quicker and more favourably in every way under their proposal than they would if they brought in an Act which gave them a legal claim.  They produced very sound reasons, as far as one could judge them. why they did not want the law altered, and the claim for personal compensation made a legal claim.  It would be, as far as I remember of what was stated, an alteration in the law as it now stands. I do not know whether I am right in that, but it struck my mind that there were two reasons that they gave us&mdash; one is that their proposal, according to their judgment, was the best for the claimants, and that they could not admit the claim of making it a legal obligation in future that personal injuries should have a legal claim for compensation by the State.  I quite admit what Senator Sir Hutcheson Poe says as to what the public on the other side of the water think about the intentions of the Government over here in regard to this Compensation Bill, but we have read statements so exaggerated and so untrue put forward with such weight, and everything of the kind, which everyone over here engaged in handling the subject knows to be such absurdities that I doubt if it is wise for the Government or ourselves to take much notice of these attacks, but to take care in every way, of course, that the Act when it does pass fulfils the justice of the case.  Now, if we pass this resolution, and the Government find that, as they did at the beginning, they must prefer their method of settling the thing to ours, I am not quite sure whether the Seanad will not be increasing the difficulties of the Government by showing a difference of opinion between the Government and the Seanad, which we know really does not exist.  I agree with the wording of the motion; but I cannot see the Government <Col N="924" /> withdrawing from the position they are in, and I think we may be creating difficulties which we do not intend to create by adopting this resolution.  I doubt if we could pass it without a good deal more consideration than we are able to give it this afternoon.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that this question has been brought up again, because it was debated at great length and decided the last day.  On that occasion I gave only a silent vote and did not speak and the result was that I was accused by a friend of doing a dreadful thing &mdash; of having voted with the Government, a thing which I never previously did and which I only did when the Government was wrong.  There are two arguments being put forward here. One is that human life is sanctified, and the other is that people must go cap in hand to the Government.  I asked some of those in favour of this motion whether soldiers were to be included in this Bill and they said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and the reason was that they were paid for it.  Then in that case the life of a soldier is not sanctified. When people come to consider these things they will find that these are only phrases used to bring tears to our eyes and that they really have nothing sound about them.  About some lives there is a great deal of sanctity, and in the last few years people have lost their lives which were worth more than anything which could be put upon them, but there are other lives which I think are not so very sanctified.  I have gone through a good many years of life and I have met people whose lives were neither saintly nor sanctified.  There were a good many Black-and-Tans killed in this country and I do not know whether their lives were sanctified.  On the whole, I think the Government on this matter were quite right to treat it separately from property, as it can be dealt with only in a different way.</P>

      <P>I am going to vote for this motion, although I agree that it is a very milk and water way of dealing with important matters.  It is touching to witness the simple faith of Senators in the word and promise of the Government when the interests which they represent are not affected, but I saw none of that faith given in regard to compensation for material damage.  In fact we <Col N="925" /> had a certain display of what one might term voraciousness in regard to other classes.  We had a very eloquent attempt at clothing the modern Shylock in the garb of Bunyan's hero.  We are told in a matter of this kind to take the word of the Government and leave it to the good faith of the Minister, whoever he may be, to do justice to the people, some of whose lives Senator Moore says are not sanctified and not worth much The arguments put up regarding the difficulty of valuing human life might with equal force be put up in regard to the Employers' Liability Act and the Workmen's Compensation Act, but they have not been put forward.  These Acts work well although they place a low value on human life.  I think it is up to the Seanad to send a message of this kind to the Dáil, but I hope they will not vote for it because they know that the Government will turn it down, but that they will vote for it as a genuine expression of honest conviction, even though it may not take definite form.  As I pointed out before, the country will be asked to shoulder a very big financial responsibility in regard to compensation to one particular class.  A large section of the Seanad is interested in the question of compensation for material damage, and a larger section may be interested later on, though I hope not, but it is a serious problem to find some people making law in regard to things in which they are interested and shutting out people who in the opinion of some of us are equally entitled to consideration for the loss of breadwinners or of the means of earning their livelihood for themselves or their families.</P>

      <P>I think this resolution is an invitation to undo what was done on Friday, when the Seanad expressed itself as satisfied with the arrangements made by the Government to consider the question of <i>ex gratia</i> grants.  Senator Douglas to-day has again expressed himself as satisfied that no wrong will be done and that cases of hardship and suffering will be treated, with consideration, but Senator O'Farrell takes the other view and will not trust the Government at all.  We hear a lot of criticism about placing human life on a lower plane than property and about penalising civic courage, <Col N="926" /> but I would ask those who advocate rewarding civic courage to consider how far this brings them.  For instance, if a man loses his life in rescuing people from drowning or from a burning house &mdash;two of the highest forms of civic courage &mdash; would they advocate here that the dependants of that man should receive compensation from the State?  I think that the Government have gone as far as they reasonably could be expected to go and that it was obvious to anyone who considers the matter impartially that they simply ruled out claims for consequential damage and personal injuries in order to limit the indebtedness of the country.  This may excite the derision of certain Senators who treat L.S.D with lofty scorn and to whom millions mean nothing &mdash; simply a daisy in a bull's mouth &mdash; and to hear them talk one would think that the Government had a huge heap of money as one has coal in one's back garden, and that those who wanted it had simply to back in their carts.  I would remind them that no matter what device is adopted John Citizen has finally to pay.  These claims must be met by taxation which will press very hard on poor people, and afterwards when workingmen complain that they have to pay more for their tobacco, sugar or tea than their neighbours across the border I am sure that the gentlemen who are now pressing these claims will be loudest in shouting for relief.</P>

      <P>I think it a pity that this should come before us after the discussion and vote the last day, and that some cogent reason was not given us as to why this motion of Senator Douglas' was brought forward. In explanation, Senator Douglas said it would add to public confidence. Senator Yeats says a letter appeared in the London &ldquo;Times.&rdquo;  Those are small reasons indeed.  As far as the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; is concerned, those of us who have lived in Ireland care little about it.  If we take as an instance of what appeared in the &ldquo;Times,&rdquo; the hubbub made last week, we can place all those things at their proper value.  The difficulty about this I see is that the dependents of everybody whose life has been lost can come forward, and say that they are dependents of those deceased, whether they are or not.  That would prevent people who are really dependent from <Col N="927" /> getting their claims, owing to the delay and discussion that would arise.  I am sorry that Senator Farren is not here, because there are few people who know better than he does of the difficulty in connection with the dependents of those who, a few years ago, were in prison or so on.  We know that in all cases everybody who was killed had a dependent, according to the claims made, whether they really had or not.  I do think that until we arrive at a decision about genuine dependents, we should accept what the Government proposes.  Therefore, I am sorry I cannot vote for the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to offer the strongest opposition to the passing of this Bill, as I believe the majority of the people view it with disfavour.  I think it will be admitted that the agricultural section of the community, the farmers and the agricultural labourers who are opposed to this Bill, form the bulk of the Nation.  It would be very wrong for the Oireachtas to pass any law which would hamper or entail loss to these people, especially as the other sections of the community living in towns and cities would not be inconvenienced or suffer any loss by the continuance of the existing time.  There is nothing to prevent people in the towns and cities from so regulating their hours of starting work as to suit their own convenience.  There is nothing to prevent them starting their work one or two hours earlier than at present.  We have always hoped that when we got a Parliament and a Government of our own, freely elected by the people of Ireland, only such laws would be passed as would be for the benefit of the majority of the people, and no matter what laws another country, differently circumstanced, passed for the benefit of its people, that there should be nothing to compel us to copy foreign legislation which would be unsuitable to the wants and needs of our own people.  If the Summer Time Act had not been passed in Great Britain it is almost a certainty that we would not be called upon to discuss this Bill.  We must remember that the conditions in Great Britain are entirely different from those existing here.  In Great Britain agriculture plays only a minor role in the life of the people, and the industrial population occupying the cities and towns form the vast majority of the people there.  We have also to remember that the ordinary time in Great Britain is the natural sun time, whereas here the existing time is from twentyfive to forty minutes in advance of the sun time.  Many arguments put forward in the Dáil in favour of this Bill appear to me to be based on a misapprehension or on incorrect information.  It has been stated that practically all the European countries have adopted the principle of Summer Time, and that the farmers in <Col N="930" /> these countries have the same difficulties as in Ireland, but that recognising the benefits internationally of adopting such an Act they have withdrawn their opposition.  Since that argument was used we have seen that the farmers in France have compelled their Government to abandon their intention of forcing on them Summer Time.  In the case of France and England the volume of traffic and inter-communication between the two countries is far in excess of that between Ireland and Great Britain.  It has been admitted by the promoters of the Bill that dairy and tillage farmers will suffer losses.  They minimise that statement by saying that that class of farmer is not very numerous to-day in the country.  I can assert that that class of farmer gives more employment and produces more food than any other. The Seanad is now being called upon to pass a Bill which will hamper, harrass, and cause loss to that section of the community, and that will result, I fear, in the diminution of the already diminished area under tillage.  It has been stated that there is one class of farmer that would benefit by this Bill, the fruit and market farmer.  It has been asserted that he can gather his produce with the dew on it in the morning. I do not know anything about that class of farmer, but if that is an advantage to him I must say that that class of farming is not very extensively practised. It has also been stated that this Summer Time will not cause any serious loss or real inconvenience to the farmers.  If that were so, I would not oppose it.  Any farmer with practical experience knows that very often crops would be entirely lost or would be seriously damaged if the farming community did not work up to a very late hour in favourable weather in order to save these crops.  Another reason why it was stated the Bill should be passed, and which I think carried some votes in the Dáil, was that nobody need obey this law.  If this law is not to be obeyed I think it would be more dignified for the Oireachtas to leave the clock alone, with liberty to every section of the community to rise and go to bed whenever they wish, and to start their work and conclude it and do their business at times that would suit their convenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is very undesirable, and I have the strongest objection to passing <Col N="931" /> laws if they are not intended to be obeyed.  The agricultural labourers are just as much opposed to this Bill as the farmers, as they have the strongest objection to being compelled to attend to their work in the early hours provided by it.  As regards other countries we have Canada with five different times, the United States with four times, and I am not aware that there is any great inconvenience or loss in connection with trains carrying passengers between one country and the other.  We had Irish time in force here some years ago, before Greenwich time was imposed on us by the British Parliament, and I do not remember that there was any great inconvenience in carrying on traffic between Ireland and Great Britain.  I would like the Seanad to remember that there is very great depression in agriculture in Ireland as well as in other countries, and they might consider that certain remedial measures are being considered elsewhere to help agriculture. Up to the present the farming community have lacked similar assistance from the Oireachtas, but it is very possible that in the near future they may ask for such assistance.  In other places it is contemplated to give subsidies by a reduction of rates to help the farmers. If the Oireachtas is not in a position to give material aid to the farmers they should at least refrain from forcing this Bill with the evil effects which it would entail on the already hard-pressed farmers of Ireland.</P>

      <P>In opposing the Second Reading of this Bill I desire to point out that the Summer Time Act was first forced on this country by the English Parliament, a body legislating for an industrial population.  I am quite willing to admit that the Summer Time Act may have conferred some benefits on townspeople.  It has been stated that there will be confusion if the Summer Time Act is enforced in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and not enforced in the Irish Free State.  Some time ago there was a difference in the time between the two countries and I am not aware that it gave rise to any inconvenience. We all know that France has refused to continue the Summer Time Act evidently in deference to the wishes of the agricultural population.  For the <Col N="932" /> benefit of those who are unacquainted with agricultural work I may state that the hours of the evening are much more favourable for harvesting operations than those of the morning, which are generally useless for that purpose.  I have never known farmers to be so agreed on any subject as this.  As agriculture is the main industry of the country I think it should be given consideration and should not be penalised.  I hope the Seanad will reject this Bill.</P>

      <P>It does not matter. Everyone knows, and well the Ministers know, that this Summer Time Bill is a minority Bill.  The majority of the people of Ireland are against it, and the only reason that I ever heard put forward in its favour is that it confers a great favour on the minority than it does the reverse to the majority.  I do not really know how you are to sum up an equation of that sort.  You might as well say Shylock gained a greater advantage from the great interest he charged on his money than the unfortunate people who had to pay it suffered by the loss of the money.  It seems to be an unreasonable argument and one which is futile.  I regret that an Irish Government should follow in the footsteps of an English Government.  In England the great majority of people live in the towns while here the majority live in the country.  The circumstances are also totally different.  To come to the question of fisheries, down at Foynes and Arklow the trains start with the fish at 7 o'clock in the morning.  We have already thrown away half-an-hour of our time by adopting English time, and if we put on another hour it will make <Col N="933" /> one and a-half hours.  In Foynes that would mean one and three-quarter hours. It is just to please a few people in the towns that they should be expected to get up in the middle of the night to bring in their fish.  They cannot do it, because they cannot bring in the fish at that time of the morning, and it practically ruins the fishing in these places, and all this just to please a few lazy fellows in the towns who will not get up early.  It is not necessary to put back the clock to make a man get up early; all he has to do is to shake himself, get up an hour earlier or not, or do what he likes.  Why should the poor country people be caused all these annoyances to please the fellows in the towns?  It has been stated that it is a difference of an hour and three quarters, which is a great deal too much. People have referred to the example of France, but they have forgotten that Paris is east of London, whereas we are west of it, and therefore it does not affect France in the same manner as it affects us.  The most the people of Paris would have to gain would be 50 minutes whereas we lose an hour and three-quarters. As a matter of fact even they have thrown it out and gone back to the half hour, which is just the ordinary difference we have here.  These are sensible people.  If there were another island further west than this, and if they followed English time they would have to get up three or four hours earlier, or in the middle of the night.  If there were a referendum on this subject, do the Ministers think it would pass?  I am not quite sure the Constitution would not give them a referendum on it.  If any disagreeable person chooses to propose it I do not think there is any question but that the Government would be defeated, and a great many people would help the referendum, because everybody in the country would vote against this proposal, because everyone would go round the country to help to get votes against it.  People say that failure to adopt it would put out trains and various things like that, but during almost the whole of my life there was a 25 minutes difference in the time between England and Ireland.  It did not upset train or steamer arrangements during all this time, and nobody thought of doing this until it was done for war purposes in England.  Then it was found that it would upset traffic between Ireland and <Col N="934" /> England if we kept our clocks at the proper time.  How did we manage for all these years?  We got on quite well without it and it upset nothing.  I think it would be very much better if the Minister would go back and adopt the old Irish system of having our own time and sticking to it.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister speaks I would like to say a word, if it were only to relieve Senator O'Farrell's mind by telling him that I am against this Bill.  What has most impressed me in considering the advantages and disadvantages of Summer Time is the fact that countries like Canada, France, Holland, Denmark, and Germany, after a few years experience, have dropped it notwithstanding the great boon it was supposed to confer on the industrial population.  Now, if the economic argument is sound &mdash; the argument that is expressed so strongly by the advocates of the Bill &mdash; it is not likely that these countries would reject it, considering that their industrial population is a great deal more than ours.  Their industrial centres are a great deal more populous, and, as far as I can see, the economic argument leaves them cold. This should make us pause, as the people of these countries are by no means so stupid as not to know what is good for them, and as industrial competitors they are nothing behind us, in either keenness or science.  Certainly England, not to mention this country, has much to learn from them.  These countries were all parties to a world agreement as to time which was reached at a conference of international scientists, held at Washington in the early 80's, and of which the imposition of Greenwich time in Ireland is a direct violation.  Notwithstanding this and the fact that the countries I have mentioned have rejected Summer Time it is now proposed to apply Summer Time to this country, to which it is suited least of all.  It is proposed, not only to apply it but give us a double dose of it, because I maintain that with the imposition of Greenwich time we already have Summer Time.  As Colonel Moore mentioned, in some places in the West of Ireland such as Galway, they were 36 minutes, and in some parts of Kerry they are 42 minutes later than Greenwich, and when you add an hour to that you will have noon arriving about a <Col N="935" /> quarter past ten in the morning.  That is, I think, an intolerable position.  The Government tell us that we can ignore this Bill.  It is not very dignified nor self-respecting on the part of the Government to introduce legislation and to invite the country to ignore it.  The country cannot ignore it; it is compelled to recognise it.  If a farmer wishes to go to a market, a fair, a post office or a town to transact business he must recognise this new time and the result is a welter of confusion in the country, one part going by one time and another by another.  If the people want to take advantage of this extra hour of daylight the obvious and natural course for them is to rise an hour earlier.  If people are early risers it does not require a Summer Time Bill to get them up.  It is only, as Colonel Moore said, the lazy fellows who want to lie in bed until 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning, who want to be coaxed out of bed by legislation and want to be deluded into the belief that 6.30 is actually 8 o'clock.  I think it is a ridiculous Bill and a Bill that is simply dignifying humbug and make-belief by legislation, and that the proper name of the Bill should not be the Summer Time Bill, but should be the Lazy Man's Delusion Bill.</P>

      <P>A member of the Dáil said to me that he had intended to vote against this Bill, but when he had heard the arguments against it in the Dáil he voted for it, and it was on that principle that I did not intervene at the beginning. I wanted the opponents of the Bill to make their case for me.  Now, it is all nonsense to talk about the extra twentyfive minutes.  That has nothing to do with the purpose of this Bill.  That twenty-five minutes is now part of the ordinary conditions.  It is part of the thing that is taken into account when times of doing anything are fixed.  It need not be considered, and it ought not to be considered in connection with this matter.  This matter is dealing with the change to be made during summer time. Senator Linehan talked about passing laws that would be of benefit to the majority of the people.  He believed, now that we had our own Legislature, that we should only have laws that would benefit the majority of the people.  I do not think it is a doctrine that anyone <Col N="936" /> would subscribe to.  There can be tyranny, as we all know, by the majority, just as there can be tyranny by the individual, and we have to consider the minority as well as the majority.  Our case in this matter is that it would benefit considerably the minority of our people&mdash;that it will be a real benefit to them, and that it will not do any damage to anybody. We have heard a good deal of talk about the damage it does to agriculturists.  For my part, I do not believe it has done a pennyworth of damage to agriculturists in the past, or that it will do any damage in the future.  I believe that is the kind of talk which is easy to put together, and which has really nothing behind it.  There is no use either in talking about lazy men. The worker in the city cannot decide to start his work an hour earlier.  If he is a worker in a shop, he cannot decide that the shop will be open an hour earlier. The owner of a business place cannot decide that it will be open an hour earlier, because he has to consider such matters as posts, railways, and telegraphs.  What is to be done in those cases is to get the whole community to move as a unit.  The individual cannot alter his time of starting business at will, and the individual employer cannot alter at will the time at which his employees will start.  Anybody who has lived in Dublin, for instance, during the past two or three years will agree that the long evenings, with the people out on the streets until dusk, through getting up an hour earlier in the morning, is a thing that must be of the greatest advantage to the citizens from the point of view both of enjoyment and health.  Undoubtedly it means that the ordinary working people in the city have an extra hour's daylight in which to be out in the evening in the roads, streets, and parks.</P>

    <P>Now that is a thing in which we should not say the minority does not matter, that we should ignore them and consider only the prejudices of some people who do not want a change.  The fact that this was first adopted by the British Parliament should not affect us.  We should look at it as our own problem, and, as far as the Government is concerned, we look upon it as a thing we have to consider and come to a decision upon. Neither here nor in the Dáil has anybody said anything that would, I think, carry any conviction that this Bill will <Col N="937" /> do any damage to agriculturalists.  As a matter of fact we know for their own business purposes they simply ignore it. It makes no change in the actual time, the time by the sun by which they start their work, and consequently they are not injured by it.  That is the experience I have had in any part of the country I have been in since it came into operation. Agricultural work started the same time as before and no one suffered.  Then there is the question of the border difficulty, and it is one we cannot quite ignore.  For instance, we have railway lines running across the border two or three times perhaps in the course of a few miles, and there would be a certain amount of difficulty from the point of view of the railway companies if we have different times on the two sides of the border. That is a matter that we ought to give some little consideration to, and we ought to take it into account when we are deciding whether or not we should adopt this Bill.  It will certainly cause some degree of confusion there.  On Sunday next the six counties time will be changed, and if we decide that it is not to be changed here we have got little time to make the necessary adjustments. This Bill is only intended to run till 31st December next.  A statute will then have to be brought in renewing it.  If the Seanad feels that it ought not to be continued it will have an opportunity in December next of striking out that. That will give any amount of time for railway companies and the Post Office to make any adjustments that may be necessary.  I will put one point of view and that is that it is a thing that benefits large numbers of people and that it has been resisted largely on political grounds, but I think that it ought to be given one year's trial as our own measure, as something not imposed on us, but something we did ourselves.  I know myself that many people opposed it because it was one of the things done by the British Government at a time feeling against the British Government was acute.  I suggest it would be a good thing to give this measure a chance of being judged on its merits.  If at the end of this year they feel it should not be continued, then it could be knocked out in December and the matter would be done.  There will also be ample time for people <Col N="938" /> along the Border and for railways and others to make their arrangements and to carry on with a different time across the Six County Border.  As far as I have heard or have been able to observe, the only difficulty it imposed on country people was calculating the real time. Undoubtedly you are continually meeting people in the country who if it was 9 o'clock were scratching their heads and wondering whether it was 8 o'clock or 10 o'clock.  They had great difficulties in making that calculation because of the mental strain it imposed, and they were against the Summer Time for this reason apart from the political objection.  I do not think it is a sort of mental strain we should shrink from putting on the people.  If they had to think along mathematical lines it would perhaps be good for them.  I would suggest to the Seanad that at this stage they ought not hastily to turn down the Bill, that if they are against it they should give it one chance, one summer as an Irish measure and not a thing that there was any question of politics concerned in.  Then deal with it in December next if still opposed to it, and if necessary let it be struck out of the Expiring Laws Continuance Act, and the matter will be done with, and there will be three or four months in which the people concerned about this time on the border can make their arrangements.</P>

      <P>To judge by the Minister's remarks you might think this was the first year we tried this Bill.  I am speaking now from the point of view of agriculture, which has had three years' experience of this Bill, and the agriculturalists have made up their minds very strongly that it is highly unpopular.  I assure the Seanad if they went through the country amongst these Farmers' Unions, everywhere you go you would get evidence of the unpopularity of this Summer Time.  I cannot believe the objection is due either to politics or prejudice.  It is certainly free from any political thought or suggestion, and I refuse to believe that it is one wholesale mass of prejudice.  There is a strong feeling of inconvenience and of detrimental effect to their industry.  Although personally I prefer Summer Time, I feel on this matter I must study what is wanted by <Col N="939" /> the majority of the people of the country engaged in our principal industry fundamentally underlying most of the main prosperity of the country.  That being so, I feel with majority rule, that there is a duty due in this case, and it is not a question of relative advantage to the townsman as against the countryman. No principle is involved, and surely in that case majority rule ought to prevail.  It is because I firmly believe the majority of the country is opposed to the Bill, that I am going to vote against it, though I prefer it myself.  The Minister suggested that farmers can contract out.  It is not quite so simple as that.  I know in some cases it is done by arrangement, but I know in others employers and employees cannot arrange it, and in that case the thing breaks down, and Summer Time has to prevail. To deprive a farmer of an hour and three quarters of his best time is a very serious injury.  You cannot assess the damage it does, just as you cannot assess damage done by rats on a farm.  The damage done by rats is enormous, and no one would believe it.  The cumulative effect of the damage done by a thing like this is colossal; and for that reason it has a serious effect on the economic condition of the country.  The debit balance is against recreation or leisure hours of the town population.  What would be very interesting&mdash;I do not suggest it be done now, but perhaps later on when the Register is ready &mdash; would be to try a referendum on this question.  I think if it were put to the test of the vote that the Government would find that it would do some damage to their prestige.</P>

      <P>Mr. Blythe is trying to pass his Bill by ridicule.  I do not think that he produced any argument in favour of the Bill except that his Bill was so late the effect of not passing it would cause confusion.  If England were to drop this Bill next year, I would wager Mr. Blythe that we should drop it too if the present Government were in power. We are accustomed to minority rule &mdash; we take it for granted &mdash; and this morning the <i>Independent</i> instructed us to put on our clocks an hour next Sunday.  As usual, we allow the nimble townsmen to boss us.  This is only a question of convenience, and I submit that it would be possible to carry out the advantages of <Col N="940" /> this Bill by an order directing the Government offices to open and trains to run an hour earlier.  The probability is that large institutions such as banks would open an hour earlier, and therefore I do not see why we should be inconvenienced by statute when the minority could be convenienced by order.  It is not necessary to reject this Bill for fear of confusion, because by the means I have suggested the time-tables could be arranged and the townsman could get his air in the evening.</P>

      <P>I have some diffidence in speaking on this Bill, because I have no clever phrases to introduce.  I think a good deal of discussion is beside the point and does not deal with the real issue.  Sir John Keane said that it was a matter between the advantage of the town and the detriment of the country, and he suggested that the damage to the country was so great that it should tip the balance in the dispute.  I suggest that we have not had put before us the damage which this Bill would inflict on the country as against the gain, which is not disputed, to the workers in the towns.  Mr. MacLysaght is not generally asleep, but when he stated that the Minister did not use a single argument in favour of the Bill he entirely ignored what I think was the main point, and a perfectly sound one, made by the Minister, that the alteration of time does give to people in the towns an opportunity of more daylight, and does lead consequently to a pretty considerable gain in the health and comfort of the persons in the towns.  Mr. MacLysaght is prepared, instead of the Bill, to have an order &mdash; I suppose an <i>ex gratia</i> order &mdash; by which you order the railways and principal offices to start an hour earlier, and he thinks that if that were done the shops would also follow.  I would like to know from our friends in the country if that were done by order, instead of by a Bill, whether they would be quite satisfied. We could then have a Government Order which would provide for daylight-saving, but I suggest that they might adopt the suggestion of the Minister and keep the hours for once.  Personally I believe the objection would not be anything like so great as the confusion caused in regard to the observance of various times &mdash; God's time, English time, and Summer time. <Col N="941" /> Personally I believe that if the opposition remains for a year we shall have to have a referendum on this issue, but I am not so sure, when you get the votes of the townspeople, that you will not find, taking Ireland as a whole, that there is a majority in favour of Summer Time.  I think there is a majority.  In this matter I think the argument that, although we may be cut off for the moment from Ulster &mdash; a partition which most of us do not approve or recognise&mdash; is a strong argument that we should keep the same time as they.  I think the question of England does not arise now, and will not arise in the future, but the question of Ulster does, and I am glad to support the Bill.</P>

      <P>As a farmer, I should perhaps say that I am sorry to rise as a supporter of the Bill.  We have had plenty of experience of this Bill for five years, and on the whole I think that nobody has suffered disadvantage. The farming community in the country have had no compulsion placed on them and really a very small percentage of farmers were required to keep Summer Time.  In all my experience of the Free State I have not heard of any farmers, except in a few isolated cases, who were under the necessity of keeping Summer Time.  Sir John Keane said that he himself would prefer to keep Summer Time, yet he is going to vote against the Bill. Among the arguments which have been made against the Bill I could see none to convince me that the Bill should be rejected.  The only argument as to inconvenience is that in regard to the sending of children to school, but it has been stated in the Dáil that the Minister for Education could make an order rectifying that.  I believe that the Bill should pass and I will support it.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I must differ very strongly with the last Senator who spoke, because he seems to have a desire to leave the impression upon the Seanad that it was a voluntary act on the part of the farmer whether he kept old or new time.  It is possible that farmers have a free hand in his district, but I know many places where they are subject to the government of the Transport Union and we have to conform to their rules.  The <Col N="942" /> consequence is that in hay-making time or at the harvest we lose one and a-half hours of the best time of the day in saving our corn.  That is the real practical objection which I have to the Bill. I have no other.</P>

      <P>In regard to school children, it is not necessary that the Minister for Education should make a ruling, as it is in the hands of managers to arrange any school hours they please. Not much has been said on the workers' behalf.  Now I ask those farmers have they followed the new time, and, if so, have they suffered much inconvenience? In my experience in the West and Midlands no farmer has followed the new time, and no farmer has suffered the least inconvenience except in a district where milk has to be supplied to the towns.  It was known that in days when farmers had to send milk by road they had to milk their cows at 2 o'clock in the morning, at a time when, as has been stated in the Lower House, the animals were asleep.  That was in the old time. I believe the objections of the farmers are for the most part sentimental ones. I would ask Senator Linehan whether he has observed the new time, and I would ask Senator Butler to ascertain how many farmers have kept the new time? I think the Minister's offer is a very generous one.  He has stated that this has had a political tinge.  It undoubtedly had in that everything that came from England was tinged in that way, and was opposed by our people.  Let them take this as a measure coming from an Irish Assembly, and I venture to say that prejudice will not be responsible for any kind of inconvenience.  It was stated here this afternoon that it was a minority Bill.  I question that.  I believe that if to-morrow the issue were put before the country it would prove to be not a minority but a majority one.  The health of the workers seems to receive no consideration from many of our speakers. The health of a nation is most important and I think it should have primary consideration. At least it should be given more consideration and be valued much more above the small inconvenience that this Bill will cause to what I believe is but a small minority of the people of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>On listening to the debate so far, one would say that except the last Senator who has spoken, we are all engaged in the farming industry.  I have not heard a single individual represent the requirements of the business community and the industries of the country.  Of course, the great industry of our Free State is agriculture.  Honestly, if one could believe that a real serious injury was being done to the farming community by the Summer Time Bill, I, for one, would vote against it, but, as the last Senator stated, and I agree with him, there is not any solid ground for all the statements we have heard made about losses to the farmers.  I meet a good deal of them, we have dealings with a great many farmers growing cereal crops, and I have not heard any of them complain that they have had any difficulty in producing them under the Summer Time Act.  When you come to look at it from the business point of view, I think it is important that we should encourage industrial, manufacturing, and business people.  When you come to consider the difference of time then we can speak of real injury.  It was treated as a casual thing, a mere matter of 25 minutes, and it was said that it made no difference whether we were behind London or not.  If you take the Stock Exchange or Banking businesses, it makes a great difference.  It is a serious thing when the Stock Exchanges in London and elsewhere are open an hour before ours.  If you go and make the Free State an hour behind everybody in Great Britain, and an hour behind everybody in Northern Ireland, it will be a real disqualification that will seriously affect the business houses in this country. And it makes no matter to say that we do not have to get up in the morning, because no matter what time is adopted everyone has so many hours in bed.  It is a real serious business consideration. If we have a different time from the whole of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, we shall be disqualifying ourselves most seriously by our own act. When we talk of different times in countries like France or Canada or the United States enormous areas work all on one time.  If they were to work little bits here and there, and have all sorts of different times that would very seriously injure their business interests, and that is exactly what we are going to do if we have <Col N="944" /> a different time from Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Later we will have an hour earlier, and that is where we will all be met.  I do not think Senator McLysaght even could design an Act compelling people to open offices, railways, etc.  That can only be dealt with in a Bill of this kind.  It would be a serious handicap to be an hour behind our competitors, and I would ask our Senators seriously to consider whether they are really subject to such injury as they think, and to give a little time to consider what the business man would really suffer.</P>
      <P>There is no question as regards the health and everything of that kind of the denizens of the cities and of the workmen and employers alike.  It is a very great boon, indeed, to every one of us who is engaged in offices or business premises. It is, as the Minister has said, a very great boon to the health of the people.  It is also a very great gain to a good many people in the saving of light. It is not, as we have heard in so many speeches to-day, a small matter for the minority of the population.  I hold it is the very reverse.  It is a serious thing for the minority; it is not as serious a thing for the majority.  The minority at present in this country are looking after affairs which it is of vital importance to the Free State should succeed.  We should not do anything to hamper the men who are trying to establish industries and make this a great industrial country as well as an agricultural one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to take quite seriously the arguments advanced against the passing of this Bill. One must come to the conclusion that the objections are nine-tenths sentimental. We have been told by one Senator after another that considerable inconvenience and loss are occasioned to farmers and to the agricultural industry by the operation of Summer Time, but not one of them has told us in what way.  Certainly I cannot find, in any of the speeches made, any single clear and definite instance in which serious inconvenience has been caused.  Naturally the farmers are interested in fairs and markets, and in trade and the proper carrying on of trade, as much as any other section of the community. I would ask them to consider the position of the railways crossing the <Col N="945" /> border.  The Great Northern Railway crosses the border at about sixteen different points, and a number of other railways, such as the Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties, the Dundalk, Newry and Greenore, and the Lough Swilly also cross the border.  A large number of cattle bought in the West of Ireland at great fairs, such as Ballinasloe, travel north via Belfast to England.  Large numbers of them also travel to Dublin and cross the Channel.  At the present time we are only concerned with this particular year.  You can fancy the tremendous inconvenience that will be caused during the next few weeks if our time is an hour behind that of the Six Counties and of Great Britain.  Railway Companies have been proceeding on the assumption that this Bill is going to become law, and they have no time now to make the enormous alterations that will be necessary if any difference of time operates. Farmers would be affected by that state of affairs to as great an extent as any other section of the community. I know something about farmers, as my father was a small farmer, and I lived in the country the greater part of my life. I know that it is a great tradition with the farmer that what was good enough for his forefathers is good enough for him. Senator Colonel Moore put it straight to-day when he asked how did we get along in the past with the old time?  If we advance the clock an hour some farmers will tell you that the end of the world has come.  If they had their way some of them would be digging to-day with a stone implement instead of a plough. <Col N="946" /> It is a well-known fact that Summer Time has not been observed and does not regulate the hours of work in country districts.  We are told that we are threatened with diminution of agricultural produce, and we know that the years during which the greatest amount of produce was turned out were those since the Summer Time Act was passed. I think 1918 was an absolute record in the production of agricultural produce so that the contrary argument falls flat. Senator Colonel Moore talks about legislating in order to make lazy fellows get up.  His whole argument was really in favour of the few lazy fellows of farmers who will not get up.  It is suggested by Senator MacLysaght that an order might be issued so that trains would run earlier.  That is really the kernel of the position.  If the trains run an hour earlier, and if the Banks, Post Offices and public houses open an hour earlier and close an hour earlier all the inconvenience that has been conjured up as being caused to that terribly afflicted section of the agricultural community will take place.  I do not think the Seanad would be well advised to take their first very serious step on this particular question.  If they want a collision with the Dáil have it on some more important question.  I tender my wholehearted sympathy to the Government in having lost the support of some of the greatest stalwarts in the Seanad on this Bill.</P>
