      <P>Before we proceed with the business on the Agenda, there is a matter which affects the independence as well as the powers of the Seanad, but, prior to referring to that, there is one thing I would like to mention. Several Senators have suggested that the present method of seating is inconvenient, and that it would be much more convenient if the benches were arranged in parallel lines to the right and left, leaving the centre of the hall free, and having a cross-bench at the end.  So far as I can see, the feeling in favour of such a change is practically unanimous, but I would not like to give directions to have it carried out until I ascertain if there was any feeling against it.</P>

      <P>I think your suggestion is a very good one, and is likely to be more convenient when Senators are speaking. They will be able to hear one another better, and probably the seats will be more comfortable.  If we find the change does not suit we can alter it again.</P>

      <P>I thought it necessary in the interests of the Seanad and as the custodian to some extent, being its Chairman, of its privileges and powers, to call attention to the proceedings of the Dáil upon Friday last, when a motion was introduced by the President, as the Minister for Finance, asking the approval of the Dáil of the report of the Committee of the Seanad upon the staff and its remuneration, which was adopted subsequently by the Seanad itself.  It is necessary for me, in order to get rid of a great deal of misapprehension that seems to be in the minds of Deputies of the Dáil with regard to this matter, to give a full and detailed statement of the whole thing from the beginning, because unless I do that neither the public nor the members of Dáil will really understand what the true position was.  Almost at the outset of our proceedings a small committee was appointed, and asked to make recommendations as to the number of the staff we would require.  That Committee assembled, and I think on the second occasion when it met, the President attended and strongly urged upon them the appointment of two persons, two named persons, to the position of Clerk and Assistant Clerk, at salaries which he suggested should be fixed in the case of the Clerk at £1,100, and, in the case of the Assistant Clerk, at £950.  By a narrow majority that suggestion was adopted, and a recommendation passed upon it was made by the Committee in which they virtually nominated two individuals to those positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it came before the Seanad it was at once pointed out that the Committee had exceeded their powers, because they were not asked to nominate individuals. They were merely asked to report as to the nature and number of the staff, and accordingly it was decided by the Seanad <Col N="125" /> that the matter should be referred back to the Committee with wider powers, and that the Committee should be increased by adding to it the names of your Chairman and Vice-Chairman.  The Committee so constituted consisted of ten, and they accordingly met, and the first thing they did was to determine to issue advertisements so that everybody who thought himself qualified to fill either of those positions might have the opportunity of having his application submitted and tested.  After these advertisements appeared I received an intimation from the President that he would like to see me, and accordingly I interviewed him.  He then told me that the view of himself and his colleagues in the Government was that they, and they alone, had the exclusive patronage of the entire staff of this Seanad from the highest to the lowest, and that, acting under that belief he had already appointed one gentleman to the office of Clerk, and had induced him on the faith of that appointment to resign a very high position he occupied in the Free State Army.  I told the President quite frankly that I did not believe the Seanad for a moment would accede to such a position.</P>
    <P>I pointed out to him that so far as the powers and duties conferred upon the members of the Seanad by the Constitution were concerned they were absolutely independent&mdash;independent of the Government, independent of the Dáil&mdash;and that I was quite certain they would resent a suggestion that they were not to have the ordinary right that is possessed by every public board and body in the country, unless it is taken from them by legislation, of appointing their own staff.  However, I told him I would bring the matter before my colleagues on the Committee.  I brought it before the Committee, and they were unanimous in contesting such a claim on behalf of the Government, taking the view I had foreshadowed that if there was anything at all within their powers that they were competent and entitled to fulfil it was the nomination and control of their own staff.  It was obvious if the Government had the right&mdash;the exclusive right&mdash;to appoint a staff, the Government would also have the right&mdash;the exclusive right&mdash; to control and dismiss the staff, and consequently our staff would not have been responsible to us, but to those who had the power of removal and control.  Every <Col N="126" /> member of that Committee of ten&mdash;it was a representative Committee drawn from all interests represented in the Seanad&mdash;was unanimous in asserting their right, and their right alone, to make these appointments.</P>
    <P>I should say that at that interview with the President I ascertained for the first time that he had, in virtue of his belief that as head of the Government the patronage belonged to him, appointed already a gentleman to the position of our Clerk, and when we were discussing the matter at our Committee I pointed out to the Committee that the President would, of course, find himself naturally in a position of great difficulty if we were to rule out his nomination, having regard to the fact that on the strength of his nomination the gentleman in question had resigned his position in the Army.  I suggested to the Committee that they should send a small deputation to discuss the matter with the President and see if we could not arrive at some <i>modus vivendi.</i>  The Committee agreed to that suggestion, and they nominated myself, Mr. Andrew Jameson, Colonel Moore, and Sir John Griffiths as a deputation to wait upon the President for this purpose. We were received very courteously indeed by the President, and he had with him as his adviser the Law Adviser of the Government.  We discussed the matter very fully with him.  I pointed out there was no restriction in the Constitution of any sort or kind upon our powers over our own House, and that it was the elementary law of the land that any public body or board, unless prevented by statute, had the inherent right to appoint its own staff, or, in other words, be masters in their own House.  After considerable discussion he ultimately agreed that we should have that absolute right conceded, not merely as regards the appointments, but also as regards the control and dismissal of our staff.  Having explained to us the difficult position in which he was placed as regards the particular gentleman I have named, whom he had already nominated to the post, I was authorised by the Committee, and the deputation accordingly with that authority informed the President that, in view of the situation that had been created we would, if upon interviewing the gentleman in question we were satisfied with his credentials, <Col N="127" /> favourably consider his name for the post. Upon that arrangement we left, having obtained a distinct admission from the President of the inherent right of the Seanad to appoint, control and dismiss its own staff.  That being the position I was greatly surprised when I read in the public Press that the President had thought it necessary to submit our report, the report made by the Committee to the Seanad, to the Dáil, and to ask the Dáil for their adoption and approval of that report.</P>
    <P>That seemed to me not only to be a complete abandonment of the position he took up that the patronage lay with the Government, but also a departure from the agreement at which we had arrived, and by which the right of this Seanad to make appointments, etc., had been conceded. In the course of the very full debate that arose in the Dáil upon that motion, the matter was discussed from different views, but there were two Deputies who put the position to the Seanad so well in their speeches that I venture to quote the material portions of those speeches for the information of the Seanad.  I refer, first of all, to the speech of Deputy Johnson who said:&mdash;&ldquo;I question the wisdom of asking the Dáil to concur in the appointments proposed.  If we are to concur in the appointments proposed then we ought to have an opportunity given to us to see whether the persons proposed are fit and proper persons to fill those appointments.  We are being asked now to undertake responsibility for those appointments without any knowledge of the qualifications of the persons who have been appointed. We ought not to concur unless some evidence is given to us of the suitability of the persons that have been appointed. They may be the most perfect men for the office, but we do not know, and we are asked now simply to say &lsquo;ditto&rsquo; to something that the Seanad has done, and to relieve the Seanad from its own responsibility for fitting those persons into their particular posts.&rdquo;  I concur with every word of that, but the matter was put even more clearly from the constitutional point of view by Deputy Professor Magennis.  I shall quote his words:&mdash;&ldquo;It seems to me that it would be a very ungracious thing on the part of the Dáil to attempt to limit or restrict the discretion of the Seanad in the appointment of its <Col N="128" /> own officials.  I mean by &ldquo;appointment,&rdquo; the decision, the determination, of what officers they need for the transaction of their business.  One comes further on to the question of filling these offices.  No matter what I may think about the candidates put forward, or the selection exercised in its wisdom by the Seanad, as a member of the Dáil, by virtue of what is in the Constitution, is it competent for me to attempt to exercise a veto over what has been done? That is how the matter appears to me. I am not expressing an opinion, because I am not a member of the Seanad, on the relative merits of any of the candidates. Am I to express an opinion as a member of the Dáil on the wisdom or unwisdom, the policy or impolicy, of what the Seanad has done?  I am fairly conversant with the terms of the Constitution. I know of nothing in the Constitution that empowers this Dáil to exercise any control except in regard to expenditure. It is for us to say whether we think the public purse has been plundered or not in the salaries that are set out opposite these offices, but it seems to me, with all respect to our colleagues, that we are not at liberty to go beyond that.&rdquo;  And then he says: &ldquo;We have to consider merely are we willing to have the public purse drawn upon to that extent for the payment of these officials. What the personnel may be I hold, rightly or wrongly, is a matter for the determination of the Seanad itself.&rdquo;  I venture to say that is an exact, a proper and correct explanation of the constitutional position.  I do not think the Dáil realise that if they are entitled to have a deciding voice in a matter like this&mdash; in appointments made by us&mdash;then we equally, because there is nothing in the Constitution to the contrary, must have a controlling voice over the appointments made by them; and I venture to think there would be a considerable uproar if the Seanad attempted to exercise any such power as that.  The constitutional position is plainly&mdash;I do not think any lawyer will dispute it&mdash;that every public body or board such as this is, unless deprived of it by legislation, which in this case would be the Constitution, which contains nothing to deprive us of it, has an inherent right to appoint its own staff, and that is a position I am quite certain the Seanad is not prepared to surrender.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> There is one other matter I would like to refer to.  It was said that we had been hasty and extravagant in our arrangements as regards these appointments.  I will deal with the question of haste first. The Committee of ten appointed to deal with this matter took three weeks over it. We interviewed over twelve candidates, and, not being satisfied with the applications we received for the post of Assistant Clerk, we consulted the head of the Civil Service, and asked him to recommend to us the names of some specially qualified men in the Civil Service, because members of the Civil Service did not apply, being precluded by the regulations from applying without the consent of the head of their departments.  Mr. O'Hegarty very kindly sent us the names of five men, each of whom he could confidently recommend.  We invited these five to be interviewed, and all attended but one. We finally selected as our Assistant Clerk one of these gentlemen, who had a most distinguished record in the Civil Service. So much for the question of haste.  As I say, we spent three weeks over it, and during that time we had at least six meetings.  May I by way of comparison, though comparisons are said to be odious, refer to the action of the Dáil in regard to the appointment of a much higher and more important official, the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  That gentleman was appointed after one meeting of the Selection Committee, whereas our appointment was made at the end of three weeks, and after a series of meetings had been held.  Now I pass on to the question of extravagance.  When the President attended the first meeting of the Committee and put forward a suggestion as to the two gentlemen that he wished to see occupying the posts of Clerk and Assistant Clerk, he fixed, or asked the Committee to fix, the salary for the Clerk at £1,100, and £950 for the Assistant Clerk.  We cut down the suggested amounts to £1,000 and £700 respectively. I may mention that under the Dáil the Clerk has £1,200 and the Assistant Clerk £850.  I do not think, therefore, we erred very much on the side of extravagance.</P>
    <P>There is another matter.  We are attacked because we had appointed a third, or a second assistant, clerk.  The necessity for that arose in this way. Under the Constitution all our proceedings <Col N="130" /> and official documents have to appear not only in English, but also in Irish, and, accordingly, it was essential that one of our staff, at least, should be a competent and fluent Irish writer and speaker.  Major-General Dalton, unfortunately, could not comply with that condition, but the Assistant Clerk we had appointed, Mr. O'Sullivan, had the highest qualifications in that regard. Then we found ourselves confronted with this difficulty: should Mr. O'Sullivan be unavoidably absent through illness, vacation, or otherwise, we would have no official in the Seanad competent to transcribe the proceedings, and to comply with the terms of the Constitution. Accordingly, it became inevitable that we must appoint an assistant to him, and in that assistant we have secured another capable and competent Irish scholar who can always act in that capacity for Mr. O'Sullivan should the latter be absent at any time for unavoidable reasons.  This gentleman that we have so appointed will not only take Mr. O'Sullivan's place in his absence, but, while the Seanad is sitting, will be in the office for the purpose of answering inquiries and so forth, and, in addition, has undertaken the duties of private secretary to the Chairman.  His remuneration we fixed at £500, so that you will see the three officials we have only exceed by £150 the amount that the President thought was the proper figure for two officials. May I also mention that these three gentlemen have only been appointed for a year on probation.  I need scarcely say, speaking for myself, that should experience show that I can dispense with the private secretary, I shall be prepared quite willingly to do so, and should experience show that we can work with two officials, I am quite sure the Seanad will do it.  In addition to these three officials the Committee only recommended the appointment of one other, that is the legal adviser, at £1,000 a year, and some minor officials: two door-keepers, who will act as messengers, and a typist.  The total expenditure in respect of that entire staff, which we reported to be adequate, would be £3,600 a year.  I do not think that is a very extravagant figure for such a House as this.  At any rate, it compares very favourably, taking a modest assembly like this with an august assembly like the House of Lords, because I find that in <Col N="131" /> the salaries of officials alone, excluding door-keepers, attendants, messengers, tip-staffs, etc., the amount paid in the House of Lords is over £20,000 a year, and a considerably higher figure is paid in the House of Commons.  That is all I have got to say on that.  I must refer to one other matter that was made the subject of adverse criticism in the Dáil on Friday last.  It was said that we had been wanting in dignity and wanting in our duty in allowing certain Government measures to go through the Seanad without discussion or debate.  It was not quite accurate to say that, because there had been some small debate; but what is the truth of the matter?  When the first of these Bills was put through, being a purely formal matter, which in the Dáil had been neither debated nor discussed, I stated publicly, as the members of the Seanad will recollect, that this was not to be taken as a precedent, but the Bill being a pressing one and of a purely formal character, I said I was sure the Seanad would facilitate the Government in allowing it to go through.  Precisely the same thing happened as regards the other Bill, the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, and another in connection with the postponing of the Local Government elections, and a third one in reference to the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, all of which had practically gone through the Dáil without discussion or debate.  Yet we are attacked because in our desire to facilitate the Government we took the same course here. I do not think the Seanad has anything to regret in the course it took, and I think its proceedings were regular and proper. I wish from my heart, and I am sure so do all the members of the Seanad, that we should work in perfect amity and goodwill with the Dáil, and that, while we respect their privileges and powers, we should receive at their hands the same consideration.  I am quite certain that what was said by way of adverse criticism on Friday last in the Dáil was said under a misapprehension of the true facts of the case, but, inasmuch as the matter has gone before the public, I thought it my duty as your Chairman to make this statement to-day before you.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir T.H. GRATTAN ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think you need apologise to the Seanad for the statement you have just made, as in your capacity as our Chairman <Col N="132" /> you are the natural guardian and protector of our privileges and, what is more important, of our credit and of our good name.  It is a pity in a sense that this misunderstanding should have arisen. I suppose misunderstandings must happen.  Starting a new Constitution, with new machinery of constitutional administration as we are doing under circumstances of unparalleled stress and unparalleled difficulty, such as obtain in this country at present, it is difficult, perhaps, that misunderstandings should not arise.  However, I hope, and I certainly think, that our proceedings to-day will help to clear the air.  Now I would like to say this at the outset. I would very much regret if any reflection was cast upon the action of President Cosgrave in this matter.  I am certain as far as we are concerned that nothing of that sort could possibly be intended.  I do not think that anybody will question that the President acted in absolute good faith.  I am perfectly certain of that.  The President acted, as we would expect him to act, with perfect candour, loyalty, and good faith.  But it does appear that owing, perhaps, to his reading of the Constitution, or, perhaps, to the fact that he had not read the Constitution, or that some parts of the Constitution may have escaped him, he must have acted under a misapprehension. I think, also, it is plain that this Seanad at the outset of its dealings with this question did what it could to make matters easy for the President.  I think that will be admitted.  As to the interpretation of the Constitution that is now perfectly plain.  It was intended, and I cannot conceive that anything else could have been intended, that both of these Houses should be absolutely independent. Although they have not the same powers they are absolutely independent and, within their own spheres, they are equal one to the other.  We stand upon the same plane in the Constitution. Our powers are different.  The powers of this Seanad are considerably less.  At the same time from the Constitutional point of view the two Houses stand on the same plane.  That being so it is absolutely essential that the absolute independence of the Seanad should be preserved, maintained, and, if necessary, asserted under every conceivable condition. If the Dáil is to have a voice in our appointments obviously, as you very <Col N="133" /> well pointed out, we are entitled to a voice in their appointments.  I quite agree with Deputy Johnson, and with Deputy Magennis that that is a position in relation to the other House which neither House could possibly ever dream of occupying.  As far as we must maintain our independence, we must maintain our autonomy, and every one of our officials from the highest to the lowest, whether he is our Head Clerk or Serjeant-at-Arms, or whatever you like to call him, or our typist or official stenographer, all these officials must be under our control, and we must have the right of appointing them and of dismissing them, if we find they do not give satisfaction.  That is all I wish to say on that point.  I would like to say this further in regard to the charge of haste in proceeding with business in this Seanad and the neglect of our right to criticise public Bills, that we proceeded, as we proceeded, advisedly, and we stated so publicly, as you have very well reminded us.  It was represented to us that certain Bills were necessary to be passed.  They were urgent, and for that reason, as we stated, we passed them practically that night, but it does not follow that we shall continue to follow that policy.  Quite possibly when we turn over and adopt another policy there may be other things said about us quite as uncomplimentary as have already been said.  As far as uncomplimentary remarks are concerned they do not matter.  If anybody imagines that this Seanad is going to refrain from exercising any of its rights in what it conceives to be the public interest they are very much mistaken.</P>

      <P>I do not want to repeat any of the statements that have been made by the Chairman, except merely to say that I was a member of the larger Committee which went into the question and a member of the smaller Committee, and that I can bear out all that you have said and the statement you made.  With regard to the criticisms that have been made by the Dáil I think it is unfortunate that these two Houses should begin criticising each other.  I think it is very unfortunate at the beginning.  I was present at the Dáil meeting, and was rather pained that such a thing should occur, and at hearing the criticisms and the contrasts that were made between the two Assemblies. <Col N="134" /> I may say that if there is any failing in this Seanad, which I do not think there is yet, it has been appointed entirely by the Dáil; and if there is any failing in the Senators here it is the fault of the Dáil for having appointed them.  They selected them and appointed them.  Therefore it is their fault.  So far, I think, our work has been done here with less friction, perhaps, than in the Dáil.  We know the state which the country has arrived at at present.  We were not in a position to effect the matter in those days, and if, perhaps, we had been it might not be in the state it is in now.  Anyway it is not this Seanad that brought the country into the state in which it is at present.  Therefore, I think, the House which brought it into that state should be a little careful before they begin to throw their criticisms at us. With regard to the expense, you have yourself compared it with the House of Lords.  But compare our expenses here with those of the Dáil.  We have appointed three people here as you mention. If one goes into the Dáil and counts the officials he will see that they have civil servants by the dozen attending them, and lawyers and various other advisers that we have not got.  I think that all those criticisms were very ungracious.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I had better mention, as I do not want to put our position at all higher than it is by the Constitution, that, of course, there is one power of control that the Dáil must necessarily exercise so long as it is the custodian of the public purse, and that is, if it thinks the salaries are extravagant, to reject them.  But the constitutional way of doing that is not to pass resolutions approving or disapproving of what we do here, but when the Vote comes up upon the Estimates then to discuss it and to challenge it and upset it if they wish.  That is the constitutional right and legitimate remedy of the Dáil in such cases.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I shall be in order in asking a question which arises on the remarks you made as to the qualifications of the gentleman who was appointed as Assistant Clerk.  You said nothing whatever about the qualifications <Col N="135" /> of the gentleman who was appointed Clerk, and in view of the criticism which was especially directed against that gentleman in the Dáil and of remarks which I read in the paper&mdash;I know nothing whatever about the gentleman himself, and I do not wish to make the slightest reflection on the Committee &mdash;I do feel that if you were in a position to give this Seanad some information as to the special qualifications which General Dalton holds for the important position which you recommended him for, I think it would clear the air of a good deal of the misunderstanding.</P>

      <P>I have no hesitation at all in answering the question that has been put.  In doing so I shall be absolutely frank with the Seanad, as I hope I always shall be.  I am not myself satisfied, quite satisfied, that the particular selection would have been made had the conditions been equal&mdash; not that we have any fault to find with the official in question&mdash;but it would not be fair for me to say that his qualifications were of that outstanding character that would have made his selection an absolute certainty, were it not for the position of difficulty that we found ourselves confronted with by reason of the fact that the President had already appointed him.  At the same time it is only fair to say this, that subsequent to the interview that the deputation had with the President we interviewed Major-General Dalton amongst the other persons we interviewed.  We questioned him particularly as to his antecedents and record, and we found that both as an officer in the British Army and as an officer in the Free State Army he had filled many appointments that called for tact, courage, and responsibility, and, therefore, we felt that we were, perhaps, safe in making the experiment of his appointment, limiting it, as I have said, to one year on probation.</P>

      <P>I would just like to congratulate the Seanad on your efforts to maintain its independence. During the discussion on the last day I referred to this matter, and it was with the object of trying to get more information in connection with these appointments, because I had the impression at that time that there was <Col N="136" /> some work behind the scenes that the Senators were not conversant with.  At that time you made a statement which enabled us to vote.  In any case you told us you found that the qualifications of those gentlemen were good enough for the appointments that were made.  At the same time one could gather from your statement to-day that you had some difficulty in maintaining the independence of this Seanad and that you succeeded very well.  I think it would be just as well that we should not refer any further to those appointments, and should drop the matter.  If there has been any difficulty it has been very well got over by the fact that you were able to maintain the independence of this Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The first regular business on the Agenda is the Report of the Committee on Standing Orders.  I may mention that the copy that was sent out some days ago to the members was prepared in a hurry, and was sent out before it was revised.  As a consequence, it is filled with clerical and other mistakes.  Since then it has been carefully revised, and an amended copy has been circulated through the Seanad. The Standing Orders number 72, and though the Committee spent a considerable amount of time and labour in their preparation, they are quite conscious that experience will show that they require alteration and perhaps amendment. What I would suggest to the Seanad, if it meets with their approval, is this: if they look at the last of these Standing Orders, they will see it provides for the appointment of a Committee on Standing Orders, that is to say, a permanent Committee whose duty it will be from time to time to recommend changes in these Standing Orders.  Now, what I would suggest to the Seanad, as the most convenient thing, would be this: to accept these Standing Orders as the Standing Orders for the next two months.  In the meantime, I would like members to study them carefully, and if they think they require amendment or addition, to give notice of these amendments or additions, and then to refer these amendments and additions to the Standing Committee for their report <Col N="137" /> and then to have a full discussion upon them.  I think if you do not adopt some course like that you will find it very difficult, and it will occupy a good deal of your time going through them one by one.  If you are satisfied to accept them on trial, so to speak, for two months, then, in the interval, you could put down any amendments or suggested alterations or additions and let those go before the Standing Committee, who will report on them to you.  Then you can deal with them as you think fit. That is a matter entirely for the Seanad If they would like to discuss them now, of course we will do so.</P>

Most of them are plain and simple, and they are extremely good Standing Orders, and we could always change them. under the conditions that you suggest, and with which I thoroughly agree.  I would suggest that you begin with Order No. 1. Put No. 1, and let it be agreed, if there is agreement on it, and then put Order No. 2.

Senators have not had until to-day a really accurate copy of these Standing Orders, and it is hardly fair to put them through to-day, because Senators have not had the facility for considering them as they should have.  If you adopt them tentatively as Standing Orders for, say, two months, or even for a month, then if you like you can consider them in the meantime and give notice of the amendments you wish made in these Standing Orders. The Committee on Standing Orders can take them up and consider these amendments and report on them.</P>

In the proposal from the Committee it is suggested that a new Stand ing Orders Committee, that is the Committee on Standing Orders, shall be appointed, and proceed to deal with the matter and report to the Seanad as soon as possible.

      <P>I cannot agree that that is the best course.  I am inclined to think that we are too prone in these proceedings to shirk anything that means work.  Now, the majority of the Senators have these proposals in their hands for the last 3 or 4 days.  In the normal course they will never get much more time than that to consider them.  I think there is nothing to prevent us going through them and passing as much of them as we consider proper, and making any Amendments we consider proper. That will not prevent a Committee being set up to consider any other Amendment that might be brought in.  Now, what is the haste in regard to the dispatch of business that would make it necessary that we should adjourn these Standing Orders?  We have not got a lot of business on the Orders of the Day that should keep us so very long.  Why bring people from the farthest part of the country for a couple of hours' session and send them back again without doing the work here that can be done?  We have work to do. We have been accused of being a bit slipshod in our methods.  I do not agree with that, but I do not intend that we should lay ourselves open to any such accusation.  In view of that fact that there is ample time to deal with the business I would strongly oppose the adjournment of the consideration of the Standing Orders for two months. and would earnestly urge the Seanad to come to grips with the business now, and proceed with the matters on the Order paper.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator O'Farrell, who suggests a little work. Possibly some of the Senators have given this matter of the Standing Orders a lot of consideration.  I had some suggestions, which possibly might meet with the approval of the Seanad.  At present there is no provision for getting the Agenda down into the country.  As it stands now, there is no arrangement by the Standing Orders to permit of our getting any Agenda in the country.  I think it is well that the country Senators should get a copy of the Agenda, and have notice of it in time.  There is no provision in the Standing Orders for that, and there are some little things of that kind which might arise from time to time, and which would facilitate a further action of the Committee.  For that reason I support the suggestion of Senator O'Farrell, who said we should proceed to work.</P>

I had not time to read one line of it.  It is very unfair to rush the matter through now. The Senators should have at least an evening or night to give them an opportunity of reading through it carefully, and, with all due respect, I would ask you to take the vote of the Seanad.</P>

There is tremendous force behind the argument that there are Senators here from different parts of the country who have come here to-day for the purpose of doing business, and the fact that we do discuss it to-day will not preclude any Senators during the two months from putting up any amendments that they think fit.  In view of the possible criticism we might lay ourselves open to by an adjournment of the consideration of the Standing Orders, perhaps the Senators will agree that, on the whole, it is more prudent for us to take the Orders now without any division.</P>

If the notice complied with the Standing Orders I do not think that the Chairman would be entitled to strike it out or compel the Senator to withdraw it.  Personally I will not subscribe to that.  I believe that every Senator has sufficient sense of honour not to put down in a Notice of Motion anything that will impute wrong against any other Senator, or any member of the Dáil.

There will be questions discussed on which there will be violent differences of opinion, and I, for one, do not wish to have members put in the position that, if they want to put down a motion on the Agenda, it will be subject to the Chairman's veto.</P>

      <P>Would it meet Senator Farren's views if the Clerk were put in with the Chairman?  The discussion calls back to my mind that, in my unregenerate days, I was constantly tripped up by a Standing Order of a somewhat similar nature in another Assembly.  I was not allowed to put in anything of a personal nature in a notice of motion, and I sympathise with the view expressed by Senator Yeats, because I often felt extremely angry when not allowed to draft a question in a particular way, and when told by the Clerk at the Table of the House of Commons that my motion was out of order.  I used to consider it a grievance, and in the nature of an insult, to be called to attention by the Clerk.  I did not mind the Speaker.  I looked on him as a respectable and fatherly man.</P>

      <P>I think the power of the Chairman is restricted in the right of revision and amending of notices of motion, and this is clearly defined under three headings.  If a notice of motion is not in compliance with the Standing Orders, clearly then he cannot accept it. A notice of motion must not contain any argument.  The third heading was that it should contain no personal imputation. I think those three are clear.  If he said any of those should be deleted in the interest of order and procedure and harmonious debate in this Seanad then there might be some grounds for his objection.</P>

      <P>I have given notice of an addition to Order No. 36.  That Order reads: &ldquo;Committees shall, as far as possible, be representative of all parties of opinion in the Seanad.&rdquo;  In order to carry out this, it will be necessary to know what are the parties in the Seanad. In order to ascertain that, I suggest the addition of covering words: &ldquo;Provided that for the purpose of this Order no <Col N="155" /> Senator shall be deemed to be a member of any party unless he shall have furnished in writing to the Clerk of the Seanad the name of the party to which he belongs.&rdquo;  If it is necessary to have this rule in existence, it is necessary to know who the parties are.  If you do not know that, you have not the matter clear.</P>

      <P>I think this is really one of the most difficult Orders we have come to, because when you come to describe us here in the Seanad as belonging to parties you raise a serious question.  I thought in the Seanad that you got away from parties, and that we were not going to have cliques, and that you would leave it to the good sense of the Seanad in that way to nominate a Committee.  We have our own individual opinion about things.  I do not believe there is any member of the Seanad at present sitting here who is belonging to a party, or in any way shaping his actions or votes in the interest of any party.  But in the Standing Orders to admit a precedent that in the Seanad we are going to split into parties and the Senators are asked to state that they belong to such and such a party would be a great mistake.  I think that is a great mistake, and if it is at all possible we should try to avoid any such statements about the Seanad.</P>

It is hoped that each of these Committees will consist of all people interested in that particular branch of the subject.  Senator Yeats has mentioned Art, for instance.  The very purpose of these Committees would be completely upset by saying that on the subject of Art we must have medical men and lawyers, and Radicals and Tories and Sinn Feiners, and all other classes of people, and in matters of Engineering and other classes we would have the representatives of Art, and so on with Agriculture.

      <P>The next business to be considered is the Indemnity Bill, which comes to us from the Dáil. The Standing Orders indicate that the reception of the Bill in the Seanad is to be taken as leave to introduce it.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">

      <P>There is a motion standing in my name, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the consideration of this Bill be adjourned till every Irish prisoner under control of the British Government for a political offence connected with Ireland, in whatever country the offence may have been committed, has been released.  The status, political or otherwise, of each prisoner to be decided by a certificate of the Irish Government.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say that I have been asked to alter the terms somewhat so as to make it a little smoother and more gracious. The alteration could only be made with the consent of the Seanad.  Should that consent be given the motion would read: &ldquo;That the consideration of this Bill be <Col N="159" /> adjourned to give the British Government the opportunity by a similar gracious act to release every Irish prisoner under its control for a political offence connected with Ireland in whatever country the offence may have been committed.  The status, political or otherwise, of each prisoner to be decided by a certificate of the Irish Government.&rdquo;  Practically the only change made there is the addition of the words &ldquo;to give the British Government the opportunity by a similar gracious act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Alteration agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion as altered.  I regret to be obliged to move it, because no one is more anxious than I to wipe out the effect of past injuries and quarrels.  No one is more anxious than I that there should be amity between England and Ireland.  I see no reason why there should be bickerings of any sort, and why there should not be the most friendly sentiment prevailing on both sides.  I would sacrifice a great deal rather than raise irritating questions, but there are some Irish questions which Irish people cannot in honour or conscience surrender. Those who stood beside us in the war that we fought cannot be abandoned and allowed to suffer to remain in prison while we benefit by the sacrifices they have made.  We are not demanding here any gracious act from one side more than the other.  We are merely asking for equality of treatment.  We have no English prisoners in our jails; we do not want to have them.  I believe there were two or three there at the time of the Truce, and they were released at once.  It happened for one reason or another that some prisoners remain in English prisons, and until these are released it will be a constant source of irritation and annoyance in this country.  The irritation is very considerable at present, and it is in order to smooth this over that I introduce this motion.  I do not know what the state of affairs is with regard to the English Amnesty Bill.  I understand that such a Bill is to be proposed, or perhaps it has been proposed; I am nearly sure it has not been passed.  I feel confident unless this matter is settled there will be continued irritation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have passed through a long period in Ireland in which this question has been <Col N="160" /> raised again and again.  The first political event in my life, the first thing that caused me to think seriously of Irish politics was the amnesty proposed for the Fenian prisoners a great many years ago, perhaps longer than most people in the Seanad remember.  I was stirred very much by reading of it, and it decided for me the lines I would take.  It had a more important effect in stirring Parnell into the action he took.  Parnell stated afterwards that the first thought he gave to Irish political questions of any sort&mdash;he was brought up in Unionist surroundings&mdash;was the question of the amnesty for the Fenians.  It was that that started him on his career, and changed the whole course of the events in Ireland.  I remember the conditions of Ireland very well in those days, and previous to that time Ireland was body and soul under the control of the landlords.  Before the amnesty question was settled their power was completely swept away to a great extent on account of the sufferings of the prisoners.  In one year four Fenian prisoners died and four others went mad.  Those things affected the people of Ireland very much.  The next thing I remember was I was sitting in the House of Commons one day when Davitt was arrested.  A group of Irish Members lead by Parnell came into the House in great heat and anger and raised the question of the arrest of Davitt.  There again that had very important effects.  Before that was finished the Irish land question was wiped out to a great extent.  It is not finished yet, but perhaps that was the first real step in the settlement of the land question. I remember in 1918 I took some part in the General Election held in this country in that year.  At that time practically all the members of the present Government were in prison.  What attitude did we adopt at that time?  We who took part in the election did not stand up and try to get places for ourselves or get elected; we stood aside, and we advised the people of Ireland to elect no one who was not in prison at the time.  That was the best step we could take, and with that cry we swept the whole country.</P>
    <P>I mention these matters in order to show the Seanad that I have a good deal of experience of Ireland&mdash;longer, perhaps, than many of the members of this <Col N="161" /> Seanad.  I do not want to connect this question with politics, but I have seen that this question has been a source of irritation, and will continue to be a source of irritation until it is done away with. What we want is amity between the two countries, and the sooner this question, which is causing so much irritation, is wiped away the better.  After the Truce, or perhaps after the Treaty, nearly all the political prisoners in England were released, whether convicted or unconvicted. A few were kept in custody.  A certain number of men of my own regiment, the Connaught Rangers, are still detained, although the Government again and again asked for their release. One excuse after another was given for not releasing them, but I know that their continued detention has been a source of constant trouble between the two countries. A few weeks before Christmas Senator Sir Bryan Mahon and a few other old officers of the Connaught Rangers, including General Arthur Lewin, Stephen Gwynne, Colonel Wood, and Capt.  Bryan Cooper, joined in sending a memorandum to the War Office on the subject, the result of which was that soldiers of that regiment who had been in custody were released almost immediately after Christmas. It is not easy to get an exact account of the prisoners at present in custody, but, as far as I can find out, all the old soldiers of my own regiment who had been in custody have been released. There is, however, a man named Joseph Dowling, who was arrested in 1918, who is still in custody.  He landed on the West coast of Ireland in a boat, and was arrested soon afterwards and tried for high treason.</P>
    <P>According to a statement made in the English House of Commons, he was supposed to be concerned in a German plot. What the plot was no one had any particular means of finding out.  Most people thought the plot was a bogus one, and they were backed up in that supposition because the Lord Lieutenant at the time, and the General Commanding the Forces in Ireland, now a member of the Seanad, never heard of this German plot.  It is not a question now whether there was a plot or not.  The important question is, that if the Irish people give an amnesty to English people, then the same principle should be applied on exactly the same terms by the English people <Col N="162" /> towards the Irish.  That is the most remarkable case I have to deal with, but there are a few others.  They stand, however, on a rather different footing. I want to be perfectly frank about these cases.  There are three male prisoners in Derry who made an attempt to escape just before the Treaty was signed.  They chloroformed a warder who, I regret to say, died.  It was more or less an accident; they were trying to escape, and they are still in custody.  There are three other men in custody in Scotland.  They were concerned in an attack on a mail car.  That was, also, I believe a political offence.  They claimed they had orders from the Irish Republican Army.  They were members of that Army, and made an attack in England in combination with a number of their fellow countrymen. I am going into these matters so that people should know the exact position. I believe that the number of men in custody ranges from 6 to 10.  There are two more men in custody&mdash;Sean McCurtain, arrested in Belfast, and Sean Flood.  I do not know exactly where he was arrested.  In my opinion, none of these men should have been kept in prison.  The Connaught Rangers have since been released, but these men I refer to are still in custody, though it is my belief all of them ought to have been released at the time of the Treaty. Dowling was an Irish soldier, and the Connaught Rangers were Irish soldiers. The point I want to make is this: that these soldiers and myself&mdash;I served in the Army for 32 years&mdash;were soldiers of the United Kingdom of England and Ireland, and owed our allegiance to these countries, and not to either Ireland or England, but to the United Kingdom. When the two countries were separated, as they were by the Treaty, each country became co-equal, as stated in our Constitution. Hence, when the Treaty was signed, each country had the right to take back its own soldiers and prisoners, to free them or to keep them as it wished, whatever the crime.  If it was mutiny or treason that these soldiers had committed, it was mutiny against the United Kingdom.  I am not for a moment trying to minimise that point.  There is no question as to whether they ought, or ought not, to have been convicted. Every soldier knows what happens when a mutiny takes place, but if the Treaty had not intervened there would be no <Col N="163" /> question of releasing these prisoners.  My case is that we must have back our soldiers.  It is an old sort of superstition or tradition, that England is the country, and that Ireland is a sort of subordinate. That is not the case, and never was the case.  Therefore, as co-equal parts, each one has the right to claim back what it is entitled to.  Ireland is entitled to its own portion of the assets of the United Kingdom&mdash;all the arms, ships, moneys, etc.  It is entitled to claim these as its share, because the two countries are equal.  This is a constitutional question, and I just mention these things because it is very necessary and important to bear them in mind, and so that we may rid the people of Ireland of the idea the theirs is a subordinate country, and only entitled to get a certain thing and cliam nothing else.  I admit that the cases of the men in Derry and Scotland are somewhat different to the others I have mentioned. The case in Derry occurred before the Treaty, and the one in Scotland after the Treaty.  These come under a different heading to the others.  At the same time, I would ask the English Government to make a clean sweep in releasing all prisoners, and not to go into technicalities as to whether the alleged offences were commited one day before or one day after.  What I ask is, that they should release all prisoners, and let us have done with all the troubles and difficulties between the two countries. It is not a question of the gravity of the crime; whether Dowling committed a particular act of high treason, or whether someone else committed an act of murder.  We cannot go into that. I think if we were to go into these matters, the balance might be on the other side.  What about the burning of Cork and other places?  or the cases of Lord Mayor McCurtain of Cork, and the Mayor of Limerick?  I want to put aside all questions of the gravity of the offences alleged against the men in custody, and to have the whole thing wiped out.  Whatever quarrels we may have amongst ourselves, and they are pretty bad at present, there is no need that we should add to them, and I think if the Seanad would adopt the motion I propose and adjourn the consideration of the Amnesty Bill until the English Government agree to carry out the gracious <Col N="164" /> act I suggest, I think we would be in a very much better state than we are.  The Governement has written a great number of times with a view to getting these prisoners released, but it has not succeeded so far.  I feel certain the passing of my resolution would help the Government very much.  I am now asking for equal treatment between the two countries. Each country should shake hands and have done with all this.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the resolution.  I do not think there will be any disagreement as to it.  We are pleading for the release of men to whom we owe our position here to-day owing to the fight they made and the stand they took.  But for them and others like them we would not be here to-day and Ireland would not have secured the measure of freedom which she has got.  I think we would be wanting in our loyalty and duty to our comrades who very positive and firm stand and make a very emphatic and insistent demand in this matter.  I think the resolution has been very properly brought forward.  It may be said we have not very much to give, that we have no English prisoners to yield up, but I am sure if we had we <Col N="165" /> would have yielded them with a very good grace, and that cannot be put forward as an argument against freeing these men whose names have been mentioned here.  I think if an account were drawn up between Ireland and England through all the centuries, of right and wrong, it would be known exactly on what side the scales would come down, on what side the debit balance would rest.  I strongly support this resolution.</P>

      <P>I find myself in substantial agrrement with Colonel Moore. I feel personally that the action of the British Government, in what one might call haggling over the matter, is extremely ill-advised and one which we should rightly protest against.  When they swallowed the camel and signed a Treaty recognising us as an independent Nation inside the Commonwealth, with co-equal status to themselves, they have very little case, as far as I can see, for quarrelling over the claims of a few Irishmen who are in British jails and whom our Government here claim the right to have the charge of and to release. Where I find a certain amount of difficulty is as to holding up a Bill in which we here, in Saorstát Eireann, are doing the right thing and are showing that we any way will keep absolutely to the spirit of the agreement.  Whether holding that up until a similar action is done by the British Government, over whom we have no control and which has absolutely no control over us, is a dignified thing for an independent nation to do is where I find a certain amount of difficulty.  If it was put to a division I should vote for it, but personally I should rather have preferred to see this Seanad passing a resolution to the effect <Col N="166" /> that all prisoners should prompltly released, in view of the fact that this was passed, and asking the government to make diplomatic representations to the effect that that was their view and the view of this Seanad.  That, I think, on the whole would be more dignified</P>

I think, if that were done now, it would have a good effect in the country, and it would probably have a good effect in England, and very likely would acheive what we want.  If we simply hold this up as a kind of threat, I am afraid the English Government, which has now control over these people, whom we expect to be loyal subjects of Saorstát Eireann in future, will not be greatly impressed.  I think the Seanad should whole-heartedly protest against an attempt to hold up a few men who may or may not have done actions which were justified from our point of view, but at the same time I think a petty action of this kind helps to lead to some of the troubles that we are at present dealing with.</P>

      <P>I feel in a difficulty with regard to this Bill which, I suggest, is bound to recure.  This question brought up by Colonel Moore is a question of government policy, and if the Government send up this Bill, and if they consider, as no doubt they do, this is a condition and guarantee, what Colonel Moore suggests raises the further question as to where we are going to get information on these questions of Government policy. A government Bill like this should, I submit, be introduced or explained by some member of the Government, and until we have that information we are very much in the dark as to what action we should take.  Might I ask if you could tell us if that difficulty has been put before the Government, and whether there is any body which is considering how and in what manner the policy of the Government shall be brought before <Col N="167" /> this Seanad, more especially when government Bills are passing through the Seanad?</P>

      <P>We have made representations on that subject already, and this Bill is a very good illustration of the difficulty that the Seanad is faced with.  Also, I am bound to say, that the Government are placed in the same difficulty, because we do not, know whether the acceptance of this amendment by Colonel Moore may possibly defeat the very object the Government have in view in promoting the Bill at all. That I cannot say; nor can I say&mdash;I have not been reading the official records of the proceedings of the Dáil&mdash;whether this very question that has now been suggested here may not have been fully debated and discussed in the Dáil.  I do not know.  I certainly do recall that the case of this.  Connaught Ranger was raised and discussed in the Dáil, but I am not in a position, being in no way connected with the Government or responsible for its policy directly or indirectly, to say how it was the Dáil determined to proceed with this Bill.  I cannot assist the Senators on that point.</P>

      <P>I think we must simply act on the information we have, and try and come to a decision that seems to us right on the arguments before us.  If we do cause inconvenience to the Dáil, the Dáil will possibly find some means of putting the facts as they see them before us.  We can only act on the facts as they are before us now. I would suggest that we are not making anything in the nature of a threat.  We are simply suggesting to England that this amnesty should be made in the most gracious form possible, and that it could only be made in the most gracious form by being made by both countries.  I presume that both England and we have the same object to allay the bitter feeling between these countries, and we have drawn the attention of the English Parliament to an unfortunate oversight on their part.  They have omitted to set free certain prisoners whom they have, perhaps, forgotten.  We think that this amnesty upon our part will sound better in the ears of our won countrymen if England passes a similar amnesty.  I think that is a very fair conclusion to come to.  I think it is also very important <Col N="168" /> to this Seanad, because of the very nature of its constitution, that we should show ourselves as interested as the Dáil is in every person in this country.  We do not represent constituencies; we are drawn together to represent certain forms of special knowledge, certain special interests, but we are just as much passionately concerned in these great questions as the Dáil.  I would suggest, therefore, that we pass this resolution now.</P>

      <P>I thoroughly agree with the remarks which have fallen from our Deputy Chairman.  I think he has voiced the feelings of many of us admirably, and I respectfully submit to this Seanad that it would be <i>infra dig</i> for us to hold up a Government measure of the kind that is presented to us this evening.  If I know Englishmen right, if I have diagnosed the English character, I think this would prejudice them against these unfortunate men that are still kept in prison.  I am sure we are all desirous that everyone of them should be released, and I think the right way to go about it is to adopt the suggestion that has fallen from Senator Douglas.  I take it that he suggests that the Bill should be allowed to pass and that we enter a protest against their detention in prison and venture to suggest that they should see their way to release the men.  I sincerely hope that Colonel Moore will see his way to withdraw the resolution in these circumstances. I am sure it would tend immensely to the good feeling already, I am glad to say, growing between the two countries.</P>

      <P>I beg to associate myself with the motion of Col. Moore. I feel that it is neither a threat towards England nor a lack of dignity on our part, to demand as far as we can, and to try as far as we may, to secure that these men who are held in custody in England shall be released.  For my part if I could threaten, but I do not think we can make a threat nor do I think we can lose dignity.  These men are an essential part of the fight that was made in Ireland for the securing of freedom. Freedom to my mind has been secured and surely these men, for whatever cause they were interned, conscientiously <Col N="169" /> believed, I am sure, that the acts they were performing were for the good of Ireland.  We are trying to represent that, and that being so, where does the threat or where does the loss of dignity come in?  I have pleasure in associating myself with Col. Moore in this matter.</P>

      <P>I view this question from a business point of view.  We were given to understand that the Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland involved the release in due course of the political prisoners on both sides.  According to the statements of the mover of the resolution there are yet in English prisons one or more political prisoners coming within the meaning of the term &ldquo;political prisoners&rdquo; as dealt with in the Treaty.  Consequently I find it very hard to convince myself as to what the reasons can be for the detention of these prisoners.  Does the Government say that these prisoners do not come within the meaning of the term?  I am not aware that they have said any such thing.  On the contrary the report of the proceedings in the Dáil shows that the Government admitted that, as far as the man Dowling is concerned he is a genuine political prisoner.  They seem to indicate that they have made some efforts to get him released without success.  Now that is a matter I think requires explanation from the other side of the water.  If we are going to pass a Bill of this kind I think we should see that there is some reasonable expectation of the other side honouring their part of the agreement in its entirety. I am not concerned with the question of <i>infra dig.</i>  We should first of all consider our duty to the country, and in that respect we would be justified in supporting the motion placed before us by Colonel Moore.  If the Government have any strong reasons to advance as to why this Bill is to be passed they have an opportunity under the Constitution of sending a Minister here to give us the Government's <Col N="170" /> opinion.  Until we get that opinion we have no alternative but to act to the best of our judgment on the information placed before us, and for that reason I am going to vote for Colonel Moore's motion.</P>

If we had information that it would be detrimental to those prisoners to hold up the Bill I would be reluctant to do it, but as the matter stands it is evident that we would strengthen the hands of the Government in their demands for the release of the prisoners by doing this.  My interest in the prisoners is a special one indeed, as I was fortunate enough to be nine months a prisoner in England.</P>

      <P>My memory goes a little further back, having taken part in the movement.  It goes back to the time of the Amnesty initiated by the great lawyer and man of noble mind, Isaac Butt.  That amnesty may have produced that sensation upon Colonel Moore and those of a like position.  Upon the people of Ireland it produced a very different effect, because, instead of being a full, complete, and generous amnesty, it left a number of men, many of the foremost, still in prison, and therefore caused a sensation of a great disappointment and indignation, and was, instead of being welcomed, denounced as a huckster's amnesty.  That is the consequence of not doing a thing well when it is to be done.  With regard to the question of the quality of the offence committed by the men, that depends so much upon the point of view, the angle, from which it is regarded.  Blackstone, in his Commentaries, distinguishes offences&mdash;that which is <i>malum se</i> and that which is <i>malum prohibitum</i>&mdash;an evil which is an evil in itself differs from the offence which is prohibitive for the same reason by some state or other by law.  But the latter is not in principle necessarily a crime.  For those who so offend one year, may become legislators later on.  We have seen that take place in Ireland upon more than one occasion.  Into that it is scarcely necessary to enter.  But some offences have been grave.  Let me call to your memory the gravity of the Orsini bombs in England which were prepared in England, and which were conveyed to France and flung into the streets of Paris <Col N="171" /> at opera for the purpose of slaughtering the Emperor Napoleon, and perhaps the Empress Eugenie, and perhaps many other non-political citizens.  That question was raised, and the offenders were sought for by France.  But those who recollect history will remember the towering indignation of the Earl of Derby at the idea of surrendering any such prisoners to a foreign power.  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not for the sake of all the Royal tyrants of Europe.&rdquo;  These men were guilty to ordinary consciousness of a terrible crime; and yet they were regarded as political prisoners by one of the greatest statesmen, the Rupert of debate, which England then produced, or has since produced.  So, likewise, Mr. Gladstone, with regard to the prisoners at Naples, spoke long and wrote fervently with regard to their position, and they also had been accused of as villainous crimes as any that had been alleged in later times. I do not wish to delay the Seanad further, but to recall that men who are one year prisoners and denounced as criminals and non-politicals, may in another year or two become political leaders, perhaps lawgivers in legislatures for the country.  It has happened many times in various countries, and not less in England.  Then we have seen the consequence when amnesty is given, and when people's minds are made up to forgive and forget everything, how the dart leaves its poisoned barb in the wound, and the indignation which comes in place of the kindness and frindship is all the more intense and more vehement and more enduring, because of the disappointment of the mistaken partial haggling act of amnesty.</P>

      <P>Some of us are in a difficulty, at least I am, in regard to this matter.  We do not know what is the opinion of the Government. We do not know what the Government wish done, and although some of us may be very anxious that these prisoners be released we may be doing here something that may damage the prisoners.  Until we do know what the Government is anxious to do, by some Minister coming here to tell us what they wish done, I think it is a very dangerous thing at all to pass any vote for or against.  Is it possible to arrange that some Minister <Col N="172" /> should come here and explain the views of the Government?</P>

We could accept the Second Reading to-day.  It could then go through the Committee Stage later and in the meantime we would have an opportunity of having the facts before us and we would certainly have the power to hold up the Bill at the Third Reading.

      <P>I cannot agree to either of these propositions.  This question has been under consideration for not only a month, but a year, and to my knowledge the Government has again and again asked for the release of those prisoners, and on one or two occasions Michael Collins was asking to have them released.  Then excuses were given. Another question was raised; then the excuse was given that they were military prisoners.  Only just before last Xmas the Government wrote a strong memorandum to the English Government asking for the release of those prisoners. They went further, and the Home Secretary asked me to go over to the War Office to see about them.  Instead of doing that, we sent a petition from here, because it was Xmas time, <Col N="173" /> and we did not see any possibility of meeting people over there.  One of the things we stated in that petition to the War Office in connection with the Connaught Rangers prisoners was that the Amnesty Bill could not be passed unless those prisoners were released, and as a result of that statement all the Connaught Rangers were released, and there is left only a small minority.  Now, with regard to the last paragraph of my motion, it is that a certificate of the Irish Government that these are political prisoners will be necessary in making the demand or request for their release. If the Irish Government does not want it to go through they will not make that demand and they will tell us so and passing through the first stage of this Bill will be extremely wrong.  It would be only equivocation. We have strong opinions about these matters, and let us not go round the corner, and let us not have these equivocations, and let us not have these half-hearted arrangements to which I have always objected.  I do not understand that sort of equivocation. The Government and the President of the Dáil stated definitely again and again that this Seanad was entirely independent of the Dáil.  The President went further and said that he did not want to have any communications except strictly official ones, and did not want any Committees half and half.  We ought to act independently.  I feel quite sure that if the Seanad passes this resolution unanimously it will have a very good effect all <Col N="174" /> over Ireland.  There has been a great deal more agitation on this matter than one would think.  I was called on again and again to raise the question, but I took care not to raise it until now, although I did call attention to it in Government circles repeatedly.  Eventually the time comes when you really must take some steps.  This will have a good effect between the two countries if we pass it unanimously.</P>
