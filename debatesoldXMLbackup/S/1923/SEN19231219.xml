That has been put there through inadvertence, because the general understanding was that in view of the fact that it cannot reach the Dáil again before the 15th January it would be better to leave the Second Reading of this important Bill over until after the Christmas recess, so that Senators might have a full opportunity of considering it.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete from this Schedule the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1883, together with the several Amending Acts therein referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tabled this amendment for the purpose of having the matter of the erection of labourers' cottages in the rural districts considered and discussed by the Seanad.  These Acts have been forty years in existence and have been renewed every year under the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Act.  I hold that the object for which these Acts were passed has been achieved and that a sufficient number of cottages have been erected in the rural areas for the people qualified to be tenants.  In fact, in some districts more houses have been built than tenants can be found for.  In some cases it has been necessary to give two houses to one tenant in order to keep the houses from falling into disrepair. In other cases the cottages have actually fallen down or the material with which they have been built has been looted and the cottages are now total wrecks.  The land attached to those cottages that are vacant has become a commonage, or it has reverted to the former owner from whom it had been purchased by the District Council.  I hold that if there is any money available for housing it should be diverted from the rural areas and utilised for the clearing and replacement of the city and urban slums, in order to provide proper housing accommodation for the inhabitants. When these cottages were originally erected under the first Act they were built at a cost of about £80 per cottage, and the rent fixed, of 1s. per week, or £2 12s. per year, very nearly covered the sum required to pay the interest and sinking fund on the money borrowed.  As time went on the cost increased.  At the present time, I believe, it would cost from £350 to £400 to erect a labourer's cottage. The District Councils and the Boards <Col N="220" /> of Guardians are bound to keep these cottages in repair, and the cost of the repairs in most districts at present amounts to a considerably greater sum than is received from the tenants. From a business point of view, therefore, it would be good policy for the country and for the ratepayers that the cottages should be transferred altogether to the tenants so as to get rid of the liability for keeping them in repair.</P>
    <P>I think it would be possible to evolve a scheme of purchase on similar lines to that included in the recent Land Act, whereby the tenants of cottages could become owners of them, and also of the plots attached, by paying an annuity that would be considerably less than the rents they are, at present, paying.  There is no doubt that when the houses were originally erected, after the Acts were passed, a great necessity existed for improving the housing conditions in the country. I hold that that object has been achieved, and that it will be simply waste of money to incur any further expenditure in rural areas in the erection of cottages.  It is difficult to get tenants for the houses already built, notwithstanding the fact that many people have possession of them who are not qualified under the Acts to obtain them.  I put down this amendment in order that the Seanad might have an opportunity of discussing the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to what Senator Linehan has said with regard to the Labourers Acts.  While many of the errors he mentioned have occurred, I think they were due to the administration by the local authority rather than to the Acts themselves.  The view that the need for houses has been completely filled in the rural districts is one that I dissent from.  In the district from which I come, probably more houses have been built&mdash;in the Kilmallock Rural District&mdash;than in any other district in Ireland.  Yet, to my mind, a want for further housing exists.  The suggestion that the money available&mdash;if any was available&mdash;should be taken from the rural districts and expended in slum districts in towns or cities may <Col N="221" /> be an admirable one, but I feel that the agricultural industry owes a debt to its labour, and that that could be in no way fulfilled by a transference of any money to city districts.  The principle that was tried in Ireland, and I think successfully, that an industry should be responsible for the maintenance of the labour employed in it was, to my mind, an admirable one.  I think in course of legislation in future times all big industries may possibly be made responsible for the proper housing of those engaged in them.  As to the question of repairs to which Senator Linehan alluded, it is unfortunately true that repairs to cottages in nearly every district have completely swallowed up the weekly rents paid by the tenants.  I think that was owing to the fact that the repairs were executed not in an economical way, but in a slipshod fashion. There were endless numbers of small contractors roaming around the country doing one little bit here and another little bit there.  All these contractors were enjoying the patronage of the District Councils.  It is in the air that the position of District Councils and their administration is to be considered by the Government. I hope, in the future, that men will be returned whose anxiety it will be to administer their functions in an economical way.  When that desirable end is attained, I think the grave errors to which Senator Linehan alluded will not occur.  A scheme of purchase, to my mind, is outside the debate on this occasion.  If the tenants would purchase I think it is a consummation to be devoutly wished for.  Personally, I may say that I suggested such a scheme some years ago, but the labourers did not think it was a wise thing for them.  I hope they will see in time it may be a wise thing.  I think if a tenant owned his house he would have a greater incentive to keep it, and not inflict serious injury to it.  For the reasons I have stated, I do not think Senator Linehan's amendment, to exclude the various Acts from the Second Schedule of the Bill, should be allowed to pass, and I beg to oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDuffy" hpid="Mr. DUFFY Mr. DUFFY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to oppose the <Col N="222" /> amendment for various reasons.  My principal reason is that the Labourers Acts were brought in, mainly through the failure of the agricultural employers in this country, to provide suitable accommodation for the workers which was necessary if the industry was to be carried on successfully. That fact cannot be disputed. Since the passing of the Acts I hold that nothing has occurred which would justify the Government in changing the present system of providing housing accommodation for agricultural workers.</P>
      <P>I am rather sorry that I had not an opportunity of getting some figures and returns of a number of schemes held up at present through the scarcity of finance.  I think the Minister will probably be able to give us the necessary information.  I received notice of this amendment only to-day, and consequently had not the time to find out the necessary information.  But I know that various schemes in the county from which I come have been held up for the past four or five, or perhaps seven or eight, years on account of the enormous increase in the cost of building materials.  Some of those schemes were nearly completed at the time the schemes were stopped. I do not see how this work is to be brought to any sort of successful conclusion in the event of this amendment being passed.  I think, however, with regard to necessary amendments of the Labourers Acts, that the eleventh hour is not the proper time to raise this question or to bring about the vital change that would be brought about by the passing of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the repairs of the cottages, Senator Bennett has stated that some time ago a scheme was evolved to provide for the purchase of the cottages.  I, as representing the agricultural workers, would have no hesitation in accepting a scheme that would confer upon the occupiers of the labourers' cottages benefits similar to what the Land Acts conferred upon the farming community.  But I cannot see at the moment how it is feasible to bring a scheme of that sort into operation, because the fact remains that the costs of repairs at present <Col N="223" /> borne by the ratepayers are greater than the rents paid for the cottages.  I fail to see how any scheme could throw the onus of carrying out the repairs on the labourers, provide for the repayment of the loan to the Board of Works, and at the same time give relief to the occupiers of the cottages. I am against the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLYSAGHT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am against this amendment, because it does not seem to accomplish anything.  Everybody here is more than anxious to see everything done, that can possibly be done, towards housing the working population of the country.  This amendment does not help at all, because of the fact that there is no money available.  The power is there. That power may be wanted again, and ought, therefore, be left.  My main object in rising is to say that I am sure the experience of most people is that the suggestion made by Senator Linehan, that two houses are very often given to one tenant, is entirely inaccurate. I never heard of such a case in my life.  With regard to houses falling down, there may be odd cases, but I am sure that only occurs in parts of the country which are entirely occupied by rangers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that any member of this assembly would table such a motion as this.  The idea behind this motion is to deprive the unfortunate agricultural labourers of Ireland of decent habitations.  The Senator who introduced this amendment told us that in several areas there were houses for which they could not find tenants, that, in fact, houses were so numerous that some tenants had two.  I am certainly pleased to hear it, because my experience is the reverse.  I think the Senator might have told us the areas in which these houses are.  I certainly know the Province of Leinster, and I challenge contradiction when I say that there are not nearly sufficient houses in the whole of the Province of Leinster or in any quarter of it, to meet the requirements of the agricultural population living there.  The language in which this amendment was moved may <Col N="224" /> lead the members of the Seanad to believe that there are houses going a-begging.  Everybody knows that people are being condemned to live in the rural parts of Ireland, as well as in the urban areas, under conditions which are a disgrace to civilisation. We know that in many small miserable dwellings there are three or four families, in which the people have to live in such a way that there can be no respect for the sexes.  The people in such cases are herded together just like swine.  The object underlying this amendment is to take off the Statute Book one of the best and most humane Acts ever passed by the British Parliament, as far as the working class people of this country are concerned.</P>
      <P>I never thought that in this assembly I would find a Senator moving to take from the Statute Book this most important measure that was first introduced for the purpose of giving to the unfortunate agricultural labourers of this country an opportunity to live in some sort of decency.  I do not want to go into the merits of the question of repairs.  It is the principle underlying this amendment that I deal with and I hope the Seanad will scout it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that when amendments like this are moved in the future some justification will be put forward, that some facts will be submitted that would justify a Senator in moving such an amendment.  The idea of this Bill was to provide houses for the unfortunate agricultural labourers at a rent that they could pay.  Senator Linehan told us that houses were let at 1s. a week.  That is not the fault of the agricultural labourer.  At the time this measure was passed the agricultural labourer had the magnificent weekly wage of from 10s. to 12s. to keep a family of from eight to ten people.  Everybody knows that owing to the high standard of morality prevailing in this country amongst agricultural labourers, they are blessed by the Almighty with very large families. But because of the fact that their employers did not pay a sufficient wage to enable them to pay an economic rent, the State had to come in and build houses in order that these poor men would live as human beings <Col N="225" /> and Christians.  That was the object underlying the bringing in of this measure, and now it is proposed to take the privilege away from those unfortunate labourers who are not housed.  There are many thousands of such in the country.  These men are just as badly in need of houses as the labourers for whom houses have been already built.  I sincerely hope the good sense of the Seanad will scout the amendment in the way it deserves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. COSTELLO</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Senator Linehan had any evil purpose in moving the amendment.  He does not give me the impression of Machiavelli.  I do not imagine, either, that he expected that the Seanad would agree with him.  We are indebted to him for initiating a most interesting debate.  I think the Seanad would be always glad to discuss questions of this nature. I think these Labourers Acts, which have been operating in this country for over thirty years, are amongst the best Acts ever passed by any country; I think they are admirable Acts, and there is no doubt they have done an enormous amount of good.  The only thing that surprises me is that other countries have not taken a leaf out of our book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other countries they are faced with the difficulty of proper housing particularly for agricultural labourers, but this country, small as it is, is the only country that has shown other civilised countries the best way of dealing with this important question. If we look back some years we can well remember the sort of houses that labourers in the country lived in. They were hovels not fit for human beings to live in.  Now, in most rural districts, particularly tillage districts, you will find a marvellous improvement, and one cannot but be struck by the nice cottages on the roadside and the charming, clean, healthy children you will see around them.  All this <Col N="226" /> is undoubtedly the result of the Labourers Acts.</P>
    <P>No doubt, in every human endeavour, there are imperfections.  Senator Linehan said that in one fortunate district, with which he happens to be acquainted, there were too many houses.  I agree with the Senators opposite that we have not yet discovered that district; certainly I have not discovered it.  I would suggest to Senator Linehan that he would be doing a great public service if he advertised the district in which there are too many labourers' cottages.  If he would do so, I am sure there would be no difficulty in having them occupied. As regards the instance of one man occupying two houses, they do that in Utah, but I did not know that it was done in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of badly-built houses, there is no doubt some of them are abominably built.  I was for many years engaged in this business, and I think I know something about it.  When public money is being spent, especially in the way that a great deal of public money has been spent, you do not get the best return for it.  There are many defects in the labourers' cottages that have been erected, and the result is that every now and then the ratepayers have to meet a very considerable bill for repairs.  I hope that when houses are being built in the future they will be better constructed, and probably more commodious and altogether an advance on those erected in the past.  Some of the houses that are now in process of erection, or that have been recently built, are admirable in every respect.</P>
    <P>There is one point in which I am very much interested, and in regard to which I hold very strong views. The proper solution of this question is, in my opinion, to make the labourers the owners of their own houses.  I have always believed that would solve the problem.  In the past it was not thought desirable that labourers should become owners.  There was some objection that I could never fathom.  The proper course would be to make the labourers owners of the houses.  They would then take a pride in them and keep them in proper order <Col N="227" /> and I am sure the ratepayers would not have so much to complain of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regret having brought forward this matter. We have had it here admitted that the cost of repairing these houses is greater than the rent received.  I would ask those who are advocating building schemes in cities, whether they propose to erect houses the rents of which will not be sufficient to keep them in repair.  That is the state of affairs in the rural districts.  No Government grant has been given for the erection of those houses; there has been merely a loan given to the local authority, and that has to be repaid. All the money will be repaid by the ratepayers.  The amount advanced for the erection of these cottages up to the 31st March, 1920, was £4,609,000; that is a charge on all the ratepayers of the country where these houses have been built.  It is a mistake to say that the Government gave grants for the erection of those houses.  They have been erected by the ratepayers, and I think the ratepayers are entitled to see that if the rents are not able to meet the cost of repairs, the Government ought to evolve some scheme that will relieve them of that liability.  I do not regret having brought forward this matter, in view of the discussion that has taken place.  With the permission of the Seanad, I am now prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite satisfied that the amendment is in order, because it proposes to effect two radical changes in the law regulating the right to the franchise.  That would look prima facie as if it was hostile for the purpose of this Bill, but I find there is a provision in the Bill, Clause 3, which does deal with electoral qualifications by shortening the period, and, therefore, I am not in a position definitely to say that the Senator's amendment is out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The first portion of the amendment reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of Section 2 the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  provided always that nothing in this Section or in any existing enactment shall entitle a person to be registered as a Local Government Elector if the rates for which he or she is legally liable on the 31st March immediately preceding the 15th November in each year are in arrear at the time of the compilation of the Register.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not think it is desirable to say much on this amendment.  It is quite evident that it is desirable that a person who pays no rates should not have a voice in their distribution.  If carried, this amendment will achieve a double purpose.  It will exclude from voting those who do not pay their rates, and it will also induce ratepayers to meet their liabilities.  For those reasons I move the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the <Col N="229" /> sentiment underlying this amendment, there is a fault in the drafting. The amendment talks about the time of compilation of the register.  There is actually no fixed time of compilation. There is a period for qualification and a period for the publication of the register, but there is no time for compiling.  If this amendment were adopted it would apply differently in different places, and cause endless confusion. If a man whose rates are unpaid is to be disfranchised what about disfranchising his wife?  There is no reason why she should not be disfranchised also.  Then there is the other very important fact, that, in places like Dublin, the tenant almost invariably pays an inclusive rent which includes rates.  If the landlord fails to pay the rates the whole of the tenants under him will be disfranchised, although they have paid their rents. It is obvious that this amendment cannot possibly be applied from the point of view of practical application, and, if it did apply, it would inflict the greatest possible hardship on some people.  I hardly think that it is necessary to argue against it further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that there is something to be said in favour of this amendment.  All over the country there is evident an extraordinary lack of zeal in paying rates.  In some counties the arrears amount to thousands and thousands of pounds.  Anything that would stimulate the payment of these rates and make ratepayers recognise their responsibilities and their duties towards the public ought to be encouraged.  For that reason, I would certainly not allow a voter to vote in a local government election if he did not discharge his primary duty as a citizen and contribute his proper share to the local rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to a wife losing her vote if her husband did not pay his rates, that might, in fact, be an inducement to pay the rates, as if the wife is anxious to exercise the franchise she would probably wish her husband to pay them.  I do not say that this particular proposal should be adopted, but, I think, it is no harm to have the suggestion made and generally <Col N="230" /> considered.  Senator Linehan has rendered a public service in raising the question.  It is for people who live in the country and have to use rates in the building of cottages and so forth, to see that those of their neighbours who are not prepared to discharge their duties should be penalised in some way.  The vote in this country is not a matter to which people seem to attach great importance.  For those who do vote and who are interested in the exercise of the franchise, I think it might be made known that they should also discharge their other duties.</P>

      <P>The Senator who sits behind me has really hit the nail on the head when he stated that the compilation of the register is to be carried out at no stated time.  That is the whole answer to Senator Linehan's amendment.  I wish, sir, when you said that this amendment was in order that you had explained that fact to the Seanad because, as Senator O'Farrell has said, the register is taken in one place at one time, and at another place at another time.  My feeling is that the amendment is absolutely useless as an amendment to the Bill.</P>

      <P>With regard to the particular time when the compilation of the register is engaging attention, if the amendment were slightly altered so that the elector would be entitled to have his or her name recorded on the register, provided he or she had paid the rates for the previous financial year, it would not matter what particular time the register was being compiled. That is the recommendation made by the General Council of County Councils to the Local Government Ministry.  I think, generally, that if a person is so lacking in civic spirit or in a sense of civic obligation, and has not paid rates, provided he is in a position to do so&mdash;there are many cases where persons are not in that position, and for one reason or another are evading <Col N="231" /> their obligations &mdash; he should not be allowed the privilege of voting.  Generally, throughout the country, there is now a disposition to evade the payment of rates, and we know that in the matter of county council arrears of rates the figure is very considerable. Propagandist movements are on foot throughout the various counties, actually to strike at the collection of these rates, and they have the effect of utterly dislocating the finances of the various county councils.  There are, in fact, instances where the rates are two and three years in arrears.</P>
      <P>You have certain expenditure to which you are committed.  Very large services depend on the payment of these rates.  A large amount of distress would be involved if any County Council were to break down financially. Appeals have been made by various County Councils.  Yet we find no material response to these appeals, showing the people are actually dead to their civic duty.  We have told them the asylums must be closed, and other humanitarian measures of that character will fail owing to the nonpayment of rates, but we do not find a response.  In cities we know of many people who could well afford to pay their rates, who have four, five, and six pounds a week coming into their houses, and in which houses there is no tangible property to be seized in default of payment of rates.  The money is recklessly squandered.  In England when a man of good earning capacity but with no tangible furniture in his house fails to pay his rates, he is put in gaol.  That shows you how the authorities view the matter in other countries.  For all these reasons I should certainly support the amendment. It is anomalous to have a man having a voice in the election of a public body that has to deal with the administration of public funds who is absolutely unconcerned whether or not he discharges his public duty.  His idea is that the expenditure might be of a lavish order and he might benefit indirectly by it.  I think a man who pays his rates should follow up the man he votes for, and see he does his duty. The man who does not is a bad citizen.</P>

      <P>I do not think any member is antagonistic to the sentiment which underlies Senator Linehan's amendment.  I am very much in favour of it myself.  Even Senator O'Farrell, if he wants labourers' cottages in a regular fashion, must have rates.  And as Senator O'Farrell pointed out, the whole point is, if this amendment is passed, a lot of people would be done out of their votes through no fault of their own.</P>
      <P>It appears to me from the statements that have been made that in the country, individual cottage-holders pay their own rates.  In the city it is not the case.  The landlord charges an inclusive rent and pays them himself. If this amendment is passed, it seems to me that if the landlord does not pay the rates, he disfranchises his tenant.  Unless the law is changed, each individual householder is responsible for his rates.  The sooner the law is changed in that respect the better it will be.  It will have the effect of getting everything done in a proper spirit.</P>

      <P>I am definitely opposed to this amendment, because it seems to me the Senator is attempting to cure a disease, due to abnormal times, in a permanent Bill.  In the ordinary times rates are collected fairly well, and even in the wild Co. Clare, which, contrary to the popular belief, is a peaceful county, in the district where I live, the total amount of rates outstanding is £98.  I do not know how many other districts have the same to say.  The reason that is so in Clare is, that the strong arm of the law is put into force.  I do not think this amendment is of much value.  As regards the idea of tenants being disfranchised through the landlord not paying the rates, that is a matter for the lawyer, and I do not think we can discuss it.  I think Senator O'Farrell was right about the vagueness of the amendment as to the word &ldquo;compilation.&rdquo;  That, in itself, is sufficient to make me oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this amendment for several reasons.  In the first place, the reason <Col N="233" /> given by Senator O'Farrell seems to me to be beside the question of when a man is disfranchised because the landlord did not pay the rates. Whether the landlord is liable or not, why should a tenant be disfranchised? Perhaps the tenant would not pay. I know that the scandals arising through people administering and spending the rates who never pay them are fearful.  I am aware of one district where the rates amount to 40s. in the £, and where people have to pay double their valuation.  That is, double their valuation, and these rates are imposed by people who, in a great number of instances, never pay rates at all.  I do not see why people should be allowed to levy rates or incur charges at the public expense who would not themselves contribute towards them, and if this amendment would have the effect of preventing this sort of thing I am entirely in favour of it.</P>

      <P>I would like to emphasise the point which Senator Barrington rather wants to slur over. One does not want to be a lawyer to know that it is the tenant who is held responsible for the rates, because I have had that experience myself.  My landlord did not pay the rates, and I was summoned for them, although I had not to pay rates at all.  If the County Councils and Corporations did the duties for which they were elected instead of talking polities, there would not be such arrears and justification for such action as this.</P>

      <P>I have been in exactly the same position as Senator O'Farrell.  I happen to hold a place for which the landlord was liable to pay the rates.  The landlord did not pay them, and I was disfranchised.  I did not care a scrap whether I was disfranchised or not, but I did object to his failure to pay the rates.  I took legal advice, and I paid the rates, but deducted them from the rent, and I believe a similar course would be open to everybody.</P>

As it stands, it is rather incoherent and hazy, but I think the principle that is at the back of Senator Linehan's mind, that a man should not enjoy the vote unless he discharges his civic duty, is an admirable one.  I must dissent from the view of Senator O'Farrell regarding the performance of their duties by the County Councils.  I have had long experience as a County Councillor, and I found, year after year, large sums in arrears returned and carried over, although strong efforts were made by the local bodies to get them in.  In many cases they went to labourers' cottages, and it was a case of nulla bona.  They had plenty of bona to spend on everything else but their rates, and I really feel that if this clause should be put in, while safeguarding the town dweller, it ought to be done.  If an amendment could be framed so as to secure that the town dweller would not be affected, I would certainly be in its favour, and even as it is, I would like to support this amendment.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment, which is a very useful one, and I think it will be of very great assistance to the local authorities that something should be put into the law to stop this refusal to pay rates.  The point advanced by Senator O'Farrell is really not material.  We all know very well that a landlord is liable for rates, and that the tenant has a very simple remedy. He can pay the rates and deduct the amount from the next month's rent.  There is no difficulty at all about it.  If he wishes to be, what he ought to be, a good citizen and anxious for the good government of the community, there is no difficulty for any man who thinks his landlord is really liable for the rates.  I agree entirely with Senator Nesbitt that it is one of the worst plans to make landlords liable for the payment of rates, and nothing could be worse for the civic government of Dublin.  Rates <Col N="235" /> ought to be levied and collected from the occupiers of the houses, and then they will become aware of how important it is to keep down the rates.  In Dublin during my memory, the tenant has never taken any interest in the rates.  He thinks the landlord pays them, and that he is not concerned.  The result is that you have the present high cost of living in Dublin.  I have men in my employment to-day who have been obliged to take a back room and pay £1 a week for it.  It is intolerable, and it puts them into that position.  I think it is a most useful amendment, and I certainly support it.</P>

Of course, this Bill was not intended to amend the franchise law in any way; that question comes under the general heading of Local Government reform, which is at present having the consideration of the Department. When I bring forward the Bill we will be able to consider the question of franchise.  I think it is a most unsuitable time to bring forward this contentious matter.  Then, of course, the question has been asked about the tenants who pay rents to their landlords on condition that the landlords pay the rates.  That is another very important matter to take into consideration, because, as Senator Nesbitt pointed out, in a great many cases these rents are paid on condition that the landlord pays the rates.  All the time the tenant remains legally liable for the rates, so that on the whole, it would be much better not to press this amendment.</P>

      <P>One of the main reasons advanced by the Minister appears to be that it is necessary to pass this Bill before Christmas, another example of rush legislation, of which, I am sure, we have all heard.  If there is a Bill on the stocks we have no knowledge of it, and if we think that a certain proviso should be put into this Bill to affect a useful change in the administration of the country, I think it is our duty to insert that proviso, even though it might not meet the views of the Government&mdash;<Col N="237" /> that we should shut our ears to what we hear and our eyes to what we see.  I do not think it would be becoming to us as a Seanad to adopt the suggestion, and I think it is one more reason why we should pass this amendment, because the only reason suggested for not passing it is that we have to pass the Bill before Christmas.</P>

      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the point of view Senator Bennett has just expressed. At the same time, I think there is a fair case for the urgency of this Bill, as it stands.  I think it is possible there is another way out for members of the Seanad who feel strongly in this matter: that is, to introduce a Bill amending the existing legislation early next year.  It would be a Seanad Bill, which could be carefully considered, and sent to the Dáil from here on its merits, after full debate.  Most of us, judging from the speeches, find a certain amount of difficulty in making up our minds in voting on this amendment. A considerable number who agree with it are doubtful as to its exact effect.  I should like to point out that in this matter we are placed in a difficulty.  I appeal strongly to the members of the Government and the leaders of the Dáil not to place us again in the position we are now. Most of us would like to see the Local Government elections taking place for various reasons at as early a date as possible, and, therefore, we do not wish to delay this Bill.  I think it is an extremely unsatisfactory position that the Dáil should send up Bills and then adjourn.  I think, in the interests of good Government, or the careful consideration of Bills sent before us, that an arrangement might be made by which the Dáil could be called to deal with any amendments that might be inserted, particularly as regards urgent Bills.  The same applies to other Bills in which amendments might be inserted, and for which a fair case for urgency can be made.  I hope it would be possible, if the Seanad agrees with me, to ask the Dáil in future to make it easy for the reconsideration of amendments to urgent Bills, and not simply adjourn until the 10th January, and send up a <Col N="238" /> number of Bills to the Seanad, which we must either amend as we wish, or pass because we are afraid of delay.</P>

This Bill was sent forward here when the Dáil adjourned, not through any discourtesy to the Seanad, or anything of the sort, but because it was considered non-contentious.  No amendment was moved in the Dáil, and the representation in the Dáil is to some extent the same as here, and we did not think there would be any discussion on it. An amendment which we had not foreseen has been moved, and that has created a difficulty.  If we had known there was to be any contentious amendment moved the Dáil would not have adjourned without giving time to consider it.</P>

      <P>Arising out of what the Minister has said, last week I protested in the strongest way I could against this system of sending up Bills &mdash;saying they are matters of such urgency, and that they should be passed at once, as they are only temporary Bills.  Last Session we had instance after instance of Bills coming up under these conditions, and we passed them in view of statements the Ministers made.  We knew the difficulties of the Ministers, and we passed them without amendments, and then we found these Bills were reintroduced verbatim and sent back for us to pass as permanent measures.  I think this case, if not exactly similar, is much the same.  If the Seanad is of any use&mdash;after all, we are the Seanad of Ireland&mdash;we have been called a Cooling Chamber&mdash;we are supposed to do our best to amend legislation, if it is our opinion that certain amendments ought to be introduced after consideration, and not make us pass a Bill of which we disapprove.</P>

Very few, if any, of these contribute directly to the rates, and a landlord can, at any time, decide to withhold the rates in order to disqualify his tenants, as this amendment would empower him to do. <Col N="239" /> All of us on this side are in entire sympathy and agreement with the sentiments expressed in the amendment, but we say it does not go far enough; it should go a long way further to penalise those landlords who will not pay the rates, though they can pay them. Some penalty ought be laid down to deal with these people.  You have plenty of internment camps and jails idle now, and if people act in this way they should be dealt with, because of their action in disqualifying a great number of people.  I think it is ridiculous to bring in an amendment of this kind as a remedy.  It certainly will not be a remedy.</P>

      <P>That is just the point in view.  There is no use asking the Minister to give favourable consideration to any amendment of the Local Government Act on the franchise question. As pointed out, the seriousness of the position will be that if you attempt to deal with a person who is guilty of the offence of refusing to pay his just and lawful debts, there are many other people who will suffer in consequence of his default if elections become very keen again.  There are some landlords who own many slum houses, where as many as 40 or 50 people live in one house, and these landlords will not pay rates for the purpose of disfranchising these people.  They are not above doing that.  Though in sympathy with the idea underlying the amendment, that if a person does not pay his just and lawful debts he is not entitled to full citizenship, I think, under the circumstances, we cannot support it.</P>

      <P>Might I ask if this would leave any margin to the ratepayer? The General Council of County Councils thought fit to give him some latitude, inasmuch as they recommended that if he paid his rates for the previous financial year he would be entitled to be put upon the roll.  It might so happen that the dates set out here might place him at a disadvantage, and I would suggest that there should be some margin allowed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the next amendment standing in my name, which is also an amendment to Section 2. It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b)  provided also that a person occupying rateable property having a valuation not exceeding £20 shall be entitled to one vote, over £20 and not exceeding £50 two votes, over £50 and not exceeding £100 three votes, and over £100 four votes at any Local Government Election, and the Register shall be so prepared as to show the number of votes to which each elector is entitled.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I regard those bodies which are elected by the Local Government electors as business concerns, and I think it is only right that the persons who contribute to their upkeep should have a voice in their election corresponding to some extent to their contribution to those bodies.  I regard those bodies, more or less, as a company, and the ratepayers as shareholders.  From a business point of view, I think it is only right that those who contribute a large amount should have a larger number of votes than those who contribute only a small amount.  The proportions set out here are not at all so great as to give the large ratepayer votes corresponding to his valuation.  For instance, a ratepayer contributing on a £1 valuation will have one vote, whereas a man paying on a valuation of £100 will have only four votes.  That is not a very great difference and does not at all correspond with the margin between the contribution of the greater and the lesser ratepayer. If this amendment were carried, it would have the effect of preventing the gross extravagance which is taking place under some of the local bodies throughout the country, and I would hope it would considerably reduce the rates by more efficient methods of administration. For that reason, I submit the amendment for the consideration of the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very funny amendment, coming from &ldquo;Rebel Cork.&rdquo;  It suggests setting up a franchise on the Prussian model.  I suppose that is where Senator Linehan got the idea from, although I understand that for generations past Cork was Republican. Senator Linehan says that local government is a business matter.  Well, so is national government, and if you are going to give a ratepayer whose valuation is over £100 four votes, and his wife four votes more&mdash;that is eight &mdash;you will have, in order to be consistent, to do likewise with the Parliamentary franchise.  At that rate, Messrs. Guinness and Son would elect about half the members of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I thought we had got away from that property basis of voting.  But now that we have got the power to arrange our own household, Senator Linehan, coming from Cork, wants the old feudal system restored.  For some considerable time now, the principle of &ldquo;One man, one vote,&rdquo; and, in later days, &ldquo;One woman, one vote,&rdquo; has been adopted in every country having any pretensions to democracy.  This amendment is going to alter all that.  Senator Linehan, a few minutes ago, as one of my colleagues pointed out, tried to take the house from the poor man.  Later on, he wanted to take the Local Government vote from him, and now he proposes to put him in an unequal position, by giving the wealthier man four times the number of votes he has.  By the time this Bill gets through with these provisions, we will probably have a revolution.</P>
      <P>The proposition is so outrageous that it would not be fair to keep the Seanad discussing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Seanad should pass this amendment because it is not sound in principle. To be consistent we should assume that all property was properly acquired through the industry, integrity and intelligence of the persons possessing it.  No one could hope to convince the Seanad that that is the case.  That being so the amendment would be very unfair from an equitable point of view and would give a very unfair advantage to property owners whose title to property, or the means by which they <Col N="246" /> acquired it, might be, at least, very questionable, and probably would not bear investigation in a great many cases.  Also if you make a property qualification on the basis of the amount of wealth that a man has, how would you apply it to the basis on which the Parliamentary franchise rests.  Would you then say that a man who was on the lowest intellectual level should have one vote and go by degrees of intellectuality until you come to the B.A., give him two votes, and three votes to the M.A.?  The same principle should apply there.  There are degrees of intelligence, just the same as there are degrees of wealth, and when you apply the root principles of the amendment I do not think the position taken up by Senator Linehan in this case is a tenable one.</P>

      <P>While I am not able to support the amendment I would like to correct two statements as regards the principle.  This principle of plurality of voting is not confined entirely to countries of a reactionary kind.  If Senator O'Farrell would study the Constitution of Belgium he will find that there is a plurality system there, not on property qualification, but intellectual qualification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to one point that has been mentioned against this amendment, that is comparing the Parliamentary franchise with the Local Government franchise. In the case of the Parliamentary franchise practically every person who has a vote contributes about the same amount to the national revenue as regards indirect taxation on what they eat and drink.  There are very few who have to pay on the income tax basis compared with the vast number of voters on the register.  I do not therefore regard the Parliamentary <Col N="247" /> franchise as being the same as the Local Government franchise.</P>

      <P>I am not opposed to the Bill, but in view of the suspension of some public boards I think the Minister ought to let us know exactly what the position is regarding the postponement of these elections.  There is a good deal of dissatisfaction with the manner in which some public bodies are being conducted.  There is also a good deal of propaganda being carried on with a view to the abolition of public boards.  It appears to me to be unfair to be postponing these elections while people are continually finding fault with the manner in which public bodies are conducting their business.  If the public boards are not satisfactory the best way to give the people an opportunity of registering their opinion in the matter would be to hold elections and allow the people to elect new boards.</P>
      <P>I think it is hardly fair to be abolishing public boards after their period of office had expired, postponing the elections, and at the same time carrying on a virile propaganda against them.  I have no doubt that the Government have some very good reasons why the elections should be postponed, but I think it is hardly fair, while the public boards are carrying on, to have the elections postponed on more than one occasion, and to be finding fault with the manner in which they are doing their business without giving the people an opportunity of putting others in their places.</P>

      <P>The first reason for postponing the elections is that if we do not do so we would have to have them on the 1st of January, as the law now stands.  Another reason is that it would be well, if possible, to get all the rates collected before we ask the new Councils to take over the responsibilities of Local Government.  The third reason is that it would be well to have the new registers which we are compiling before them.  As well as that, I would like to have time to consider the whole question of Local Government, as it may perhaps be necessary to <Col N="249" /> change the administration in many ways.  It might also be necessary to have changes in the personnel or the system.  At all events, it is impossible to have the elections on January 1st. I think everyone will agree with that.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert after Section 8 a new Section 9 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;9. No penalty inflicted under this Act shall be reduced or remitted save on the recommendation of the Judge or Justice who imposes such penalty, and any recommendation for such reduction or remission shall be made at the same time as the penalty is imposed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the effect of the amendment is clear and obvious.  I may describe the amendment as one to save the Government in general, and members of the Government in particular, from the importunate advances of their friends.  We all know what happens in these cases. A penalty is inflicted, and for some reason hard to appreciate, whether it is lack of sympathy with the law or regard for the individual offender, a petition is got up and actively championed by a number of law-abiding citizens, with the result, as frequently happens, that the course of justice is frustrated.  This thing has become so obvious, and so notorious, and has earned for the country such a bad name that I hope, now that there is an opportunity, it may be put right once and for all.  The object of the Bill is to put a stop to a very great danger from the point of view of the economic welfare of the country, a form of poaching, hard to detect, and one very indiscriminate and far-reaching in its effects. Judging by our experience, if on every occasion, when a penalty has been inflicted the usual petition comes on, then I think the object of the Bill will be only partly and ineffectually attained.  I do not think Ministers can honestly say that they are absolutely immune to all kinds of advances from outside sources. Take the case of any of us, however high one puts duty, or however anxious one may be to do what is right, if from his constituents a number of very important and influential people come forward on behalf of some malefactor, it is almost more than human nature could expect to turn a deaf ear to such entreaty. We have rather to go on our human nature and on facts in considering this matter.  I hope that the Seanad by its action will remove all temptation from the way of Ministers and put <Col N="251" /> them in the enviable position of being able to say: &ldquo;I am very sorry, much as I sympathise with you, but the law allows me to do nothing for you.  The law has to take its course.&rdquo;  There is this exception provided, that a judge or justice who imposed the fine can recommend remission.  While by law the minimum penalty has to be imposed, there may be extenuating circumstances which the judge or justice can best appreciate. If a recommendation for remission is made, and if such a record is made at the same time as the conviction, there will be no possibility of any undesirable influences being brought into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have much pleasure in supporting Senator Sir John Keane's amendment in this matter, as an amendment of my own with precisely the same object was to have come on a bit later.  However, if Senator Sir John Keane's amendment is accepted, as I hope it will be, there is no need of entering into mine.  Now I ask the Government for a great many reasons to accept this amendment.  In the first place, whatever reason there may have been for the remission of penalities in the past, these reasons have disappeared now. There was a fear in the past that benches of magistrates might perhaps inflict penalties which would be too severe, having regard to the personal interests that would crop up.  Sometimes these penalties were alleged to be too severe in themselves but that has now been done away with by the Government.  These magistrates have now been done away with themselves, and these penalties can only be inflicted by the District Justices lately established by the Oireachtas.  If the men who have been appointed to administer the laws, and to inflict these penalties, are suitable, and if the penalties themselves are not too severe, I cannot see the least reason for reserving power to revise these penalties to somebody in Dublin who does not know the circumstances as well as the man who heard the case.  It is not right that somebody here in Dublin should be in the position of revising these <Col N="252" /> penalties.  In this connection I might perhaps tell the Senate of an instance which I heard within the past week. It is quite notorious through the country that these fines, as a rule, are paid by the dealers.  There is a certain lady in one part of the country who used usually pay the fine for the poachers who supplied her with fish. She came some time ago to a friend of mine, and said she never came across a greater rogue than Johnnie So-and-So. He had a fine inflicted on him and then came to her to get it paid.  She paid it.  Then he went to Dublin and got the fine remitted.  He really made money by it.  I confess that if the power to remit these fines is continued in the hands of somebody here in Dublin, who himself would be the last person in the world to desire to have that power, it will give rise to any amount of back-stairs influence and every kind of corruption which it is most desirable to do away with.  We have now started out to make things better and to reform things, and I hope the Government will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to go further, and not to allow any remission of these fines to anybody outside the Justice.  The Judge or the District Justice who had decided the case should be left to decide it once and for all.  The Judge or Justice who has to decide in the case of theft or robbery decides it once and for all. This is to all intents and purposes also a case of theft and robbery, and theft and robbery of a very discreditable kind.  Why the case of a poacher should be treated with greater leniency than the ordinary thief I do not know, and I would therefore suggest, and I am not quite sure whether it covers Senator Barrington's view, that no penalty inflicted under this Act shall be reduced or remitted.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister, when framing the Bill, must have had the assistance of the people best calculated to understand all the conditions of salmon fishing in Ireland. In some districts the differences are very great.  Everybody who knows anything about fishing is aware that there are such things as bye-laws which could <Col N="253" /> be introduced on the application of the Conservators.  These bye-laws can be, as possibly they have been, upset on the application of influential interests in a district after an inquiry has been held by the officials of the Fisheries Board. The little retreat taken by the Minister in this Bill was a wise one.  It is clear that the District Justice must sponsor the application in all cases where the aggrieved party considers the law is bearing unfairly on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are cases where the law does not really mete out justice.  One example occurs to my mind, and it is the village of Rathcoursey, where, for the past 200 years, the inhabitants have been exclusively carrying on business as fishermen. They understand the art of fishing thoroughly, and are just as well versed in it as any fishermen in the world.  They fish there for salmon until almost the close of the season.  The village is about 8 miles from Roche's Point, which is the extreme limit of the harbour.  They can fish with drift nets from Roche's Point to Templebrady, provided they can get there.  To get there, however, they would have to row the boats a distance of 8 miles or so, and if they happen to be caught in the act of going out there, although their nets would be perfectly dry and their boats would present every appearance of the fact that they were not out for any but a legitimate purpose, as the law now stands they would be liable to a penalty. To avoid incurring that penalty, they have to transport their nets and gear by road a distance of 8 miles, so as to get them over to Roche's Point, and to approach the sea there for the purpose of fishing is an almost impossible task. Dozens of men have lost their lives in endeavouring to observe this particular bye-law which prevents them going by sea.  In 1909 or 1910 an inquiry was held, at which the cream of the Bar was present.  The inquiry was held by the Privy Council, and some ex-naval man succeeded in getting the Admiralty into it.  The Admiralty succeeded in putting up a case that a salmon drift net would be highly dangerous for the periscope of a submarine, and consequently they could not think of granting the appeal.  There are 80 drift nets at Youghal, 70 at Waterford, and 64 <Col N="254" /> on the River Shannon.  The whole coast is strewn with drift nets, but yet they cannot be used because the Admiralty hold that they would be destructive for submarines.</P>
    <P>A wag was responsible for the statement that the Empire was now all right, and that its integrity was complete, because all that would be required was to scrap the fleet and surround the British Islands with drift nets.  Mr. Green and Mr. Holt held exhaustive inquiries at Cork and at Cobh, but despite those inquiries, the state of the law is as I have explained. These unfortunate men, who are living by fishing, and whose ancestors lived by fishing, are hindered from approaching the fishing ground in the way I have indicated.  They are very excellent types of men.  If they were to go through the harbour they would be liable to severe penalties.  They are obliged to take their nets either by cart or aeroplane to the fishing ground.  Surely the Minister ought to see his way to make some provision to remedy the plight of these fishermen.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the Bill, as it stands, does not require any amendment.  It indicates that a decision cannot be considered except on the recommendation of the District Justice.  I am quite in agreement with the efforts made to prevent poaching, and especially am I in agreement with the effort to prevent any interference with spawning fish, which really is the most important thing.  If in-spawn salmon are killed in sufficient numbers, the whole species will be exterminated.  I do not think there is any necessity for the amendment.</P>

      <P>I cannot recommend the Seanad to accept either of these two amendments.  They are both more or less following the same lines, and they stand or fall together.  The real reason that I do not accept the amendment is, it is absolutely unnecessary.  What it conveys is exactly the procedure as at present in vogue.  The procedure is that when the Justice imposes a fine, if he feels, under the circumstances of the case, that a remission might be advisable, he makes a recommendation immediately to the Minister for Home Affairs, who refers it to my Department. I make the ordinary local inquiries through the Boards of Conservators, and I send my recommendation to the Minister for Home Affairs.  He then forms his decision as to what should be done.  As far as other memorials emanating originally, not from the District Justice, are concerned, I do not think we can prevent persons sending up memorials of this kind or asking for remission.  At any rate, when they do arrive the procedure is that the Minister for Home Affairs refers these cases back to the District Justice who has tried the case, for his comment.  When that has been received, it is then sent on as if it originally emanated from the District Justice.  I am perfectly satisfied that this talk about back-stairs methods of influencing Ministers is all moonshine.  The Ministry brings forward this Bill, considered by some people a drastic Bill, and surely the Ministry is not going to stultify itself by urging the remission of fines which the Ministry itself put into the Bill and which they went to the trouble of bringing before both Houses of the Oireachtas. I do not see the point in either of the amendments.  The procedure at present covers them, and covers the point raised in them, and, as a matter of fact, the putting forward at this particular stage of this amendment would help to put the provisions of the Bill out of action for the close season, which is now well advanced.</P>

Considerable interest and agitation have gone on about these petitions, and I still say, in the light of local knowledge and knowing what these petitions do mean, and that such things go on in this as in every other country, that it is highly desirable to exclude, as far as possible, this power of remission from the Government.  We should face this amendment which makes it absolutely clear that there will be only one means by which penalties can be remitted, and that is through the Judge who hears the evidence.  I think Senator Love is in agreement with this point of view.</P>

      <P>I am most concerned with the suggestion the Minister in his last sentence dropped that because we are amending this Bill therefore <Col N="257" /> we are going to prejudice its effects for the present close season. That is again the question of urgency, and it is suggesting that the Seanad is expected to assent, without putting up any amendment to the Bill, or otherwise you are going to interfere with the administration of the law. That is not a position that this Seanad, with its responsibility and dignity, can accept, especially as this is not a matter of such extraordinary urgency. I, therefore, do hope that this amendment will be accepted without prejudice to its indirect effect on the prerogative of the Governor-General. I hope the Seanad will in no way be affected by the argument that two Ministries are concerned, that while one Minister has power of decision another has the power of recommendation. That makes the thing worse. When it is a question of canvassing two Ministers, one to recommend and the other to remit, it makes it worse. I do hope that the Government will not take these remarks of mine in the spirit that is not intended.  We all know how these influences arise.  We are subject to them ourselves.  We are here canvassed on different things that we do not like.  Would it not be much better to say in a matter of this kind &ldquo;I have no power in the matter, the law cuts away the ground from under my feet.&rdquo;  There would be no more canvassing about it.  I, therefore, hope that the Seanad will support this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am a follower of the gentle art, and I would like to say something with regard to the Bill and the debate that has taken place on this amendment.  As I said on the Second Reading, this is a very drastic Bill.  The amendment proposed by Senator Sir John Keane is not necessary, and I hope to be able to show why that is so.  I agree with the Minister that a petition can be sent up.  Anybody can send up a petition to the Ministry on any subject whatever.  That is a liberty of the subject that is allowed in almost every country.  The petition is dealt with in this manner.  The Justice, in deciding a case, is asked for a report into the circumstances, and it is quite right to have a petition sent up, because those <Col N="258" /> who send it up are local inhabitants who know the local circumstances.  The Department of Fisheries, having had the opinion of the Justice on the subject, sends the case to the Minister for Home Affairs.  Does anybody suppose that the Government, having brought in a drastic Bill, are going to stultify their position by remitting fines upon poachers under a Bill which is one of the strictest Bills I have ever had the pleasure of reading?  This Bill is, in fact, much stricter than the measure in operation on the other side.  Senator Sir John Keane must allow that we are living in times quite different to those of the old regime, when it was a pleasant fashion for the Lord Lieutenant to remit a big fine if, indeed, not to cancel it.  That made a farce of the whole thing.  The law was there, but it was never administered. This Bill is going to administer the law, because I believe every word which the Minister has said with regard to it.  I think the Seanad would be doing an injustice to the Bill and to the Minister if they accepted the amendment, because I consider it is perfectly unnecessary.  The law is going to take its course, and the Minister has already said that he is going to make the profession of the poacher an unpleasant one.  That is quite enough for me.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the amendment.  Further down on the agenda paper I have an amendment on similar lines.  As I said on Second Reading, I think it would be lamentable to exclude citizens of the British Commonwealth of Nations&mdash;that is to say, the other Dominions&mdash;from these examinations. It might very possibly lead to retaliation which would be disastrous. At present, in our schools and universities, there are a number of men preparing for examinations for the Indian and other services in the Dominions and Colonies of the Crown.  If the clause were passed as it now stands, it is, I think, exceedingly likely that Great Britain might say that as Ireland has excluded the children of Great Britain from competing for examinations in Ireland, they, on their side, would exclude Irish Nationals from competing for examinations under the British Crown.  Had this been suggested a good many years ago, personally I would not have spent a great many years of my <Col N="261" /> life in the service of the Government of India.  As an Irishman, had retaliation been enforced, I would have been precluded from competing under the Civil Service Regulations.  I think it would be very undesirable that the children of other Dominions should be excluded from the operations of the Bill now before us.</P>

      <P>I should like to be able to support this amendment if I thought there were reciprocal arrangements with regard to other Dominions, but I am afraid this amendment is a little premature.  Our terms of citizenship are at present wide, but we have hardly yet decided as to how citizenship is to be acquired, and we are not yet clear as regards our relationship in regard to citizenship with Great Britain, and the other parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to go much further than they go in England.  A German can become a naturalised citizen of Australia, but that does not make him a citizen of Great Britain, and he would not be entitled to enter for the British Civil Service in England. Under this amendment a German, or a Russian, or anybody else who becomes a naturalised citizen of Canada, becomes eligible to compete for the Irish service.  If we have reciprocal arrangements with Canada, could a German or a Russian become a naturalised citizen of the Free State, and at the same time go over to Canada and compete for the Canadian Civil Service?  I doubt if he could.  I think the amendment is not quite clear with regard to its wording. With regard to the phrase &ldquo;Citizens of Ireland,&rdquo; there is no such thing as citizenship of Ireland.  There is citizenship of Saorstát Eireann.  I would urge the Seanad to be slow in adopting the sweeping terms of this amendment.</P>

    <P>I think the motion Senator Linehan brought forward is one which deserves <Col N="262" /> our very sincere support.

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think care should be taken before an amendment of this kind is passed.  In the first place some of the arguments of Senator Haughton seem to be arguments that suggest that there is reason to suppose that because we protect our own nationals, there is going to be immediately hostile action on the part of the English Government. I should conceive of the Commonwealth as a number of nations which protect their rights while at the same time there would be negotiations, and goodwill and give and take.  This Bill does not exclude any mutual agreements applicable to citizens of this country.  I think I am correct in stating that there is no such thing as citizenship of the British Commonwealth. If for the sake of argument we take a German under laws which we have yet to pass, and give him the rights of citizenship, and make him a citizen of the Free State, he will not be a citizen of England when he goes across to England.  If a person is admitted, as he might be, into citizenship in Canada are we, without examination, going to include that person as we would under this amendment, amongst persons suitable for our Civil Service, a body which must have the confidence of the whole country?  I am in favour of preference for Irish citizens which I think every man will admit is reasonable.  I am, further, in favour of mutual agreements being made with England and the other nations of the Commonwealth, but a sweeping amendment like this, passed here, it seems to me, would weaken our position in making suitable arrangements which we can make.  Instead of being an amendment made in confidence of our position in the Commonwealth, it would really represent a want of confidence.  I hope the Minister will make the position clear.  And I would also be glad if the Minister would say whether this Bill makes <Col N="263" /> obligatory that such competition would exclude some other arrangements with the other countries of the Commonwealth if it were found desirable.</P>

      <P>The amendment has been referred to as being far-reaching, and it does look a far-reaching condition to put in the Bill.  It practically limits competition to Irish people alone, and anyone who knows the number of Irishmen across the water and the splendid positions they fill there will, I think, admit that it would be a very dangerous thing to go forth that we are starting this new Government with more or less parochial ideas.  I am quite satisfied that Irishmen will be able to hold their own in their own country, but I should be very sorry to see the field closed to them on the other side.  We have many enemies there who will be only too glad to take hold of this Clause and use it to our very great detriment.  It has been quite a pleasure to me in the past, in travelling through England and Wales, to find men at the head of the medical, engineering and other professions from Ireland, and in most cases from the South of Ireland.  You have been striving to improve university education for all creeds and classes, and there is not a day in my life but young fellows are coming to me asking me to give them recommendations to firms across the water.  There is no room for all these in our country at present.  I may not see the day, but I hope it will come, when you will be able to cater for all. Meanwhile I think this is an exceedingly dangerous clause to insert.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot support this amendment, for reasons which have not been stated by others.  Let us consider where people would come from. Is it supposed that people who are not Irish, or of Irish descent, and who have no connection with Ireland, will come from South Africa, Australia and New Zealand?  I think it is not likely that they will, or that they will want to. They have positions of their own to get over there, and it is not likely that they will come to compete here.  Therefore, the people whom we are really concerned with are English.  England is <Col N="264" /> a very over-crowded country at present, with a million and a half of people unemployed, and as soon as opportunities arise in this country, which is not so thickly populated, they will be crowding over.  Really I think that English people have done pretty well in Ireland in the last seven hundred years.  They occupied all the land, all the positions in the Church, in the law, in business, and in everything else for the last seven hundred years, and really I think it is about time that the poor Irish people, who have been left out and excluded&mdash;forcibly excluded&mdash;from all these things, should have some little chance.  It is my idea and my wish, and the wish of everybody, to bring back as many Irish people as possible. As has already been said, there are Irish people who occupy high positions all over the world, and they are a great loss to Ireland.  I must say I have not so much sympathy for those who leave Ireland to earn their bread.  I have no objection to their doing so, but my interest is in the people who live in Ireland, who stop here and try to work and raise up the country as best they can.  I should like to collect all the best Irishmen from all parts of the world, if it were possible, to come over here to help in our professions and our Parliament.  But I would not like to see English people coming over.  We have had enough anglicisation for the last seven hundred years, and I am not anxious to see more.  If we could bring back the best Irishmen who have made good all over the world we would be rich indeed, and would have plenty of people to do our work for us.  At present we are not very well off in that respect.  I do not think reprisals are likely.  Ireland is different from other countries.  Ireland is not a cosmopolitan or an imperial country like England.  We have set up a new Government and it is time for us to try to provide positions for our own people instead of having them snapped up by Englishmen, who have always been trying to get in.  Plenty of English people have been coming along and there are people now who are wanting to get employment.  English people have come to me to try to get employment. Why they should come to me I do not <Col N="265" /> know, because I could not give employment to anybody, but they come to anybody that they can get hold of.  I do not want to see them in the country at all.  The less we see of them the better.  I think that the Government should try to protect and keep for the people of Ireland as many places as possible and not bring in all kinds of strangers and foreigners who can do very well in their own countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to get an interpretation of the clause as it stands before I can decide my attitude towards the amendment.  I take it that those who are born in Ireland, or of Irish parents, or who are children of such persons, are eligible.  Might I ask if the children of people who are born in Ireland, of Irish parents, and who go to England and bring up a family there are eligible to come over and compete under this clause?  I think, in the strict reading of it as it stands, that that is the interpretation.  The clause says:&mdash;&ldquo;Or who are citizens of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  If that were:&mdash;&ldquo;Who are children of such parents and who are citizens of Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; that would possibly be what is meant.  That, by the way.</P>
      <P>I do not think that any narrow view actuated the framers of that clause, because, surely it is due to us to narrow down the competition.  We have not had very exceptional educational advantages in our history, and we are now broadening the basis of education and allowing those who are not very fortunate in the way of worldly endowment to get an opportunity of exercising and developing their intellectual gifts.  Surely, at this stage of the formation of our nation, seeing that there is such an inclination on the part of those who are born here to go abroad when they reach the age of budding manhood or womanhood, we ought to see that we should keep them at home where possible.  I do not think that in any circumstances you will have very many people coming from abroad to compete at your examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think straining that argument is unnecessary. The effect, no matter whether you pass this amendment or not, will be just the same so far as candidates <Col N="266" /> sitting for examination are concerned. I can foresee the time when Ireland will offer such opportunities to people in New Zealand or Australia to leave their own homes and families and interests and come to Ireland to sit for a Civil Service examination.  I hope the time will come, but I do not think it will be within the lifetime of any of us here.  If that is the interpretation of the Bill as it stands, then I think it is sufficiently wide, and I will oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>One must view this amendment from two points of view.  I think the attitude suggested by Senator O'Farrell, in which he said: &ldquo;Are we convinced that reciprocity exists&rdquo; has not, so far, been cleared up.  I sympathise thoroughly with the mover of this amendment, and I quite agree we have had advantages from being allowed to enter the Civil Service in other countries. Is it not wiser for us in our infancy to adopt the policy of <i>festina lente</i>, make haste slowly, and consider whether this Bill as it stands leaves us room to argue that?  The English nation recently considered the big question of tariffs.  Tariffs are used by nations for reciprocal agreements, and the only thing we have to consider is whether we, an infant State, with education, as has been suggested, in a rather puerile condition, are to open all our examinations to other countries, the whole Commonwealth of Nations, without being satisfied that their examinations are also open to our people?  If we did so we would be adopting an unwise course. Under the circumstances I think it is wiser not to pass the amendment.  There is nothing to prevent the Government from bringing in an amending Bill at any moment, if satisfied it is wise to do so, and if the reciprocity, which Senator O'Farrell feels has not so far been extended to us, has been extended to us. On that account I will vote against the amendment.</P>

      <P>I rise to oppose the amendment.  When this Bill was being drafted, the first proposal was to confine the Civil Service to citizens of Saorstát Eireann and their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Afterwards it was thought wiser to extend that a little, in view of the partition of the country, which we hope will <Col N="267" /> end in our time; in view of the fact that we have an indeterminate boundary; and that we have many of our people on the other side of the boundary, who, we hope, will be in the Saorstát when the boundary is determined.  We thought it desirable to alter it to its present form, which simply confines the Civil Service to citizens of Saorstát Eireann and their children.  I think we should look at this from the point of view of doing the best here in the matter of administration, and confidence in the administration and of harmony between the machine of Government and the people.  The talk of reprisals and retaliation on the part of the British Government or Dominions, at any rate on the part of the British Government, seems to me to be utterly without cause.  They have their own problems and their own reasons for their arrangements. Anybody, whether he is a Zulu, Hindoo, or Eskimo, if a British subject, can go into the British Civil Service. The conditions we have to face in Ireland are nothing like the circumstances the British Government has to face. Great Britain is an Imperial power, which we are not, and it has very good reasons for allowing everybody who has the status of a British subject to compete in its Civil Service examinations. It would be very destructive of its Imperial interests if it did not allow them to compete.  There is no such thing as what you might call British citizenship, as apart from the status of British subject.  We here have adopted a form of citizenship.  We do not allow a man to vote here simply because he is a citizen of one of the Commonwealth of Nations, or because he is a British subject from India or elsewhere.  He only votes here when he is a citizen of the Irish Free State.  It would be quite reasonable and proper in my mind to restrict our services to citizens of the Free State.  We must not lose sight of the extreme importance of the Civil Service in administration and legislation, even although it does not come directly into legislation, but we know the influence the Civil Service will always exert on legislation.  It exercises a very great influence on administration. It is most desirable that our Civil <Col N="268" /> Servants should be people whose interests and whose roots are in this country.</P>
    <P>I remember speaking to one or two people about the time of the split, when the Treaty came along.  We had a few English people in the Sinn Fein movement who had no roots in the country, and who took the most violently Republican attitude.  I remember likening some of them to one of the women who came before Solomon in the dispute about the child.  When it was proposed the child should be cut in two to divide, the real mother said: &ldquo;Let the other one have it.&rdquo;  The person who was not the mother was willing to have the child divided.  I had an example of the doctrinaire point of view that people who have no roots or interests in this country will sometimes take up when extreme differences arise. I think it is most desirable that in our Civil Service we should have people whose interests are here, who look at everything from an Irish point of view, and who are in touch with the ordinary people of the country, so that there may be harmony and sympathy between the administration in every branch and the ordinary citizens.  I think that is what we have to look to in determining the people who are to go into the Civil Service. The British Government have other things to look to, and will continue to look to them, and I venture to prophesy there is not the slightest risk of any exclusion of Irishmen from the British Civil Service.  I do not think anyone here who looks into it will believe that there is a risk that the British Government, if we pass this clause in the form in which it stands, will exclude Irishmen from the British Civil Service.  I do not think that the amendment to the clause would make a great deal of difference, because our Constitution prescribes that Irish is the national language of this country, while English is equally the official language.  It certainly must be anticipated that, as time goes on, people who have no knowledge of the Irish language will be considerably handicapped in competition at examinations for our Civil Service. I believe the very fact of the position that has been given to the Irish language <Col N="269" /> will automatically mean that the Civil Service of the Free State will not be particularly attractive to people from outside it.  I do not think that in actual practice a great deal of difference will come, but I think it is well to lay down that in all circumstances we are going to have people in our Civil Service, just as we would have them in our Seanad and Dáil, who are interested in the country, and who have some tie binding their citizenship, or some hereditary tie linking them up with this country and its interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say with regard to the few remarks made by the Minister that they have absolutely convinced me that I ought to vote for this amendment, and especially for this reason.  After all, it is a question of the balance of advantage to Ireland.  Ireland is a very small place; the Saorstát is smaller still, and I fancy that all that is proposed to give away is to open up the Civil Service of the Saorstát of Ireland to other candidates, and that is a very small matter.  We neither give salaries likely to attract people nor give them any other great advantage. I fancy there are very few people from England likely to avail of the advantage to be derived from our Civil Service. On the other hand, there are a great many Irishmen who gain their livelihood in the British Empire, not only in the British Civil Service, but in private companies and from private individuals. We all remember the time when notices used to appear in England, &ldquo;No Irish need apply.&rdquo;  I feel certain that if we in this, one of the first Acts of this Parliament, make a provision limiting the Civil Service to people of Irish parentage, we will be met by reprisals from the other side, and that not only will the cry, &ldquo;No Irish need apply&rdquo; be put in force again, but it will be put in force with far greater venom than before.  The Minister said that the British Civil Service is open to everyone who is a citizen of the British Empire, whether he be a Zulu or an Esquimo.  He said no matter what they did they would be allowed to compete.  That I doubt.  If Zulus or Esquimos, excluded from office Englishmen in their country, then I <Col N="270" /> fancy reprisals would very soon take place.  The balance of advantage to be derived by this very small country in comparison with the risks in eliminating this would be so much to our advantage that I strongly urge the Seanad to pass it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>Section 4, Sub-section (4).  To delete all after the word &ldquo;if&rdquo; in line 53 up to and including the word &ldquo;resolutions&rdquo; in line 56 and to substitute therefor the words:&mdash;&ldquo;either of such Houses shall, within the next twenty-one days on which either House has sat, after such regulation is laid before the Houses, pass a resolution.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Section as it stands provides that any regulation made by the Commissioners should be laid on the tables of both Houses, and, if approved by one House only, shall operate.  In other words, the Seanad may pass a resolution, disapproving of the regulations issued by the Commissioners, but, unless the Dáil passes a similar resolution, the regulation stands.  In the reverse direction, if the Dáil passes a <Col N="271" /> resolution proceeding to annul regulations, and this House does not, the regulation likewise stands.  The only effect is that the Commissioners are practically autocrats unless they can get unanimity between the two Houses. When this matter was up the other day, the Minister defended the clause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of personal explanation, may I say that there was no discussion of this Section in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it was Section 9, on which the same principle arises?  He defended it principally on the ground that these regulations would mainly affect money matters, but there will be regulations other than money matters, upon which the Seanad would have a right to make recommendations. Now, if you take up another very important Bill&mdash;the Courts of Justice Bill&mdash;we find that, under Section 97, the rules of the court must be laid before both Houses, and if either passes a resolution seeking to annul the regulations, the regulation falls.  If that is the case with regard to rules of the courts, there does not seem to be any strong reason why the same regulation should not govern the rules in regard to recruitment for the Civil Service.  Naturally as the Minister is responsible to the Dáil, the decision of that House will, in most cases, prevail, and the result is that this House would be completely smothered in regard to these regulations.  If the Seanad thinks that is a desirable state of affairs, it will defeat the amendment, but if it considers the resolution of any House should be sufficient to cause the withdrawal of the regulations made by the Commissioners, then those who have at heart the dignity of the State and the efficiency of the Civil Service, must vote for the amendment.</P>

I think the House would come to the conclusion that these motions should be held over until all the facts are in the possession of the House.  I do not intend to give them until the motions are reached, but if the information was given, I think Senators would see the wisdom of holding them over until after the Christmas recess.  There are still a number of amendments on the Paper to the Civil Service Regulation Bill, and I think when we get these disposed of we should then be in a position to adjourn over Christmas.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Senators Col.

That Committee did send in an interim report, and there was then appointed a Committee consisting of your Chairman, An Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil, and the Minister for Finance, to go into the whole question of the staffs and to determine which were to be the common staffs of the two Houses.  We have prepared <Col N="273" /> a report which will be finally settled this week, and until that comes up before the Seanad I do not think it would even be in order to discuss the matters contained in the motions of Senators Moore and Keane.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out, as regards this provision of laying rules before the Oireachtas and the <Col N="274" /> annulling of them, that in the case of the majority of the Bills which have been passed so far, it was provided that the resolution must be passed by each House, or both.  That was done in the case of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, the Local Authorities Extension of Time Act, the Electoral Act, the Censorship of Films Act, the Army Pensions Act, and the Damage to Property Act.  In the case of the Courts of Justice Bill, it is provided that before a regulation is made it may be annulled by the resolution of one House.  It seems to me as regards this particular matter, that the provision as it stands should be allowed to remain.  The regulation deals only with the matter of confining a particular examination to a special class of candidate.  For instance, recent examinations were held for certain minor posts in the Customs and Excise, and in view of the fact that 20,000 men have been demobilised from the army, and that 10,000 more are due to be demobilised in the next few months it was thought desirable and proper to confine that examination&mdash;which was a competitive examination for which a large number of men entered&mdash;to men who had served in the National Army, and hence a special regulation was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This clause simply deals with the making of such special regulations.  It seems to me that these are matters practically of administration, and matters where it is not desirable to hold up the making of appointments or the holding of examinations unless you can get a resolution of the two Houses agreeing to the making of such regulations.  The regulation does not affect the ordinary citizen at all, in the way, for instance, that the regulations dealing with the Rules of Court would affect him.  The regulation is not legislative; it is not legislating by regulation, but simply the carrying out of certain acts of administration, and providing for the ordinary work of Government machinery by regulation.  It is not a matter that in any way affects the rights or the liberty of the subject or anything of that nature.  If you provide that one House may annul such a regulation, you then provide the possibility of a deadlock.  For instance, <Col N="275" /> in a matter like this: Suppose it happened that the Government, with the support of the Dáil, felt it absolutely necessary, in the circumstances of the country, to confine these examinations to men who had served in the National Army, and supposing that, for some reason which might appear good to a majority of the Seanad, they decided to annul such a regulation, there would be no way out of the impasse.  We would require to promote a new Bill; it would not even be a matter of allowing a certain time to elapse, but a new Bill would have to be provided.</P>
    <P>Under a regulation of this sort it seems to me there can be no particular abuse.  It will never be a popular thing to prevent a certain number of people from competing, and even with these competitive examinations you cannot ensure that any particular candidate will get an appointment.  It is not a matter that can lead to any serious abuse, and it is not desirable that there should be any possibility of a deadlock which might be created by the adoption of this amendment.  There is no doubt that if the Dáil passes or rejects an amendment, and it is the Dáil that is principally concerned with administration, the Minister responsible to it will almost certainly have to give way.  He will have to give way, unless it is simply a chance or a snatch vote. In the case of legislation by regulation or by order, it is a different matter altogether. I submit that this is purely a matter of administrative detail and one in which no abuse can arise, and that the Seanad ought not to make an amendment that would provide the possibility of a deadlock arising.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say that the arguments of the Minister are pretty familiar.  We have heard them before, at least half a dozen times, in regard to similar amendments.  The net result of his arguments is this that the Seanad may pass as many resolutions as it pleases seeking to annul a <Col N="276" /> regulation, no matter how that regulation may encroach on the rights of competition in the matter of recruitment to the Civil Service, but unless the Dáil passes a similar resolution the result is that the resolutions passed by the Seanad are so much waste paper. The Minister has painted for us a terrible picture as to what might happen in regard to a deadlock if a resolution were annulled; but he has slided over what should be a far more serious deadlock, and that is, if a resolution passed by this or the other House should annul any of the rules of Court, how would the deadlock in that case be overcome?  I desire to ask if it would mean the introduction of a new Bill or the withdrawing of regulations already issued, or would it mean that fresh regulations would have to be made to meet such a position.  There is no use, I suggest, in putting this bogey man before us, and telling us that if you annul the regulations of the Commissioners you are going to pull down the pillars of the State.  The Seanad has to say whether it shall have any effective voice in regard to regulations of this kind or not.</P>
