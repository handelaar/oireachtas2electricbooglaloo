      <P>The first business on the Order Paper is the election of Cathaoirleach.  In accordance with our Standing Orders, it is necessary that I should vacate the Chair, and that the Seanad should appoint one of their own body to act as Chairman for the purpose of this particular election.</P>

      <P>I had the honour twelve months ago of proposing the name of Lord Glenavy for the Chairmanship of the Seanad.  I did so, first, because I considered him the one man whose judicial qualities and powers of decision pre-eminently fitted him for the position, secondly, because I felt that the most prudent step that this Seanad could take in embarking on its new career both for itself and the country was to obliterate all old political landmarks, and to let those who had formerly been the <Col N="170" /> minority in this country see that we regarded them only as brother Irishmen, and that we were willing and ready to invite them to places of honour and influence, requiring only one test, namely, that of ability and efficiency.  I am aware that this attitude has been criticised.  It has been severely criticised by people who claim to be great Nationalists and Republicans. But my answer to this criticism is that in carrying out this policy we are carrying out the aim of that great Nationalist, that great martyr of Irish liberty, and that great Republican, Wolfe Tone, who proclaimed that his aim was to unite the whole people of Ireland, to abolish all memory of past dissensions and to substitute the common name of Irishman in place of the denominations of Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in furtherance of that aim, I am to-day again nominating Lord Glenavy as the Chairman of the Seanad.  In asking the Seanad to reelect him, I feel that I am asking them to take a step that is in the interest of true patriotism and of true wisdom. Of his Chairmanship during the past twelve months I will only say&mdash;without reflecting on any person in this Assembly&mdash;that no other Senator could have conducted the business with such expedition or presided over our deliberations with more tact.  Although I spoke on the last occasion of the effect it would have on Ulster, I know that that effect to-day is not very apparent. Still, the outlook and the prospect of reunion with Ulster is a great deal brighter to-day than it was twelve months ago, and I hope when twelve months have passed again that the varied tints of the classes and creeds and sections that go to make up the Irish nation may be united to form one arch of peace.  I formally move the reelection of Lord Glenavy.</P>

      <P>I feel very greatly honoured by the renewal of the confidence that was reposed in me in December of last year, and by my election then as the first Chairman of the Seanad of the Irish Free State. That honour has been enhanced to-day by the gracious and generous terms in which the Senators who have spoken have supported the resolution and by the unanimous vote with which it was adopted.  I can honestly say this much, at least for myself, in their justification, that I have done my best, and shall continue to do my best so to interpret the Orders and Rules which have been passed for my guidance as to secure for every Senator the fullest freedom of speech and to maintain and uphold the powers and privileges of the Seanad.  If, during the last twelve months I have achieved any measure of success in this respect, it has been largely due to the indulgence and consideration that I received in every quarter of the Seanad, and not, least of all, to the constant and loyal cooperation of the Deputy-Chairman, whose talent for organisation and great business capacity were always at my disposal, particularly in the early months of the year, when we were confronted with the novel and difficult task of setting the machinery of this Seanad in motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the very outset, its existence was seriously menaced by that section of our people who tried to strangle the Free State, and who, as a means to this end, singled out for attack many members of the Seanad, whose only crime it was, that they loyally and unreservedly acquiesced in the declaration of the people's will as embodied in the Constitution, and cast in their lot with the majority of their countrymen by accepting the invitation of the Government to become members of the Seanad.  The victory of the Free State has been obtained at tragic cost, not merely in the crushing burdens of compensation, which will cripple for years to come the finances of our country, <Col N="172" /> but in the loss on both sides of many valuable lives, at a time when Ireland needed the help of all her sons.  But these sacrifices have not been in vain, if they have at last, and finally, convinced our people of the folly of seeking the political conversion of their brother Irishmen by the means of the bullet and the bomb.  A nation cannot recruit its population from its cemeteries; it cannot raise revenue from ruins, nor can the country's credit and its confidence rise like a phoenix from its ashes from the ravages of robbery and rapine.  For myself, my belief in the future of the Free State rests in the hope that Irishmen of all shades of thought will, at a very early date, be permitted and be prepared to advocate their views upon constitutional lines, taking their places in our native Parliament and uniting in a common effort for the reconstruction of our country, so that in a saner and more peaceful atmosphere we may yet attain to the poet's ideal, &ldquo;When none was for a Party, but all were for the State.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Before I call the next business on the Orders of the Day, I want to ask, so that Senators might consider the matter amongst themselves, as it is one in which their own convenience should be consulted, what they would like to do with regard to Bills that might be available between this and the adjournment over the Christmas recess.  The business of the Orders of the Day, though lengthy, is not likely to be protracted, because, perhaps with one exception, the Bills are all non-contentious and of a purely formal character.  I think there is no doubt that we will be able to dispose of the business on to-day's Orders of the Day this afternoon.  The Dáil, I understand, after this week, are adjourning until the 15th January next, but the Judiciary Bill, perhaps the most important Bill that the Seanad will have to deal with, is through the Dáil, and is now ready to be received in the Seanad.  I want Senators to consider and determine this amongst themselves, as it is probable it will not be very convenient, at any rate for some of them, to attend here next week, <Col N="173" /> which is the week immediately before Christmas.  What occurred to me was that perhaps they might wish to take the Second Reading of the Judiciary Bill on Friday next.  I think it would be too soon to ask them to take it tomorrow, as they would only get the Bill in its complete state to-day.  The alternative to taking that Bill on Friday would be to take it next week or to hold it over until we re-assemble after the Christmas recess.  There will be no other business available for us until after the adjournment for Christmas, except a non-contentious Bill, the Expiring Laws Bill, which must be passed before we adjourn for Christmas. Perhaps we will be in a position to dispose of that Bill on Friday next. If the Seanad preferred to take the Second Reading of the Judiciary Bill on Friday, rather than assemble next week, or to hold it over until after the Christmas recess, there will be ample time during the discussions of the business for Senators to consider the matter, and I will gladly give effect to whatever is the view of the greater number.</P>

      <P>Now, sir, that you have been elected unanimously by the Seanad to occupy the position of Chairman, it falls to me to propose the election of a Deputy-Chairman, and I beg to propose the name of Senator Douglas.  He has helped our Chairman in many ways, and the least of his duties has been to preside at our Senate.  In the late troublous times he never hesitated to go out to Glenavy at all times and at all seasons to consult with our Chairman.  Those were dangerous times, and nobody knows it better than our Chairman and Senator Douglas.  You have heard from our Chairman that he considers Mr. Douglas a good business man and quite capable of carrying out the duties of Deputy-Chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was present the other day at a Committee called for the purpose of deciding whether our Parliament was to enter the inter-Parliamentary Union.  Senator Douglas, I am sorry to say, was the only Deputy who attended <Col N="174" /> at Copenhagen.  I must point out to the Seanad that this was the first time that Ireland was represented at an inter-Parliamentary Conference as a Free State.  At that Committee Senator Douglas made a very interesting statement.  He had a difficult task to perform, but he upheld his country with dignity and, I may say, with common-sense in every possible way.  Our status as a Free State was respected by all nations assembled at Copenhagen. We have to thank, and I say it without contradiction, Senator Douglas for doing that.  In conclusion, I wish to say that I thank, and I am sure every Senator will agree with me, Senator Douglas for what he has done. Our Chairman has told us that he would make a very good Deputy Chairman, and I therefore beg to move that he be re-elected to that position.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the motion, and I wish to confirm what Senator the Earl of Mayo has stated to the effect that Senator Douglas's chief work for the Seanad has been away from the limelight, that he has gone to very considerable trouble and personal expense in building up Standing Orders, both in regard to ordinary business and to Private Bill legislation. There is one important factor which should not be overlooked, and it is this, that under the Standing Orders governing Private Bill legislation these Bills will be initiated in the Seanad, and the Deputy-Chairman is to preside at the Committee and over the work in connection with that part of legislation. It will require a man fully conversant with the very voluminous and intricate Standing Orders to discharge that duty efficiently.  Personally, while not overlooking the qualifications of other members of the Seanad, I venture to say that there is hardly any Senator more fitted than he to discharge that duty.  I hope we will recognise his past services, and in justice to ourselves and in justice to the efficient working of the Seanad, we will re-elect him unanimously.</P>

      <P>It is not necessary for me, I think, to add anything, except briefly to state my appreciation of the honour which has been again conferred upon me.  You, sir, stated that you had done your best.  I cannot claim that my best was a great deal, but I can honestly claim that my best, such as it was, was given to the work entrusted to me.  I cannot claim any great qualifications, but I will say this: I believed whole-heartedly in the Treaty.  I still believe whole-heartedly in it, and I believe that this Seanad is intended to take a useful, important and invaluable place in the life of this nation, and it is my desire to endeavour, whether I hold office or whether I do not, to try and maintain the position and dignity of the Seanad and to help it to fulfil the place which in the Constitution it was intended to fulfil.  I did not seek the position at the beginning, and I did not again seek it, but I allowed my name to go forward, because so many Senators, whose character and ability I respect, pressed me to do so.  I should like to thank all members of the Seanad. While I am quite conscious that in many ways I have not satisfied the requirements of the office, I feel deeply grateful for the honour of being elected to this position unanimously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to inform the <Col N="176" /> Seanad that I have the honour of nominating Mr. Samuel L. Brown, K.C., for the vacancy created by Sir Horace Plunkett's retirement&mdash;a retirement which we all regret.  In considering who should follow him in his seat on the Seanad, for some considerable time a good many of us have been looking at the serious difficulty in which we were placed in the Seanad from having no one with legal training or special legal knowledge amongst our Senators.</P>
      <P>In every case where any question of law came forward we had only our Chairman to appeal to, and we have known cases with which it was very difficult for the Chairman in his position to deal.  To have a barrister of great experience and great mental capacity in every way amongst our members appeared to us as one of the objects which the Seanad should undoubtedly be pleased to carry out. Those of us who feel that we represent the same class of interest that Sir Horace Plunkett did know that we are doing not only good for ourselves by getting him amongst our number to consult with, but that his name and ability are of such supreme and outstanding importance and known to every Irishman, we are really conferring not only a benefit upon ourselves, but upon the Seanad by proposing him and bringing him forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think anyone here who has anything to do with business affairs knows the standing of Mr. Brown.  He has been a K.C. of many years' standing. He is at present in the full swing of his practice, and it may be well to let the Seanad know, as probably they ought to know, the chances they have of getting the services of Mr. Brown if we elect him.  It happens that Mr. Brown is considering the giving up of a good deal of his practice.  He has now done many years of hard work, and he thinks it is time that he was not at the beck and call of every man. So he intends to draw back from his active practice, and when speaking to him on the subject he told me that he felt that if the Seanad concluded that what talents he had, what knowledge and experience he had, were useful to them, he would like to be a member and devote those talents to the work <Col N="177" /> of the State, and that he would give any portion of his time and ability which the Seanad required.  He is in his full health in every way, and, therefore, I think, and I have no hesitation in saying that as far as filling the needs of the Seanad and giving us a man of great capacity with an immense knowledge of Ireland and its needs, we cannot do better than elect Mr. Brown.  I wonder if the Seanad would excuse me for a minute in dealing with another matter which hangs upon this more or less?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to intervene. I do not know the nature of Senator Jameson's application.  I am afraid if the supporters of each candidate get up and make speeches, and enlarge on the qualifications of each candidate, we will take up a considerable amount of time and bring the level of this Seanad down to that of a Board of Guardians or County Council.  I earnestly suggest that we rely upon the information contained in the regulations sent out by the Seanad itself and on our own personal information as to what candidates we should vote for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because of our experience in the past that I am making those remarks.  Hitherto, vacancies that have occurred in the Seanad have been dealt with as he says.  There has been only one candidate proposed representative of the section to which the retiring member belonged.  No other candidate has been put forward, and we have acquiesced in the proposal at once.  The reason I am taking this unusual proceeding is that we have departed in this instance from that practice, and what I was going to say is endorsed by the Senator, and I think he will agree with it by the time I have closed.  I happened to be personally engaged in the arrangements made for the establishment of the Seanad.  I happened to be one of those who discussed the whole matter with President Griffith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going back into a little bit of history, which perhaps the Seanad may have forgotten, when the Treaty was being discussed in London, some of us met Mr. Griffith, and we arranged with him, and obtained his agreement to, <Col N="178" /> certain proposals concerned with the establishment of the Seanad and various other matters.  After the Treaty this was carried further, and a few of us, representing different interests from Mr. Griffith, met in Committee in London.  We met Mr. Griffith and Mr. O'Higgins, and, with Mr. Winston Churchill in the chair, we carried out those arrangements connected with the establishment of the Seanad.  I think Mr. O'Higgins&mdash;I see he is here&mdash;will agree with me that both sides put their heads together to design the most useful class of Seanad, and agreed that it was to be an assembly in which minorities are to be represented, and most carefully was it decided how many there were to be, how many representative of different interests.  Unfortunately, the carrying out of this did not fall into Mr. Griffith's hands.  President Cosgrave, when he took up the burden of President, carried out loyally every arrangement which Mr. Griffith and Mr. O'Higgins made with us.</P>
    <P>That was in November of last year, and, knowing what was coming on to-day, and seeing how the Seanad themselves appeared to be departing from the arrangements then made, I thought it might be wise to-day to consider a bit of that history.  I happen to have here a list which President Cosgrave did me the honour in going through in making his nominations to the Seanad It is the nominated parties I am now discussing.  This is a confidential document, and, therefore, I cannot show it. In it every consideration was given to the various interests which this Seanad was supposed to be representative of, and which were put here because they could not be put into the Dáil.</P>
    <P>And yet both Mr. Griffith and President Cosgrave believed that it was essential at the beginning of the Free State that these minority interests should be properly represented.  I only refer to these things because hitherto the Seanad recognised them, but if we depart from that now, and if a member of any one of these sections who were appointed in that way retired, and if no attention was paid to the opinions of his colleagues as to who should succeed him, if, whenever a vacancy <Col N="179" /> occurs, four or five, or any number of candidates are to be put forward, quite regardless of what section or interests the retiring member represented, it is quite within the power of the Seanad to wipe out all small sections within a very short time and do away with the whole scheme long before the country has any voice in the matter.</P>
    <P>We all know the sections that are represented.  Take Mr. O'Farrell's own section; there is not the vestige of a doubt that if the Seanad chose to put it to a vote they could wipe out the Labour representation.  The Seanad could wipe out any of us who represent the business and land-holding interests The same thing applies to the farming interests, and it seems to me that by bringing forward candidates of this sort who have not got the approval of the section to which the retiring candidate belongs, we are doing away with the very principle upon which the Seanad itself was constructed by Mr. Griffith and President Cosgrave, and which was agreed amongst us all in very long and difficult negotiations as the wisest arrangement.  I am merely mentioning this matter of history now because this is the first time in which that rule has been questioned.</P>
    <P>It is not a rule; the Seanad can break it if it likes, but I would say this, that I think the Seanad would be better advised if they followed on the lines laid down by Mr. Griffith and President Cosgrave, and allowed the fellow-members of the member who represented any particular interest to be the persons to bring a candidate before the House.  It is always open to the House, if any objectionable person were brought forward, to raise objections, but I think that it ought to be a necessary qualification for any candidate that he should have the approval of those who sit on the same benches as the retiring candidate.  I trust the House will excuse me for saying this, but I think that Senator O'Farrell will see that I am pointing as much as possible along the same line as he is, and that I believe if what I suggest is adopted there will be no further infliction on the Seanad such as this of mine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.W. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I deprecate very much, indeed, eulogies of any particular candidate, and in this case I think the suggestion of Senator Jameson is that Sir Horace Plunkett belonged to a particular section which, for historical accuracy, we will call the Southern Unionists.  Sir Horace Plunkett, to my mind, represented here the great agricultural movement, the great co-operative movement, the great movement of establishing technical instruction, and all the great movements of that nature, and to revive our knowledge of history I would point out that Sir Horace Plunkett, with a very few others, some here, and of whom I happen to be one, launched forth the Irish Dominion League, which had not the approval of any narrow or of any particular section in this House.  He was its founder, and one of his great objects and one of the things to which he devoted a long period of his life was the bringing to fruition such a programme as was adumbrated in the Irish Dominion League.  I regret having to mention these facts, but when I think that Sir Horace Plunkett, to my mind, tried to stand aloof from all sections and from all parties where he thought the good of his country required it, I do not like to hear him put into a compartment as the representative of any particular section, excepting the section which represented Irish agriculture, Irish agricultural development and Irish agricultural interests.</P>

      <P>No, it is a nomination.  Senator Jameson spoke to me on this question shortly before we met to-day as to whether he would be in order in making any statement on the nomination of any particular candidate.  I was not myself quite satisfied that it was desirable that that should be done, but, at the same time, I was not in a position to say it was contrary to any of our Standing Orders, and if for the future the Seanad considers that it is not desirable that different candidates should have their merits proclaimed by their nominators, it would be necessary to frame an additional Standing Order for the purpose. But as our Standing Orders at present exist, I could not see my way to rule Senator Jameson out of order.</P>

      <P>I think the very interesting statement that Senator Jameson has made will remind many of us, myself included, of the obligations which we owe to the parties to which we respectively belong.  It was the failure to recognise and to remember that obligation that has led me into somewhat of a difficulty, for in standing up, as you may suppose, to nominate Mr. Gill, I feel bound, after what Senator Jameson brought forward and called my attention to yesterday, to announce that I am not prepared to support his candidature.  It was the failure to recognise that that has led me into this difficulty, and the moment it was pointed out to me in the Seanad that at this early stage of our existence, to interfere with the balance of parties, which, for the protection of different minorities was laid down by the Constitution, was undesirable, I placed myself unreservedly in Mr. Gill's hands, to abide by whatever decision he might arrive at.  I saw him yesterday, and pointed out the difficulty I was placed in, and that by apparently going behind the back of the Party in whose interests I was acting, I was really acting <i>ultra vires</i> in submitting the name of a gentleman who, whatever his qualifications might be, could not be said to represent that minority, and, as I said, I was going behind the back of my own Party.  I had no intention whatever of doing anything of the kind, but in the circumstances <Col N="182" /> I put myself into Mr. Gill's hands, and, with your permission, I will read his reply.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In view of the new factor you have learned of this afternoon, and of which I, too, had been previously unaware&mdash;viz., the understanding as to a quota of the nominated seats in the Senate being for the present regarded as allotted to the Southern Unionists, and Sir Horace Plunkett's seat being reckoned as one of these &mdash;I can see the difficulty thus involved for you in proposing a man who does not belong to that party or class description, should your friends insist on that line of selection. I would not think of leaving you under such an obligation in the circumstances, and I desire you to be perfectly free not to propose my name, and Sir Nugent to be equally free as regards seconding it.  I am grateful to you both, with whom I have had long association in public work, for your esteem and for the honour you have done me in wishing and moving to have me with you on the Senate.</P>
      <P Just="Right">&ldquo;Yours sincerely,</P>
      <P Just="Right">&ldquo;T.P. GILL.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circumstances connected with Mr. Gill's candidature are of such an exceptional character that I would ask the indulgence of the House, in spite of what Senator O'Farrell has said, and in justice to Mr. Gill and myself, to make a short statement.  The first intimation that I, or, as I understand, any member of the Seanad, had of any desire on the part of Mr. Gill to come forward in Sir Horace Plunkett's place was last Tuesday week, when Mr. Gill and I happened to be fellow-travellers from London to Holyhead.  In the course of conversation Mr. Gill told me of his desire to be of some service, if he could, to the country, and before venturing to stand in Sir Horace Plunkett's place he had been over to London and had consulted him.  He did not like to come to any decision without his approval.  Sir Horace Plunkett welcomed the idea and wished him success. Under these circumstances, and <Col N="183" /> believing from Mr. Gill's long services on behalf of Ireland, his association with Sir Horace Plunkett in founding the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, his support of his policy for bringing men of all creeds and parties together to work in the good of their common country, and his long connection with the Department of Agriculture, left no doubt in my mind that if we could secure his services the Seanad would gain in importance and dignity.</P>
    <P>Therefore I had no hesitation in being his sponsor.  It was only on my return to Ireland yesterday morning that I learned for the first time my action was questioned, and that, as I said before, I had done something that was perhaps not quite straightforward, but I think no one would consider that I had done it with intention.  I placed myself in Mr. Gill's hands, and he met me in the most frank and generous manner, and you have heard his letter.  Personally, I very much regret that this untoward development has deprived us of the services of Mr. Gill.  I think if his nomination had gone forward he would have received a large measure of support.  I can assure you, and I do so with all sincerity, that if there is a vacancy in the future for which he would be eligible, I should be only too glad to do all I can to support his candidature in any way he thinks fit.  I beg to withdraw Mr. Gill's name.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeNesbitt" hpid="Mr. NESBITT Mr. NESBITT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NESBITT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am the nominator of Mr. Denis McCullough for the Senatorship. I cannot agree with the points of view put forward by Senator Jameson, and agreed to by Senator Hutcheson-Poë, that the vacancy should be filled by Mr. Brown.  Senator Sir Hutcheson- Poë said that when Mr. Gill spoke to Sir Horace Plunkett in London he wished Mr. Gill success.  Does not that imply that his cloak would envelop the figure of Mr. Gill admirably?  I cannot see how we are going to carry on in water-tight compartments, as suggested by Senator Jameson.  I agree certainly with a great deal of what he said as to having representation in this House, which representation might not take place in the Lower House, but there is one class of representation you <Col N="184" /> have not in the Seanad, and that is representation from the North.  The North is a question, I submit, which, if settled, would automatically settle a lot of the difficulties of this country.  Mr. McCullough is a gentleman whom I have known for a great many years. He is a man of business instincts and experience.</P>
      <P>He knows the Northern question thoroughly.  He has suffered very much for his country, and he has suffered&mdash; what many of us anticipated ourselves &mdash;in his own person and property.  I have had business connection with him for the past twelve months or so, on a Committee discussing ways and means, and I was very much struck with his way of handling finance and the clear methods with which he transacted insurance business, and he is a man with an economic outlook, which my friend, Senator Sir John Keane, would very much appreciate.  I am sure he would be a great backing up to Sir John Keane in his economic programme.  I do not think any party in the Seanad would suffer by the presence of Mr. McCullough, because, notwithstanding his ideas on the national point of view, he is a man of large mind, and in spite of all he has suffered he has nothing but charity in his heart.</P>

      <P>The name of Mr. Gill having been withdrawn, there are now three candidates before the Seanad, and under our Standing Orders a vote will now be taken by ballot, and on this vote each Senator is free to record his vote for not more than two out of the three.  He may only vote for one if he wishes, but he cannot vote for more than two out of the three. The object of this ballot is to bring down the number of candidates from three to two.</P>

      <P>I feel constrained to say a few words, because I am in the rather anomalous position of having supported a candidate, and while agreeing with Senator Jameson thoroughly in all he said, I do not intend to misinterpret him.  At the same time, it is difficult to explain my position in having nominated another candidate without throwing a wet blanket on the candidate himself.  When the vacancy took <Col N="185" /> place by the retirement of Sir Horace Plunkett, there was nobody in the field. There was a proposal to nominate a gentleman who subsequently withdrew. It was then I proposed the Marquis MacSwiney, because I thought by so doing I would not imperil in any way the dignity of the Seanad, and at the same time we would have the advantage of his knowledge of European affairs if we wish to be represented at the League of Nations.</P>
      <P>As regards the point which Senator Jameson made, with which I agree, the only difficulty is, how is one to define accurately the Party compartment in this Seanad.  Sir Horace Plunkett, we recognise, represented a certain interest and a very varied one.  I am of opinion that there is less difference between Marquis MacSwiney and Sir Horace Plunkett than there is between Mr. Brown and Sir Horace Plunkett.  While I do not go as far as the French Republicans in the opposition they showed to Barristers at the time of the Revolution, I think, Sir, you are adequate to give us any legal advice we may require. While I explain that I am very far from wishing to be taken in any way as opposing Senator Jameson&mdash;he is the last man whom I would wish to oppose&mdash;I want to make this explanation, without throwing a shadow on my nominee, that I think he is not too averse to the interests which Mr. Brown could be elected to represent.  This is merely a personal explanation.</P>

      <P>The Minister should be here to explain why the elections should be postponed.  I did not object to the Second Reading of the Registration Bill.  The two Bills, the Postponement and the Registration Bills, are more or less interlocked. The object of the postponement is apparently to give time for the Registration Bill to be passed.  The object is to revise the register so that no persons be on the list of Local Government Electors who are not qualified to be on it and who are not contributing to the rates and expenditure of the local bodies.  According to this Registration Bill I do not see any change of any importance whatever in the status of the local government elector.  I am sorry it has omitted to make any provision for the exclusion of persons on the local government register who failed to pay their rates.  According to the law at the present time the man who pays no rates has just as much voice in the expenditure of the money of the county as the man who pays. Perhaps the Minister would give some explanation to satisfy the Seanad why <Col N="188" /> the postponement has taken place and also what the object of this Bill is.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Senator has a clear idea of what the object of this Bill is.  It is not quite true to say that one Bill is dependent on the other.  The object of the Postponement Bill is, first of all, if such a Bill is not introduced we will have an election on the 1st January.  I do not think that would suit any Party. Another reason is that, as he has stated, the new register will not be completed by that date.  There is also another reason&mdash;a large amount of the current rates are outstanding.  If we have an election now people in default will have an excuse for withholding payment much longer.  It would not be fair to saddle a new council with the debts of an old one.  The other Bill is purely a machinery Bill and has nothing to do with franchise at all.  It enables the local government register to be compiled with the register for the Dáil and Seanad to save expense.  Otherwise it would mean that there would be two registers compiled, and it would mean double payment for travelling expenses and also for printing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody interested in the preservation of our fisheries will welcome the introduction of this Bill, although one might come to the conclusion that the minimum penalties are certainly somewhat heavy. When we compare them with the penalties which are inflicted on those who adulterate milk and commit a crime against humanity, one is forced to the conclusion that there is a greater interest taken in the preservation of the life of a fish than in the preservation of the lives of children.  Of course, under the existing Act these crimes <Col N="189" /> were almost automatically reduced to a nominal amount, and if the same procedure is to be adopted in the present Bill, the penalties will be non-deterrent as they will be treated as merely nominal.</P>
      <P>The provision which enables a minimum sentence of one month's imprisonment in one case and in another of six months' imprisonment seems altogether atrocious for crimes of that kind.  The drafting of the Bill is in one case unconsciously funny, and I do not know if the Minister can explain it.  At the end of Section 3 it reads: &ldquo;Provided always that any person who shall take or catch any such salmon or trout accidentally and shall return the same immediately to the water without injury shall not be guilty of the offence aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If a man hooks a salmon and can take the hook out of its throat, and return the fish to the water without injury he must be an artist.  If there is any doubt that he returned it to the water without injury would the Minister say whether the same salmon can be arrested and brought up for medical examination?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLove" hpid="Mr. LOVE Mr. LOVE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LOVE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that refers to cases where fish are caught in nets. Occasionally salmon are caught in nets with pollock and other fish, and the fisherman is supposed to return the salmon and I suppose he does.  The fines in the past were absolutely prohibitive. Some time ago there were two extraordinary cases of which different views were taken by the magistrates.  In one case they fined £50 for an offence which was much less than one committed in Dublin where the fine was £10.  The great thing this Bill strives to do is to draw attention to the extraordinary value of our fisheries.  I think people are really to be pitied more than blamed in some instances, as they do not seem to understand the real harm they are doing.  I think that in places where salmon go to spawn there ought to be pictorial maps in the schools showing the value of salmon and the harm done by killing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that a female sheds from one to two hundred thousand eggs, which in the course of six weeks <Col N="190" /> come to maturity.  After about three and a half years the fish come back in the form of spring salmon.  In some rivers there are artificial hatcheries arranged and they give good results.  In America they have them all over the country.  Here I think we suffer much because there has not been a proper conception of their duties by Boards of Conservators who mostly know nothing about fishing. They have, perhaps, some rights of their own and they stick to them. I think that the rivers should belong to the people.  Down in the South, Lord Bandon has given a free day's fishing on his river, and it has had very good results.  The common right of fishing must be respected, and there should be proper conservancy of the rivers.  The Lee and its tributaries extend about two hundred miles, but the vast amount of conservancy money is spent on watching the men with drift nets in the lower end of the harbour while the rest of the river and tributaries are watched by one or two bailiffs.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is to be congratulated upon bringing in this Bill, which will do something towards conserving our rivers.  Inquiries have been held, and the authorities have decided to amend the laws.  In the estuary of the Lee a man may be, and has been, shot for fishing with a drift net, but on the Blackwater and other rivers he can fish with impunity if he pays the ordinary licence of £3.  Some time ago an attempt was made to prevent such fishing on the Bann and on the Foyle, and there was a big lawsuit in Dublin which bore very largely upon the fishing rights of people all over the country. The Master of the Rolls decided against the Royal Charter and said that there was no power that could destroy the common right of fishing.  There have been a few instances of that kind but I am sure all the facts in connection with them are in the possession of the Department.  I congratulate the Minister on the Bill, and I hope he will give an opportunity of looking into these cases with a view to adjustment.</P>

      <P>I consider this to be a good Bill.  It protects the fish on the spawning beds, and it provides <Col N="191" /> a close season for brown trout as well as for salmon.  The rich man can afford to go salmon fishing and pay a big price, but it is great amusement for the poor man to be able to go and fish for brown trout, of which there are thousands in this country.  That is why I welcome the Bill.  Our rivers are short in comparison with those in America, and we have no canning stations, but we have quantities of these trout.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that I have noticed in legislation that brown trout is to be really preserved, and when our Civic Guards are in full working order and the conservators can afford to keep bailiffs, which they must very soon, if this Bill is to be carried out, then I foresee that Ireland will be a great playground for the man who wishes to enjoy a quiet and pleasant holiday following the gentle art.</P>

      <P>As one having some slight practical knowledge of this subject, I should like to say that I support this Bill.  Fault has been found with the nature of the penalties; Senator O'Farrell thought they were very high.  They are high in some cases, no doubt, but the thing which perhaps will not be realised by all the members of the Seanad is that the offence of poaching, in many of its aspects, is so particularly easy to carry out and is a particularly mean form of crime, if I may so call it, because it is so selfish and results in depriving other people of a great deal of pleasure.  Where it is very easy to commit offences of this kind with impunity I think the magistrate is justified in making the penalty rather high and for that reason I do not think we ought to take exception to that.  The Bill may not be perfect. It may possibly be improved in certain respects, but I think it is a move in the right direction.  Something of the kind is badly needed, or the country will be the poorer for something which in every way would be a great loss. For the information of Senator O'Farrell who, I think, said that anyone who had caught a salmon was something in the nature of a marvel, I would like to assure him that it is frequently done.  I have often done it myself, and it is quite easy to do.  I <Col N="192" /> would not like it to go out that the Bill has been criticised by this House as being in any way ridiculous.  I think it has been very carefully considered and that it is aiming in the right direction.</P>

      <P>I was asked practically by every part of the country to bring forward a Bill of this kind because it was generally felt that something like this was necessary to check the wholesale poaching of fish, especially during the spawning season.  It was all the more necessary because in a great many parts of the country we had, if one might call it so, become sufficiently morally depraved to look on poaching as a rather honourable profession.  I brought forward the Bill with the intention of making those gentlemen who thought so feel that they will pay for their fun.  The purport of the Bill is to increase the penalties under the existing enactments.  It creates no new offences. Senator O'Farrell referred to the minimum penalty.  The minimum penalty exists wholesale already in fishery law.  From the year 1848 down we find the minimum penalty appearing in Fishery Act after Fishery Act. It varied from 10/- to £5.  Where a penalty of 10/- was imposed in 1848 it is not an extraordinary thing to impose a penalty of £2 now.  I am sure that Senator O'Farrell, in discussing a matter of another kind, would hold that a person who earned 10/- in 1848 should at least get £2 now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he does, or very nearly.  Under the existing Acts also, not so widely, I admit, as in the present Bill, there is an option of imprisonment, notably in the case of dynamiting <Col N="193" /> and poisoning.  We extend that a little further to govern other offences, especially during the close season, and we hold that nobody should have any sympathy with a person who finds himself getting a month in jail for interfering with spawning beds and spawning salmon.  After all, interference with a spawning salmon or trout is not alone an offence against that individual salmon or trout but against the potential wealth that will accrue if it is allowed to spawn.  It is an offence against the national fisheries themselves as well as against every person who directly or indirectly depends on them for a livelihood.  For that reason I do not see that we should shed any tears over any person who gets a month in jail for this offence.  I have hopes that the Bill will bring home to people that this is considered a serious offence, that therefore it will act as a great deterrent and that as a result our fisheries will benefit considerably, because, as the Earl of Mayo remarked, I believe that one of the results of the Bill will be to bring a great deal of money to the country through the attraction of persons who have money to spend on a pleasant holiday.</P>

      <P>I desire to ask the Minister a question on a subject which I hoped he would have dealt with.  It is an open secret that the funds for the protection of these rivers are largely derived from fines.  I have no sympathy at all with the people who are fined, because a great many of them are really destroying the assets of the nation and not the assets of any private individual.  But these fines are inflicted in the country and they ought to go to the relief of those charged with their protection of the particular district concerned. They came up here, and hitherto the power rested with somebody&mdash;I suppose it will be with the Minister now&mdash;to remit these fines. Where a fine of £5, which probably was richly deserved, was inflicted, it was frequently reduced to 10/-, and similarly all through.  I think it would be a very desirable thing that there should be no power to reduce fines that had been inflicted, after careful consideration, by a Justice who has investigated all the circumstances.  If the Bill does <Col N="194" /> not contain any provision for the reduction of these fines, could the Minister give us any undertaking that they will not be remitted?  It will lead to the better protection of the fish.</P>

      <P>The procedure hitherto had been that, prior to the establishment of the Saorstát, the recommendations for a remission were made on many occasions by the magistrate who inflicted a fine, or even if no recommendations were made by the Bench of Magistrates, frequently a memorial was sent to the Lord Lieutenant, who, I believe, referred the matter to the Fisheries Department.  They made local inquiries and sent back their notes to the Lord Lieutenant, through the Chief Secretary, and then a decision was arrived at in the Castle.</P>
      <P>The present procedure is this.  The magistrates inflicted the fine, and the recommendations of the Justice were sent to the Home Affairs Department, and that Department referred the matter to me.  I made inquiries from the local Board of Conservators, and I made my recommendations.  You may take it that the recommendations of the Fisheries Department were usually against remission, except the circumstances were very exceptional.  We usually recommend that the law should take its course, and I think that for the future you will find that the recommendations of the Ministry of Fisheries will be the last word as the governing authority for remission.</P>

      <P>This Bill is dealing with the future.  These wicked magistrates we have had in the past have disappeared, and in future these fines will be inflicted by some people who, we hope, will perform their duty with far greater scrupulousness than the magistrates are alleged to have done in the past.  When a Judge having heard all the circumstances and investigated them fully, comes to the conclusion that a certain fine is justified, is it the intention of the Government that these fines should be reduced by backstairs influence in Dublin?  If so, it would be a disastrous thing, and if a clause were inserted in the Bill that the fines imposed should in no circumstances <Col N="195" /> be reduced, that would be in the interest of wholesome Government.</P>

      <P>I think nothing I said would justify any suggestion that the recommendations of magistrates sitting locally would be changed here by backstairs methods.  What has always happened in the past, and since the establishment of the Saorstát, is that recommendations were made by the Justice recommending that certain fines should be reduced.  The Justice recommended to the Minister for Home Affairs that a fine should be reduced, and Home Affairs referred it to us.  We recommended, as a rule, that the fines should stand, after consultation with the local Board of Conservators.  I do not think there is any need for such a clause in the Bill as the Senator suggests.</P>

I should like to ask the Minister if he would tell us what he has in mind by way of assisting people on the spot in enforcing the provisions of the Act.  As the Minister, I am sure, is very well aware, to fine your poacher is one thing but to catch him is another, and that in the past has been, and probably in the future will be the great difficulty, especially in the part of Ireland I know best, where the rivers are small and the district mountainous. All the same, though they are little rivers, they carry great numbers of breeding fish, and I think from the national point of view the preservation of these small rivers is every bit as important as the larger ones, and that is why I ask the question.</P>

      <P>On this question of fines, as far as I understand the matter, I am not satisfied; perhaps I <Col N="196" /> misunderstood the Minister.  Is it quite clear that a recommendation for the remission or reduction of a fine must emanate from the Judge or Justice who imposes the fine, and, if so, must it emanate at the time the fine is made, or can a period elapse, and the matter then be brought to the notice of the Judge?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that of necessity the recommendation for remission should emanate from the Justice. It has frequently emanated from the Justice, and has come along with the report, whatever form it takes, of the infliction of the fine, but frequently a request for remission has taken the form of a memorial got up locally by the friends of the person on whom the fine was inflicted.</P>

      <P>I think this Bill will be generally looked upon as a non-controversial measure, and will be welcomed by the Seanad as a whole.  The great surprise has been that it has been delayed for such a long time.  During the past two years more civil servants have resigned than in the same period within the experience, I think, of any living person, and their places have been filled, as far as I am aware, without any competitive examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected if I have made an over-statement, but I think it is safe to say that the great majority of the posts have been filled without any examinations.  That is a <Col N="197" /> very serious consideration, and this generation is going to pay for it at the expense of efficiency.  When we see a state of affairs of that kind obtaining, we need not wonder at the terribly chaotic state of such departments as the Army Accounts and Finance Department, where accounts are transferred from one department to another, and from one officer to another until the unfortunate creditor does not know where to look for his money.</P>
      <P>I had a case some time ago in hands, and I was amazed to find that an absolutely accounting matter was being dealt with by an ex-engine driver&mdash;a man who might be an excellent engine-driver, but certainly knew nothing about accounts.  One of the officers also, who was concerned in the matter, stated that the matter was in his hands only six weeks.  How he could be expected to give a reply in six weeks baffled the imagination of that officer.</P>
      <P>I had occasion to write to the Secretary of the Post Office some four or five weeks ago, at the request of some persons whose children wished to go in for the competitive examination for the Post Office.  I asked him when, in his opinion, the examination would be held for female learners, and other such positions.  He replied to the effect that the subjects for the examination had not yet been decided upon, and consequently he was unable to say when the examination would be held. I hope that some progress has been made in that respect by now.  It is a very serious state of affairs, at a time when resignations are so numerous, to have the Civil Service built up by people who cannot, and in many cases, it is well known, have not the qualifications that are necessary for these positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to pursue that matter any further because it is so obvious to everybody, but I want to draw attention to two matters of constitutional importance in the Bill.  Sub-section 4 of Section 4 provides that regulations made by the Commissioners regarding the admission of people to the Civil Service shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and if only one House disapproves of such a regulation <Col N="198" /> that it shall prevail.  That would mean that a regulation framed by the Commissioners, of which this Seanad approves, and of which the Dáil disapproves, shall still prevail.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Seanad can overrule the Dáil, and vice versa.  That is a very unsatisfactory position.  Instead of putting down in this particular Section &ldquo;both Houses,&rdquo; it should be &ldquo;either house&rdquo;&mdash;that if either House disapproves of any regulation made, then that regulation shall be nullified. Otherwise you can have either assembly nullifying the act of the other, and leaving the Commissioners in absolute control.  Naturally, as the Minister is responsible to the Dáil, that is the body that will probably prevail in most cases, and the functions of the Seanad will be absolutely wiped out. It is quite possible, however, that the reverse may obtain.  The Dáil can turn down a regulation of this kind, but unless the Seanad sees fit to do likewise, then the regulation stands.</P>
    <P>In Sub-section 2 of Section 9, the very same principle arises, and I intend when this Bill is in Committee, to move amendments providing that it shall only be necessary for one House to pass a resolution disapproving of any regulation in order to nullify the regulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been described as a non-controversial measure.  To my mind, it is by no means a non-controversial measure.  Following what Senator O'Farrell has said, I have several times here given instances of scandalous cases of corruption in the country.  When this Bill was before the Seanad on a former occasion, we were pressed to pass the Bill, and not to be in any way uneasy about it, because it was only to last for a few months.  I suggested an amendment to one Section&mdash;that when local bodies were making appointments these appointments should only be made through the medium of the Civil Service Commissioners.  I gave a number of very outrageous instances of corruption which I had known to exist.  The Minister for Local Government and the President were here, and I certainly understood from them that they quite approved of the suggestion.  In fact, the President said that they had a very <Col N="199" /> comprehensive scheme for dealing with the matter, when the Bill came up for reconsideration, and that all these amendments would be adopted.</P>
      <P>The Bill has come up for reconsideration, and I find that it is verbatim the Bill that we were asked to pass on the plea that there was a great hurry about it.  This Seanad has been described elsewhere as a cooling chamber.  It certainly exists to enable improvements to be introduced into legislation.  If Bills are to be hurried through, as they were on the last occasion, by suspending Standing Orders, I certainly must protest in the strongest way possible. We owe a duty to the State to see that the administration of public affairs is as pure and uncorrupt as possible.  We know cases of men down in the country getting returned so that they may make a living out of these jobs.  It is notorious that doctors in the past have had to buy their jobs.  Unless something is done to prevent such things as that in the future, I certainly must protest in the strongest manner against this Bill being pushed through without the amendments promised on the last occasion when it was brought up being introduced into it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the Senators who have spoken in what they said on this matter.  It is very late to bring forward a Bill of this kind when the whole Civil Service, from top to bottom, has been not only filled but over-filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should have been done long ago. Everyone will approve of these matters being put into the hands of the Civil Service Commissioners.  There are things here connected with the Schedule, however, which I do not understand. There are a number of classes of persons included in the Schedule who do not come into the Bill at all.  That may be all right, because I quite understand that there are some appointments that must be made without examination.  You cannot have porters and door-keepers, and people like that, appointed by competitive examination.  There are also some very high positions which would not properly come under competitive examination. But we would like to know who <Col N="200" /> those people are who come under some of these designations which are very general and very uncertain.  With regard to No. 4, while it is clear that we cannot have examinations for the persons referred to, I would like them to be appointed by some method other than political influence.</P>
    <P>It came to my knowledge some time ago that practically every appointment was made by the Whip of the political party in power.  I know that is so. We were told by the President on one occasion that the reason he appointed certain very important people in the Ministry of Finance, and other places, was because they were recommended by the heads of the departments to which they belonged.  That certainly was a very good reason.  No one can doubt it.  On the other hand, when I was told by the head of a Department that every single appointment under him was made by a political Whip I was somewhat taken back.  I think it is very improper that the Whip of a political party should have power to appoint door-keepers, messengers, night-watchmen, charwomen, cleaners, and other persons in subordinate positions. That puts into the hands of a political party power for wholesale jobbery.  I am not saying any particular political party commits this wholesale jobbery, but some political party may come in and commit wholesale jobbery.  There should be some means of appointing these people which would not allow of jobbery.  Who all the people are described in No. 2, I do not know.  Perhaps the Minister will help us by explaining.  I join with Senator Barrington in saying that the Bill should extend further and apply to all public bodies in the country.  The less influence Ministers or political parties have in these appointments the better.  There will always be a certain amount of influence, but the less the better for the general credit and honour of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as this Bill provides for competitive examinations for the Civil Service, I am in thorough agreement with it.  I go further and say that any people who got positions in the Civil Service, other than by the <Col N="201" /> door of competitive examinations, should not be regarded as permanent officials.  I entirely agree with the remarks that were made by other Senators, and regret that the competitive system was not enforced sooner and before all the positions had been filled. However, better late than never.  With the passing of this Bill I hope it is by competitive examinations these offices will be filled, and that the rule will be rigidly adhered to.  Otherwise, we might adopt the system here of having each political party when it comes into power appointing its own supporters.</P>
      <P>I think that would be an unfortunate thing for the country.  By that method certain classes in this country who do not see eye to eye with the Government would feel that they are ostracised in their own country.  Once the competitive system is established, they would have no reason to grumble, as they will be eligible if worthy and efficient to secure the highest marks. There is one Section of the Bill which I question will be to the advantage of this country.  That is the Section which states that candidates for appointments must be born in Ireland.  We must remember that a very large number of Irishmen have got positions through competitive examination in Great Britain, and a very large number of the schools have been training their pupils for the purpose of enabling them to compete at these examinations.</P>
      <P>If this Section is adhered to in its present form, I fear that it may induce Great Britain to retaliate by excluding Irishmen from competing in the Civil Service in that country.  I throw out that suggestion so that the matter may be considered, and so that those in charge of the Bill might try and ascertain how many Irishmen got employment in the past through these examinations, and how many in the future might be deprived of a livelihood if the Bill passed in its present form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Barrington, I am somewhat concerned that the amendments promised, when this Bill went through before, have not been included.  My chief anxiety is on the question of appointments under local authorities, and that it is not mandatory on the Civil Service Commissioners <Col N="202" /> to hold examinations in these cases, but is left to the discretion of the Executive Council.  You cannot deal with these matters from the point of view of generalities.  You have got to deal with them in the light of local knowledge.  Things being as they are, the appointments made by local authorities generally have been of an unsatisfactory character, and made with little or no regard to the qualifications of the candidates, very often on a purely parochial basis.</P>
      <P>It was only the other day that I saw an appointment in Tipperary where applicants were confined to that area, even the county being excluded.  I believe that anyone living outside the town was excluded from being an applicant. Bearing in mind those facts, which I think are notorious, it does seem necessary to tighten up the whole matter and for this purpose to make these examinations mandatory and to approach them from a different angle and then perhaps to state certain exceptions. It should not be left entirely to the discretion of the Executive Council, in a permanent Bill of this kind, to hold only if it thinks fit competitive examinations for an important position in the Defence Forces, the Dublin Metropolitan Police, or the Civic Guard and all the appointments under local authorities, when we know that in the latter case undesirable influences are the most potent.  I hope the Minister may deal with that point and perhaps save time by preventing amendments which are unnecessary being put down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Farrell led off with the parrot cry we have heard so often of late about the filling up of the Civil Service during the past two years. There is no truth whatever in that.  No permanent appointment has been made to the Civil Service since the change of Government.  It was impossible to make any permanent appointment. Certain temporary appointments have been made.  A considerable number have been made in special offices like the Army Finance Office and the Compensation Department of the Ministry of Finance, where a huge volume of work came in on account of the emergency. Apart from that there has <Col N="203" /> been no great number of appointments, and any that have been made have been temporary.  They cannot be converted, any of them, into permanent appointments except in accordance with the provisions of this Bill.  The cry Senator O'Farrell allowed himself to be deceived into repeating was one without foundation.  This Bill is practically a re-enactment of a previous Bill that was introduced four or five months ago. Before that things had not reached the stage when it was possible to set up a Civil Service Commission, and have recruitment for the public services by the methods provided in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Up to that time the State was actually fighting for its life, and it would have been a great danger to have appointed, say, a well-known Irregular, even if that Irregular had passed an examination.  I am speaking of a theoretical Irregular.  Even if the person had done nothing that would bring him within reach of the law, it would have been a danger to the State to allow such person to get in by competitive examination.  There were considerations which made it impossible to set up the ordinary Civil Service machinery.  It was only possible to pass a temporary Bill, and that was done. This proposal is to re-enact these temporary provisions.  I do not think that it was promised that amendments would be introduced into a permanent Bill, obliging the Civil Service Commissioners to hold examinations for local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I see the matter, it is undesirable that that should be dealt with in this way.  A Local Government Bill is in preparation, which will reform a great number of local government matters. That will prescribe how local government appointments are to be made, which are to be held by competitive examination, which by a qualifying examination, and which are not to be the subject of examination at all. When we are making rules for local authorities under the Local Government Bill, it can be prescribed that the Civil Service Commissioners can hold examinations where examinations are to be held.  It would be useless to require the Commissioners to hold examinations <Col N="204" /> when the local authorities might ignore them.  This Bill is to set up a Civil Service Commission, and there is nothing in this Bill to prevent whatever changes we may desire in regard to the filling of local appointments. I think we have done sufficient here when we have enabled the Civil Service Commissioners, if required, to hold an examination for local authorities. I think it will be going too far to make it obligatory on the Commissioners to hold examinations which local authorities might ignore.</P>
    <P>The appointments under the Schedule include Judges and District Justices. In Section 2 they include the Heads of Departments.  It is felt that there should be some possibility of going outside the ranks of existing civil servants, if necessary, to get the head of a department. That would probably arise only where some new section of work is being taken on.  For instance, when the National Health Insurance Act was set up, the Government of the day went outside the Civil Service to get a man to place at the head of the Insurance Commission.  It is felt desirable that in the case of the heads of Departments there should be freedom for the Executive Council to choose the best men.  It would be undesirable, of course, to go outside the ranks of the Civil Service, unless it was necessary, because, if you do not promote to these important offices, the type of candidate you get to go into the Civil Service, it would not be as good as otherwise it would.</P>
    <P>With regard to No. 4 in the Schedule, I do not know how that matter could best be arranged.  At present, if it is a case of men being employed, they will be confined to, say, men who served in the Army.  If you do not do that, you might as well do it by lot as any other way.  I assume it is not impossible to devise a satisfactory system. In any case, you will not have political jobbery in the appointment of charwomen, and it will not damage the State.  This Bill provides for the setting up of a Civil Service Commission somewhat similar to that which exists in England.  It provides for the remuneration of the Commissioners, and for the giving of certificates, and it provides <Col N="205" /> also that in normal circumstances there shall be open competitive examinations.</P>
    <P>There is power in certain cases to confine competitive examinations to persons belonging to a specific class. That has been done recently.  We are demobilising large numbers of men from the Army, and we have already demobilised, I suppose, something like 20,000.  When we thought it was of advantage to the State and fair to the men themselves, as many as possible were absorbed into suitable appointments in the Civil Service.  An examination was held recently for fifty minor posts in the Customs and Excise which was confined to men who served in the National Army.  I think it is desirable to have power to make such regulations.  I think it would probably not be used very much except in circumstances such as we have at present, but there might be other reasons for confining examinations to a particular class.  Clause 6 deals with professional appointments chiefly.  As regards the matters that Senator O'Farrell raised as to a particular class, I think I need hardly discuss them at the moment.  I am prepared to defend them in the present form when we come to the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I must say that I desire to be rid of any power to make any appointments myself, or influence any appointments. There is nothing that would relieve me from trouble more than to be absolutely powerless to influence any appointment, and I think that is the opinion of other members of the Government.  We have recently extended the system of competitive examination to classes which did not come within the scope of competitive examinations in Great Britain&mdash;for instance, temporary typists.  These are generally appointed by getting on to a list and being asked for by some Department.  We have arranged that from time to time examinations shall be held for a list of persons for appointments as temporary typists, and the Departments requiring typists must take them from that list in the order of merit. Wherever we can have the competitive system, we are desirous of having it.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Seanad there was no holding back in this Bill, no desire <Col N="206" /> to stuff people into the Civil Service and then bring in a Bill after that has been done.  The people appointed since the change of Government held temporary positions.  They can be deprived of them.  One or two hold permanent positions such as the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  The others hold temporary appointments, except those who came in in the old Dáil service.  There was a Dáil Civil Service running to 120 or 130 people before the Treaty.  That has been incorporated in the regular service and except the people who were brought into service by a special Act, the Superannuation Act, no other persons have been appointed. I am satisfied that this system will work well.  There is no doubt the British Civil Service is really a very excellent machine.  I do not say we could not make changes that would improve it and adapt it better to the conditions prevailing here.  It has produced a magnificent machine.  It has got good material.  It has got a Civil Service where there is integrity and impartiality, and, I think, all the zeal you can have in a Civil Service.  I believe in adopting a system something the same, we will get good results for this country, and can make any changes desirable.  At the present moment we do not want to make any specific changes.</P>

      <P>My criticism of this Bill was not that the Bill was bad but that it did not go far enough.  I would like to ask whether the Government would be prepared to accept an amendment something on the lines of what I suggested.  It is said that this is not the place to do it, that we are not introducing a Bill to deal with local government, and that it is a big question and it must be a long time before the Bill will become operative.  In Section 8 I notice that the Commissioners are to hold examinations for the army, police, county surveyorships, and various appointments by local authorities in the country.  If they are prepared to hold those examinations for a certain number of those limited appointments why not extend the principle to the few others and enable us to have the improvement effected at <Col N="207" /> once pending the perfection of it by a Local Government Bill?</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister to state why the position of porters, door-keepers, messengers, night watchmen, charwomen, cleaners and all those who perform subordinate duties shall not be established?  The reason I raised the question is, some months ago there came under my notice the case of a person who had been in the employment of the State for 36 years, a woman who had torn the heart out of herself carrying buckets of coal from the cellars to the offices in the Four Courts. After a whole life time's service, she was dismissed on a fortnight's notice. I never imagined that when this country would have the management of its own affairs it was going to treat people differently because they were charwomen. I do not think that was intended. I heard the Minister for Finance saying repeatedly that he does not believe in class legislation.  We do not believe in class legislation.  We want to do away with class legislation, but there has been nothing but class legislation. When a man has given service for three or four years as a judge, he is entitled to a pension.  Surely a woman who has given 36 years of her life is also entitled to one.  Therefore, I want to know why these positions are unestablished.  Where is the Minister going to draw the line?  I want to know why a woman who happens to be only a charwoman is refused a pension.</P>

I think it would be lamentable that we should exclude other British subjects from this examination.  As Senator Lenihan remarked, it might lead to retaliation which would be disastrous.

If that is the view of the Seanad I think we should omit any further minute criticisms until we get to the Committee stage.</P>

      <P>I should like to suggest that in view of the fact that we must meet again in a day or two it would be much more dignified not to put any of the Bills through further stages.  I think that a certain amount of the criticism of the Seanad is due to the fact that naturally, and, I think, wisely, members do not read the Bills until they pass the Dáil.  We then come to what looks like a non-controversial Bill on the Second Reading and find that on a little more consideration it may require some amendments.  I personally strongly favour that in every Bill, unless there are very urgent circumstances, you should at least reach the Committee Stage.  If when you get to the Committee Stage you find that no one has any amendments, it is pretty clear that it is a non-controversial Bill, and we should not go further in approval of it, but that we should meet again and take the Committee Stage.  It will only take a couple of minutes if there is no controversy.  That is also emphasised by the fact that in one of these Bills, regarded as more or less non-controversial, the Minister has a verbal amendment which he would like to have introduced.</P>

I might be allowed to say, in order to allay any disappointment on the part of some Senators who perhaps were looking forward to my delivering an impassioned harangue against the Irish language and the Irish movement, that I desire to make it clear that I intended doing nothing of the kind, that far from attacking them I believe that both the Irish movement and the Irish language are entitled to the greatest respect.  Beyond that I say nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>The EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad, being of opinion that it would be in the public interest if questions could be addressed in the Seanad to the Ministers of the different Government Departments, respectfully requests the President and his colleagues to make arrangements by which, after due notice had been given, Ministers would attend in the Seanad for the purpose of replying to such questions by answer or other explanation as in their discretion they think right.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I remark that this is not the original motion that I handed in.  You, Sir, have thought fit,&mdash;and you have every right to do so,&mdash;to alter my motion. The sense of it is really not altered. <Col N="211" /> Let me explain to the Seanad my reason for putting this motion down.  The fact of the matter is that there are some questions that are most important for us to put in the Seanad. I put some questions down and I was told it was against the orders that any question should be put to Ministers here, for the very good reason that the Ministers were not here.  My motion is to enable the Ministers to attend.  I do not wish to be impossible on the subject.  If one puts down a frivolous question it is easy for the Minister to send his Secretary and say: &ldquo;There is no reason for me to attend to answer a question of that sort.  If the Senator likes to come and see me I have no doubt we can settle it.&rdquo;  There are other questions of great importance which I think, and I hope, that the Seanad will agree with me, ought to be put to Ministers and ought to be answered by them.  Now, Sir, you have suggested &ldquo;questions by answer or other explanation.&rdquo;  I should like to add after the word &ldquo;answer&rdquo; the words, &ldquo;verbally or in writing,&rdquo; because there are questions that a Minister can answer in writing quite easily. Technical questions, and questions with regard to Departments, he can answer in writing, but there are questions that have to be put verbally, and I will tell you the reason.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say: &ldquo;Lord Mayo can go and get a question put in the Dáil,&rdquo; but the real truth of it is that the man whom you ask to put the question does not know anything about it; it does not interest him; he has got his own job and his own questions to look after, and therefore it does not interest him.  You may give in a typewritten brief, but that is read out in an informal sort of manner.  It impresses nobody.  The whole thing is, on the surface of it, done to please his friends and no notice may be taken of it.  That is the reason I have put this down and I hope that the President and his colleagues will make arrangements to answer questions.  We &ldquo;respectfully request the President and his colleagues to make arrangements.&rdquo;  You may call up spirits from the vasty deep, but the question is, will they come?  Therefore, <Col N="212" /> I should like to put it a great deal stronger, but as you think that the word &ldquo;respectfully&rdquo; should be used, I agree that it is perhaps more dignified as a Senator that I should put the motion in that way, and I hope the Seanad will agree with me and my idea. I should like to have the words &ldquo;verbally or in writing,&rdquo; because there, at all events, if the Minister does agree to answer a question he can do it verbally or in writing.  I do not think I need say anything further on the subject.  I feel very strongly that we are here in the air with regard to these questions. I know they are very busy in the Dáil. I know they have a great deal to do, but I think that now and then that they might pay us a visit and answer important questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I may mention this matter was discussed at great length when we were dealing with the Standing Orders, and there was a good deal of diversity of opinion on the subject.  Nevertheless I was then, and am still, in favour of it; but I certainly would not like to be asking questions from all corners of Ireland on all sorts of frivolous subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that if the Seanad is generally of the opinion that the substance of the motion is wise and wish to support it, it might be wiser first to refer it to the Standing Order Committee, because the matter is not as simple as it appears at first. Arranging the question of time for questions is difficult, in view of the fact that both Houses generally meet at the same time, and at the time questions would have to be answered here the Minister would have to be in attendance in the Dáil.  That, no doubt, could be arranged if it is desired, and the Ministers agreed.  Then, again, we could not demand in any way the attendance of Ministers here, and we would just run the risk that it might look, if the Minister failed to turn up, that he was either disrespectful to the Seanad, or that the Seanad was not a very important body and could be ignored.  That is not insuperable either, and could be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then again&mdash;and this is of considerable importance&mdash;think that before any Order is added providing for questions that an effort should be made to define the kind of questions that are to be asked.  Reference was made to the fact that certain members of the Seanad were nominated, but for all practical purposes, this is an elected House, inasmuch as the members have to go forward in three, six, nine or twelve years before the electorate. That means that the constituency of each member is the whole of the Saorstát. <Col N="214" /> If the same kind of questions are to be asked in the Seanad as in the Dáil, it means that you may have letters from your constituents in the country, and we may be placed in the position of telling our prospective constituents that we think a question is stupid or silly, and that we would prefer not to have to ask it, or a Senator may ask the question and take the brunt of its silliness on himself.  If there is a strong feeling that questions should be asked the Standing Orders Committee should have another try, first, to define questions, and second to approach the Ministers and endeavour to get consent in the matter.</P>

      <P>While supporting the amendment, I think the Earl of Mayo is quite right in raising the question. I think we are often in great difficulties here through not having a Minister to answer questions.  A great deal of business is held up in that way. If we could secure a better attendance of Ministers it would undoubtedly help in the working of the Seanad, but, as Senator Douglas has said, it is a very difficult thing to arrange to take care of both the dignity of the Seanad and the dignity of the Ministers.  It will require judicious handling, and I think the amendment is a wise one.</P>
