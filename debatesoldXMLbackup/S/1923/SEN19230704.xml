      <P>The Cathaoirleach is still detained in London, and has asked me to take his place.  I want to draw the attention of Senators to the book which has now been prepared containing a list of Senators in which Senators can sign their names, so <Col N="1324" /> that there will be no possibility of errors in the record of attendances.  It is to facilitate the staff and the Clerk in keeping a record of attendance that we ask the Senators to sign their names in the book.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. K. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. K. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture is unfortunately detained in the Dáil on the Land Bill and I have been asked, on short notice, to represent him here on this Bill, which provides for the dissolution of the Congested Districts Board and its absorption in the  Commission.  Section 1 of the Bill will be found to be merely a definition of <Col N="1325" /> technical terms contained in the course of the Bill.  Section (2) confirms the powers of the Land Commission as at present existing.  Section (3) provides for the appointment of a Judicial Commissioner:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Until the establishment of Courts pursuant to Article 64 of the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann, Sub-section (5) of Section 28 of the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1891, shall apply to the office of Judicial Commissioner under this Act, and from and after the establishment of such Courts a Judge of the High Court shall be assigned, in such manner as shall be prescribed by law, to discharge the office of Judicial Commissioner under this Act.</P>
      <P>Section (4) goes on to provide powers for the appointment of Commissioners.  Section (5) dissolves the Congested Districts Board.  Some of the powers of the Congested Districts Board, as exercised in the past, have passed formally to the Ministry of Fisheries and others to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. While it is recognised that that Board played a very useful part in the past and did very useful work for the country, there seems no case for its continuance in the altered conditions.  It is therefore formally dissolved by Section (5).  Most of the rest of the Bill is simply consequential upon the transfer of the jurisdiction and powers of the Board to the Land Commission, transferring its property, providing for the validation of existing contracts, and disposing of its funds.  Section (10) deals with pending legal proceedings either by or against the Congested Districts Board:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In all suits, matters and proceedings to which the Congested Districts Board is a party and which at the passing of this Act are pending in any Court in Saorstát Eireann, the Irish Land Commission shall on the passing of this Act become and be a party in the place of the Congested Districts Board, and every such suit, matter and proceeding shall be continued between the Irish Land Commission and the other parties thereto accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section (11) adapts existing enactments to the altered conditions, and Section (12) vests control of the Land Commission in the Minister for Agriculture.  Section <Col N="1326" /> (13) deals with expenses and staff, making the Ministry of Finance the body responsible for all such payments in future.  If Senators wish to mention special information which they require I will endeavour to meet them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPoe" hpid="Colonel Sir HUTCHESON POE Colonel Sir HUTCHESON POE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Sir HUTCHESON POE</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the discussion which took place in the Dáil with regard to the Congested Districts Board officials who will suffer on the disestablishment of that body unless some adjustment of their position takes place.  It appears that when the Congested Districts Board was formed certain pledges were given by the British Government of the day that these men would be treated to all intents and purposes as Civil Service officials both as regards promotion, superannuation, pensions, gratuities and so on.  These pledges, for one cause or another, were not fulfilled. When the Bill was under discussion in the Dáil a number of Deputies brought the case of these officials forward and stated that they had already suffered a good many disabilities through being underpaid as compared with men who are doing the same duty in the Land Commission, and that they would be still further penalised unless some adjustment of the difference were made.  Deputies FitzGibbon, O'Connell, Davin, and others, spoke very strongly in their favour.  As far as I understand, the Minister was quite prepared to admit that these pledges given by the British Government had not been carried out, and was ready to undertake that on their transfer to the Land Commission they would be placed in as good a position with regard to future superannuation and gratuities as if these pledges had been fulfilled.  I understand further that several Deputies stated they were quite prepared to accept that assurance of the Minister as regards the future of these men, but having regard to the fact that the Land Commission is benefiting to the extent of about £1,500,000, that has been saved by the Board, the cost of adjusting the salaries of these men for the last nine or ten years, who have been, so to speak, underpaid as compared with officials in the Land Commission, would not amount to much and should be defrayed out of this nest-egg, so to speak, of £1,500,000.  I think some Deputies stated that the cost involved would be only £14,000, which would be a comparatively <Col N="1327" /> small sum and would not involve any special charge on the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that he was not prepared to give any assurance of that kind.  He could not go back on the misdeeds of the past, and could not give any undertaking.  The matter was pressed to a division and the voting was fairly close, 32 or 33 to 25.  I only mention the matter in case that other Senators wished to call attention to it on the Committee Stage.  I do not know if the Minister could say anything that will throw some light on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 of the Bill was a Section around which there was most discussion in the Dáil, and both the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance made their positions fairly clear on the matter.  Section 5 is a very short Section.</P>
      <P>Immediately upon the passing of this Act the Congested Districts Board shall stand dissolved, and thereupon every officer and person then in the employment of the Congested Districts Board shall be transferred to the employment of the Irish Land Commission, and shall, for the purposes of the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1919, be deemed to have been paid from moneys provided by Parliament or the Oireachtas throughout their service under the Congested Districts Board within the meaning of Section 17 of the Superannuation Act, 1859.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Section is more than a mere safeguarding Section.  It provides that no officer in the employment of the Congested Districts Board at the time of the dissolution shall be shed in the process of transfer to the Irish Land Commission, for it expressly states that every officer and person then in the employment of the former shall be transferred to the latter.  No one, however, becomes under the clause entitled on transfer to what he had not before; that is the non-pensionable staff does not by the fact of the transfer become entitled to a pension, but it does give the power in the case of a temporary or non-pensionable officer made permanent to have all previous non-pensionable service counted towards pension if so desired.  The wording of the Section as it stands does not confer pensions upon those who were under <Col N="1328" /> their service with the Congested Districts Board non-pensionable.  The pensionable staff comes over fully entitled to count on their previous service under the Board for pensionable purposes, not under the pensionable system of the Board, but under the general pensions system of the Civil Service.  One effect of this will be to remove an injustice under which officers of the Board laboured for many years.  That injustice arose out of the interpretation of Section 52 of the Land Act of 1909, which was inserted with the intention of enabling the Congested Districts Board to grant their own staff the pensions and gratuities already possessed by the ordinary Civil Service under the Superannuation Acts.  These privileges since the Superannuation Act of 1909 had included the right of a representative of a deceased pensionable officer to receive a gratuity equal to a year's salary, but when Section 52 came to be interpreted it was held that through loose drafting the Section gave no power to pay such a gratuity.  The Treasury admitted at the time that unintended injustice had been done to the Board's staff in this matter, and stated that it was their intention to incorporate in some coming Bill a Clause rectifying the error. This intention did not mature until the bringing in of the Land Bill of 1920, which included a Clause for the purpose. The Bill was not proceeded with, and so the matter stood previous to the introduction of this Bill.  Clause 5 of the Land Law (Commission) Bill definitely removes the grievance for cases of future deaths, and would also, presumably, enable the Minister for Finance to make the improvement retrospective, that is to give the gratuity to the representatives of any pensionable member of the Board's staff who died between 1909 and the present day.</P>
    <P>That is the official case with regard to Section 5.  You could not deal with the big question of establishment by legislation. There is an Establishment Branch of the Ministry of Finance that can definitely deal with this question of the officials of the Congested Districts Board by incorporating them, or all of them who would be entitled, in the ordinary Civil Service.  There are in the Congested Districts Board, as there are attached to Ministries of the Government, clerical officers who are <Col N="1329" /> not Civil Servants, and it is not proposed to make it mandatory to incorporate in the Civil Service officers of that kind who were attached to the Congested Districts Board.  The Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Agriculture are out to do substantial justice to the staff of the Congested Districts Board, and as has been pointed out they remove in the Bill the chief grievances that officials of the Congested Districts Board were labouring under.  It is pointed out that that injustice was simply due to an error of draughtsmanship which has not been rectified up to the time this Bill was introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Col. Sir HUTCHESON POE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged for the Minister's explanation. The only point that has not been cleared up is that if possible something should be done with regard to these officials who have been on a very much lower salary than they would have received if the pledges of the British Government had been carried out.  The contention of Deputies in the Dáil was that having a large sum of money at their disposal, taken over from the Congested Districts Board, something might be done where there was a manifest injustice.  Where the Minister for Agriculture was satisfied that officials had suffered within the last nine or ten years, something might be done to give them something in the nature of a bonus out of that fund, and to indemnify them against that injustice.</P>

      <P>If any kind of arrangement is to be suggested to give men money which they were not earning I hope the Seanad will be put into possession of what their salaries were.  I think the solution of the difficulty outlined by the Government is an admirable one, and I certainly would be adverse to giving men salaries which they never thought they were to get and where they are receiving every possible consideration in regard to pensions and any grades which they did earn. The suggestion seems to me to be unjust to the community as a whole and I should certainly oppose it.</P>

    <Title>THE CIVIC GUARD (ACQUISITION OF PREMISES) BILL, 1923. - SECOND STAGE.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is rather urgently required.  At the moment only about four hundred and twenty Civic Guard Stations have been established. The total establishment provides for eight hundred and seven stations, and there has been considerable difficulty in placing the Civic Guard, even in such important towns as Mallow, Carrick-on-Suir, Claremorris, and other large centres. I have a recollection that it took considerable negotiations before we could open a station in Tullamore.  The underlying principle of this Bill is simply that in the face of a big common need, an urgent public necessity, I submit it is necessary to ask individual citizens to waive the fullness of their legal and property rights.  We ask power for the Board of Works to acquire premises compulsorily. Naturally, in the exercise of that power the greatest possible care will be taken to see that the minimum of hardship or inconvenience is inflicted on citizens, but that it is necessary to get the Guard out quickly should be obvious to everyone.  We are within, I suppose, a couple of months of an election, and generally, it would greatly expedite the return of the country to normal conditions to have a full police establishment in the shortest possible space of time.  I think that there will be very little question about that.  The State has always, in the face of public needs, encroached upon the property <Col N="1331" /> rights of individuals to a greater or lesser degree.  They have taken land compulsorily for railways, and public works of that kind, and we now ask for compulsory power to acquire premises for the establishment of the police.  Section 1 of the Bill provides for that power, and Section 2 provides that due notice be given by the Board of Works to people whose premises it is proposed to acquire. Section 3 is an important section, and deals with the terms on which premises may be acquired:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All premises acquired by the Commissioners under this Act shall be acquired for such term of years and at such rent as may be agreed between the Commissioners and the occupier, immediate landlord, or owner (as the case may require), and in default of such agreement shall be taken by the Commissioners on a yearly tenancy terminable at the end of any year of the tenancy by either party on giving three months' previous notice in writing, and subject to a yearly rent to be fixed by the Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Whenever the Commissioners acquire any premises under this Act any person (other than a caretaker) who was put out of occupation of such premises or any part thereof in order that the same might be used for the accommodation of members of the Civic Guard shall be entitled to reasonable compensation for disturbance, the amount of which shall in default of agreement be fixed by the Commissioners.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That seems arbitrary, to say that in default of agreement, the amount of compensation shall be determined by the party taking the premises compulsorily, but that is simply a starting point.  There is a provision under 5 for an appeal from the decision of the Commissioners, and in order to appeal they must have something to appeal from.  The Commissioners, therefore, state the amount they are prepared to pay in compensation, and the aggrieved person has his right to appeal, under Section 5 to this panel of referees appointed under Sections 33 and 34 of the Finance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is retrospective.  It will deal with a few cases where a certain degree of compulsion was exercised in the acquisition of premises.  Compensation and the rent that will be fixed under the machinery provided by the Bill will go back to the date on which the Civic <Col N="1332" /> Guard entered into occupation.  I doubt if it is necessary to urge again on Senators the absolute imperative need of an early distribution of this force in full strength.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPoe" hpid="Col. Sir HUTCHESON POE Col. Sir HUTCHESON POE">
      <NameTxt>Col. Sir HUTCHESON POE</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers which it is proposed to confer on the Ministry in this Bill are undoubtedly drastic, inasmuch as it entitles them to acquire premises, whether they are occupied or unoccupied.  Still, I think in the circumstances which the Minister has pointed out, the necessity for getting the Civic Guard distributed through the country in the interests of future peace, and to meet the growing demand from different parts for the services of these men, we have no course but to pass the Bill as soon as possible.  The only thing I would like to urge, as was urged below, is that care should be taken not to disturb schools by acquiring them for the use of the Civic Guard.  One of the Deputies mentioned that, to his knowledge, two large schools&mdash;he did not say where &mdash;had been taken for the military.  The students had been dispersed, the teachers had been discharged, and, of course, the education of that district had suffered enormously.  Schools are very convenient buildings for such a purpose as this, and I hope that the Minister will be able to assure us that every care will be taken to interfere as little as possible in the acquisition of premises with buildings used for this purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenjaminHaughton" hpid="Mr. HAUGHTON Mr. HAUGHTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HAUGHTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that that point is raised by Senator Colonel Sir Hutcheson Poe&mdash;the question of schools and educational establishments.  I am sure that the Government will use discretion as to the premises that they acquire.  I am personally acquainted with a large educational establishment in the South of Ireland which has been greatly inconvenienced by its occupation for some months by the military authorities, and the school has been greatly injured, financially and otherwise, in consequence.  I know it was inevitable at the time when it occurred, but I am sure that the Government will use all discretion in the buildings that they endeavour to acquire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice in Sub-section (2) of Section 3 &ldquo;whenever the Commissioners acquire any premises under this Act any person other than a caretaker <Col N="1333" /> who was put out of occupation of such premises or any part thereof in order that the same might be used for the accommodation of members of the Civic Guard shall be entitled to reasonable compensation for disturbance, the amount of which shall in default of agreement be fixed by the Commissioners.&rdquo; I cannot understand why a person who can least afford being dispossessed of premises is not entitled to compensation the same as everybody else.  An unfortunate caretaker of premises may hold these premises to be part of his wages, but if he is dispossessed and put to the same inconvenience as anybody else still he can get no compensation.  I think that caretakers should be entitled to the same ratio of compensation in proportion to their loss as anybody else.  They will have to remove their furniture and look for new places in many cases, and they will have to pay rent though they have not being paying it before.  As I have stated, in many cases the accommodation provided is portion of the wages. In most cases accommodation is given to caretakers by reason of the fact that they supervise premises in other than business hours.  I think you are going to do an injustice by this to the one section that can least afford it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the powers in Section 1, Sub-sections (a) and (b) are very drastic indeed.  They would enable the Commissioners to acquire any business, premises, shops, places where manufactures are carried on, and any premises of any description.  I do think that there should be some clause protecting an owner who can show that premises which the Commissioner wishes to acquire are essential to the business that he is carrying on, and that he ought not have to look for compensation for a thing that could not be compensated for at all.  If in a country town a man had some store, or some part of his buildings which is essential to the carrying on of his business, as we know there are in a great many towns, and if he cannot get other premises they might absolutely destroy the business of the individual by taking these premises, and if in any way a clause could be devised which would enable the individual whose premises are to be taken to be granted the right to prove that these premises are absolutely necessary to the business <Col N="1334" /> carried on and ought not to be taken, it would meet the case.  I cannot see how anybody can be compensated, even under Clause 5, for some premises essential to his business being taken from him.  I should hope that there was some way of drafting an amendment or a clause on that one vital point.</P>

      <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides that the powers conferred by the Bill shall operate only for one year.  What will be the position at the end of that period?  Will the ordinary law operate then, subject to the provisions of the Rent Restrictions Act, or will the Commissioners of the Civic Guard be still able to retain these premises, irrespective of the fact that the owners may desire to regain possession? It is laid down that three months' notice in writing may be given terminating the contract, but the assumption in Section 3 is, that the original contract shall be for not less than one year, I take it. At the end of that time will it be within the power of the owner of such premises to serve a three months' notice?  Will this Bill prevent him regaining possession of these premises provided that he requires them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>At a rough guess, I should say that the position at the end of the year would be that the Minister for Home Affairs of the day will be asking power to prolong the life of this Bill, but it was not thought right that a Bill giving rather drastic powers of this kind should have a longer single lease of life than just one year.  It may be just possible that within the year the Civic Guard will be able to find accommodation voluntarily, and naturally it would be very much preferred if it could be managed in that way.  No one likes the principle or the idea that the State should simply walk into the premises of a citizen and say that they needed them and that they must have them.</P>
      <P>I am not so optimistic as to believe that the housing question or the question of accommodation generally throughout the country will be considerably less acute than it is in twelve months time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, Senator Jameson dealt with the compulsory acquisition clause and spoke of the compulsory acquisition of stores or business premises.  I take it that in a general way it must be left to the discretion, <Col N="1335" /> and good sense of the Commissioners of Public Works, to see that the minimum of hardship or inconvenience is inflicted in putting into force the powers conferred by this Bill.  Section 5 gives powers of appeal from the decision of the Commissioners, either on the question of rent or compensation.  I think that the panel of Referees, in judging the question of rent, will advert to the loss incurred by the owner because of the taking over of a particular premises.  There are things that you cannot provide against, absolutely, by legislation.  It may be pointed out, that under this Bill, we could take over Clery's as a depot for the Civic Guard, and possibly, if that argument were to be put forward it would be unanswerable, but it is not a thing that a responsible public Department is at all likely to do, and, similarly, dealing with the towns throughout the country, in which it is proposed to establish stations, the Commissioners will take care to advert to the hardships that will be inflicted, and to the amount of inconvenience. Senator Farren asked why no compensation is to be given to caretakers. Premises occupied by caretakers, I think, are strictly unoccupied premises, with simply a paid person looking after the house and taking care of it for the owner. The question of compensation, or of alternative accommodation, for such caretaker, would become very much a matter for his employer.  Assume that the premises, instead of being acquired compulsorily, were acquired voluntarily by agreement on the question of rent, what would be the position of the caretaker in that case?  We could not accept the principle that the State, acquiring premises under this Bill should in every case, where there happened to be a caretaker in occupation, compensate that caretaker for disturbance.  The business of a caretaker is essentially a matter of contract and employment, and we do not propose to alter that situation.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might be allowed to point out that the Minister for Home Affairs in his reply has dealt only with the extreme case.  The case he dealt with is not the one we have in mind at all.  The Minister has dealt with the position of persons employed as caretakers looking after empty buildings. Now, what I have in mind is premises <Col N="1336" /> that may be acquired in which there is a caretaker who has apartments in the building as a consideration, and as portion of his wages.  It is a common practice in this country, and people are employed in certain firms and are given accommodation as caretakers, and this accommodation is portion of their wages for looking after the premises other than in business hours.  I do not anticipate there are many people who will suffer disturbance in such cases, but I would point out that the clause as it stands is liable to do great injustice to some people.  I think there is no necessity for having the clause in the Bill as it stands, at present.  If you deprive a person of regular employment such person is entitled to compensation, and if a premises is taken and that accommodation in that premises is portion of the wages paid to a caretaker, then such person is entitled to compensation. As I say, I do not think that there will be many such cases, but still care should be taken that no injustice is done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, as it stands, proposes to make provision for the dependents of the men who gave military service and who lost their lives, or were wounded, during the armed struggle in Ireland in three distinct periods, the first being the Rising of 1916, when military service was given by the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army of that time; the second, the period extending, approximately, from January, 1919, when the First Dáil came into existence, to the 6th December, 1921, the date of the signing of the Treaty with Great Britain, during this period military service was given by Oglaigh na hEireann, otherwise known as the Irish Volunteers or the Irish Republican Army; and the third, is the post-December, 1921, period, when military service was rendered by the Irish Volunteers or the present properly established Army.  The Bill is not one on which very much discussion will arise with regard to the general principles of it.  Provision, as I say, is made for the widows of the men who died during that period, for the upkeep of their children, sons up to the age of 18, and daughters up to the age of 21, and there are certain allowances for the completion of the education of children left fatherless.  In the case of men wounded during that period, to the extent of being either permanently or partially disabled, provision is made as indicated in the Schedules attached to the Bill.  The machinery for bringing the Bill into force is being rapidly organised, so that when the Bill is passed through <Col N="1338" /> the Oireachtas there will be no delay in bringing to the relatives of deceased men, or the men themselves, the assistance which the Bill provides.</P>

      <P>I think some gratitude is due to the Minister for Defence for the promptitude with which he has introduced this very important measure.  It will be generally agreed, I think, that the Bill is, in the main, equitable and satisfactory.  It represents, I think, the minimum that we owe to those who died that the Nation might survive, and to those who risked or sacrificed their limbs for the same cause.  Of course, no money can restore the lives that have been lost, or can adequately compensate the widows and the orphans or the immediate relatives of the heroic dead; but money can, at least, ensure that the widows, orphans and dependants of the men who died shall not be left in want of the necessaries of life.  It will also make provision so that the children of these men shall obtain an education that will enable them to earn a livelihood for themselves and play their part as citizens hereafter.  The provisions for the men wounded, or permanently disabled, although modest, are, at least, I think, an honest endeavour to meet, to the extent of the ability of the nation, its responsibility to those who have been maimed in its service.  Just as important, in some respects, as the amount of the pension is the provision under Section 5 whereby the Minister for Defence has power to provide for any officer or soldier who may apply for vocational training.  I hope we shall never witness here the sights that are so common in English cities, of crippled officers and soldiers trying to supplement their slender pensions by playing barrel organs on the streets, or hawking postcards, or little ornaments of one kind or another, painfully from one door to another.  In nine cases out of ten a good vocational training would render such sights unnecessary, and would also save the country from well-merited charges of having failed to do justice to its wounded men.  General approval of the inclusion of the Irish Citizen Army in the Bill will, I think be accorded, as also will the decision to treat all those who took an active part in the rising of 1916 as officers.  Because of the <Col N="1339" /> loose nature of the military organisation then, it is only fair to assume that the responsibilities were more evenly divided, and the sacrifices more evenly shared, than perhaps at any subsequent period.  It was at that time the seed was sown which was so effectively reaped in after years.  I think the people generally are conscious of what they owe to those who shed their blood so generously for an unselfish and a high ideal.  I think, because of that, the Bill will be warmly welcomed by the country, and the action of the Minister for Defence will be very deeply appreciated indeed because he has introduced this without any delay.</P>

      <P>I think, perhaps, it is necessary for me to say a few words on this Bill that is being introduced, although very little is necessary to be said.  We are all unanimous on that point.  I just want to pay tribute to those who served with me in those first days.  We served together and I know what men they were.  I know how much they all thought of giving service to their country.  None of them were looking to serve their own interests, but were willing to sacrifice their lives, and did sacrifice their lives, for their country. I think it will be recognised that these men, who succeeded in doing what generation after generation of Irishmen have tried in vain to do, ought to be honoured in every possible way.  It is a small matter to give them a little compensation, or a little money to their relations. The honour that is due to these men will be recognised by all the generations that come after us; it will be recognised that they won for Ireland her liberty and her honour after the centuries that generations of her people had suffered so cruelly.  I just want to say a word in honour of the men who died at that time, and who will be remembered for all time as the great heroes of Ireland.</P>

We are all Irishmen and we are pleased that these men who contributed to bring about Home Rule in Ireland, and to satisfying the aspirations which generations of our people have died and suffered for, and also the dependants who have suffered through their deaths, and the others who have been incapacitated by disease or the hardships which they have undergone, should now in the hour of victory be looked after and safeguarded.  I feel sure that the knowledge that the Army has been properly indemnified for the sufferings they underwent will be an encouragement and a stimulus to what I may call the regular forces of the National Army to increase the efficiency which they have already attained, and to show by their good conduct that they are worthy descendants of our other Irish soldiers.</P>

      <P>I would like to add a few words of tribute to the soldiers on whose behalf such eloquent appeals have been made to-day.  We have had great and brilliant Irish soldiers in every age. I do not wish to make any comparison between the men who fought in the periods already mentioned and those who fought in the cause of Ireland in the generations which preceded them.  There is one great distinction between the soldiers whom we are to-day endeavouring to do the merest justice to and the soldiers of the past&mdash;namely, that they were successful.  We were told one time that revolution to be justified should be successful.  When we look at the almost superhuman accomplishments of the soldiers of the past few years in the Irish Army&mdash;whether the Citizen Army or the men of 1916, or any of the others&mdash;I think we have to admit that what they did was marvellous.  We must all admit that the spirit that animated them was one which was never equalled, and certainly never surpassed in the many great struggles of the past.  We are only doing the merest and scantiest justice to them in this Bill.  We have but one regret, and that is, that, unfortunately, the great work which they made it possible for Ireland to achieve by their labours has, to a certain extent, been tied up from a monetary point of view by the unhappy <Col N="1341" /> occurrences of the past twelve months. I think that every Irishman will agree that but the merest and scantiest justice is being done to them, and I am sure that it does not require any appeal to be made to us, as we are all too happy to facilitate the passing of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I introduced this Bill in the hope that it would be unopposed. The purpose of the Bill is to enable work to be begun under this scheme sooner than it could be if we were to wait until Standing Orders for the Dáil and Seanad in relation to Private Bills and Provisional Orders had been adopted. The Council first put forward this scheme in 1911.  At that time an inquiry was held and opposition was offered by the riparian owners and the Dublin Corporation, which wished to supply the water.  Negotiations were going on when the European War broke out in 1914, and the whole matter fell into abeyance.  It was raised again recently, and an inquiry was held by an Engineering Inspector of the Local Government Department.  No opposition was offered at that inquiry.  The riparian owners were satisfied to let the scheme go <Col N="1342" /> on and the Dublin Corporation no longer desired to supply the water.  A Provisional Order, consequently, was made. I think there could be no danger in passing this confirming Bill in all the circumstances, as no opposition has been offered.  Everybody concerned has been served with copies of the Provisional Order, and has been invited to enter any protest they liked.  If there had been opposition I would not have introduced it as a public Bill, but would have allowed it to go through the scrutiny that a Private Bill would go through ordinarily. If any opposition had been offered in the Dáil I would not have gone on with it, and if there were to be opposition in the Seanad I would not desire to have it carried by a majority, because I think it is a type of legislation that should not be carried, unless there is agreement, otherwise than in the usual way and after the usual inquiries and hearings that would take place in regard to Private Bills. The scheme is a necessary one.  It is not a very expensive scheme, as it only amounts to about £11,000.  The work is necessary, and if the Bill is passed by the Seanad, and the powers given, it will enable employment to be given on necessary work immediately, and will be a very useful measure.  As I say, unless the Bill were taken as agreed, I would not press it at all on the Seanad, but I think there could be no objection to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Act confirming the Constitution of Saorstat Eireann was going through the British Parliament there was also an Act passed known as the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act.  One of the provisions of that Act provided for the setting up of a body to be called the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust, to carry out work that had been previously undertaken by the Soldiers and Sailors Department of the Local Government Board. That Department was occupied in the provision of houses with plots of land for men who had served in the British Army or the British Navy during the European War.  Certain schemes had been promulgated and adopted.  These schemes were not carried out in full when the Treaty was signed and when the Irish Free State Agreement Act was passed. Some portion of the work on the uncompleted schemes was done by the officials of the old Soldiers and Sailors Department acting directly under the British Treasury. <Col N="1344" /> With the passing of the Constitution a new position arose.  It would not have been easy, even if it had been possible, to have a British Government Department carrying out any function in the Saorstát. At the same time it certainly was desirable that provision should be made so that the work which had been begun of providing for these men, having regard to the promises given them time and again by British statesmen, should be continued. The device adopted was the setting up of a Trust consisting of five members, three representing the British Government, one representing the Government of Northern Ireland, and one representing the Government of Saorstát Eireann. It is provided in the Bill that as soon as legislation has been passed by the Parliament of Northern Ireland&mdash;which I believe has already passed this legislation&mdash;and by the Oireachtas of the Saorstát enabling the Trust to carry on its functions, and hold Land in the Saorstát, that a sum of £1,500,000 would be available for the work of the Trust.  That will certainly provide a very considerable number of houses throughout Ireland.  There is no provision in the Bill as to the way that money will be apportioned between the Six Counties and the portion of Ireland under the jurisdiction of Saorstát Eireann, but certainly on any basis a very much larger proportion of it is bound to be expended in our territory.  The need for houses for every section of the population is very great.  We all know that within the Saorstát 30,000 or 40,000 houses are wanted. It will be a great asset to this State to have this money made available for the provision of houses, apart altogether from the carrying out of the pledges given the men who will actually be put into them. That there should be money made available for the proper housing of any section of the citizens of the Saorstát is extremely desirable having regard to the great need for houses that exists.  The Government propose when the Trust has been formally set up to nominate a respected member of this Seanád, General Sir Bryan Mahon, as the Saorstát representative on the Trust and I believe he has consented to act.  The trust would have no compulsory powers to acquire land. If it does find it necessary at any time to have resort to compulsion, for the purpose of getting suitable sites at reasonable prices, these compulsory powers will be exercised through the Minister for Local <Col N="1345" /> Government at his discretion.  I do not anticipate, nor do I think the people associated with this work in the past anticipate that it will be necessary anywhere to have land acquired compulsorily. I know that they have offers of very desirable sites in or in the neighbourhood of Dublin and other places on exceedingly reasonable terms, but in case we should find any attempt to make a ring and to rob the Trust, compulsory powers to acquire sites will be available and will be exercised, if it seems in all the circumstances that they should be exercised by the Ministry of Local Government at the request of the Trust.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether he could tell us if in the original English Bill of 1919, any limitation was laid down as to the amount of land that was to be attached to these cottages.  The reason I ask is that when this matter was discussed in the Dáil one Deputy said he knew of instances where 30 acres had been allotted in one case and 5 acres in another case.  As there are 1,500 houses expected to be built under the Bill, I do not know if there was anything in the original English Bill dealing with the limitation of land to be attached to them.  I suppose the administration and the regulations will rest with the Trust and the Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I could hardly inform the Senator at the moment, whether there are any restrictions in the Act of 1919.  Certainly there will be no such thing as acquiring 30 acres of land for anyone in future.  The funds at the disposal of the Trust would not enable them to do that.  If they chose to do it they would have to do it by voluntary agreement, as no compulsory powers would be used to acquire land to the extent of 30 acres to give to anyone.  If the Trust were to be so foolish as to do so it would be hardly our concern, but I think there is no chance that it would happen.  The Trust will have to carry on its work in accordance with the regulations made by the British Treasury, and I am sure the British Treasury would not allow money to be spent in such a way.  The general complaint is that there is not nearly enough and provided to build the houses that have been promised.</P>

Of course, the people who are paying the money have the right to call the tune, and it is not right that we should interfere, but I think, if the money has been specially earmarked for the purpose of providing houses for soldiers and sailors, these houses should be built at a rent which soldiers and sailors can afford to pay.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, if land is to be acquired compulsorily the Local Government Department is practically the court to fix the price.  Is there no court of appeal? I merely ask the question because I know what happened in the attempt to acquire land compulsorily for the same purpose under the British Government.  I know a case of a townland in Meath where it was sought to acquire compulsorily 500 acres for £5,000.  When the owner objected it was immediately raised to £10.000.  He still thought that this was not an adequate sum and appealed to Judge Ross.  The sum fixed by Judge Ross, after hearing evidence, was £16,000 whereupon the Land Commission withdrew. I think there ought to be some appeal from the Local Government Department <Col N="1347" /> to a court where evidence could be heard on the part of the owner.</P>

    <Title>THE DOWLING CASE. - MOTION BY SENATOR COLONEL MOORE.</Title>
    <P>&ldquo;That in the opinion of the Seanad the British Government should release or hand over to the Irish Government Joseph Dowling, an ex-private of the Connaught Rangers, of Irish nationality, arrested in Ireland, who is at present undergoing a life sentence of penal servitude in England in respect of an offence, political or quasi-political, committed prior to the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and that in passing this Resolution, the Seanad has in mind (1) the International and Constitutional aspect of the case and (2) the adverse effect on the harmonious relations between Ireland and Great Britain produced by the continued retention of this prisoner.</P>

      <P>The resolution I have to bring before the Seanad follows to a certain extent upon the Amnesty Act passed by the Oireachtas last December.  The object of that was to pass an act of oblivion on the troubles and hostile acts that occurred during the struggle for Irish liberty.  It was hoped and expected that the British Government would reciprocate our friendly salute and that amity and good-will would arise, so that a new era of trust and confidence might replace feelings of hatred and revenge which these acts had aroused. Nothing came of that Amnesty Act, as far as the other side was concerned, except that a question was asked in the House of Commons as to whether it was the intention of the Government to pass such a bill and the answer there was that it was not, that a statement on amnesty had been made some time previously and that nothing more was required.  A little <Col N="1348" /> later, about January, some Senators and some officers of the Connaught Rangers, who were principally concerned in this matter, sent a memorandum to the English Government asking that all Connaught Rangers and all soldiers who were imprisoned in England should be released.  A week or a fortnight afterwards all the Connaught Rengers who were concerned in a certain breach of good order in India on account of Ireland were actually released.  All soldiers were let free with the exception of Private Dowling of the Connaught Rangers, whose case was somewhat different from the others. Some of us did not think that that was quite fair, and Senator Sir B. Mahon, another officer and myself went to London to endeavour to extend that amnesty to Private Dowling.  We asked for an interview with the Secretary for War, and the reply we received was that it was a Cabinet question that had already been decided and could not now be changed.  I would like to say that all the efforts that were made were made in the most conciliatory manner.  Nothing was said to which exception could possibly be taken by anybody.  The statements made did not altogether set out my views on the matter but we were determined that nothing on our part should impede the release or cause any friction whatever between the two countries.  Everything was smooth and gentle.  We were unable to get the release. I want the Seanad to understand that particularly so that they might know that everything that could be done was done by good-will and persuasion and that nothing remains now except to pass a resolution which will bring the matter prominently forward.  Unless we do that we must be content that this man be left to his fate.  He has already suffered five years' penal servitude; his sentence is for life and we know what that means.  I regret very much if any unpleasant memories should be stirred up.  We hoped that they would have been buried and not raised here, or elsewhere in Ireland, and it is only because the matter has been forced upon our attention by the failure of those across the water to reciprocate our good actions that we are bound to raise this question.  We are bound also because I do not think that it is fair that one man only should bear the responsibilities, the pains and the punishment that have resulted from seven or <Col N="1349" /> eight years' trouble in this country&mdash; trouble not caused altogether by this country but caused to a great extent by people in the other country and caused by certain politicians and men who are now in high places&mdash;that one unfortunate private soldier, who is illiterate, and who did, as he thought, what was best at the time, should be made the one sufferer in the world for all the omissions and misconceptions and mistakes and bad actions that have taken place in the last few years.  I have already circulated a statement on the subject which I daresay many Senators have read.  We all remember that after a struggle of 100 years a Home Rule Bill was passed through the House of Commons and it was countered by certain politicians and, I am sorry to say, certain soldiers, by means of threats of war, threats to stop the operation of an Act of Parliament which had already been signed by the King.  Just at this moment, when things were in a difficult and dangerous state, the Prime Minister of England came over to Ireland&mdash;for war had broken out, the Great War which lasted so many years&mdash;and he appealed to the people of Ireland to give their united support to help England; that as Ireland had been set free, there was no ill-feeling between the two nations and that we should join together in what he called opposition to the common enemy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Redmond at that time joined in that demand.  He went to the Volunteers&mdash; I was present at the time&mdash;and he made an appeal to them to join the Army and to go out and fight in France on behalf of Great Britain and Belgium.  He said that Home Rule was on the Statute Book and could never be repealed and he appealed to them  reciprocate.  I remember what happened at that time. A great many of the old troubles disappeared in a moment.  The Irish people are naturally a very generous people and are always ready to reciprocate any kindly action, and I believe they have been too ready to do so.  They joined up, and they cheered both the Prime Minister and Mr. Redmond, and the result of it was that 25,000 Irish Volunteers joined the English Army to fight for England. I remember, and we all perhaps remember, a certain incident in Bachelor's Walk when soldiers shot down innocent people, and when an English Judge condemned that action.  The feelings of the Irish people were hot and angry on <Col N="1350" /> the subject, when all of a sudden through the generous mood that the Irish take on occasions, this was forgotten and the same Regiment was cheered on its way down the North Wall to embark for France.</P>
    <P>I might say Dowling was one of those men who joined with those ideas hot in his mind to go out and fight for the Allies. No sooner were these men safely established in France than the Home Rule Bill was hung up owing to certain threats.  It was not withdrawn at that time, but it was dangled before the eyes of the Irish people as an inducement to them to enlist.  It was not until the war was over that the Act was repealed.  Some Irish people had great doubts at that time as to what would happen.  They doubted these things would be done, And I remember them saying:&mdash;&ldquo;These people will never give us Home Rule; it is our blood they want.&rdquo; It is not astonishing that, at a moment when suddenly what they had been struggling for for so many years was withheld, bitter feeling arose amongst those who went out fighting under all these fine promises.  Certain prisoners were captured by the Germans and these men discussed these matters among themselves and Sir Roger Casement, a man of genius and eloquence, came to them.  He also had his doubts, and an Irish American Priest came there and told them the same things.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising, whatever may be the rights or wrongs of the matter, which I am not going into now, that they should from a brigade to fight for Ireland.  I want it to be understood clearly that the objects of that brigade, as stated in a memorandum sent around at the time, was to fight for Ireland alone.  Remember that in no single case was it stated that they should be asked to fight for any German aims.  I dare say some people may think that a rather fine distinction. It would be difficult at that time to know how people could fight for Ireland without helping Germany, and I think that is so.  The words were very taking and they jumped at them.  I do not think the distinction much finer than the statement made by Sir Edward Carson that the Ulster Volunteers would fight against Home Rule but that they would not fight against the Imperial Parliament that passed Home Rule.  Moreover I think that some of us who have followed the history of the war remember that the Czechs who were Austrian subjects were <Col N="1351" /> captured by the Russians and they formed battalions, brigades, and divisions, and fought for the Russians and that all these actions were highly applauded by the whole Allied Press and nowhere more than by the English.</P>
    <P>All these people who were mixed up in these affairs are now in high places, but Dowling is undergoing penal servitude. He was the only one of those that joined that brigade to suffer in this way.  The actions of all the other people were not only washed out, but they were not tried or charged, and they received back pay for all the time they were in Germany. You may think that very strange conduct, but it is a fact that they received back pay for the whole time they were in Germany, and Dowling has been sentenced to penal servitude for life.  I myself am a soldier, and I am not inclined to minimise the question of mutiny or trouble of that sort.  I know quite well how serious a crime it is under any conditions.  I am not the person to advocate it.  I was very much astonished when my soldier friends, people with whom I had served many years in the Army, said that they were not prepared to go to Ulster even if ordered.</P>
    <P>I told them that I thought that an extraordinary thing, and I could never believe it from them.  But that was the atmosphere I want you to understand in which the whole of this question arose and it is not surprising that men like Dowling were influenced by that, as were men of the highest standing in the Army, such as Lord Roberts and others.  I am sorry to bring up these matters, but it is necessary in order that Dowling should not bear the whole weight of the misunderstandings and troubles of that time. Three charges were made against Dowling. One was that he enlisted into that Irish Brigade; the second was for having induced others to enlist in it; and the third was having embarked on board a certain ship with German civilians or sailors. The first charge is hardly denied; the second one, that he enlisted others, is denied.  I have read through the Courtmartial carefully and it is a doubtful question, and the evidence was very contradictory.  The third charge is a presumptive thing; possibly he did but there is no proof of it.</P>
    <P>All that is known of this matter is that he was seen one morning early on a small <Col N="1352" /> island a quarter of a mile from the shore waving his hand and asking for help from some fishermen.  The fishermen went out and brought him ashore.  There was no boat with him, and there was no submarine there.  All that is known is that he was brought on to the land.  A boat was found a few days afterwards floating about.  At the Courtmartial a great many questions arose about that boat, and experts said that it was a boat that no seaman or sailor would have constructed, Suppose that the man did actually land in a submarine, what of that?  There were many others.  I may say that Bailey, who actually did land with Sir Roger Casement, was not tried although he was actually arrested on land.  The Attorney-General said that Bailey's objects were known. His objects were to get to Ireland and to escape and as he had nothing in his possession, and as they knew nothing about him they must presume that his objects were innocent, and he was not charged at all and was allowed to go free, and was reinstated in the army, and as far as I know is serving in the English army at the present moment.  It seems strange that one man should be singled out from all the others.  We now come to the question of Amnesty.  At the time of the passing of the Treaty resolutions were passed by the British Government and the Irish Government proclaiming amnesty to all persons concerned in these affairs.  General Collins issued this statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now that a Treaty of Peace has been concluded between the people of Ireland and Great Britain, the Provisional Government hereby decree a General Amnesty in respect of all Acts committed in the course of the recent hostilities.  This amnesty extends to all members of the naval, military, police or Civil Services of the British Government, and all other persons by whom acts of hostility against the Irish people were committed, aided or abetted, whether in Ireland or elsewhere, during the past six years and the full protection of the law will be afforded to all such persons against violence or injury of any kind.  The Provisional Government appeal to all Irish citizens to respect this amnesty in the spirit and the letter.  In this, as in other matters, we must not suffer ourselves to be outdone by our late enemies in seeking that the wrongs <Col N="1353" /> of the past may be buried in oblivion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The English Government on the 12th January, 1922, issued their proclamation of amnesty as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;His Majesty the King has been pleased, at the moment when a Provisional Irish Government is about to take office, to grant a general Amnesty in respect of all offences committed in Ireland from political motives, prior to the operation of the Truce on July 11th last.  The release of prisoners to whom this amnesty applies will begin forthwith.  It is His Majesty's confident hope that this act of oblivion will act powerfully in establishing relations of friendship and goodwill between the people of Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to call attention to the fact that the Irish proclamation was very much more a generous one than that of the English Government.  The Irish proclamation made no exception as to place or time, everybody was to be amnestied.  The English Government limited itself to offences committed in Ireland and in that way by trying Dowling for acts committed in Germany they excluded him from the terms of the amnesty.  I do not think they acted quite in the spirit in which the Irish people acted.  I claim that Joseph Dowling was an Irish citizen and an Irish Soldier.  He was arrested on Irish soil and it was there he should have been tried and if convicted he should have been imprisoned in Ireland and even though he was not, but on the contrary, was tried in England, still when the Treaty was signed, he should have been handed over to the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an impression in some people's minds  before the Treaty was signed the Army belonged to England.  Everyone, and especially people who formerly held Unionist opinions, must repudiate that statement. Constitutionally the army was the army of the United Kingdom and not of England, and when under the Treaty the partnership was varied and the Union abolished, Ireland had a right to claim her share of all the assets of the United Kingdom which her resources, her brains and her soldiers had amassed.  This claim extends far beyond Joseph Dowling's; he is a mere cypher in the total.  When the Commission sits to assess the financial <Col N="1354" /> relations of the two countries and a claim is put forward against Ireland for a share of the debt, a counter claim must be made for her share of all the assets.</P>

      <P>Very well.  What I want to say is that Ireland has a right to claim everything that belongs to the country.  Both the Treaty and the Constitution, affirm the equality of the two nations, and neither side has a right to claim the whole capital of the joint concern.  The Irish soldiers ought to have been handed over, armed and equipped as they stood, and there should have been no talk of Ireland paying for arms which her taxes had paid for. She has paid twice.  When the British Government disbanded the Irish Regiments, recruited in the Free State, and withdrew her own soldiers from Ireland, she made a practical admission of these rights.  It is a breach of the Treaty to keep any Irish citizen or soldier in an English Prison for acts committed in Ireland and for Ireland.  The English Judges have practically decided that question in reference to the Deportees. <Col N="1355" /> If the Irish people standing solid behind the Irish Government do not insist on the delivery of Joseph Dowling they surrender a national right, and the most sacred duty that any Government, and any Nation owes to its citizens.  The Seanad at least will not be guilty of this default.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir BRYAN MAHON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second Senator Colonel Moore's resolution. I do not intend going into the details or the arguments which Senator Moore has so ably put before the Seanád, some of which I do not understand, and many of which I do not agree with.  As regards Dowling's release I give all my support to that, and in a few words I shall try to explain why I think the man is suffering an injustice and has been hardly treated. In my opinion, he is suffering an injustice because his treatment has been different to that of the 53 other men who were prisoners in the same category with him. Dowling was an old soldier, and a man who had always borne an excellent character in the Army.  Even before 1914, he was an old soldier having 8 or 10 years' service. In view of that, I do not think it can be urged that he enlisted originally in the Army for any political purposes or, indeed, for any purpose except to serve his King and country.  I make no excuse for the the offence Dowling committed.  He was a prisoner in Germany and joined this Irish Brigade.  I suppose that was as serious an offence as a soldier could commit but it has to be remembered there were 53 others equally guilty with him.  The fact that he served on a submarine afterwards does not, in my opinion, add to the gravity of the offence, or should in any way disqualify him from receiving the same treatment as the other 53 men. They all committed the same offence, and whether one served in a submarine, or another walked about the streets in Berlin, they were all equally guilty, and ought to have received the same treatment. As regards their leaving Germany and joining the so-called Irish Brigade, they all probably had great temptations, and I suppose were offered great inducements. Dowling gave as his reason for going on the submarine that he thought he would have an opportunity for escaping.  He was told that the submarine was going to the coast of Ireland, and he probably thought that the journey would afford <Col N="1356" /> him an opportunity to escape off the coast of Ireland which, as a matter of fact, he eventually did.  There were no incriminating documents found on him. He had £50 in his possession, but that might be accounted for in this way, that he was probably given that sum of money to land for the purpose of buying provisions such as fresh meat, etc., for those on the submarine.  Another aspect of the case is, the British Government, in 1918, made, political capital out of Dowling's arrest, and made him a much more important person than he really was.  Dowling was imprisoned in the Tower of London, very much in the same manner as, say, the Duke of Buckingham, the Earl of Kildare or many other great nobles in olden days.  He was compared to these nobles.  Dowling was considered at that time a leading figure in the so-called German Plot.  You all remember that in May, 1918, over 100 men were arrested. It was announced that they were arrested in connection with the German Plot, but not one of them was tried.  I should point out that Dowling is an illiterate man, and that being so it is hardly likely that a very intelligent and far-seeing nation like Germany would employ an illiterate soldier from the West of Ireland on a mission to this country, a mission demanding very great intelligence, a very difficult and complicated mission which was to organise a rising in Ireland.  I think we all agree it would be absurd to suggest that Germany would employ such a man on a mission of that kind.  I am not making any excuse for Dowling for what he did, but I think all these men should have been treated alike.  For that reason I think an injustice has been done to Dowling, and I think the British Government ought to release him and send him back to his home.  He has now been in custody for over five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire very briefly to support this motion.  I was one of those who actively supported the adjournment of the Amnesty Bill until the British Government actually reciprocated the policy of our own Government by releasing Dowling, and every other Irish prisoner coming within the same category, who might still be held in England.  However, after the receipt of the Message from the Dáil and the very earnest request of the President that we should pass the Bill as the surest and <Col N="1357" /> quickest method of achieving the object we had in view, I, with the other members of the Seanad, felt that there was no other sensible alternative, and we agreed to pass the Bill.  The President was very guarded in his language on that occasion lest he might be taken as promising that Dowling would be released on the enactment of the measure on this side.  Nevertheless, I think he left us all under the impression that he and his Cabinet believed that the release of the prisoner would be a natural sequence to the passing of the Amnesty Bill.  If that was the belief of members of the Government, it seems unfortunate that their confidence was very much misplaced.  As has been pointed out by the proposer and seconder of the motion, Dowling's offence, even from the British standpoint, was no more serious than the acts committed by numerous other prisoners, all of whom have since been released without any demur.  In fact, except from the point of view of giving him credit for what he might do if he got the chance, they fail to prove very much against him.  Personally, I would not like to seek his release on that ground, but rather on the grounds of the desirability of wiping out all unpleasant reminders of an unpleasant past, and of reciprocating the action that has been taken by the Government of Saorstát Eireann in passing the Amnesty Bill for all who committed acts of violence against Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  English propaganda, very ably conducted by the late Lord Northcliffe, was directed immediately before, and for some time after, the capture of Dowling, towards inciting the Bohemian and Polish troops in the Austrian Army to mutiny and to fight against Austria for the freedom of their respective countries. Either that British policy was entirely wrong or immoral or, on the other hand, Dowling was doing the right and proper and patriotic thing, according to the British ideas of right and patriotism. Surely the desire for vengeance must have been satisfied by this time.  The whole proposed expedition was a dismal failure. Sir Roger Casement was offered up on the scaffold amid the howlings of a savage mob.  Dowling has been confined in an English dungeon for five years, and the British Government has since said that the cause for which these men were <Col N="1358" /> punished is a just one after all.  We hear repeated statements made by British statesmen to the effect that they are desirous of giving the Free State Government every opportunity of giving full effect to the Treaty, and of establishing peaceful and cordial relationships between the two nations.  Yet while these platitudes are being indulged in they succeed in keeping the Government on this side in a difficult and embarrassing situation, and they incur the daily risk of causing, at least, an open diplomatic rupture.  And all this for the sake of inflicting a mean and petty vengeance on one helpless man.  The wrong is none the less serious because it is confined to one humble individual, and I hope that the Seanad will see its way to express its views in that respect by passing this resolution which, unfortunately, is the only method we have of expressing our views upon this case which never should have been dragged out to this extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. J. McLOUGHLIN Mr. J. McLOUGHLIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. McLOUGHLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the motion, as on the occasion when the Amnesty Bill was before the Seanad I doubted the wisdom of holding up the Bill as a lever to procure the release of this man.  I still think that the Seanad and the Government did the right thing in passing that Bill, which was intended to give legal effect to the proclamation of the late General Collins.  However, I confess I was considerably disappointed and surprised that when the Bill was passed and the Connaught Rangers were released, that Dowling was still kept in penal servitude. I do not understand on what principle the British Government released the Connaught Rangers and refused to to release Dowling, whose offence could be no greater in British eyes than that of the soldiers who mutinied in India. My own impression was that Dowling's treatment was due to the whim of some highly-placed Die-hard who was determined to keep Dowling in captivity to show his contempt for the Treaty and the Free State and to keep up the temperature between the two countries.  Now we learn that the continued imprisonment of Dowling is a result of the deliberate decision of the British Cabinet.  This makes it all the more incomprehensible. As far as I know the British Government and the British Cabinet, in all other respects, have honoured the obligations of <Col N="1359" /> the Treaty fairly and honestly up to the present, and I do not think that we have any grounds of complaint against them. The case of Dowling is the one black spot, and it is the one black spot that will impair the good relations between the two countries, if it is not speedily removed. No one can deny that Dowling's offence, no matter what charges were formulated against him, was a political one, and political offences should have been wiped out by the Treaty and the Amnesty that followed it.  That one political offender should be kept in prison afterwards is a breach of the Treaty, if not of the letter, at least of the spirit of it.</P>
      <P>May I mention a couple of other cases, those of the warder Leonard, and three other men, who are undergoing life sentences for participating in the attempted escape of prisoners from Derry Jail.  These men are still detained in penal servitude.  They are citizens of the Saorstát and their crime, or their offence, had a right to be wiped out and they had a right to be amnestied by the amnesty that followed the Treaty.  When one recollects the sacrifices that have been made by the Irish people and their Government, the amount of blood and treasure that they have poured out to honour the signatures of the plenipotentaries and to carry out the obligations of the Treaty, it is a poor compliment for all that they have undergone for the last eighteen months that the great British Empire should break faith with them in the small matter of refusing to release a poor soldier, whose only crime was that he tried to lend a hand in the fight which resulted in the establishment of the measure of freedom under which we sit here to-day, and the right which the British themselves justified when they signed the Treaty.</P>

      <P>I wish to add a few words in support of the resolution so ably proposed by Senator Moore.  I wish also to apologise to him for the interruption of his address.  This is a case that should be very generously dealt with by the Government of Great Britain, the Mother of Parliaments and the Cabinet of that country.  I expect several other Senators like myself were closely associated with the terrible tragedy of the war which was declared in 1914.  Personally I was closely associated, through my family, with several of its fronts, from Gallipoli <Col N="1360" /> to Palestine, from Palestine to the plains of France and Flanders, and also for three weary years with those horrible German prison camps.  Before coming up here I conversed with some of my friends, that were engaged in this conflict, with reference to this resolution, and I believe their sentiments are the sentiments of nine-tenths of the people of this country, that this poor wretched man who has already endured five years penal servitude should be immediately discharged.  I hope that the people across the channel do not imagine that the majority of the people of this country were opposed in principle to the struggle that was entered into in 1914.  They should read the eloquent remarks that fell from Senator Moore when he told us that no less than 25,000 of our people joined the colours, and of that number I believe the vast proportion entered the service of the British Crown from the district from which I come. Under these circumstances I sincerely hope and pray that this request that we ask to be sent across the channel to the British Government will be sent and that the prisoner will be soon released.</P>

      <P>When we discussed this matter some time ago we were under the impression, at least we were very hopeful, that the spirit in which we passed the Amnesty Act would have been reciprocated on the other side. I confess that I am in some degree disappointed that the spirit which we showed on that occasion was not more fully reciprocated.  At the same time, the matter may have been overlooked, and I would like to join my voice with those of the other members of the Seanad who have taken this opportunity of impressing on the British Government the advisability of amnestying Dowling.  Dowling was an old soldier.  Into the details of his case I do not intend to go.  I do not know enough about them to go into the technicalities, but we have his case very eloquently supported by two gallant soldiers in the Seanad, and surely they would not advocate anything or advise the British authorities to take any steps which would not be in accordance with military traditions.  I think Dowling should be amnestied, and amnestied at once.  I know that the present moment may not perhaps be very propitious in England, in view of the sustained efforts that are being made over there to s art a <Col N="1361" /> new anti-Irish propaganda.  At the same time, I do not think that the majority of the English people are likely to be influenced by such proceedings.  I believe we shall have them with us.  When we ask them, in the name of peace, in the name of friendship, in the interests of good relations between the two countries, for the sake of healing old sores, and contributing to a permanent peace, I think that the action taken by the Seanad will have beneficial results.  Whether the result is good or ill, I have much pleasure in supporting the motion.</P>

      <P>I think after what we have heard from, as Senator Sir T. Esmonde described them, our two gallant soldiers, as to Dowling's case, there can be only one opinion in the Seanad, that we should endeavour to secure his release. I do not deal with this case in any way from that point of view, but I consider that we ought to turn our minds as to how that is best to be attained.  Let Senators just consider for a moment, if the House of Lords had a case of the kind, and was pressing the Irish Government, not through their own Government, and not with the considered opinion of the Lower House of Parliament behind them, about a case upon which the Irish Government has a certain opinion, I cannot see that they would do much good in advocating the cause they were passing resolutions about.  I am afraid that if we pass this resolution it will end as a resolution and not produce or effect the release of the man we want released.  I am criticising our line of action from the point of view of its not being the right method to secure what we want.  I think that as one of the Houses of the Oireachtas of the Free State our first efforts should be directed to forcing our own Government to do the thing which they ought to do. I think if the Seanad appeals to the British Government their answer at once will be: &ldquo;Why do you not go to your own Government?&rdquo; I cannot see who is to answer the Seanad.  We are interested in nobody.  It ends as a resolution. Now I hold that if we want to do any good it is our own Government we should force into action.  There may be, and Senator O'Farrell seems to think that there are, reasons that lie behind. He may know more than I do about it. There may be diplomatic reasons why it is injudicious to do so.  The one thing I <Col N="1362" /> have in my mind is to get Dowling out. I do not think we should take any steps unless we are positively certain they are the best steps to get him out.  I hold that the Resolution that we should pass in the first place is to our own Government, and let the Government here say why they cannot get him out.  We have no one here to talk on behalf of the Government. We are talking as if we were a Committee amongst ourselves.  We have no one here to answer our questions.  I hold the matter will end here and that we will hear no more about it if we pass this resolution.  If we pass a resolution calling on our own Government, somebody on behalf of the Government must answer our resolution.  Then probably we are going to do some good.  If there are reasons why our own Government cannot act, and if this is found to be the best course, Senator Moore and Senator Sir Bryan Mahon can get the resolution if they want it.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Jameson is quite right, and that we are not going the right way about this thing.  Not being an old Parliamentary hand, I do not like to make a suggestion as to what the actual wording of an amendment should be, but I think it should be something in this form:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Government be requested to forward a resolution to the above effect&rdquo;&mdash;not a resolution of the Seanad, which, as Senator Jameson says, will probably be resented, just as our Government might resent a resolution from the House of Lords.  I think that conveys my meaning or the meaning that should be given to Senator Moore's intention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>This resolution calls on our Government to forward it to the British Government.  I understand that the Government has tried every means already, and that the Cabinet has been in communication with the Cabinet in England, and that correspondence passed between them with no result.  Even when they tried to get the Connaught Rangers out the Dáil failed signally, and it was only through the action of the gallant soldiers who have been referred to here in going over and bringing pressure to bear as Army men on Army men on the other side that the Connaught Rangers were liberated.  I think something stronger than this is required.  If the case is as <Col N="1363" /> stated, an unanswerable one, our attitude, without any disrespect, should take the form of a demand for Dowling's release, and that puts it up to the British Government to show cause for keeping him. Dowling would not be where he is to-day were it not that England broke faith with Ireland; and as has been stated here, in response to the appeal made in this country at the time of England's stress Dowling and other men went forward freely and joined the ranks.  Certain promises were held out that a measure of freedom would be afforded to this country by England.  It was only when England fell away from these promises and it was borne in upon the minds of these men in foreign camps that they had been cruelly deceived by England, that they took up this attitude towards England. It was because of that that Dowling was influenced to take the course that he did, and that the Connaught Rangers were also influenced.  Had England kept faith with these men, none of these things would have happened.  That being so&mdash; seeing that the British Government was the direct cause of this rebellious attitude, or mutiny, whatever it might have been &mdash;the British Government were themselves responsible for it.  The Governments are apart, and there have been declarations leading up to the Amnesty Acts passed by both Governments which, I take it, were made in good faith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that the declarations made prior to the actual drawing up of the Bills were made on the honourable understanding that there would be a mutual exchange of prisoners.  We have kept to the spirit of that understanding.  Some of us, when the Amnesty Bill was submitted here, had our thoughts and gave expression to them, knowing that the past history of England in her relationship to this country was a series of broken pledges which we could not forget, and we tried to introduce into the Amnesty Bill a clause that would cover Dowling's case. The President, who possibly was in closer touch, or led us to understand so, at least, with those in power on the other side, assured us that we would not be benefiting Dowling's case by pressing this clause or by holding up the Bill, and those of us who took the other view gave way.  Are you to go through the whole process again?  The Dáil has expended all <Col N="1364" /> its efforts and has failed.  Those in this Seanad who should have most influence with the British Government and with the British Army authorities have also failed. I think unless you can impart into your resolution something stronger than what is conveyed in its wording, you will meet with failure again, and I think the resolution should be that the Government be requested to demand the release of this Irish prisoner.</P>

      <P>Would the following words meet the difficulty?  &ldquo;We ask the Free State Government to draw the attention of the British Government to the following facts.&rdquo;  Then the resolution would go as it is at present until after the words &ldquo;Anglo-Irish Treaty,&rdquo; and would then say: &ldquo;And that the continued detention of this prisoner has an adverse effect on the harmonious relations between Ireland and Great Britain.&rdquo;  At present we are writing a letter but we are not making any arrangements to put it into the pillar box or to have it delivered on the other side of the Channel.  I merely suggest that we adopt the usual postal arrangements.  I move that as an amendment.</P>

      <P>If what Senator Sir Bryan Mahon says is right I have nothing more to say, but if we agree with Senator Jameson that it is rather for the Government of the Free State to approach the British Government with regard to the detention of this man, I think we should be carrying this intention better into effect and with more deference to the Free State Government and to our own dignity if we simply forward Senator Moore's resolution to the Government, requesting them to take such action to carry the resolution into effect as they might think fit.  It is for them to take the necessary steps in accordance with our resolution, but if the Senator who proposed it is content with that amendment I have nothing more to say.</P>

      <P>I think it might possibly be convenient to adjourn the discussion until to-morrow, that is if the Seanad agrees, and the various members who are making suggestions might possibly come together and circulate before to-morrow an agreed amendment to the resolution which would probably lead to unanimity.  There will be no difficulty in continuing the debate <Col N="1365" /> to-morrow, if that be the wish of the Seanad.  I throw that out simply as a suggestion.  Four different suggestions have been made, but only one definitely in the form of an amendment which has not been seconded, and it is rather difficult to deal with the matter.</P>

      <P>The reason I interfere at this stage is because Senator Yeats got up and read an addition that might bring Senator Jameson's ideas into agreement with Senator Moore's.  Senator Jameson pointed out that the resolution led us practically nowhere.  It merely emphasised the fact that this man was in prison.  Senator Jameson was right in that, that we ought to have something else in it.  Senator Moore pointed out to us that when the Treaty between the two countries was agreed to it was implied that the release of Dowling along with others would have been carried out. These implications are on the heads of the people of this country and England.  I think we ought to add to the resolution &ldquo;that the Seanad desires the Government of Saorstát Eireann to see that all the implications of the Treaty be given effect to by the British Government.&rdquo;  I think that would get us over the difficulty.  I do not like that we should be in the position that the Seanad should be begging of the British Government to have this man released.  I do not think that is a position that we should take up.  If there are implications by the Treaty we ought to insist on their being carried out. I think the amendment would help this Government.  There is no reason why we should keep all the provisions of the Treaty, and that they could get out of any of them.  We hold to them hard and fast; let us get the whole hog or none.  If Senator Moore would accept my proposal I am prepared to move it.</P>

      <P>If there is any desire that the Seanad should adjourn it would be absurd for me to oppose it, and I would not do anything of the sort. I may not agree with any of the proposals or suggestions made, but nevertheless I defer to the wishes of the Seanad and I am quite ready to agree to an adjournment on this matter.  I only say for the present that I desire the resolution to be made as strong as possible.  I am always considered rather an extremist and too violent in my opinions and statements, and for that reason I try to moderate them to come level with more moderate people, as far as I can, but this matter was very carefully considered again and again, and redrafted two or three times and submitted to several people.  It was drafted with the help of lawyers and in <Col N="1367" /> consultation with others interested in the matter.  We must remember that the Government has been trying all along, and I hope no one will think that this is an attack on the Government.  Nothing of the sort.  The first thing I did after the Treaty, was to go to members of the old Dáil whom I knew, to get them interested in the matter, and I suppose they did all they could.  I went to members of the Government and I found they had already made these efforts and failed, and I made <Col N="1368" /> these efforts again by my own initiation and failed.  For that reason, I think it is rather a question, for the Dáil and Seanad individually rather than the Government, which has already failed admittedly to get him out.  They told me so.  I am ready to agree to the suggestion for an adjournment.</P>
