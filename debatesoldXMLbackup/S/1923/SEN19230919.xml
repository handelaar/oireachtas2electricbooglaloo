      <P>I should like to inform the Senators that through the courtesy of the Speaker of the Dáil the small gallery in the Dáil will be reserved for any Senators who wish to attend the proceedings there after our proceedings have concluded.  Another matter I would like to refer to is this. Up to the present our Standing Orders made no provision as to our procedure upon the first meeting of the new Dáil and the summoning of the Oireachtas as a consequence, nor have we any provision made regulating our procedure as regards the reception of the Governor-General's address.  It is desirable that Standing Orders should be framed dealing with matters of this kind and probably the Seanad will be anxious that that should be one of the matters taken up at once by the Committee on Standing Orders after it has been appointed or reappointed.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask on a point of order how we can do any business to-day, because I received a notice&mdash;and I think most other <Col N="2" /> Senators did&mdash;asking me to attend an informal meeting of the Seanad, whatever that may be.  How can an informal meeting of the Seanad elect Committees which bind the Seanad for the whole Session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">

      <P>I am very glad to see, notwithstanding the receipt of that notice, that not only was the Senator able to be present, but that we have a very good attendance of Senators. I am not responsible for the expression &ldquo;informal,&rdquo; but I am responsible for asking the Clerk to inform Senators that the business would be of a formal character, and they will see, if they look at the Order Paper, that that is an exact description of what business there is.  The only business we have is the re-election of certain Standing Committees, and I certainly was not going to leave Senators under the impression that we met to-day for the transaction of business in the ordinary way.  I thought it would be desirable and in their interest that they should be told that the only reason we met to-day was because of the Oireachtas having been summoned.  As the Oireachtas was summoned I thought it was only right and fair and proper that the Seanad should be convened.  At the same time, as Senators might have found it very inconvenient to attend to-day, I thought it proper to let them know that the business would be of a purely formal character.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The first business is the appointment of Senators under Standing Order No. 3.  That Order deals with the appointment of certain Senators to act as temporary chairman in case of the unavoidable absence of the Chairman or Deputy-Chairman. Last Session Senator Sir T. Esmonde and Senator O'Farrell were appointed, and if it is the wish of the Seanad I would suggest that their places should be taken for the coming Session by Senator Westropp Bennett and Senator MacPartlin.</P>

      <P>The next business is the appointment of the Selection Committee for the ensuing Session.  I shall read to the Seanad the list of the Committee as at present standing, and if the Seanad consider it desirable they can re-elect the Committee, or if any Senator wishes to substitute any name he can do so.  The Committee at present consists of Senators Jameson, MacLoughlin, O'Dea, MacPartlin, Butler, MacLysaght, Guinness and Barrington.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering this Committee is to be elected by proportional voting is it correct to re-elect them in this way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, quite correct, if there is no opposition.  The election is only required in the event of <Col N="4" /> there being additional candidates.  If the proposition is to re-elect the Committee as it stands I do not think the necessity for proportional representation comes into the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a clear case why this Committee should be reappointed because it has only recently been elected and has not functioned, as it had no work to do, because no Committees have been appointed since it was elected.</P>

      <P>The only remaining business is the appointment of the Committee on Standing Orders. Probably the Seanad will agree that they should re-appoint the former Committee, as speaking for them, except for the Chairman, I can say they were very attentive to their work and did it exceedingly well.  There are some important matters still remaining to be dealt with, so that I think it would be better to leave them in the hands of those who were entrusted with the task up to the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you leave this question I wish to raise a matter that I have already raised several times.  We are completely in the dark at the present time, so far as Standing Orders are concerned, of the prescribed formulas that should be complied with for Private Bill legislation.  It is a very important matter, and if any Private Bills were proposed to-day no one knows the procedure that would have to be gone through.  It is pretty near the time when Private Bill legislation is usually introduced, so that I think it would be very desirable that attention <Col N="5" /> should be paid to the matter.  Of course it can only be done in combination with the Committee that deals with the matter in the Dáil.  It is essential that the Standing Orders there and in the Seanad should be the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter was taken in hands and was completed in the previous Session of the Dáil and the Seanad.  There was a small Joint Committee, and it was agreed by this Committee that Standing Orders should be drawn up under the supervision and advice of Counsel. That was done, and the Standing Orders were approved of by the Committee. I think nothing but the dissolution prevented them from being given effect to.  Everything is ready, and I do not think there will be any delay in having the Standing Orders brought into shape, printed and published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>You realise the importance of having them.  I was not aware they were available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think they were available as they had not been approved of by either the Dáil or the Seanad, but they got so far as to be in print.  There is nothing to prevent them being put into force the moment they are sanctioned by both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be extremely desirable, in my opinion, to urge the desirability of having them approved of as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the position is that the Standing Orders have not actually been approved of by the Joint Committee yet.  They are complete, and they were to be the next business for consideration by the Standing Orders <Col N="6" /> Committee.  I am informed that to-day or to-morrow the Dáil will have before it the appointment of this Committee, and that it will be possible to submit the Orders, which are now in draft form, to the Joint Committee.  No doubt the report can then come on at an early date.</P>
      <P>Motion put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Before the Seanad adjourns I should inform Senators that so far as the business of the Dáil is concerned, it is not likely to require any assistance from this House in the way of a meeting or otherwise, before Tuesday week.  I understand that is the day on which there is likely to be a joint sitting of the Oireachtas for the purpose of receiving the Governor-General's address.  It may be that, for the purpose of appointing Joint Committees or otherwise, a meeting of the Seanad may be required in the interval, and therefore I would suggest that the best way is to leave matters as they stand in the Standing Orders so that I shall have power, if I find there is no business for next week, to abstain from calling a meeting.  On the other hand, if I find the Seanad is required before Tuesday week I will, of course, summon a meeting and issue a formal notice.  I think the best plan is to adjourn now generally, if it is the wish of the Seanad.</P>
