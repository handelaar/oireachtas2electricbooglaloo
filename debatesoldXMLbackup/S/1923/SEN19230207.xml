      <P>I regret to have to announce that Lord Glenavy is unable to be here to-day.  He has written to me from London, asking me to apologise to the Seanad for his absence.  His daughter, who has been seriously ill, was to have undergone a very serious operation about ten days ago, but, owing to illness, that operation had to be postponed until this week. Lord Glenavy expected to have been back in time to be here to-day, but, unfortunately, he will not be here either to-day or to-morrow.  He asked me to apologise to the Seanad and state the reason of his absence.</P>

      <P>The following is the message:&mdash;&ldquo;I have to inform you that the following resolution was passed by Dáil Eireann on the 13th January, 1923:&mdash;&lsquo;That the Bill be recommended to Seanad Eireann, with the following message:&mdash;&ldquo; Dáil Eireann again desires the agreement of Seanad Eireann to the Indemnity (British Military) Bill, 1923, and while appreciating the reasons stated by Seanad Eireann for adjourning consideration of the Bill, urges upon the Seanad that the object which both Houses have in view would be best attained by the speedy passage of the Bill into law.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There has been a certain amount of misunderstanding with regard to the position of this Bill.  As I under <Col N="222" /> stand it, the resolution passed by the Seanad adjourned consideration of the Bill&mdash;that is, held it up, as it is entitled to do under the Constitution; and if no further action is taken by Seanad during the period of 270 days, then the Bill would automatically become law, as we have no power to hold it up for any longer period.  It has been stated in the Press that the Bill was returned from the Seanad to the Dáil.  That is a mistake.  A message was sent by the Clerk informing the Dáil of our decision, but it is not correct to state that the Bill was returned.  A message has now been received from the Dáil with reference to this Bill.  The Standing Orders which we passed made no provision for the procedure to be adopted in the event of a message being received from the Dáil. We have already referred the question of the relations of the two Houses, including a question such as the receipt of a message or the sending of a message, to our Standing Orders Committee, and we will in due course receive a report from them, proposing, no doubt, additional Standing Orders to deal with such matters. Having no Standing Orders at the moment to deal with this matter, it seemed to me the right course was to place the message received from the Dáil on the Orders of the Day.  If the Seanad desires to act in accordance with the message that has been received, it would be necessary first of all to table a motion for the rescinding of the previous motion, and for that purpose the assent of twenty Senators would be required.  I understand the President intends to speak on the subject matter of this message. Meantime I think we will be quite in order in discussing the message for at least a reasonable time without any formal resolution.</P>

      <P>I understood there would be no discussion on that particular message to-day.  I had a motion to bring forward dealing with the matter, but as you have stated that the whole thing is to be referred to the Standing Orders Committee I do not see that there is any necessity for a discussion now.  Of course we will be delighted to hear the President speaking, but as far as the message from the Dáil is concerned I think it should be referred to the Standing Orders Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill that the Dáil has asked you to reconsider is an Amnesty Bill which has been passed by the Dáil in pursuance of a Proclamation issued by the late Commander-in-Chief, General Collins, on the 10th February, 1922, reading as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Now that a Treaty of Peace has been concluded between the peoples of Ireland and Great Britain, the Provisional Government hereby decree a General Amnesty in respect of all acts committed in the course of the recent hostilities.  This amnesty extends to all members of the naval, military, police or civil services of the British Government, and all other persons by whom acts of hostility against the Irish people were committed, aided or abetted, whether in Ireland or elsewhere, during the past six years, and the full protection of the law will be afforded to all such persons against violence or injury of any kind.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Provisional Government appeal to all Irish citizens to respect this amnesty in the spirit and in the letter. In this, as in other matters, we must not suffer ourselves to be outdone by our late enemies in seeking that the wrongs of the past may be buried in oblivion.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the spirit in which the Dáil considered this Bill, not as a matter of bargaining, not as a contract or an agreement between one side and another, but rather as an act of grace and something in regard to which, even if it were a thing that the other side agreed to this proposal in principle and did not, perhaps, act in the way in which everybody anticipated, at any rate it could not be said of us that we did not perform our duty with regard to those who were our late enemies in anything but a spirit of the most perfect goodwill and cordial co-operation towards wiping out all the bitternesses and all the troubles that we experienced during the last few years.  It was not in any spirit of bargaining that the late Commander-in-Chief issued that Proclamation, and in any of the business that we have had under consideration in the Dáil, at no time can it be said that we traded on the memory of the late Commander-in-Chief or the late President.  In every act that we carried <Col N="224" /> out, or in the performance of any duty that we have had to discharge, we at all times endeavoured to carry out in the spirit and the letter, so far as it lay in our power, any undertaking or any promise given by either of those two great Irishmen. In pursuance of that we passed this Amnesty Bill, and the Dáil, in the same spirit, ask the reconsideration by this Seanad of that measure, and ask that it should be passed in the same spirit of good-will, and with the same generous, cordial feeling that has been shown in the Dáil.  I think that if the matter be considered in the light of the possible result of the Seanad holding up this Bill in pursuance of the resolution that they have adopted, it will be seen at once that a certain number of months will pass by and the Bill will automatically come into operation, and be passed into law over the head of this Assembly.  That is certainly a thing that I think, on consideration, the members of the Seanad would not wish.</P>
    <P>This is the first occasion on which I have addressed the Seanad.  We all understand the difficulty of arranging business between the two Houses, and of the attendance of Ministers here for the consideration of decisions, or the reconsideration of decisions, that have been arrived at by either House.  That is a matter which, I expect, will have to be dealt with rather delicately.  I think the Senators, generally, will not quarrel with me if I say, that this Seanad represents all sections of the community in the country.  It may, perhaps, not represent all sections of the country in the proportion in which the country could be best represented if we were to take into consideration the various elements in it which require representation, but I put it to Senators, that in this matter, if there were any objection, it ought to come from the House in which popular feeling is more generously represented perhaps than it is here, and that this Seanad, as it is constituted, can scarcely have a quarrel with the individuals who took part in any act of hostility which we are seeking, by this particular instrument.  to wipe out from our memory.  One particular objection put forward against the passing of this Bill was, that at least one prisoner, or possibly more <Col N="225" /> prisoners, had not been liberated.  I believe, and I explained at some length in the Dáil in connection with that particular prisoner Mr. Dowling, that I was not personally acquainted with all the circumstances of the case, or so completely in touch with the activities of Mr. Dowling as to enable me to make the representations that might otherwise be made if it were a thing that I had complete and ample information as to his activities. It prejudiced to some extent my representations to the British Government, but it did not, in my opinion, prejudice the case of Mr. Dowling.  If the interests of this Seanad are bound up in that particular case, I suggest, for the most careful consideration of the Seanad, that the interest of this particular man are not served by holding up this Bill.  We have taken up the cases of prisoners who, properly speaking, do not come within the terms of this amnesty that was published by the late General Collins, or the amnesty that was passed by the British Government. We have succeeded in a great many cases.  We have not succeeded in all cases.  I have yet to meet the man who has succeeded in everything he has undertaken.  I suppose it would not be disrespectful of me to refer to some of the arguments put forward here for holding up this Bill.  They are arguments that are new to me.  I trust the gentlemen who made those remarks will not take it that I intend to be in any way disrespectful, but I must say that the particular line of argument pursued did not appeal to me, because for some years past I have been in touch with, I think, most of the people who represent popular opinion in this country, and I do not know that at any time during that period any big body of opinion in this country clung to, or reposed any great faith in, the institution known as the United Kingdom.  It did not appeal to people.  A very large section of the country supported the idea that the Union was an immoral thing&mdash;that it was not an Act that any country could legitimately, or legally, attach any real signification to.  From that point of view, instead of the term &ldquo;the United Kingdom,&rdquo; for the last twenty years I have myself always heard people speak of England, Ireland, and Scotland as the Three Kingdoms, but that is simply an aside.  The real thing that we are endeavouring to do, and <Col N="226" /> that has prompted the introduction and passing of this Act, is that even though there may be some misgivings in the minds of people that the British Government has not, perhaps, done all that we would wish them to do, that we at any rate, on our side, desire to show that, as far as the individuals are concerned who were engaged in active hostility against us for the past, five, six, or seven years, we are prepared to wipe out all these differences; that we want to start anew, and wish to have no bitter memories; and that, as far as we are concerned, we freely and fully forgive them.  It is in that spirit that I commend the consideration of this Bill to the Seanad, asking them to pass it in the same way as the Dáil was asked to pass it, and to do that fine act of grace.</P>

      <P>I understand that we are not at present in a position, or entitled by the Orders of the Seanad, to speak on this matter, or raise any discussion on it whatsoever.  That cannot be done until a memorandum has been signed by 20 members asking that the question be re-opened.  I wish to know if I am right in that view?</P>

      <P>My understanding of the position is that we cannot take any stage of the Bill until the previous resolution has been rescinded in accordance with the Standing Orders, which means that a resolution rescinding it must be tabled, showing the assent, in writing, of 20 Senators.  I do not think, however, it is out of order to discuss the message that has been received from the Dáil.  We can do that without prejudice to any future orders that we may make with regard to messages passing between the two Houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought not, myself. I wish to say a few words in reply to the President's statement.  At the outset I desire to mention that I have myself tabled a resolution which I may mention is in agreement with the proposal made by the President to the effect that we should agree to continue the discussion on the Amnesty Bill.  I think, considering that the Government <Col N="227" /> have taken upon themselves the responsibility in this matter, it would be wrong for us to step in and continue to object any longer.  That is my personal view.  I have, therefore, tabled a resolution, and any Senator who desires to sign it can do so.  The resolution asks that the Amnesty Bill be again brought before the Seanad, and if 20 members sign the resolution that can be done, as I understand from the Deputy-Chairman. That is all I have to say on that point.  With regard to what the President has said just now, I must take great exception to his statement that the members of the Seanad are not as much interested in the prisoners as the Dáil.  In my opinion the members of the Seanad are just as much interested in the prisoners as are the members of the Dáil, or any other popular assembly, and they have a keen desire to see all the Irish prisoners in England, or elsewhere, liberated at once.  I hold, too, that the members of the Seanad are just as much entitled as the President or members of the Dáil to make a fight for the release of these men, and I think the suggestion that there is any difference of right, as between the members of the two Houses, to take steps in the matter should not be made.  I have been mixed up in matters of this kind all my life, even, perhaps, before the President was interested in them, or, probably, before he was born.  Therefore I really resent now that he is my junior, his coming in here and saying I have no longer any right to have an opinion on that subject because I am a member of the Seanad. It seems to me quite an extraordinary statement.  I dare say that the President really did not mean any such thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope not.  I think he referred to some arguments of mine with reference to the United Kingdom, and made a statement that there was no such thing as a United Kingdom.  I am quite in accord with him in that matter. In the arguments I used I took the English point of view, and argued from that point of view, from the English constitutional <Col N="228" /> point of view that they had no right to hold our prisoners.  In the same way he says he has known a great many people who do not recognise the United Kingdom.  I do not differ very much from him in that.</P>

      <P>I have already stated that we had no Standing Orders dealing with the receipt of messages from the Dáil, and I suggested it would be convenient until we got those Standing Orders that a reasonable time might be allowed to discuss a message from the Dáil, as an act of courtesy, and I understood I had the assent of the Seanad in allowing the discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument I put forward, and which I am trying to maintain was that whether it was the United Kingdom or three separate Kingdoms&mdash; and mind you his argument is more in favour of what I brought forward than my own, as I was arguing from the English constitutional point of view, and if there was any such thing as a United Kingdom or if there were three separate Kingdoms, what the President says holds then all the more&mdash;England has no right to keep our prisoners, because they are keeping prisoners belonging to a foreign State. Whichever way you put it my argument holds&mdash;whether there was never a United Kingdom, or whether it is a United Kingdom no longer.  What I put forward before was that the military authorities of that day had the right from their point of view, from the point of view of military discipline, to punish people who mutinied.  Those soldiers, whether Irish or not, enlisted under regulations which they understood perfectly well.  I am not going to question that.  What I do say is that once the two countries became separate Ireland had the right to her prisoners just the same as England had to hers, and that we had no right to keep English prisoners in our prison any more than England had to keep our prisoners in hers.  The two countries are equal. Although they may have had the right to keep their prisoners in until the Treaty, once the Treaty was passed it became illegal and a breach of the <Col N="229" /> Treaty to hold them, because I hold that the two countries are equal, and each had a right to claim back its prisoners.  If that is not so&mdash;if England, as a superior Power, has a right to keep our prisoners, then we are not equal. Not only Irish citizens but Irish soldiers like Dowling owe their allegiance only to the Free State.  If that is not so, I will have to change my opinion very much about this Treaty.  I think all Irishmen would have to do so&mdash;because it would recognise England as a superior Power. If I am a believer in the Treaty and in the Constitution, England and Ireland are equal.  So far, at all events, the Treaty between the two countries does not cover it.  I think I will not go beyond that now.  It would be too long. I have answered the two arguments put forward by the President.</P>

      <P>I only want to correct what, in my opinion, is a misunderstanding of the President's position, and the position he took up in his statement to you.  I think Senator Moore has made a grave mistake in attributing to the President any desire to belittle our representative position. There is no doubt&mdash;I do not think anybody here would deny it&mdash;that the Dáil more fully represents the popular feeling than we do.  Fully half of the Seanad were indebted to nominations as representing certain interests.  Therefore, although I am sure our opinions are of extreme value, yet I do not think we could claim that they are quite as representative as those of the Dáil.  I only wish to draw your attention to what I think must be a misconception on the part of Senator Moore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHN THOMAS O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it is unnecessary to state, notwithstanding some flippant statements in another place to the contrary, that those of us who voted for the adjournment of this measure had only one object in view, and that was the release of the few unhappy men condemned to spend the best years of their lives behind English prison bars for political offences committed prior to, or immediately after, the signing of the Truce.  We were anxious, and are still anxious, for obvious reasons, to obliterate every unpleasant reminder of an era fraught with racial strife, hatred, and bitterness, so that the <Col N="230" /> atmosphere in which the new State is struggling for existence and stability might not be poisoned by the tainted breeze from the past.  I think if some of the statements made to-day on the part of the Government had been made when the Bill was introduced on the last occasion, our decision might possibly have been different.  It is hard to understand how it comes about that the English, who honoured the other implications of the Treaty in a fairly reasonable manner, should spoil the moral effect of much that has been done by clinging tenaciously to a few prisoners where thousands have been released.  In view of the remarks made by the President to the effect that it is the opinion of him and his Cabinet, and, indeed, of the Dáil, that the best interests of these men would be served by passing this Bill, I believe that we should hardly be justified in adhering to the policy of holding it up until the last of the hostages is released. But it should be made clear that if the Bill is passed as a result of these statements, that on the people responsible for them will naturally rest the main responsibility for the ultimate result.  I presume we should feel grateful, and should express our gratitude, for the many well-meant hints and more or less weighty lectures to which we, as an Assembly, have been treated during the discussion on this and other measures in another place.  Well, one can understand the anxiety of a father as to the good conduct of his first-born, but one might also reasonably question the wisdom of rebuking or punishing a child in anticipation of some shortcomings or indiscretions of which he might possibly be guilty in the dim and uncertain future.  For the sake of the child we hope that in this particular instance he will profit by the shortcomings and indiscretions of his father, rather than blindly follow his example.  I am sure we are very grateful to our overzealous parent, three months our senior, but we would respectfully remind him&mdash; and I am now speaking collectively of another place&mdash;that the possession of power, either real or assumed, should not in itself be sufficient justification for dispensing with the elementary rules of courtesy and etiquette, and that the line between comedy, such as that which has been displayed elsewhere, and another <Col N="231" /> accomplishment of a less flattering description is a somewhat narrow one, which not even an old man, having any regard for his own dignity or self-respect should cross very lightly.</P>

      <P>When this Bill was brought before us, if there had been a Minister here, a representative of the Government, to tell us what the Government's intentions were, and what they wanted us to do, then I think this Bill would have been passed immediately. Senator Moore's motion would probably have been discussed, and that discussion would have served all the purposes that Senator Moore wished.  The disability we labour under here is that we have no representative of the Government in this Seanad.  We should, at least, have a couple of Ministers here, men who, on such occasions as this, would put before us the intentions of the Government.  Then a deadlock of this description would not arise. Of course, as it has arisen we shall have to adopt whatever course the Standing Orders say should be applied to this motion.  I think Senator Moore in his references to the President did not quite understand or accurately quote him.  The President did not want to draw, I am sure, the distinction that Senator Moore put in his mouth as to the relative merits of the two Houses in discussing a question of this kind.  I hope that the President will begin to rearrange his Cabinet, and when he finds an opportunity of creating another Minister, that he will select a Minister from this Seanad, and, therefore, that the Minister will be able to interpret the wishes of the Government to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS H. GRATTAN ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this debate is an illustration of the extreme difficulty under which we are endeavouring to carry on our business.  Of course, in the beginning we must expect a certain amount of difficulty in working the machinery of legislative administration.  It is no harm perhaps, that these difficulties should arise.  In a sense, the sooner they arise the better, because then we may be able to take whatever steps are necessary to remedy them.  I have listened to the President, and I have listened to Senator Moore.  If I might deal with the President's speech first, I <Col N="232" /> do not think there was any intention on the part of the President to lecture this Seanad.  Some of my colleagues seem to imagine that there was.  I do not think so.  I am not very much a believer in lectures, because they are always open, at all events, to a reply, and if one party starts the lecture, then the other is bound to reciprocate, and that might lead us into all kinds of curious channels.  I do not think the President had any intention of lecturing us.  On the other hand, I do not think that Senator Moore was desirous of doing anything very unkind to the President or to anyone else, and I quite sympathise with him in his desire to see these prisoners released.  He has a perfect right to express these sentiments; so have we all the right to express all our sentiments without being accountable to anybody except ourselves for the expressions to which we give utterance.  As I understand the situation at the present moment, it is this: An amnesty was agreed upon at the time of the Treaty by England and Ireland. It was agreed by the negotiators on both sides that a general Act of Amnesty should be passed, and that England should do her part in the matter of passing an Indemnity Act and Ireland should do the same.  I understand England has passed her Indemnity Act.  I take it she has.  We are now in process of passing our Indemnity Act.</P>

      <P>I proceed on that assumption that England has not passed its Indemnity Act. If England has not passed an Indemnity Act, then that complicates the situation. I understood that she had, and that she was acting upon that Indemnity Act in releasing certain Irish prisoners.  Certain Irish prisoners have been released.  The Connaught Rangers in India have been released.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to say I am not very well posted in these matters.  That was the general situation as I understood it.  Proceeding <Col N="233" /> with that argument, I should say, if you are going to make peace, make peace and be done with it.  There is no use in carrying on these inveterate sores and these ancient blisters that do so much to make bad feeling between the two countries.  I absolutely agree with Senator Moore.  He expresses the sentiments that I have held all my life, that England and Ireland are two equal countries and in all their dealings with one another the proper position for them to take is that they are <i>ex aquo.</i> Ireland treats with England as an equal sovereign nation and England treats with Ireland as an equal sovereign nation.  Then we come to the practical point; what can we do in this matter? I understand that there are either one or two prisoners still in English gaols; one prisoner called Dowling, who I understand was associated with Sir Roger Casement in the landing.</P>

      <P>Then I am wrong.  At all events he was put in prison because of some action he took in connection with Irish politics.  I would put it to the English Government, &lsquo;What earthly good does it do them to keep this man in prison?  If you are going to have an amnesty why not let him out?&rdquo; Certainly in his endeavours to release Dowling Senator Moore has my entire sympathy.  I think the only question now is what can we do.  We perform a gracious act, if we say to the English people, &ldquo;Well, we rely upon your goodwill and we rely on you to reciprocate it; we rely on you to pass this Act&mdash;we will not say on the understanding that our prisoners are to be released&mdash;we will not put it that way, but we expect that you will take note of this proceeding and that whatever Irish prisoners you have you will treat them as we would treat English prisoners if we had them under our control.&rdquo; The situation is really a bit awkward. Our Standing Orders afford us an excuse for delaying the matter a little bit longer, but inasmuch as peace is made, or said to have been made between these two countries by the Treaty I for one would not be prepared to put relatively small impediments in the way of a better <Col N="234" /> understanding.  I think both England and Ireland should try to forget their differences and should try to be friends in future, and, so far as we are concerned, if we can help in any way I should be very glad to help in that direction.  Whatever action Senator Moore sees fit to take in the matter of asking the Seanad to reconsider this he can count on my support.  I think he has done very well so far as he has gone, and he has certainly called attention to a case that should have been attended to, and I think the President has also treated us with his customary courtesy and he has made his case plain.  If we are not correctly informed in the matter he will inform and correct us, but I would again remind the Seanad of the extreme difficulty we are in, and have been in, from the beginning in conducting our business and co-operating so far as we may in the government of the country owing to the peculiar relations that exist between our chamber and the other chamber.</P>

      <P>We are sitting here under a definite Constitution.  It has never been suggested in the Dáil that we have exceeded our powers. I think we did what we have a perfect right to do, and if we are now adopting a different attitude, it is because the mature opinion of the Government is that these prisoners run a better chance of being liberated by such action as we are asked to take by the President, and it is largely as an act of grace that we would be inclined to vote for the recision of the previous resolution.  We were told, apparently, in the other House that we were not to be taken seriously.  Well, we took ourselves seriously, and apparently our action made the other House take us so seriously that it was necessary for the President to come here to cool our temperature.  He has not cooled me so far.  I would still resist if I thought my action would release one prisoner. We spoke fully before about what we felt.  I shall not allude to this again; but this I shall say, that we did not exceed cur powers, and when the day comes I hope we may still make good, even as we have done in this Bill; and, as a cooling Chamber, having cooled, that we may do useful work, and even, having cooled, that we may incubate.  I feel strongly <Col N="235" /> that we can do many things, and as a supporter of the original Resolution, and as an act of grace to the President and his Cabinet, I will vote for rescinding the Resolution.</P>

      <P>In answer to a point that was raised by Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde, who asked what act had been performed by the British Government in connection with this, I wish to say that a Royal Proclamation was issued giving a pardon&mdash;I forget the exact terms, I was ill at the time.  It was published some time last year, but I have just remembered the circumstances, and I have had corroboration of that now from our Law Advisor, that that was the form in which their part of the transaction was completed.</P>

      <P>I supported Senator Moore's Resolution, and, having heard the President, I hold the same attitude still.  I think that in a matter of this sort the Dáil was rather premature in taking the initiative.  Surely in the interchanges between the two Governments on a matter of this sort of mutual interest and of mutual concern some pour-parlers might reasonably have been expected in order to test the attitude of the English Government with regard to the entire matter of the withholding of the freedom of the Irish prisoners in her jails, and then Bills could have been introduced at the same time, both in the English Parliament and in the Dáil.  I am sure the matter would have gone through.  I have not the sublime faith in British Ministers that some in this Seanad seem to have; I do not think that anything in her history, or in the history of the connection between the two countries, would justify us in even hoping that these prisoners would be released as a result of this act of grace which we are now asked to perform.  All our history points in the opposite direction.  Any generous conduct on the part of Ireland in the past has not been responded to by the English Government.  Whether the altered relations now may change their attitude or not.  I do not know, but it has always been the practice of England in her dealings with Irish affairs, and with Irish requests to keep what is generally termed as something up her sleeve, to keep something in reserve in order that afterwards when pressure is applied, and more than pressure, when threats have been applied, that England might have it in her power to make some gracious concession.  That has always been our experience of the attitude and the practice of the British Government in the past.  Now, it may be different to-day. I do not know what private information the President may have as to the general feeling on the other side. The Minister may have some private information which would warrant him in coming to the Seanad, and assuring us, and it is on his assurance we are now going to act, that it will be in the best <Col N="237" /> interests of the prisoners that we should withdraw our opposition.  We are entirely acting upon that now in what we are to do, on the assurance the President has given us on what warrant and what foundation he knows best himself, but if the prisoners are still withheld after we withdraw our opposition, unreasonably withheld, certainly the blame cannot rest with the Seanad.</P>

I would not like it to be understood that I gave any guarantee, or that I indicated that any representations have been made to me that in the event of this Bill being passed these prisoners would be released.  I wish that to be understood.  I do not think I permitted myself to give any undertaking of that sort.  I simply say that in my opinion the best interests of the prisoners are not served by holding up this Bill.  Nothing more than that I can tell you.</P>

      <P>May I ask the President one question, because we may not have the opportunity of seeing him again. I hope we shall, but he might not be able to turn up at the moment.  I notice in this Amnesty Bill the amnesty applies only to unconvicted prisoners or the prisoners who are suffering imprisonment which may be given under a higher judicial authority.  It does not, as I understand&mdash;I may be quite wrong, and I am merely asking his opinion&mdash;I think it <Col N="238" /> does not apply to prisoners who are already convicted and lie in jail and can make no appeal.  In that case if a similar Amnesty Bill was passed in England it would not cover the cases of some of those men lying in prison.  I may be wrong about that, and that is why I questioned the President.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to move the following motion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad views with grave concern and surprise the decision of the Government to withhold the Housing Grant from the Dublin Corporation, and requests the Government to reconsider the question, with a view to rescinding their decision.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion merely expresses the opinion that the Seanad views with grave concern and surprise the decision of the Government in withholding the Housing Grant from the Dublin Corporation, and requests a reconsideration of the matter with a view to an alteration of that decision. I put down this motion for the purpose of giving the Government an opportunity of reconsidering their decision. I must say I was amazed when I read of the decision of the Government.  I believe if the Government had given this question the consideration it deserves they would not have arrived at such a hasty conclusion.  Those of us who are familiar with the housing conditions in Dublin City view the matter from no other standpoint than one of amazement. As far back as the year 1913, during a time of great industrial trouble in this city, the Government of the time appointed a Commission to enquire into the housing conditions of the working classes. The Commission sat and heard evidence, and then issued their findings.  The report of the Commission disclosed an awful state of affairs.  It shocked everybody, and proved conclusively that twenty thousand families in Dublin were living in rooms and houses unfit for human habitation.  The Commission made certain recommendations to deal with the housing of the people, but for one cause or another no serious attempt was made by the Government then in power to deal with the situation.  It is common knowledge that for 10 years the Dublin Corporation have been endeavouring to do something to end this awful state of affairs.  It is true also to say <Col N="243" /> that for 10 years the Government used every art and every device that the official mind could conceive to prevent the Corporation proceeding with the work that its own Commission said required to be done.  It is an appalling thing to think that seventy-four thousand people in Dublin are living in one-roomed tenements. It is a shocking state of affairs to think that more than one family are living in one room.  There is no respect for morality, no respect for decency.  I suggest to the Seanad that if you want to have good citizens you cannot have them under the conditions in which the unfortunate poor are condemned to live in Dublin.  Worse than that, the housing conditions in Dublin are responsible for an abnormally high death rate.  Statistics have proved that the mortality rate per 10,000 of the population who live in single rooms is 390 as against 64 per 10,000 of the population who live in houses with 4 rooms.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Seanad that the Government did not give this question the consideration it deserves.  The first time the President of the Dáil got an opportunity he attended to this important question of housing.  I want to say here publicly that the President has done one man's part in regard to housing in the city.  I must pay him the tribute that he has done more than one man's part. I have known of his work for many years on the Dublin Corporation in regard to the problem of housing, and at the very first opportunity he got when he went into power he dealt with it in no halfhearted way.  He got the Government to agree to make a million grant for housing purposes in the country.  Out of that grant Dublin would be entitled to something like £400,000.  We were not able to do anything in Dublin because we were hampered under the old <i>regime</i> by the Local Government Board.  The Housing Committee of the Corporation made every effort to deal with this much delayed problem, and after very hard effort we were about to proceed with the work when, to our amazement, we found that the Government had made up its mind to withhold the grant.  I would prefer not to deal with this question from the view of the cause.  I would rather deal with the effect of the decision, although I have no objection to dealing with the <Col N="244" /> cause, if necessary.  I say, with all respect, that the 20,000 families in Dublin who are living in houses unfit for habitation should not be condemned to continue to live in these houses because of the fact that 16 members of the Corporation did a certain thing.  If 16 members of the Corporation did something which is wrong they, and they alone, ought to be made responsible for their act.  Surely it is not fair to visit the sins that rightly belong to 16 members of the Corporation, on the unfortunate people who are rotting in the filthy slums of the city?  Surely that is not an act of government?  It appears to me to be a reprisal.  Further, there has been a double hardship inflicted on the unfortunate people by the action of the Government.  There are in the building trades in Dublin between 3,000 and 4,000 men unemployed.  There are no building operations going on at the moment; the operations are operations of destruction rather than of construction. Between 3,000 and 4,000 building operatives are unemployed, and if the Government insist on withholding the grant it will mean that these people will be out longer, and I suggest it is not good to have that number of hungry men unemployed in these times.</P>
    <P>The Government had many other ways of meeting the situation than by the action they took.  I suggest there were many ways of dealing with it other than the method they have adopted.  As to the cause of the action of the Government, the position ought to be made clearer.  I have no hesitation in dealing with the matter from that standpoint.  The Dublin Corporation for some months past have been considering the question of the payment of allowances to the dependents of men who have been arrested.  As far back as last September the Finance and General Purposes Committee of the Corporation, after having this matter under consideration, sent a report to the Corporation. When the report came before it the Corporation decided to refer it to the Law Agent for advice, and the Law Agent advised, and the result of the Law Agent's advice was that he went over the ground covered formerly with regard to the payment of wages or allowances to the relatives and dependents of men who had been interned or imprisoned.  The Corporation dealt with this, not from the point of view of payment of allowances <Col N="245" /> to dependents of men in prison.  The decision of the Corporation&mdash;and I want this thing to be clearly understood, because the position, in my opinion, has been wilfully misrepresented&mdash;was to make an allowance of half-pay to the dependents of untried prisoners.  I suggest that the position has been wilfully misrepresented.  Reading the public Press one would be of the opinion that the decision of the Corporation was to pay allowances to the dependents of every man in prison.  That is not the position.  The decision of the Corporation was that an allowance of half-pay was to be made to the dependents of untried prisoners.  In the case of men in custody, the payment of the allowance was to cease immediately on these men being found guilty of an offence and convicted. We understood under the old <i>regime</i> that, according to the law, a man or a woman was innocent until they were proved guilty, and I think that a man or woman is innocent, or ought to be regarded as innocent, until convicted. They ought not, at any rate, to be prejudged. What are the facts?  As far as I can ascertain there were about 55 employees of the Dublin Corporation arrested, and of these 15 have been released. I venture to say that, if these people are innocent, the other people still in custody may be equally innocent.</P>

      <P>Senator Mrs. Wyse-Power, a colleague of mine in the Corporation, for whom I have great respect, says that the 15 men who have been released signed the paper.  That brings me to another point in the case that I want to put forward at the Seanad.  One would imagine, reading from the newspaper reports and the statements made, that any person in custody who signs a paper will be immediately released.  I want to say that that is not a correct representation of fact.  In the newspaper statements which appeared dealing with the question, the decision of the Corporation was deliberately and wilfully misrepresented by stating that half-pay was being given to people who would not sign the form. I have in my possession a letter from a boy of 16½ years of age to his mother; I <Col N="246" /> know the boy's father and mother well. This boy of 16½ years of age, in a letter to his mother, states&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think I am entitled to make my statement without an interruption of this kind.  Senator Mrs. Wyse-Power stated that the men at present in custody would not sign the form. I say that is not the position.  I have in my possession a letter from this boy to his mother.  It is dated the 17th of November last, and is addressed from Wellington Barracks.  The boy states, in the course of his letter to his mother, that he had signed the necessary form, that he was never a member of any organisation, and that he expected to be released.  That boy is still in custody. That proves, I hold that the mere signing of the form does not secure a prisoner's release.  Therefore, I say the continued detention of these men in custody is not because they have not signed the form.  As to the merits, or otherwise, of the decision come to by the Corporation, I am not going to argue the matter at any great length.  The case I want to make is this, that I believe the Government have made a great mistake in coming to such a hasty decision on this all-important question.  I believe we would be doing the Government a good service by asking them to reconsider this question, because I honestly believe they did not give it the consideration it deserves.  I believe, also, that it is not fair to inflict injury and hardship on the unfortunate poor people who are suffering and dying in the slums of Dublin.  Statistics prove that the high mortality in this city is mainly due to the bad conditions of housing in the city.  Therefore, I think the Government made a great mistake in coming to a decision to withhold these grants, and my motion simply requests that they would reconsider the whole matter, and alter their decision.  As I stated before, the Government have many ways of dealing with the situation other than by withholding the grants for housing.</P>

      <P>My name has been mentioned in this discussion, and, I must say, very unjustly.  I made a certain statement at the Dublin Corporation meeting the day the discussion was on about signing the paper.  I stated that, if any employee of the Dublin Corporation who was in jail signed the paper, and the Government refused to release him, I would reconsider my position regarding such a man's dependents.  I am in that position still.  We have no knowledge that any of the 55 employees of the Corporation who are in custody, with the exception of the 15 released, have signed the paper.  I desire to repeat the statement I have made, that if any of these men sign the paper, and the Government then refuses to release them, I will then consider my attitude as to the payment of allowances to their dependents. Senator Farren, with whom I agree on many questions, but differ with him on this, has, I think, entirely exaggerated the situation as regards the housing grant.  The plans and everything else are in course of preparation, just as if this edict had not gone forth from the Government.  I think the discussion to-day is a little out of order, and I am going to move an amendment, because on Monday next the Dublin Corporation will have an opportunity, and Senator Farren will have an opportunity of reconsidering the vote that has already taken place on the question.  On Monday there is a rescinding order of the decision already come to down for discussion, and to it are attached the names of 27 members.  I beg to move the following amendment: &ldquo;That this motion be postponed until the Dublin Corporation has an opportunity of discussing the matter.&rdquo;  I think a great deal of the heat and unpleasantness that has arisen will possibly pass away when the situation comes up for review on Monday next, and I think it is rather a pity that details should be gone into now.  During this debate one would really think one was at the Dublin Corporation meeting. To some of us it is rather pleasant sometimes to get away from them.  Without saying any more, I now beg to move my amendment.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the amendment for the reasons stated by Senator Mrs. Wyse Power, and also for the further reason that our discussion of this motion would necessarily be restricted, because it would be a very difficult matter, in fact it would be almost impossible, to discuss the motion in the terms in which it is set out without trenching on the question of administration. Seeing that we have no responsible Minister in this Seanad, I think we should not touch the question of administration.  In the terms in which the motion is set out, the matters are so closely linked that I fear there could be no full discussion of the whole question, because of the restriction under which we labour.</P>

      <P>I want to oppose the amendment, because I do not think that anything the Corporation does next Monday or anything it did last Monday has anything to do with the case.  Most of the members of this Seanad are not members of the Corporation, and the question we are discussing here is the terms of the resolution&mdash;whether we think it was right or whether it was sufficiently well considered before the order was sent out that these grants would be stopped.  I think after the facts that have been placed before us in connection with the whole position of housing in Dublin, along with what we already know as to the condition of housing all over, that when a hasty decision is come to like this, which will keep back the provision of houses for the people, we have a right to consider that matter without considering what may happen next week or next month at the Dublin Corporation.  On these grounds alone I will vote against this amendment.  I had hoped that this matter would have been discussed merely from the point of view of whether the stoppage of the grant was a wise action on the part of the Government or not, and that we would not have any reference to what <Col N="249" /> happened last week or what may happen next week in any other place but this. I thought that was the line upon which Senator Farren would go, and that we would not have this other matter brought in at all.  I think that we should try and look at the position purely from the standpoint of whether it is good for the country or not at the present time to stop grants such as those and come to a decision, and that we would be better advised than in bothering about what may happen next week or next month at the Dublin Corporation.  The real matter is whether it was a well-advised policy, whether we are of opinion it was come to too hastily, and whether we think that the Government ought to be asked to reconsider the position.  It is not a question of whether we are going to criticise harshly the action taken by the Government at a particular time; but we can say as a Seanad whether we think that they were hasty in their action or not, and that they ought to reconsider the position if we think it is going to be detrimental to the carrying on of the country in general.  That is the position I feel in, that it is detrimental to the country as a whole as well as to Dublin City in particular, and for that reason the Seanad ought to be directly interested and give a decision to-day without adjourning it.  If we adjourn it to see what the Dublin Corporation does, then our decision and our discussion at the next Seanad meeting will be based upon what has happened at the Dublin Corporation, and not on the question of whether we think it was right or wrong. I think we ought to avoid that, because it is bad work to be made little of, say, in the Dáil; but do not let it go through the country that the Poor Law Guardians and the Dublin Corporation are the leaders, because we will be far behind in the procession if we let them go ahead.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment, because I think this motion is simply an invitation for us to reduce ourselves to the level of the Dublin Corporation. I can understand Senators who have supported this motion wishing to say nothing about the effect of it, and painting a lurid picture of the conditions of housing in Dublin.  I submit that they are responsible for the Government stopping <Col N="250" /> the grant, these men who voted in the Corporation for giving half-pay to those 55 innocents who are referred to as untried prisoners, but who, we read in the daily Press, were taken because they left their employment and took a hand in wrecking the city, causing the citizens the loss of millions of pounds, and causing unemployment to thousands of working men and women.  I would like that Senator Farren would find out the concern and the surprise with which those people who are walking the streets of Dublin idle to-day looking for a job view his action and that of his associates in voting half-pay to those who are responsible for their present plight.  I think the most disgraceful of all the many disgraceful things that have happened for the last twelve months is for public representatives to stand up in the Corporation and vote half-pay to people of this sort.  It is all very well to talk about their being untried, but they have had an opportunity of signing the paper, and 15 of them have been released.  There is no reason why the other 40 of them should not be released if they did the same thing.  If an intelligent foreigner landed in this country a couple of weeks ago, and if he picked up a paper and read in one column the very eloquent manifesto of Senator O'Farrell denouncing the murder of the railwaymen in Tralee, and read in the same paper an account of where Senator Farren voted for giving half-pay to the associates of the political organisation that was responsible for the murders in Tralee, I wonder what he would think.  He would think, and think rightly, that a country whose public representatives were so supine and invertebrate was unworthy of freedom, and would go down in disaster and disgrace.  I would suggest to the Labour Party that it is time for them to cease speaking with two voices.  Let them either be men or mice.  They should abandon this line of policy, which even their own followers say leaves them open to the charge that they are simply playing for safety.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I was not <Col N="251" /> present when this motion was introduced. It is, I think, unnecessary to say that this is a request that the Government could not possibly reconsider.  Twelve months ago the Provisional Government, just getting into control of the administration of this country, pending an Election, earmarked a huge sum of money for the purpose of enabling local authorities to build houses for the working classes.  The proposals of the Government at the time contemplated building in one year one-fifth of the entire number of dwellings that had been constructed during the previous fifty-six years by Urban Districts throughout the entire area of the Saorstát.  I think that no useful purpose would be served by entering into a discussion of the merits or demerits of the present Irregular offensive. Suffice to say that it is admitted, I think, by every sound economist both in this and every other country, that no nation has had war made upon its vital interest with such utter disregard of every principle of morality or good government as this country of ours has had to suffer during the last twelve months.  During all the period I think it will be admitted that the Government has acted with as much forbearance as the circumstances of the times permitted, or, perhaps, as any other Government ever acted during the entire history of the world, and is at all times willing and anxious to meet these men as brothers again, and wipe out their offences, to forget the damage that they have done, and to endeavour to work together again for the benefit of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already explained to what extent the Government were committed as regards the proposals made to local authorities throughout the country. In the case of Dublin I think that the sum earmarked for housing was in the neighbourhood of £400,000.  In other words, if the municipality of the capital of Ireland were in a position to put forward housing proposals to the extent of something like three-quarters of a million the Government was prepared to pay £400,000 of that amount.  It is some time ago since I had the figures in my possession, and I may be making a mistake just now as to the actual amounts. In any case, the number of cottages that was to have been built was in the neighbourhood <Col N="252" /> of 1,000 for the City of Dublin, and anybody who has studied the housing problem in Dublin knows what an immense contribution that would be towards remedying the state of affairs that, perhaps, has no parallel in any country in the world.  Knowing all that, some of the employees of the Corporation of Dublin took up arms against the Government, looted shops, and destroyed one of the finest thoroughfares that we have in Ireland.  The proposal made now by the Dublin Corporation, having all these facts before them, is to remunerate these men, by giving them half-pay.  I cannot see for my part any justification for it.  I cannot see any moral sanction for it.  I cannot see how any law could justify an extravagance of that kind.  It may be that the families of these men have suffered for the sins that have been committed by the bread-winners.  That is, unfortunately, one of the disadvantages of sin, that it spreads out its tentacles to others than those who commit it. What, then, is the position of the Government with regard to a matter of this sort?  That we are to subsidise a local authority to the extent of £400,000, and that we are to go on pouring out this money that is subscribed, not alone by the Urban District, but by the agricultural districts, and subsidise those who are making war, not alone upon the agricultural districts, but also upon the municipal districts throughout the entire nation. It is not a matter to which I think any Government in its sane mind could possibly give consideration, much less a favourable decision.</P>
    <P>In one area alone where this municipality of Dublin erected 200 cottages at an enormous cost (I think some thing like £600 or £700 per cottage), and which is returning a rental of approximately 30 per cent.  of the annual outgoings, quite a number of young people have been occupying these cottages subsidised by the rates of the city, and making war upon the Nation at the same time.  The time comes when fathers, as well as Governments, have got to correct any delinquencies of their children, or subjects, or citizens.  This is a case in which every effort has been made to placate people who are in arms, people who have no moral justification for the acts that they have committed; people who have scorched and burned and killed children; <Col N="253" /> people who have no respect for the most cherished possessions of the Nation, which have been sent to the flames; people who have no respect for age.  One of the most respected members of this Seanad, who had no qualms of conscience about putting his life in jeopardy, hesitated about putting the shame on the Nation of destroying the priceless treasures he has collected during four score years. That is too much for him.  He could stand the threat to his life, he could put his life in jeopardy, but to say that the Nation that gave him birth had so little respect for culture, is a thing he could not stand.  I cannot see any justification for putting forward this resolution.  The Government cannot act both ways.  It cannot pour money to assist a municipality to do its duty and to discharge its obligation to the public, and at the same time subsidise those who make war upon that municipality and attempt to destroy the life and property of the Nation.</P>

      <P>So far as I am personally concerned, and I think those of my colleagues who think with me here are concerned, our views upon Irregular activities referred to by the President and by other speakers are pretty well known.  I would like emphatically to repudiate the suggestion of the Senator on my right (Senator McLoughlin) to the effect that we have ever spoken with two voices.  We look at this, personally I look at this, altogether from a different standpoint to that taken by the supporters of the amendment.  I am not going to defend the action of the Dublin Corporation.  Heaven forbid that I should ever be asked to defend the Dublin Corporation in regard to many things that it does.  I would say, however, that that body has, through a lack of backbone on the part of many supporters of the Government in the Corporation, brought itself into contempt in recent months.  It was deplorable to find a corporate body of that kind trying to conduct its business with a roaring mob in the gallery.  First they seemed to be of one persuasion only, but recently they are pretty well mixed.  One does not wonder if sometimes a number of people stay away, and if those who are there sometimes do things that in normal circumstances they would not do.  As has been pointed out by the mover of the <Col N="254" /> resolution, there were means by which the action of these Corporators could be dealt with by the Government.  The particular people responsible could be very effectively dealt with if they had done wrong.  What one does not like is the suggestion of reprisals by a responsible Government on people who were in no way responsible for anything that happens at the Dublin Corporation. Now, I would ask those who are supporting the amendment that they should take a more manly course than the one they have taken and face the music. If they think this resolution should not have been introduced here, and, having been introduced, should not have been passed, why not adopt the manly course of voting against it?  Why move an amendment suggesting that it could be brought on again?  I think the speeches made in support of the amendment are very largely speeches which tend to defeat it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I have no support of any kind, but the greatest contempt, for the method of warfare which has been waged during the last four or five months against the people, but I think that these unfortunate people are suffering quite enough from those who are waging that method of warfare, without having further reprisals taken upon them by the Government, to whom they look for security and protection.  The President, I think, has somewhat over-estimated the effect of the decision of the Dublin Corporation. One would imagine that it was incidents of that kind which were causing the present deplorable state of affairs to continue, while he knows well, and everybody here knows well, that other quarters must be looked to for the real responsibility for the continuation of the present state of affairs, and that departments for which the Government are responsible are in themselves very largely to blame, either through incompetence or otherwise.  One has only to read the newspapers to-day to find that a body of men attacked Nenagh Workhouse at 1 a.m., removed the inmates, and set fire to part of the place and created terror through the town, while it was 6.30 a.m. before the soldiers, who were stationed less than ten minutes walk away, arrived on the scene.  While this is the state of affairs, and this is the way in which the Army, for which we <Col N="255" /> are paying very dearly, conduct their business, and the manner in which they discharge the duties that are allotted to them in protecting this Nation, is it any wonder that the present state of affairs is continuing?  Therefore there is no use in making a mountain out of a molehill and imagining that actions such as the Dublin Corporation's would mean helping the present state of affairs to continue. That is not so, in my humble opinion; but one of the principal causes is the absolute incompetence of the Army charged with the protection of the Nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ANDREW JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator O'Farrell is right in one thing. I think it is a mistake for the Seanad to deal with this matter by way of amendment by postponing it for anything that might happen in the Dublin Corporation.  I think, taking care of its own dignity, that the Seanad ought to deal with the motion yea or nay.  After such a discussion as we have had to-day, and after the President has been down here and has explained to us the policy of the Government, and why they have taken the action they did, I think it would be most unseemly if we deferred the whole thing to next week, and I doubt if Senator Mrs. Wyse Power had that in her mind.  The question has now gone beyond what she meant, and she would probably be quite content if we took a vote on the question now as to whether the Seanad did or did not approve of this Resolution.  I think the discussion that we had at the beginning of our proceedings to-day as to the relations between the two Houses ought to make the Seanad very careful how they rush into the position of beginning, by passing resolutions, to lecture the Government of the day, which has had, no doubt, the support of the Dáil for what has been done.  Our position so far is very undefined.  If we were to pass this Resolution, after we have heard the speech which the President has made, there is not the slightest doubt that this Seanad would be passing a vote of censure on the Government, and we must face that.  Senator Farren spoke about the wretched housing of the Dublin poor.  I suppose there is no one in this Seanad who knows much more about that than I do.  I happen to carry on <Col N="256" /> my business in one of the poorest districts in Dublin, and I know where my own workmen live and what the surroundings are.  I walk every day through the middle of some of the worst slums in Dublin, and have for many years of my life protested and done whatever I could.  Everybody knows that we can do nothing to help that sort of thing. As far as that part of the speech of the Senator is concerned I have no doubt at all that every Senator here knows full well how awfully the Dublin poor are housed, but with all that knowledge this is not the time or the place to raise that question and to ask us, because the poor people of Dublin are wretchedly and miserably housed, to interfere in this mighty question which is now before the nation.  Why is no building going on in Dublin?  Every man amongst us knows that it is because as fast as a building is put up it is pulled down again, and the Government stands for this, that until we get peace, until men who are going to spend their money have a reasonable prospect of getting a return for it, there will be no prosperity either for labour or capital or anything else in this country, and for this Seanad, having that before them, in the slightest way to throw an aspersion on the Government and say that they are not doing everything that human beings can do, as we know they are, would be, to my mind, a stab in the back and an injury of the worst description.  It is on that ground, and on the ground that this Seanad must take a high stand and say what they believe, that this Government is acting rightly and honourably, and with the very best ability of any set of men that could be got together.  For that reason they should say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Senator's proposal, not because we do not understand what the conditions of the poor are, but because if the Seanad were to support this Resolution now and take action against the Lower House, against the Government of the day, they would be laying down grounds for many a quarrel and undermining any chance of our ever taking the place which I hope to see the Seanad definitely occupying in this country.</P>

Only for the vote of the Dublin Corporation this resolution would not have been here, and that was really the reason I proposed the amendment, believing that Senator Farren would have sufficient commonsense to fall in with and accept it.

      <P>As I intend to vote for the motion I would like to make my position clear.  I quite agree with everything that Senator Jameson said about the Government doing their best in an exceedingly difficult position, but at the same time the Government is not perfect, and in this particular case I believe that they have made a mistake. I am not sure that I would have thought it a good thing to bring this motion on, but as it is here, and as I think the Government have made a mistake, I am supporting it.  I feel sure that theirs was a hasty action, notwithstanding what the President said about subsidising the local authority.  There is no doubt that this is a national question.  It is almost the most important question in the country, and anything that could cause building, especially in Dublin, where we have the slums, to be retarded by a single day I thoroughly oppose, and I believe that the Government's action will have that effect.  In fact, it amounts to a reprisal, and I believe myself that by surcharging members, or by some other way, they could easily have shown their disapproval. The reason I stand up now is to make it perfectly clear that I thoroughly disagree with the Corporation in giving half-pay to those people, and I want to make that quite clear, for fear I should be thought to be voting on their side. Somebody mentioned the signing of the paper, and said that people signed it and did not get out for a long time.  That is perfectly true.  On the other hand, people sign the paper, get out within a week, and are back again in arms, some of them within three days from that.</P>

      <P>I am not a bit sorry I raised this discussion, notwithstanding all I have heard from the different speakers, including the President.  I am still convinced that the Government made a mistake, and I repeat that you have no right to inflict an injury on innocent people, and that the action of the Government in this case is not dealing with the people responsible, but is inflicting needless hardship on the unfortunate people, who were in no way responsible for what happened at the Dublin Corporation. I do not want to go over all the different points made by the various people.  The President told us of all the terrible things that are happening.  I am not in sympathy with the terrible things that are happening.  I wish to God that such things could not happen in this country, and that we would not approach them from the point of view of vengeance on one side or the other.  Lord Wicklow, at the last meeting of the Seanad, suggested that it would be a good thing if we opened our proceedings with prayer. I think, also that it would be a good thing if we did, and that we should look at these things not, on one side or the other, vengefully, but from the broad point of view of Christianity.  I say it is not in a Christian spirit that you are going to inflict untold misery and hardship on the unfortunate people who are living and dying in the Dublin slums.  That is not good Government, but an act of vengeance&mdash;a reprisal on innocent people. Senator Jameson says that he knows the slums&mdash;that he walks through them. But, did he ever live in them?  I did. I know what they are.  And if he lived in them, as I lived in them, he would not condemn these unfortunate people to exist in them another single day.  It is all right to talk about sympathy; but sympathy ought to be put to a practical test.  I say that the people in the slums of Dublin are in no way responsible for what has happened, and, therefore, it is not an act of government to victimise them in the manner in which it is proposed.  I would be prepared to deal with this question from a practical point of view, and without any political bias.  I am not animated by any political bias.  I do not want to get at the Government.  I am animated only with the one desire, to see <Col N="259" /> things going in this country as we would all wish and hope to see them going.  I suggest that action such as this on the part of the Government will not tend to bring about the state of affairs that we all desire.  I do not think there is any need for me to say more on the matter, only just to mention that I put down this motion with one object in view.  I believe that the Government were wrong in the action they took, and why I put in the motion originally was simply to get an expression of opinion from the Seanad, but the Chairman of the Seanad informed me that under the Standing Orders I could not hand in such a notice of motion, and he amended it, and added the last lines.  The motion, as I drafted it, simply expressed concern and surprise at the decision of the Government in withholding these grants.  The Chairman insisted on altering it, and he added the additional words.  I put it down with the object of helping the Government, and I believe, from the volume of opinion heard here to-day, that the Government made a mistake, and I believe that if the Government continue to act on these lines they will come to realise that they have made a mistake.</P>
      <P>Motion put and negatived.</P>

      <P>I have received, in connection with the discussion that took place earlier in the sitting, a notice of motion that the resolution on Indemnity (British Military) Bill,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;That the consideration of this Bill be adjourned to give the British Government the opportunity by a similar gracious act to release every Irish prisoner under its control for a political offence connected with Ireland in whatever country the offence may have been committed.  The status, political or otherwise, of each prisoner to be decided by a certificate of the Irish Government,&rsquo;</P>
      <P>passed on 23rd day of January, 1923, be rescinded.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It had been handed in by Senator Moore, and it has been signed by twenty-four members of the Seanad.  Under the operation of the Standing Orders, two days' notice would be given, but it is possible, if it is the desire of the Seanad <Col N="260" />&mdash;and it seems to be the desire of the Seanad&mdash;by formal leave of the Seanad to take this motion immediately or to-morrow. Once that is passed, it would be possible to take the stages either one after the other, or at intervals, on the Indemnity Bill.</P>

      <P>The Second Stage of that Bill will be under consideration to-morrow, and it is a matter for the Seanad whether further stages will be dealt with.  I understand that Senator Sir John Purser Griffith would prefer to move his motion to-morrow.  I think we may take it as certain that we shall have a Bill from the Dáil&mdash;the Enforcement of Law (Occasional Powers) Bill&mdash;the second stage of which will be considered.  I have also received from the Government a copy of an order made by the Executive Council on the 5th instant in connection with the Railway and Canal Commission.  It is entitled the Extension of Time Order, 1923.  In accordance with Section 7 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, that has to be laid on the Table of both Houses of the Oireachtas, and in order that it shall come into operation the formal approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas is required. This is also a matter for which we have no Standing Order, but I propose to put a formal motion on the Agenda for to-morrow, in the same way as under our present Standing Orders a Government Bill would be placed automatically on our Agenda.</P>
