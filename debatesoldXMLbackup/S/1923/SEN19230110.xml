      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The first business on the agenda is to receive the Report of the Committee to deal with Articles 21 and 23 of the Constitution, and with the suggested appointments and remuneration of officers of the Senate. The report of that Committee is before you, but I wish to make two observations in regard to it so that you may understand the form in which it comes before you.  There are two reports, and that arises in this way: the Committee, in the first instance, dealt with the question of the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach as well as with the question of the remuneration of Senators and facilities for travelling.  It was obvious that on that Committee neither the Cathaoirleach nor the Leas-Chathaoirleach should be members, nor should they take any part in the proceedings, and, accordingly, that first report is a report from that first Committee.  Subsequently, when the other Reports came before the Seanad, they were asked to deal with the second matter, namely, the suggested appointments and the remunerations of officers of the Seanad. The Seanad thought it right to add to that Committee the names of the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach, and consequently, you will find that while their names do not appear to the first Report, they do appear to the second Report.  The only other matter I wish to mention is, that this is an interim Report, and for this reason: we have not completed the task that the Seanad allotted to us.  The appointments, according to the determination of the Seanad, were to be for one year only. It would be necessary for the Committee that you have appointed to deal with the duties and remuneration, in so far as increments of salaries and pensions are concerned, in the cases of permanent officials, and consequently the Committee has still got to go into that matter and report to you upon it.  It has also to consider the question of appointment of an Advisory Counsel to the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach, who will also act as the examiner of Public and Private Bills, and will be available to assist the members of the Seanad and its Staff on any questions of law procedure that may arise, so that these two matters still stand over, and, consequently, the present Report comes before you as an interim Report only. It is now before the Seanad, and perhaps to make matters regular, some member of the Seanad will formally move, and some other member will formally second, the adoption of the Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKEAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you put this Report, I think it right to say that at our last meeting, when this subject came up before us, you pointed out that the Committee that you had appointed had exceeded its powers, and you administered a slight rebuke to them for doing so.  In doing that you had with you the approbation of the majority of the members of this Seanad.  Then, what must have been the astonishment of the Senators to hear you speak in that way <Col N="93" /> when they found, a few days afterwards, that the same Committee had apparently flagrantly violated its privileges in putting an advertisement into the daily papers asking for applications for these positions?  I think, before that had been done, this Committee should have brought its Report before this Seanad, and this Seanad should have gone into those various appointments, and then this advertisement should have been put into the daily papers.  You pointed out to them that they acted <i>ultra vires</i> in certain recommendations they made, and I think now they have gone beyond that and acted in a more flagrant manner in exceeding their powers by putting in this advertisement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Senator is under a mistake.  In order to give to this Committee the powers which they thought they possessed in the first instance a second reference given to them was to consider and make suggestions as to the appointments, and also recommendations as to the remuneration of officials.  It was put in that form deliberately, in order to make this Committee to have the power which they thought they possessed on the first reference. On that second reference, they considered it was their duty to take all the necessary steps in order to ascertain the names of suitable and eligible candidates, and then to investigate the qualifications of all these candidates. They interviewed at least a dozen of the gentlemen who sent in their names, and they took very considerable care and spent days over the matter.  The Report now before you is the result of their labours.  They were of opinion it would not be right or proper for them to make recommendations as to particular names unless and until they had publicly advertised that those positions were vacant so that anyone who wished to apply might have the fullest opportunity.  That was the reason why they published the advertisement.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Because, in the first case they were asked only to report as to the number of the staff that would be required.  It was in consequence of the narrowness of that reference that the Seanad on the second occasion thought it was desirable to enlarge the reference. That was the reason they sent it back to the Committee.  This report now before you does not purport to appoint anybody or to fix anything.  It makes recommendations to the Seanad, which they are at liberty either to adopt or reject.</P>

      <P>I agree with the remarks of Senator MacLysaght.  I think it is unfortunate that our Chief Clerk would not understand any discussion which arises here in the Irish language; apparently he does not.  I understand that our Assistant Clerk has a very good knowledge of the Irish language, and our second Assistant is also very highly qualified in the Irish language. That is very gratifying.  However, I think it is unfortunate that our <Col N="95" /> Senior Clerk is not qualified in Irish, but I hope he will acquire it before the end of the probationary year.</P>

      <P>It will be necessary for us to appoint officials, such as the messenger, the typist, and, perhaps, a shorthand clerk.  But we do not think that these matters are big enough or important enough to be dealt with by the Seanad, and minor appointments like that should be left as in paragraph (c). Practically all the important officials will be subject to appointment by the Seanad.  As regards the minor appointments, we do not think the Seanad would care to be troubled with them.</P>

      <P>We have a recommendation for the appointment of two chief officers of the Seanad, and, as far as I know, the great majority of Senators have not seen any qualifications in respect of either of those officers, or, indeed, any of the other applicants.  It is rather awkward for us to have to vote, and have, perhaps, to carry this recommendation without knowing anything of the men we are voting for.  I understood there would be no names submitted here in the first instance.  I thought we would first have the terms of the position <Col N="96" /> specified, and that afterwards qualifications would be brought forward, and that the applicants would have to conform with those before being appointed. We are asked to vote here in complete ignorance of the qualifications of the persons we are voting for.  I have no doubt the Committee went very carefully into the qualifications, and probably selected the very best men; but I am not certain of that.  I do not know that I may be asked to vote for a man who may not have the necessary qualifications to entitle him to occupy the position.  Before we are asked to carry this report we ought to get some information of the number of applicants and what their qualifications are.  I have only been handed the Committee's report; I do not know anything about it or the men recommended in it.  I would like if the Chairman would tell us more about the report.  I am not at all opposed to the appointments, but I never like to vote straight out for things I know nothing about.  If there is a motion made for sending back this report, or any part of it, I would feel bound to vote for that motion.  I would like to know whether there were other applicants, and to get some idea of their qualifications.</P>

      <P>This is really a question of whether or not you have confidence in a Committee you nominate. The Seanad as a whole could never possibly have done the work that we did, because we interviewed at least a dozen candidates.  We had applications from probably a dozen more.  We spent five days exhaustively going through those applications, criticising and discussing them.  In regard to the appointments, what we did was this: We selected a certain number ruled out some as being unsuitable, and left others in whom we thought had proper qualifications.  We had to weed them out, and interviewed all that were available, and having interviewed them we finally came to a conclusion as to the individuals who, in our opinion had the best qualifications.  We accordingly determined to recommend those individuals to the Seanad.  It comes to this: we have delegated this Committee, and are you now satisfied with the work that the Committee have done.  How the Seanad as a whole could ever have taken this task and done what we did I am at a loss to understand.</P>

It is manifestly impossible for the Seanad to discuss the qualifications of these gentlemen like the small Committee did.  We asked them to do such and such a thing. They did that thing, and in view of the additional information which the Chairman has given us, and which did not appear in the report, I would ask Senator Fitzgerald to withdraw his amendment and let the matter go through.</P>

To have the whole lot of us threshing out these appointments would be a thing that is not wanted.  I think there is something behind Senator Fitzgerald's amendment which we could easily meet.  I think when we settled it in the Committee we did believe them to be really minor appointments and that the Chairman and Deputy Chairman would settle them definitely.  I think from what the Senator said he has an idea that there is something more in it than small appointments, and that being so it would meet the thing entirely if a list of these appointments, before they were made, was submitted to the Seanad.  I believe that would meet all the objections and get over the trouble.  There seems to be some idea that somewhere or another, which certainly I do not believe anybody in the Committee knew, there is some appointment in this that was out of the class we thought we were dealing with when we dealt with the matter in Committee.</P>

I think we really would make ourselves a laughing stock as a Seanad if from time to time you have to get a report that a junior typist has resigned or been dismissed, and, therefore, the Committee will meet, interview the persons, and make a report again to the Seanad.  I do not think that is done anywhere in the world, and I do not think it looks like efficiency.  It looks far more like suspicion and distrust.

      <P>I have only seen the paper recently, but in the last line of paragraph &ldquo;A&rdquo; I see the word &ldquo;commencing.&rdquo;  I happen to be on a public body which rather got into trouble by using the words &ldquo;commencing salary&rdquo; without further definition.  I should like to suggest that the word might be either defined or cut out.  The case I had in mind was one where the word was used, and it subsequently transpired that the ideas of the officials concerned as to when the increases should commence and the ideas of the public body did not coincide, and it created a good deal of difficulty and of heartburning.  The body to which I refer, in a fit of economy, did not carry out the implied obligation of increasing the salaries after the lapse of whatever period it was&mdash;one year or two&mdash;and I thought it might be possible in this case, as the appointments are for one year only, that the word might be left out or more clearly defined.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I explain what exactly the Committee meant by that.  You see that the officers proposed are only to hold office for one year, so that it will be essential for this Committee, and one of the duties that still remains to be discharged by them, to draw up a scheme, which they intend to do, and which will regulate the increments, if any, which these officers are to get, their pension rights, and matters of that kind, their duties and so forth. The reason we did not approach that as yet is that a scheme is being prepared by the Dáil regulating such matters in regard to their officers, and our Committee thought it would be desirable that we should run on parallel lines with them, and we are waiting to see what their proposals are, as they may affect our consideration.  But we have not lost sight of the matter mentioned by the Senator who has just spoken.  It is one of the things we have still to discharge, and that will explain why it is the report appears in that shape.  We did not like the officials to believe, or to think, or that it should go out to the public that these salaries were fixed at <Col N="102" /> these figures for all times.  We thought that it should appear to them, by inference, that these salaries would be subject to increments or increases according to the scheme we would ultimately agree on.  We have not yet had time to approach that scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I explained all that.  Perhaps I may say we have been labouring here since we started under the greatest difficulty, because we have had no official Staff, and there has been great difficulty in getting recorded the various resolutions arrived at by the Seanad.  In fact, we had to depend largely on the notes I took myself. That is the reason we came forward with an interim Report, because we were anxious to have our Clerks appointed at the earliest possible moment <Col N="104" /> in order that things would be reduced to regularity and not left in this haphazard way.  My recollection is quite distinct, viz., that the reference to the first Committee was simply to report in regard to Sections 21 and 23 of the Constitution as to the number of the Staff to be required.  It was in consequence of that restriction upon their powers that in making the second reference the Seanad deliberately stated that they were to suggest the appointment and to suggest the remuneration, and that is what we are entitled to carry out.</P>

      <P>Yes, to suggest the appointment and remuneration, but not to name the person.  I find nothing in your remarks that they are to actually name the people to fill the appointments, and other members of the Seanad are in the same position as I am.  If the Committee exceeded their duty in the first instance they have more than exceeded it in the second.  You said you could not possibly allow the report to come up for discussion because the Committee seemed to have completely misconceived the subject matter of the reference, which was not a reference to appoint Officers, and you said the Committee had not considered the qualifications necessary, and that the Committee should consider them.</P>

      <P>You may give me credit that I was satisfied that the first Committee exceeded their powers so far as was in my power to see.  The second did not do anything of the kind. If the House thought they exceeded their powers they could have rejected the Report, but I have no hesitation in saying, so far as I have any voice, that their action is strictly within the terms of reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the report before me, and there is not a single thing in it to justify them in that.  On the second occasion they were confined to the terms of reference equally as on the first. There was nothing to justify them in <Col N="105" /> naming anyone to fill any of those appointments, and I go further and say I and others received applications.  I have no fault to find personally with the present Clerk.  I do not know what his qualifications are.  I see that he has distinguished himself as a military man, and surely our Army is a sufficiently large and important service to find a fitting position for him if he has distinguished himself in that way.  You yourself stressed the qualification that would be required for a Clerk of the Seanad. Whether the present Clerk has these qualifications or not I am not prepared to say, or whether the Committee are as satisfied as you think, but the Seanad had no means of knowing.  The Committee should have come back to the House and reported the Staff required, and reported on the extent of the qualifications of the applicants, and they should have submitted these to the House and appointed a special Committee to go into these qualifications.</P>

Therefore, the matter is very urgent, and that is the reason it appears before you to-day, and having regard to its urgency perhaps the Seanad would take the course they took with regard to other Bills and allow the Standing Orders to be suspended so that this Bill could be put through all its stages.</P>

      <P>I move that it be passed <i>in globo</i>, as I do not suppose the Seanad desires to discuss the matter at very great length. With regard to the point raised, as to whether this was a Money Bill or not, you are asked to answer that conundrum. But no one has been competent to answer it, and it is not a conundrum to which you can reply.  There is no certificate from the Speaker of the other House that this is a Money Bill.  Under the Constitution the Speaker of the other House has to certify on any question when it is a matter of doubt about a Bill being a Money Bill or not.  When a Bill comes to the Seanad the Speaker of the other House has to append his signature and certify that it is a Money Bill.  That has not been done here.  All I have to say is that this Bill is absolutely necessary.  The appointment of this official &mdash; Auditor-General &mdash; is a matter of the very greatest importance to the taxpayers generally.  This official will be one of the most important personages we have.  He will be the taxpayers' sheet anchor, and I think he should be appointed at once.  I think <Col N="107" /> the Seanad is perfectly right in trying to expedite his appointment.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the proposition, but I think it would be much better in principle that we should put the Bill through the various stages.  I am not referring particularly to this Bill.  The Bill, I think, should be put through the various stages, if possible, without debate.  That means that no Senator will be deprived of the right of moving an amendment if it is possible to do so.  In the form proposed now it seems to me that would be very difficult.  I do not wish to press that point now, but I was going to say what Sir Thomas Esmonde referred to&mdash; that there is a certificate attached when a Bill is a Money Bill.  May I go further, and point out also that, under the Constitution of this House, there is power to dispute this, even if there was a certificate. That is a matter of importance, and should be understood, and I suggest that Senators should read the clause of the Constitution referring to it.  I think it is one of the clauses that are tolerably clear.  With regard to the Bill itself, I agree with the other statement that it is a matter of very considerable importance that the person who is to be appointed to the office of Auditor and Comptroller-General will be appointed to one of the most important positions in the whole of Saorstát Eireann.  This official will be a trustee of the whole Oireachtas to see that no money is expended which has not been sanctioned in some form or other by proper legal methods, by the Dáil, or by both Houses, as the law may stand in a particular case.  He will have the power of withholding sanction of the payment of money until he is satisfied there is a legal warrant for the expenditure.  Therefore it is only right that his position should be that of practically a Judge, only removable by resolution of both Houses, as provided in the Bill.  I think <Col N="108" /> it is well the importance of this position should be understood, and I very much hope that the Dáil, which is responsible for the appointment, will find a very competent, and the very best, man for it.</P>

He may take up the position at 55 and go on until 70 and get two-thirds of his salary.  I think it might be well to see that the initial age should be kept under a certain age, say 45.  Perhaps it could be arranged that no man serving fifteen years could retire without some cause other than mere old age.  I would like it to be understood that a man who is appointed Auditor-General, after fifteen years should not be allowed to retire automatically and get two-thirds of his salary.  I do not think that he would be justified in getting it.  I think it would be well to add a clause that no person should be qualified for the position after the age of 45&mdash;or something of that nature.</P>

In the absence of a Minister, or some representative of the Government, it is really only wasting our time for Senators to suggest amendments in the manner in which we have so eloquently heard it done.  For the purpose of getting on with the business, I think we should wait until we have the benefit of the advice of some member of the Government, or swallow the Bill holusbolus, as my friend, Sir Thomas Esmonde, suggested.</P>

      <P>In asking permission to submit this motion I desire that the Seanad of Ireland should associate itself in sympathy with our sister Nation of Canada in the loss she has sustained by the destruction of the Cathedral of Notre Dame at Montreal. This loss to Canada is nothing short of a national calamity.  Notre Dame was the religious centre of Quebec.  It was Canada's oldest historical monument.  It was the most interesting church historically in North America, and one of the most interesting churches in the world. Those of us who have been privileged to worship in this venerable shrine can specially feel for Canada in the destruction of this beautiful edifice, with its historical associations, and the treasures of art it contained.  Therefore, the resolution I invite the Seanad to approve is no mere perfunctory expression, but a genuinely conscious effort to convey to the Canadian people our strong feeling of sympathy with them in this great misfortune. The world and our civilisation are the poorer for their loss.</P>
      <P>I have the honour to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Eireann desires to convey to the people of Canada the expression of its sympathy with them in the destruction of Notre Dame Cathedral, at Montreal; and to associate itself with them in their regret in the loss of their oldest national monument.

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be remembered that just before Christmas I brought in a somewhat similar motion, but a little exception was taken to the motion I brought in at that time, because Senators said that they had not time to consider it, and that, as it was a very important matter, they would like time to consider it, and I withdrew it on that occasion.  On this occasion I have made a change.  At that time the motion was a definite one to introduce these things at once, whereas now I only propose that a Committee should be appointed to investigate and study whether these Committees ought to be appointed or not, and, if they are to be, under what convenient method they should be appointed.  This does not commit the Seanad to anything in particular at present; it merely commits it to make an enquiry as to the advisability or not of appointing this Committee. With regard to the names I have suggested for the Committee, my only reason for doing so is because I am bound by the Standing Orders to do so.  If I do not put down a certain number of names for the Committee I may be ruled out of order.  I have selected those not knowing in the least whether they approve of the motion or whether they are prepared to go on the Committee, but I have selected the names that appear to me to a certain extent to represent the particular subjects that I thought might be brought forward.  The reason why it is necessary that we should take this step, which is not a step taken everywhere else, is because the constitution of the Seanad is very different from that in other places.  The Upper House in England, the House of Lords, is entirely differently constituted.  There Ministers are members of the House of Lords, it is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who is a Minister, and it is governed by party principles, whereas in this House we have no parties, thank goodness, and we have no Ministers, which is perhaps unfortunate; and we must organise ourselves somehow or in some method, otherwise a number of <Col N="113" /> Senators are meeting here, and there will be no means of bringing forward properly-stated measures.  Any member may bring forward any measure he chooses, no one else having studied it or knowing anything about it.  I propose this Committee in order that all subjects brought before us may be properly stated, and that members may understand and be educated into these particular subjects in which they are to legislate.  I hope that these Committees will have another very good effect. I hope they will prevent caucuses, which are established very often in different places.  I hope we will not get a caucus, which is a sort of evil genius of democratic assemblies.  They may be suitable in some places, but I hope they will not be attempted here, and this gives an opportunity of avoiding these evils, and in proposing to appoint this Committee I am not introducing any particularly new plans.  They have been adopted in other countries; in America and France and elsewhere Standing Committees of some sort have been sanctioned&mdash;Committees on Finance, Foreign Affairs, and so on.  These Committees serve a most useful purpose, and are very important in the constitution of a country.  I think we have power to prepare Bills and send these on to the Dáil, and it would be very useful and important that we should do so in order that proper Bills may be produced.  These Committees can study and consider the Bills introduced, and draw them up in some sort of form and present them to the Senate.  Certain different forms have been suggested. The last time I brought the matter up there were a few remarks made, and it was suggested that they should not be Committees solely of the Seanad, but that there should also be joint Committees with the Dáil.  I think there is something to be said for both of these suggestions, and also that there might be separate Committees both for the Dáil and for the Seanad, and that these should combine and work together.  For all these suggestions I think there is something to be said.  I am suggesting now that the Committee we are setting up shall decide which of these forms is good and recommend it to the Seanad. I do not know that it is necessary to bring in any special form of words to ensure that, but perhaps it might be better to leave it out, because it might <Col N="114" /> to a certain extent suggest to the Dáil a method of organising themselves that they have not yet started.  That might not be a proper thing to do.  It might be better to leave it to the Committee to get in touch with the members of the Dáil, and ask them to raise the question in their own House.  Therefore, I am leaving that out, but it is quite possible that an amendment may be brought up to that effect.  Another matter I have put down relates a number of subjects which I suggest these Committees might consider.  I did so because I wished to be quite explicit, and that every Senator should understand what it was that I had in my mind at the time.  It is not at all necessary that all those particular subjects I had mentioned should have Committees.  It is quite possible there are other subjects which might have Committees.  I just put it forward in order that it may be explicit in the minds of everyone here. I hope if these Committees are set up they will be the means of enabling every Senator to be a sort of expert on at least one subject.  Of course, members can belong to two or three Committees or more, and in that way when any question arises there will be a number of people who will be particularly expert on that particular subject, and will be able to discuss the matter when it arises, and the Senate will be conducted on business instead of upon party business. On these Committees there will be members of every party if there are such things as parties now.  There are not, I think, but there are differences of opinion on various subjects, and these will be all mixed together, and in that way we will get a great deal of unanimity we would not otherwise have.  I hope it will enable us to get credit in the country, and that the country will rely on the Senate as a very business-like Assembly capable of doing definite work. I therefore move that the motion in my name in the Orders be adopted.</P>

      <P>I have felt, and I am sure we have all felt, the fact that we are a group of individuals who do not know each other, and that is a great injury to us in our capacity as a deliberative body.  I think, at the same time, if Colonel Moore brings this to a vote now it will probably be lost, and I imagine under the new Standing Orders it would not be possible to raise it again for some time.  I think it is necessary for us to know something of each other before we form such a Committee on the various subjects suggested by Colonel Moore.  I feel it is important that we should not do anything now to injure our chances of carrying out such a project later on. I think, then, we might possibly find it a little desirable to be guided by the idea of not forming Committees on subjects for which there are already Ministers in the Dáil.  Now, if we appoint Committees such as those suggested, we may find ourselves in the position of critics of the Dáil, which is not desirable. We might, on the other hand, find it desirable to form Committees for subjects in connection with which there are no Ministries.  For instance, Public Health.  Now there is no Ministry of Public Health.  It might be desirable to form Committees of that kind.  I am myself anxious to see a Committee appointed to look after the interests of Fine Arts, and I do feel if this motion is brought to a vote it may probably be lost, and if it is not lost we have not sufficient knowledge of each other to form such Committees with the necessary information.  I therefore suggest that we postpone this resolution for some time.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I would be in order in speaking on the amendment. If necessary I will move an amendment later.  If the names are removed from the motion, and if it is made clear that this is simply to enquire into and report at a later date&mdash;if that will meet the wishes of Senator Yeats&mdash;it will postpone immediate action, and it will enable the members of the Seanad to know each other.  I think we would make much more progress if certain Committees, not too many, are appointed. I have always felt that it would be extremely helpful to both Houses if Joint Committees, who could report to both the Dáil and the Seanad, were appointed.  I know provision is made in the Standing Orders in Canada and Australia for the initiation by both Houses of Joint Committees.  I think, therefore, that probably will be one of the subjects that might be included.  I hope that in some form this motion of Colonel Moore's will be adopted, so that it will not be cropping vaguely up in a continuing form, but that when it comes up it will be definitely disposed of.</P>

      <P>I formally move the amendment, which I have practically already explained, and which has been circulated to the Senators.  My amendment would make the original motion read in this way:&mdash;&ldquo;That a Committee be appointed to consider and report on the advisability of establishing Standing Committees appointed either by the Seanad alone, or jointly by the Seanad and the Dáil, and to suggest to the Seanad the purpose, method of appointment, and duties of any Committees that <Col N="117" /> may be recommended.&rdquo;  May I briefly point out that the object of the alteration is not to dictate to the Committee the names of the subjects for which the Committees would be formed.  It is to make it possible for them to report in favour of Joint Committees. That is the object of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I think that the proposal made by Senator Douglas is an admirable one, and it is quite obvious that if we are to conduct our business in any kind of satisfactory way there must be some communication between the Seanad and the Dáil.  The appointment of combined Committees is an excellent idea, and it would get us out of very considerable difficulties on many occasions.  On the general question of Colonel Moore's amendment, I do not think it would in any way be interfered with by this proposal.</P>

The Committee to consist of the following:&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion this proposal is carrying the Seanad a very long way.  We have had no discussion whatsoever as to the advisability or otherwise of establishing Standing Committees. In many places where one has served there are Standing Committees, but they have certain specified and definite duties connected with essential existing things in connection with the body they are appointed from.  There are many formal duties connected with such Committees.  One's experience of Committees appointed with a long lease of life, and for no very definite purpose, is that the subjects referred to them are <Col N="118" /> shelved, and nobody bothers his head about them, and you hear no more of them until the Committee report back. For the purpose of doing real business, I do not think Standing Committees are good things at all.  We have not debated this subject here.  We are now proposing to appoint a Committee to consider the advisability of establishing Standing Committees.  Why should we appoint a Committee to do a thing which the Seanad ought to settle for itself? The Seanad ought to decide whether or not it is wise to have Standing Committees. I believe that Senator Yeats' proposal was the right one; we have not had time to consider the matter.  The questions raised in the present proposal are very big questions.  To make a great change of that kind seems to me too hasty, and I am of opinion that Senator Yeats is right; we ought to have time to consider this matter and to know each other better and to know the best people to be selected for those Committees. In my opinion a Committee should be appointed only for a definite purpose, and its duties should end when that purpose is achieved.  I do not believe that Standing Committees do much good at all.  The Seanad should be given an opportunity to debate the question fully. Then probably we will have a clearer idea of what we can do along the lines of Senator Douglas's resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to suggest that the amendment be put, in order to keep the matter in order.  The only difference between Senator Jameson and myself is simply this&mdash;that I think that the whole Seanad could discuss the matter better after receiving a report than it could by simply discussing a motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Seanad will allow me to say just one word about this.  I attach very great importance to the amendment proposed by Senator Douglas, because the moment we get our Seanad in order and proceed to enter systematically upon the business entrusted to us we will find ourselves up against difficulties every day by reason of the absence of Ministers in our Seanad, and the absence of means of communication between the two Houses. The great benefit that I see in the amendment suggested by Senator Douglas, <Col N="119" /> having regard to the work we will have to do, is the fact that it enables us to get these joint Committees, if we can, into working order at the earliest moment.  While the matter is well worthy, of course, of much greater consideration, I think that inasmuch as this is only a proposal that a Committee should report on the subject, it does not pledge the Seanad to anything, and it gives them the fullest opportunities later on the discussing the whole question when the report comes up.  Perhaps, therefore, the Seanad might allow it to go in that form, which, I understand Senator Colonel Moore will accept.  I shall now put the amendment moved by Senator Douglas and seconded by Senator MacLysaght.</P>

      <P>I should like to consult the wishes of the Seanad on the next motion, which is the motion for the adjournment.  The position is this, as I understand it, that the other House will have no further business ready for us before the 16th instant at the earliest date.  At present in our initial state we have devised no business for ourselves.  In the interval I hope that the suggestion of Senator Moore will take effect, and that the members will begin to devote themselves to the study of any particular subject in which they take a special interest, and that later on they may promote legislation which would, to some extent, perhaps, relieve the burden on the other House. This Seanad might very well initiate legislation upon non-contentious matters that would be to the benefit of the country and of relief to the other House, but until we get our House in order and our members begin to find their feet we cannot hope for much in that respect. The only thing is that I should wish <Col N="121" /> them to apply their energies to it as soon as possible, because it would give us work to do.  Meanwhile I would suggest to your, although it is not usually the task of the Chairman, but perhaps it is most convenient, that we should not definitely fix the 16th instant, because I am not quite certain that business will be available even by that date. If the Seanad are willing to leave it to me to summon them when I ascertain the date for which they will be required. <Col N="122" /> I will gladly do it, but it is a matter for the Seanad.</P>
