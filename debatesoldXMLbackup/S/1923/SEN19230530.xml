      <P>The first business on the Order Paper is the Statutory Undertakings (Continuance of Charges) Bill.  This is a formal but a very urgent Bill, and has to be put through all its stages to-day, because unless it came into operation to-morrow, financial difficulties would arise.  Perhaps some member, therefore, will move that the Bill be put through all its stages to-day.</P>

      <P>As I understand this measure, it is necessary that it should be passed to enable various arrangements which have been made heretofore to continue, as the Government and the country generally are not in a position to go into this question seriously and to revise all the various regulations which have been made.  The only way out of the difficulty, in view of the fact that a number of these fares and so forth will terminate by a certain date, is to carry on for another year, and that is, I understand, what the Bill proposes to do.  I beg to move, therefore, that the Standing Orders be suspended to enable the Bill to pass through all its stages.</P>

      <P>I hope there is no impression&mdash;I believe there is an impression abroad&mdash;that the passing of <Col N="1048" /> this Bill means that the full charges now in operation on railways, tramways, etc., shall continue as a matter of course until the end of the year.  I take it this Bill merely authorises the continuance of the charges pending or failing other arrangements. I was glad to note that the Minister in charge of the Bill in the Dáil said that arrangements were being made to have an inquiry into the tramway charges.  I think that announcement will be welcomed by anybody having any practical experience of the manner in which the charges of at least one tramway company are imposed.  Not only has there been a very serious increase in the charges, but the stages have been shortened and altered in a very drastic, and, indeed, aggravating manner.  The manner in which the new regulations in the Dublin Tramway Company are being interpreted would almost go to show that those who are responsible for them were rather imbued with the desire of giving the minimum of comfort and service for the maximum of expense and inconveni ence.  Unless you keep your toes very closely to the line chalked out for you by the company, on entering a tram you invariably find that you are charged twopence for less than the equivalent of a three-halfpenny fare, or what should really be a penny fare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the manner in which the requirements of the service are met. There seems to be no real attempt to meet the dinner hour and evening rush for trams.  In fact, it is a case of the survival of the fittest to try to get even standing room on a car at these hours when they are most required.  The fact that there is no queue system in force here as in other cities, especially across the Channel, makes it really a question of physical force in storming a tram at the hours when the great bulk of the citizens require them most.  I think that the least we might expect in return for the very exorbitant charges which are being made at the present time is that we should have reasonable breathing space on these trams and that the company should make a better effort to meet public requirements.  Then there is the case of the charges for children. A child can go the three-halfpenny stage for a penny, but all other fares above that amount must be paid in full.  On the <Col N="1049" /> London busses and trams children are charged only half fares with a minimum of a penny, and I fail to see why similar regulations should not be in operation here, as the present arrangements hit the children of the poor very severely. In the case of a bank holiday or a Sunday, when the working man wants to bring his children out to the seaside, it is a great hardship that he has to pay the same fare for the children for the five-penny or sixpenny stage, as the case may be, as he pays for himself.  It often means that the children are left at home as a consequence.  The railways universally charge half fares for children under the age of twelve years, and there is no logical reason, at all events, why a similar arrangement should not be made in regard to the tramway company. There have been reductions in wages, and very heavy reductions in the cost of materials, particularly in the case of steel rails, coal, and other items that weigh heavily on the tramway company. I do hope, and I sure it is the hope of everybody, that there will be some material reduction in tramway fares before the time for the expiration of this Bill.</P>

      <P>This Bill is not one which purposes to continue charges.  Its purpose is rather to take powers to continue charges or to reduce charges as the case may be.  That is the ambit of the Bill.  The Ministry wishes to have the power to make increased charges when it is found that increased charges are necessary because of increased expenditure in the working of the various undertakings. In reference to what Senator O'Farrell has said in regard to railways I may say that railways do not come within the scope of the Bill.  When the Bill was passing through the Dáil we did undertake to have an inquiry made into the charges of the Dublin United Tramways Company, and as soon as the Bill becomes law we hope to set up that inquiry and to have an immediate investigation.</P>

      <P>There are no amendments sent in to this Bill except one, and that is a signal compliment to the Seanad, because it is a request, apparently, on the part of the Government that we should amend this Certified Money Bill in one particular respect. That, of course, we can only do in the shape of a recommendation, but, as the amendment is one which the Government wishes to have inserted, and it is a purely formal one, I am sure there will be no objection.</P>

      <P>Apart from the fact that many of us may not have sent amendments in, it should hardly be taken for granted that a Bill is to be rushed through all its stages in one day.

      <P>I think the Seanad will agree that if there is a Bill of which Senators have received full notice, and it is a certified Money Bill, as this is, and having had time to send in amendments, it would be not only in the public interest, but in the interest of the Seanad to put the Bill through all its Stages.  As members have expressed a desire to have amendments to this Bill discussed, I think the proper course is to confine ourselves to-day to the Second Stage of it.</P>

      <P>I think there is confusion.  You can discuss it to-day fully, and go into the merits and demerits on the Second Reading.  You have no power to amend the Bill, but you have power to suggest recommendations, and all I do say is, that in a case of a Bill like this, when no notice of any recommendation is given, and it is a certified Money Bill, unless there is a strong expression to the contrary by the Seanad, it might be in the public interest and in the interest of the Seanad to dispose of it.  In view of what Senator Linehan has said about this particular Bill, and his desire to move an amendment, I think the proper course is to confine ourselves to the Second Stage to-day.</P>

      <P>For future arrangement, I think it would be well if we had <Col N="1052" /> a clear understanding that when a Bill is put down for Second Reading, even though a Senator may have amendments, he is not expected to send them in when the Bill is only put down for Second Reading.  He need not send in the amendments until the Committee Stage is fixed.  If I had an amendment I would not send it in until that stage.</P>

Nevertheless, the Seanad thought it was in the public interest to put all the Stages through to-day.  If that is not the view with regard to the Unemployment Insurance Bill, then, I think, the proper course is to confine ourselves to the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>As the Minister is here I want to ask a few questions. Where can we find set out the finances and figures affecting this whole matter? It has been my occupation during the last few days to study the Estimates and to try and disentangle a lot of complicated matters.  I do not recollect seeing anywhere in the Estimates the effect of these various unemployment schemes. Where can we see, now, the precise financial effect of this whole problem, not only for the coming year, but for the past year?  Will any accounts be presented to give such information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be generally agreed that for its particular purpose, the Bill before the Seanad is a pretty satisfactory one.  To my mind, one of the most welcome features of it is the proposal to terminate the present very complicated arrangements as to uncovenanted <Col N="1053" /> benefits, and the special period laid down in the Acts of 1921 and 1922.  The proposed arrangements seem to be simple and equitable, and, after the 11th of October, they should enable the scheme to be worked on a genuine insurance or actuarial basis.  The provisions in Section 3 should help somewhat to case the position of the unemployed during the coming winter, provided, of course, that there is a very great development in trade and trading conditions.  In regard to Section 7, the Minister recognises the necessity of keeping in insurance soldiers who have not to their credit the prescribed number of subscriptions prior to the date of their joining the Army, but the provision is the mere minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Section, it would seem to me that a soldier on demobilisation would only be entitled to a maximum of about 6 weeks' benefit.  One would imagine that, when the principle was recognised at all, it would have been recognised in a more generous and effective manner. This could only be done by paying the same number of subscriptions in respect of each soldier as would have been paid for him had he been an employed person, within the meaning of the principal Act, during the whole of the time that he was in the Army.  The Section as it stands will leave each demobilised soldier in a very precarious and unenviable position, unless he is able to obtain employment very quickly.  Of course, this question of finding work is the real crux of the whole position.  The next twelve months will be an extremely critical period.  The country has been considerably weakened and rendered anaemic by the struggle. Nothing short of a great revival of trade and acceleration of the industrial wheel will bring the country back to a healthy condition, and thus help to solve this terrible problem of unemployment.  We have a very numerous Army of 50,000 men; we have 12,000 or 13,000 prisoners, and some thousands of additional unemployed, who are not shown on the registers. It is true that the Army has absorbed a very large section of the unemployed, and I think that must account for the improvement in the figures now, as compared with this time last year. In addition to that, the provision of Army contracts has given employment to a large number of work-people, who would otherwise <Col N="1054" /> have been unemployed, while the disbursement of army wages and separation allowances has tended to distribute a large amount of purchasing power which also went to reduce or prevent unemployment.</P>
    <P>But this sort of thing cannot go on indefinitely; it is like the camel living on its own hump.  It is an artificial prosperity which leaves, opium-like, aftereffects on the economic life of the country.  It is true that in order to revive trade, we must have settled conditions and there must be a restoration of public confidence.  I hope we are not too optimistic in believing that these conditions are obtainable in the near future. Recent events would lead one to hope that the reign of violence had come to an end.  From this point of view, at all events, we may hope soon to reach what may be termed conditions of normality, but the restoration of public confidence is an urgent matter, and the Government can themselves give all their contributions in this direction.  Now, here the main question of the Army arises.  If it is seen that the Government finds it necessary to retain the services of 50,000 men under arms for a prolonged period, it will not be taken as a very good omen of the stability of the country or the establishment of settled conditions. Therefore, in my opinion, the sooner the question of demobilisation is considered, with comprehensive plans for absorbing at least some material proportion of the demobilised men, the sooner will public confidence tend to be revived.  It is no reflection on the present Army to express the belief that 15,000 or 20,000 men, properly trained and disciplined, will be at least as effective as the present 50,000, who were hurriedly assembled and put in the field with very little training and with little or no discipline.  We may reasonably look forward, in this direction at all events, to some act on the part of the Government that would tend to inspire confidence.</P>
    <P>Another way in which unemployment might be relieved, to a certain extent. would be by the Government speeding up the arrangements for the hearing of claims for damage to destroyed property. There is an enormous amount of work to be done in this direction: sufficient to absorb for a considerable time a large number of building operatives and <Col N="1055" /> labourers, to say nothing of the employment that would be given in other directions connected with the supply of building materials.  Then there is in many parts of the country the question of the arrears of rates.  Many people normally employed by local authorities are now idle because the ratepayers have taken advantage of the prevailing conditions to withhold their rates.  I think every encouragement should be given to the local authorities.  They should be urged to use the whole of the machinery at their disposal, if necessary, to collect these outstanding rates.  As the result of their being withheld, all progress is impeded, everything is held up, and the whole community is suffering very considerably. I believe that it is by the policy of prevention, rather than by any curative policy, that this great problem can be most effectively dealt with.  It is a problem that threatens to become one of our greatest difficulties in the near future, and at a time, too, when the Nation is trying to recover, very slowly, from the staggering effects of the long war against the foreigner, and the still more ruinous war between armed forces in the Nation itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Sir John Keane's application for information as to the cost of the Unemployment Act to the State, independent of the cost to the employers and the employees.  It would be very well that we should know what the country at large has to pay, and whether the agricultural labourers and farmers have to subscribe by their taxes to give the dole to labourers in other parts of the country. I should also like to know whether this Bill adopts the provisions of the other Acts that have been passed previously in which it is provided that a man earning 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a day, or £1 per week, shall be considered as unemployed and qualified to receive the dole.  I should like to know whether it is intended to repeal that Clause or retain it.  There are also conditions as to the unemployed person looking for employment, one of which provides, which is very fair, that an unemployed person is not supposed to take work in a firm where there is a strike.  That is very well.  There is another Clause in the Act which this Bill is proposing to amend.  It provides that where different sets of employees have <Col N="1056" /> disputes between themselves, and in no way concerned with the employer, that a man who refuses to accept employment in that firm is not to be debarred from receiving the dole.  I should like to know from the Minister whether there is any intention to amend these extraordinary conditions in the existing Unemployment Act, and to let the country know how much it costs to carry on these schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Sir HUTCHESON POE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are all agreed with what Senator O'Farrell has said, that the whole question of unemployment is one which deserves the serious consideration of every member of the community.  The system of doles, that is what this insurance benefit amounts to, is very unsatisfactory, and I believe is felt so by every decent working man in the country. These men would much rather get work and honest wages for it than be unable to get work and to stand shivering in the cold outside the Exchange doors, for what, in the best of circumstances, is only a miserable pittance compared with their wages.  Under the Bill, I believe it is contemplated that the average benefit would be about 20/- per week, and that would run for a period of 15 weeks.  Of course, when a man has got nothing to live on it is something, but I am sure we all believe that if work could be found for that man which would give him a wage of £3 or £4 a week, that would be much more satisfactory.  I understand a Reconstruction Commission has been already arranged by the Dáil, consisting of several members of the Dáil, with a view to investigating this unemployment problem, and submitting schemes for the possible employment of a certain number.  What steps that Commission has taken I do not know, but if they could devise a scheme with reference to what Senator O'Farrell has said regarding demobilisation, if they could, in the meantime, before demobilisation is carried out, go into the question of making provision for work for those who are demobilised, it would have a very good effect in the settlement of this question. With regard to expense, I understand, from what was said in the Dáil, that the cost would be something about £250,000.  I do not think that will come out of the Unemployment Fund, as that fund is considerably in debt, but I believe <Col N="1057" /> it will have to come out of the Central Fund.  I believe the Minister said that the cost would amount to £250,000 a year, and that is a very serious sum when we are so much in debt. But there is one satisfactory feature, and that is, since the Bill was introduced in March, that the number of unemployed has dropped from 33,000 to about 29,000. That is a little drop in the ocean, but a reduction of 4,000 is something to be thankful for.  I only hope that before the second year benefit arises that some bigger scheme may be devised for providing work for a large section of those who are now getting what is more or less in the nature of a charitable dole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.W. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion was made to utilise members of the Army when demobilised for the purpose of reconstruction works, and to put them on to these works so that they would not come into direct conflict or competition with the present genuine unemployed.  I think that is a very good suggestion indeed. It will be admitted that the whole trend of this unemployment relief as at present administered, and properly described as a dole, is demoralising.  I think it destroys the self-respect of its recipients and undermines their morale. That is a very unfortunate thing for this country, considering the huge problems it has to face in the near future.  The country is trying to get on its legs again, and it is up to every man and woman in the State, in order to pull the country out of its present plight, to put their shoulders to the wheel, and to give all that is in them in the interests of the State.  There ought to be more of the feeling of the German workers amongst our people.  See what the German workers are doing to-day to pull their Fatherland up, and they are not troubled by any personal scruples.  They see the necessity of the country, and they have put their shoulders to the wheel and are trying to pull their country out as best they can.  I think we would all like to see the workers here animated by the same spirit.  I believe that spirit is in the Irish race, and that this demoralisation has been going on through causes for which the people of the country are not responsible.  There is pluck and spirit in the Irish race, and love for their country, which will, at this juncture, dispose the workers to take suggestions from the <Col N="1058" /> State and to respond cheerfully to any appeal that the State may make to them. I know personally, and I am sure many members of the Seanad are aware, who are brought into daily contact with the workers, that this thing of the dole is irksome to many men.  It has the essence and flavour of charity, and I think a good step would be made in more than one direction if instead of doling out this money, whatever the amount is to which they are entitled, some system of local or other works of a State character, such as drainage, road-making, and works of that kind, all of which are needed by the State could be organised, whereby workers at various points could be assembled, and by means of motor lorries brought to their work and brought back again at night.  I think that works of that kind must be a little removed from the residences of many of the workers, and it would be uneconomic to ask these men to walk 3 or 4 or 5 miles to their work and walk the same distance back again.  It would be more economic to provide a motor lorry to carry these men to their work and bring them home again to their wives and families.  I believe, whatever relation that may bear to a fair standard wage, that 90 per cent of the workers to-day would prefer to give a return for the money in that way, if it were only for one or two or three days' work in the week.  They would rather do that than, as has been suggested, stand at the corners shivering for the dole, which has also a further demoralising effect on them.</P>
      <P>If any plan of that sort were enquired into by the Government I think it would go a very long way towards solving the unemployment problem, and give a very great fillip to the advancement of reconstruction works which the Government have had in view for a considerable time.</P>

      <P>The whole tendency at the present moment is to displace labour from the land and increase unemployment.  As has been proved by the Departmental figures, the fact is that no crop that can be grown now can be relied upon to be sold above the cost of production.  The consequence is that land is going out of cultivation, and that being so, the army of the unemployed will be largely recruited from those employed on land.  To go into what <Col N="1059" /> would be the remedy is too large a question. It is quite clear our present fiscal policy is not suited to the condition of the country, and until the Government finds some remedy, so as to make it profitable to till the land, I cannot see why such measures as are contemplated in connection with the division of the grass lands, will get you any nearer your object of finding employment.  What does not pay an employer of agricultural labour will hardly pay the man who works for himself, unless he is prepared to take a far lower reward for his toil than when he would be employed by a larger farmer.</P>

      <P>The Government are to be congratulated on the step forward that has been made by this Bill.  The provisions of the Bill are a considerable improvement on the old Unemployment Act.  Some Senators requested that the Minister in charge should tell us what the cost of Unemployment Insurance is to the State.  When the Minister is replying I hope he will tell us what the cost is to the working class people who subscribe also for the Unemployment Insurance. Some people have a mistaken idea that the State contributes all the money paid in Unemployment Insurance. As a matter of fact the vast bulk of the money is contributed by the workers. Every person employed in what is known as an insurable occupation, comes under the head of Unemployment Insurance, and contributes a certain sum each week from his or her wages. The employer also contributes so much per head, but I venture to suggest that the worker pays the employer's share as well as his own, because the employer deducts the cost of insurance out of wages.  I would ask any Senator who is an employer if he can contradict that statement.  The actual cost of insurance paid by the employer is put down under the head of wages.  In this way the vast bulk of the money is contributed by the workers.  It is to the credit of the working classes in this country, many thousands of whom have not drawn a penny in Insurance, that they are willing to contribute for the support of their brothers and sisters who are out of employment.  That is the position of Unemployment Insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question raises the very important <Col N="1060" /> issue, whether or not a man or woman has the right to work or to be maintained in this country.  If they do not get the right to work, then the State has a duty cast upon it to maintain them.  If a manufacturer, contractor or other employer of labour has a team of horses for which he has no work, he feeds those horses, and feeds them well.  Therefore, if an employer has a team of work-people and he has no work for them, they also should be maintained.  Charity was suggested. I suggest there is no charity. The people who get Unemployment Insurance provide by their own contributions against unemployment, just the same as a Senator who would insure his property against fire, burglary, etc., would, in the event of anything of the sort occurring, receive compensation.  Any person contributing to Unemployment Insurance gets no charity.  During the old regime in Ireland the manner in which the Unemployment Insurance Scheme was administered savoured greatly of charity.  I am happy to be in a position to pay a compliment to the officials now working the scheme.  There has been a decided improvement in the manner of its administration since the setting up of the Saorstát.  I know something of Unemployment Insurance, because I had to deal with many cases.  I had to appear before martinettes who were engaged administering the scheme in former years, and from their demeanour one would imagine they were dispensing charity, and that what they were paying out was their own.</P>
    <P>There has been a decided improvement since we got the management of this matter to ourselves.  Speaking quite candidly, and from a knowledge of the working classes, I may say that the people of Ireland do not want charity, and do not want doles.  They want to be allowed to live the life that God ordained they should live, to give useful service to themselves and to their brother citizens. They want employment, but under existing conditions it is almost impossible to bring forward schemes to give employment. I hope the time is rapidly approaching when there will be no necessity for Unemployment Insurance.  I hope to see the time when the good-will of all people in this country will be such that every man and woman able to work will <Col N="1061" /> be provided with work.  I have no sympathy with those who are too lazy to work.  Every man and woman can perform useful work for the community, and I hope the time will soon arrive when we will do away with doles for unemployment and otherwise, because there are people getting doles for other reasons than unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenjaminHaughton" hpid="Mr. HAUGHTON Mr. HAUGHTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HAUGHTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I thoroughly agree with the last speaker when he says that he does not believe that the working classes of Ireland are anxious to avail very largely of this dole system.  They prefer not to do so, but owing to the unfortunate state of things and the conditions that have obtained they have been in many cases compelled to do so.  I would like to remind the Seanad of the very graphic illustration which I might take from another country in Europe&mdash; Denmark, a keen competitor at the present day with this country, and with Great Britain.  It is the country that was regarded as being down and out in the sixties of the last century, after being cruelly crushed by the German Empire and an important province taken from it.  Instead of throwing up their hands in despair on that occasion, the capitalists and bankers in a very patriotic way, and especially the working classes, put their heads together and so co-operated, one with the other, that to-day Denmark, per head of population, is one of the richest countries in Europe.  The gospel of patriotism and national endeavour was proclaimed throughout that little country. Electrical power stations were started, dairies were started and equipped in a manner that set an example to, and won the admiration of, the whole world. I believe that even the very piggeries were electrified, and in every channel of useful development the Danes set a splendid and patriotic example.  I would like to remind my own countrymen at the present time what little Denmark did half a century ago.  I believe that the working classes, as well as the capitalists are seemingly desirous that Ireland should prosper.  I would like to suggest to them, especially to the men in my own neighbourhood in the South of Ireland that it is difficult for Munster, Leinster, Connaught or Ulster to compete with cross-channel firms, and Denmark, if the wages are based on a higher level than what is paid elsewhere.  I am sure that <Col N="1062" /> we who are interested in the industries of one kind or another are most anxious to pay as much, at any rate, as is paid across channel.  But I think it is unreasonable and unjust that it should be expected of us that wages and salaries should be based on a very much higher level than our friends and neighbours across the channel are paying at the present time.  If we do co-operate, one with another, with the one desire that our country should prosper, then our country would be in a better way, and we ourselves would in time to come look back upon the era, difficult and awful as it has been, for the last few years, not with regret, but with satisfaction that we profited by these bitter experiences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to emphasise what has been said by the last speaker.  As far as I can understand the Bill, it is not applicable to the rural labourer.  That, at least, is my impression. If the industrialist class is to be largely added to in the country then I am afraid that this Unemployment Bill, being what Senator Farren describes as just, standing actuarial tests, will become largely charitable, and instead of costing £250,000, it will go into the neighbourhood of a million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I personally have worked on the land all my life.  There is hardly a detail on the farm that I do not know.  I worked at everything from the plough to the threshing mill, and I can say with confidence that no operation on the land at the present moment is capable of giving a man a decent wage.  I think it would be advisable for the country to go into the fiscal question and see whether means can be devised to keep the labourer on the land in Ireland at a wage which will justify his existence there, and make it a paying proposition.  I have nothing but admiration for the labourers and for their loyalty to one another, which deserves the admiration of everyone.  Their readiness to subscribe to unemployment funds and to do everything which a citizen ought to do for his neighbour, and which they do for one another is admirable. For that reason I welcome the attempt on the part of the Government to secure that the unemployed man should get sufficient to keep him from hunger when the occasion arises for the Unemployment Benefit.  But I feel that the number of unemployed in Ireland will increase unless <Col N="1063" /> something is done, and done quickly, to relieve conditions on the land, and this unemployment will add largely to the difficulty in the country.  I would like to see, as Senator Farren suggests, that a large portion of the unemployment money was paid by the employees themselves. Possibly in proportion to his ability the employee is paying a large proportion.  But when you consider that £250,000 is to be expended, and that the employer has to pay a proportion of it, I do not agree with Senator Farren when he says it is paid out of wages, and that it does not partake in some form or another of charity.  Charity is not to be despised; if a man wants it he must get it. It is one of the most ancient and best Christian principles to relieve your neighbour in distress, and the Government recognise this themselves.  I have nothing but admiration for it, but in order to make it a success, in order to ensure that the burden of the State will not be greater, I feel it is incumbent on the Government to investigate thoroughly and sincerely the conditions of agriculture, and to secure that no men should be withdrawn from rural labour to swell the unemployed population in the towns.</P>

      <P>With regard to the sums involved, a Vote, of course, to provide for unemployed benefits does appear in the Estimates; but there are some figures which I have immediately available, and which will probably interest Senator Sir John Keane.  For the purpose of the present Bill a sum of £250,000 will be necessary.  That sum will be necessary after allowing for all contributions from both employers and employees.  That sum will still be necessary. Moreover, the Senator will be in terested to know that a sum of £550,000 is now owing from the Unemployment Fund to the Central Fund for advances made during the past few months.  Of course he will appreciate, as I am sure the other Senators appreciate, that unemployment during the last 12 months has been altogether abnormal.  Conditions existing in the country have been abnormal.</P>

      <P>Figures are set out <Col N="1064" /> in the Estimates dealing with the various Labour Exchanges.

    <Speaker pid="JosephWhelehan" hpid="Mr. WHELEHAN Mr. WHELEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHELEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Of course that £100,000 would not exactly apply to the period over which that £250,000 would be expended.  The £100,000 would be an annual expenditure in connection with administration.  Further, I might add, without suggesting who pays the major portion, the following figures may be of interest: employers' contribution is at the rate of 10d.; employees (male) 9d., and the State contributes 6¾d.  About £35,000 per month is received in contributions from employers and employees. Dealing with the points raised by Senator O'Farrell, the Senator will remember that military occupation is not one of the insurable occupations in the principal Act, and in Section 7 of the Bill the endeavour was to ensure that soldiers on demobilisation would not labour under any disadvantage.  We could not accept the insurance principle for military service, but we do want to ensure that men who have been in insurable occupations before joining the army will suffer no disadvantage on demobilisation.  That is the intention in Section 7 of the Bill as it stands at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cure for unemployment very obviously is not Unemployment Insurance, and I am glad to see that all sides of the Seanad fully recognise that in the present conditions, or in the conditions that have prevailed up to now, it would scarcely be possible to expect that work could be found for all those unemployed. I agree fully with Senators that before there can be public confidence&mdash;that public confidence which is necessary to invite capital to come readily into operation, to be invested in the country and, consequently to give employment&mdash;we must have ordered and peaceful conditions. <Col N="1065" /> The Government has recognised that, and the aim of the Government during the last twelve months has been to secure that those ordered and peaceful conditions should come about at as early a date as possible.  I do hope, with Senators, that those ordered conditions now obtain and that very readily and very rapidly unemployment will decrease; that capital will take courage and will take labour into its confidence, and that both capital and labour will recognise that there is a patriotic duty which both parties can discharge and which they ought to discharge: after mutual conference to secure that every man and every woman who is willing to take the Saorstát to heart as his or her country will have no reason to complain of the means of living within the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>As to the point raised by Senator Linehan, so far as I understand, the Senator said that a man earning 3/4d. per day, or £1 per week, was still entitled to benefit.  What the Act does provide is that a man out of his normal employment is not disqualified from benefit if he has some occupation which does not yield him more than 3/4d. per day.  As to trade disputes, the definition of a trade dispute under the Act has been the accepted definition for the past twelve years, and until this date no better definition has been found.  There was one other point with which I might deal, that is the provision of public works.  In the Bill, as originally introduced, we had a Section 7 which provided that in particular cases and for works of public utility the Minister might direct, with the assent of the workers, that instead of paying unemployment benefit to any particular sum per week, in case an employer had not been able to work economically, what would be paid to the men had he closed down should be paid to the employer if he were allowed to work on and make up the balance of the weekly wage to the men.  That provision, however, did not commend itself to the Dáil, and we were not particularly enamoured of it in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, because we realised it would mean a considerable amount of extra work and considerable difficulty in determining what were works of public utility and ascertaining accurately when work could not be carried on economically.  So <Col N="1066" /> that Section was omitted.  It was an honest endeavour to try and do good to two parties.  However, it did not commend itself to the Dáil, and the Section was withdrawn.</P>
    <P>To try and hasten up the absorption of all the unemployed under proper schemes of work, a Commission on Reconstruction and Development has been set up to advise the Ministry on useful schemes of work.  We await the report of that Commission, and the Government intends taking advantage of the report at the earliest possible moment.  The Government has also decided to set up a Fiscal Inquiry to inquire into the industries of the country.  The object of the inquiry, as Senators will remember, was stated in Dáil Eireann.  It is hoped when both these reports are before the Government it will find itself in a position to give all possible aid to Irish industry and, consequently, to remove the necessity for the provision of a very large sum for unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>One final word about the dole.  It is hardly correct to call this a dole.  The present Bill does away with uncovenanted benefit and provides for the payment of covenanted benefit only.  It is a return to covenanted benefit, based on the number of contributions from the persons who become unemployed.  It is hardly correct, however, to call it a dole.  Even with regard to the past few months it would be scarcely correct to call it a dole, as it is intended that all sums which have had to be borrowed from the Central Fund shall, at a later period, be paid back from the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  I hope this is the last occasion on which large sums will have to be provided for Unemployment Insurance Benefit.</P>

    <P>I think it is fortunate that the motion I have to bring forward to-day comes after the one we have just considered, because this tends to remove the difficulty which we have been discussing.  The late President Griffith, who spent all his life in the service of this country, had two objects in view and they were always before him. One was the political freedom of Ireland and the other was the economic freedom of Ireland.  His political views were always very much coloured by his economic views, as he always believed that there could be no development of Irish industries while the country was dominated by the commercial interests of England. The object of my motion is the development of industries, an object he always had in view.  One of the first things he did when he came into power was to establish a commission to inquire <Col N="1069" /> into the industries and resources of Ireland in order that he might have something to go on as soon as a Parliament was set up in this country, as he always expected, and so that there might be methods ready to be considered by that Parliament when it assembled and to avoid delay in helping forward the industrial development of Ireland.  He wished to help industries which existed, and also to establish others.  The object of my motion is to help in the development of these industries.  The commission was an unpaid commission and sat for two and a half years, and worked very hard in all parts of Ireland.  It issued reports on a number of different subjects&mdash;coal and other things.  One of the principal things which it reported upon was water power, the subject we are now considering.  A good many of the Senators, or some, at all events, and some members of the Dáil were members of that commission and worked very hard at it so that, I am sure, they will welcome an effort to carry that work into effect.</P>
    <P>Senators will see that this motion of mine was not a freak action but one that has been very carefully considered for a long time.  It was approved by a great many people.  I have asked advice from a great number of competent people, including Sir John Griffith and others, and they are all agreed that this is a good thing to do.  Nearly all countries have established a hydrometric survey, at least all civilised countries, including America, Switzerland, France and others.  They did not do so in England, as they have there a very large supply of coal readily available and also cheap.  They did not think it worth while to trouble much about water power in England, and very much less in this country.  This Commission, which went into this question, reported that it would be very unwise to venture on any great water power development until the matter had been very thoroughly discussed, examined and investigated, as a great deal of money might be wasted and thrown away in wrong attempts to establish water power where it was unsuitable.  If water power were a continuous force, always ready to act, of course it would be rather a simple matter and would probably wipe out nearly all other powers, but it is not so at all.  There are a great many difficulties in the way of water power, and the object <Col N="1070" /> of this motion is to find what these difficulties are and how they can best be overcome.  Until every rain-catchment area of Ireland, every river, has been carefully studied, the amount of rainfall examined and the outflow of water gauged, it cannot economically be used for the development of power.  People who have mills require a great deal of knowledge on this matter.  They require to know, not only the maximum of power which they could obtain from any engineer who has spent a few hours examining the place, but they want to know the minimum.  We all know that rain varies very much from one month to another, from one year to another, from one period of time to another, and all these falls of rain affect very much the amount of power.  A river at one time might have 10,000 horse power available; at another it might not have 1,000, and before the manufacturer spends money in putting up plant he needs to know exactly the minimum that he can depend on, because, in any case, he will have to put up stand-by plant to carry out the work when there is a small flow of water.</P>
    <P>Observations have been taken all over Ireland at different times, sometimes by engineers employed for the purpose, sometimes because people were interested in the matter, and went out and made reports about it; sometimes private persons put up measures for finding the rainfall, and in various ways like that a good deal of information is at hand stowed in different reports, but by no means full reports.  It would require a great many more gauges on various rivers and rainfall gauges before we know exactly how we stand, and we require reports over long periods of time.  Another very important matter to consider is the co-ordination of power.  Sometimes there are rivers which have a good many affluents with small power.  Perhaps none of these affluents is sufficient for any big purpose, but by hydrometric means these could be brought together and used.  If certain independent private companies obtained possession of these water-powers it might be very difficult to buy them out. They might not be able to use them very much themselves, but they might hold them and get very big prices.  Although the State might have nominal control over them they might not be able to get actual power over them, except at very great cost.  What is necessary is that <Col N="1071" /> Irish industrialists who want to establish industries should know exactly what power is available in different parts of the country.  They must have reasonable surety that their money will not be wasted.  Hitherto they had to depend on the reports of persons who have been sent out for the purpose by private individuals or by companies who wanted to exploit these districts, and these people who reported to them, or the people who were trying to get things established, were very often not anxious to know what the real thing was.  They wanted to get big statements so that companies might be formed, and they did not care very much whether these companies failed or not. That has been one of the great difficulties in this country.  People have not known exactly where they were and were not willing to spend money on these things.  People have talked of the enormous water-power in Ireland.  Because they see the Shannon and other rivers flowing down the centre of the country, false statements have been made about the power available.  The object of this Motion is to find out exactly where we stand.  The United States have quite lately established a hydrometric survey, and I will read you an extract from the first report made.  It is from the first annual report of the Federal Power Commission for the fiscal year ended the 30th June, 1921:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The approval of the Federal Water Power Act on June 10, 1920, marked the end of the period of discussion and controversy, which, for more than a decade, had waged both in Congress and outside, over a National policy with respect to water power under Federal control.  The laws previously governing the administration and disposition of water powers had been passed, the one in 1901 and the other in 1910, at a time when there was little appreciation of the role electric power would play in transportation and industry, or of the safeguards which, in the disposition of this National resource, would be required in the interests of the investor as well as of the public.  For many years Federal laws had been wholly unsuited to prevailing conditions.  The rights granted were so insecure, and the liabilities imposed so uncertain, that only in occasional instances could water power <Col N="1072" /> development, which required Federal authority, be financed; with the result that the development of the inexhaustible water power resources was largely blocked, and recourse was had to steam power, with its consequent use of coal.  The flood of applications which have followed the passing of the Act of 1920, and the projects on which, notwithstanding the industrial depression and the uncertain financial situation, construction has already started, under licence issued by the Federal Power Commission, is abundant evidence both to the extent to which former legislation stood in the way of power development, and of the generally satisfactory character of the present legislation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The same object is in view here, that people might know what power they have available before they make these applications. Of course there are a great many difficulties in face of establishing water power.  If it were quite a simple thing it would have been easily done long ago. One of these difficulties is storage in lakes and reservoirs, and there again the establishment of these lakes and reservoirs causes a great many other difficulties, to agriculture by flooding, to navigation and to fishing, and it requires some central authority to decide which is the most important, nationally, of these subjects. Sometimes fisheries may be more important than power, and sometimes navigation may be.  Sometimes the difficulties caused by flooding would prevent the setting up of power stations, because they would do more harm than good. There must be some central administration to decide which is the less, and the less should give way to the greater.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to refer to is the cost.  The cost of setting up a hydrometric survey is an important matter, and it depends very much on whether we are going to rush into this business and set up a full-grown Board straight away, or whether we are to begin by degrees with a few engineers and develop gradually as we proceed.</P>
    <P>Personally, I think it is much better to begin in a small way.  I have a statement here with regard to the numbers of persons and the expense involved.  It is made up by Prof. Walsh, of Cork, who had almost the entire drawing-up of the Water Power report which was sent out</P>

      <Col N="1073" /> He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The work of the Hydrometric Dept. might develop gradually, requiring a small staff at first, and a larger staff later; or it might start on a large scale with a big staff.  For many reasons I think the first alternative the better.</P>
    <P>Initially, the staff would consist of a senior and junior engineer at salaries of, say, £800 and £400, respectively, and a clerk.  Equipment would consist of a small office, a Ford car, a few surveying instruments, costing about £150 at most, maps, and sundry office fittings.  Put the total cost of equipment required, initially, at £500.  For the first six months the expenses would be something of this order:&mdash;</P>

    <P>During this time the two engineers would examine, together, the most important rivers, in order to locate power sites needing early investigation, and to locate sites for guaging stations.  This work could be based on the Water Power Report of the Commission of Enquiry, but would entail travelling over the greater part of the country.</P>
    <P>As soon as a number of the most important sites for guaging stations would have been fixed, two more junior engineers would be required to help in the work of installing guages, locating further sites, surveying, etc.  Towards the end of the second year the staff would probably consist of:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Even after some years working the expenses of such a Department need not exceed, at the very outside, £10,000 per ann., but I really think that all that would be needed could be done, and well done for the £7,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Expensive recording guages would be required only on the most important rivers, say 25 to 30 altogether; very simple cheap guages would suffice in most cases.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that observers would not be required to give more than a few minutes daily to the guages, and would be necessarily local workers paid a small amount for this service.</P>
    <P>As far as rainfall is concerned, dependance must be placed almost, entirely, upon voluntary observers, who might, in some cases, be supplied with guages at the expense of the Hydrometric Dept.</P>
    <P>I think it is inadvisable that the Hydrometric Department should be made a Department of the Geological or any other Department in Ireland.  It is essentially an engineer's affair, and engineers ought to be employed if the work is to be properly done, and they ought to be independent to carry out the work as best they can.  That, I think, gives a sort of estimate to the Senators to work on.  I cannot say that it can be all carried out in this way, but it gives a sort of idea as to the cost.  At present, I am told a great many people are going about the country, speculators and others, drawing up plans and trying to get up companies for the sake of starting these things, and perhaps selling them afterwards to other companies with profit to themselves, and with no particular trouble to themselves, and there is no proper Department of the Government to meet this, and to prevent the country being exploited.  Therefore, I move that the proposal I put here shall be passed by the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.W. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion put forward by Senator Colonel Moore.  I feel very strongly that the water power which is so largely available in Ireland will inevitably develop <Col N="1075" /> into the motive power of this country, and for that purpose I think that the setting up of a Board of Control is desirable.  Senator Colonel Moore went into the question of cost, and I am satisfied and glad to know that the cost will be very little as an initial experiment, but I am more concerned with the fact that the great water power of the State should be conserved for the State, and that it should not, by any means, get into the hands of private exploiters.  There is that danger put forward by Senator Colonel Moore, and if you do not get such a Board of Control up and down the country you will get people selecting favourable places where power may be developed, and trying to grab these places and take them away from the people, to whom they belong. Having heard the statement as to the probable cost, I think we could hardly hesitate to advise that this step should be taken.  I am one who feels that an industry will not be started unless there is a reasonable prospect of power for working it.  I may be told there is plenty of water everywhere, and plenty of information everywhere, and that the Government Departments are pigeonholed with all the necessary information, but that wants to be collated, and wants to be made known, and the whole material resources of the country require to be conserved for the State.</P>
      <P>Collaterally I think the Hydrometric Survey would be advantageous to the land.  To my knowledge certain parts of the richest areas are water-logged. Hitherto the cost of schemes of drainage have militated against the admirable advice given by engineers to drain these lands.  I think if the whole of the water power of the country was conserved and streams diverged to their proper channels, that great good would react on some of the better class lands in the South of Ireland.  I do not think there will be any objection on the part of the Senate to approving of the motion of Senator Moore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that although I am entirely in sympathy with the objects of the proposer and seconder of this Resolution, that I am entirely against the methods they propose to adopt.  I am one who has spent more years than I like to reckon up in <Col N="1076" /> the practical promotion and carrying out of works of this sort, and I have invariably found that when you are running up against a bureaucratic body, instead of being likely to be helpful it is much more apt to be a hindrance. We have a very eminent Irishman who is a member of the Seanad, and no doubt you will all recollect a debate and somewhat acrimonious correspondence a few years ago on the question of the number of public Boards that existed in Ireland. I think he calculated them at something like 33, and he proceeded to point out that the bulk of these Boards, or a great many of them, were mainly occupied in justifying their own existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often the views of one run up against the views of another.  I fear that if we establish this Board of Control which is suggested here that we will be only creating another bureaucratic body that will be a kind of Frankenstein that we would find it very difficult to get rid of later on.  With regard to the information that Senator Moore is so anxious to get, I would like to point out that a Board of Commissioners were appointed here in the early part of the last century to investigate water power.  They did investigate, with very great care, the water power of almost every river of importance. Their reports are in existence. They are, no doubt, hidden away in the archives of some Government Department. They are most carefully made up. The plans are all lithographed.  The reports are all printed, but I am afraid that they have been consigned to the scrap heap with a number of reports of Royal Commissions and others that have been appointed in the past.  I am very much afraid if a new Board of Control is set up, that instead of forwarding what we have at heart that the effect would be the reverse.  I am very anxious that I should not be for one moment taken as suggesting that all the investigations which are at present carried on by the Meteorological Department should be dropped, but I believe that very much cheaper and better arrangements could be effected by utilising those reports.  I get a weekly, and a more elaborate monthly report from the Meteorological Department.  They go very fully into the question of the rainfall and other phenomena that they have to deal with.  I <Col N="1077" /> think that with the help of the information, which the Department is in a position to furnish, that nobody will be very much astray in calculations as to what water power can be expected in any given district.  I think by establishing a Board of this sort we will be only creating an incubus and spending a lot of money which would be much more advantageously spent otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGriffith" hpid="Sir JOHN GRIFFITH Sir JOHN GRIFFITH">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN GRIFFITH</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say myself that I approach this subject with very great sympathy for Senator Moore. I should have liked that he would have confined himself to the formation of this control and not go into the question of the work they had to do.  The work that has been put down is, of course, the elementary work of any department of the kind.  I am in total sympathy with Senator Moore's motion, for I have been through this mill for the last thirty years and found the difficulty of securing water its proper use.  Of the many Commissions that have sat in this country for the last forty years, there was one refrain at the end of every one of them: &ldquo;Unity of control is wanted.&rdquo;  Drainage Commissioners one after the other pleaded for unity of control; the Navigation Commission, under Lord Shuttleworth, pleaded for unity of control.  Viceregal Commissions and Committees that have sat on different portions of the work have all pointed out the want of unity of control. I was glad to hear Senator Moore quote from the reports of this Water Power Commission which has been established in the United States within the last three years.  This is a new body.  It is the result of the experience of the last twenty years. Congress finally passed an Act appointing this Commission.  It is not a new Board, but it is a co-ordinating Board.  It is a controlling Board consisting of the three heads of Government Departments&mdash;the Secretary of War, the Secretary for the Interior, and the Secretary for Agriculture. There is no new Board, but there is a concentration of powers under one control which is what we have all pleaded for, for the last half century.  If we start on these lines I think we shall do well, and will learn from the experience of what has happened abroad.  Do not let us repeat the mistakes of Switzerland, Germany or France, but let us start afresh with the full knowledge of what <Col N="1078" /> they have done, and let us know the things they have failed in.  If we do that I think Ireland's start in this matter of water power will not be matched in the world's history.  There is very little need for me to labour this point.  I was Chairman of the Board of Trade Sub-Committee in connection with the water resources of Ireland, and we terminated our reports by pleading for the establishment of authority to allocate water amongst those different interests.  That is where the sore point is, to try and make peace between the drainage, navigation, fisheries and water power interests. Power has come in now at the end, and it is perhaps the most important of all. After listening to the debate this afternoon I am filled with hope that with the introduction of water power resources in Ireland we will do a great deal to cheapen power and to supply cheap power to the industries of the country. If we do that the question of wages sinks into insignificance.  I would cordially support the first clause in Senator Moore's motion, to the effect that the Government be asked to take into consideration the formation of a controlling commission, or whatever you call it.  I avoid Mr. Barrington's word &ldquo;Board,&rdquo; because I thoroughly sympathise with him about Boards being the curse in Ireland.</P>

We have a great deal too many Boards in this country, and one of the best things we could do would be to abolish nine-tenths of them.  My friend Senator Col. Moore need not expect me to support him if he proposes to add a thirty-fifth or a thirty-sixth to the various Boards we have.

      <P>That would be quite all right.  It might be advisable to further suggest to the Government that they should take steps to investigate this important matter.  I understand the present situation in regard to administration is that some Bill has been drafted and passed, more or less in skeleton form, enabling the Government <Col N="1080" /> to set up a Department for Technology and Geological research, and various matters of that kind.  I understand there is some idea of co-ordinating the various scientific and technical organisations, and instead of having five or six Boards as at present, having all the work done by one. It would be a good idea to suggest to the Government that whenever they remodel the system of administration, we should have these Hydrometric Surveys, and all the matters relating thereto, combined with the geological survey and various other services, so as to have the control centralised.  That would be the proper way of treating this question.</P>
      <P>We are all most anxious that the water power of Ireland should be properly utilised.  I am not quite sure that when we come to investigate practically, and in accordance with present ideas, the water power of Ireland, we will find it to be as great as we imagine it to be.  Time and again we have had inquiries into this matter.  All sorts of reports have been produced.  Senator Sir J. Griffith has reminded us of his experience in this regard. Of our own knowledge, in studying the contents of our National archives, we know that there are reports almost innumerable, and any amount of Blue Books.  It would be useful if some librarian would compile into a ready summary all the records we have on this question.  If they were condensed, and if the public would take sufficient interest in them to read the condensed material, they would be amazed at the amount of information that we already possess.  We have all this information at our command, but apparently have forgotten about it.  What we have never done is to put the suggestions contained in those reports into practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Colonel Moore has quoted American publications on the subject of water power.  I have seen some of the American power stations.  Of course, we all know about Niagara, possibly the greatest electrical generating power in creation.  We know of the Shoshone Valley dam.  We know of the huge dam at Jackson Lake, which irrigates thousands of acres of land, and we also know of the Mississippi, which is believed to be the longest of all the dams in the world.  The Americans have amazing sources of water supply, and we cannot compare ourselves with them.  At the same time Senator Moore is perfectly <Col N="1081" /> right.  We ought to have a scientific, and, as far as possible, a cheap investigation into our water power resources.  We cannot compare with America, but we can do a great deal in investigating our own resources.  Senator Moore would be well advised not to press for the appointment of a new Board, but to urge on the Government the importance and necessity of taking some steps to have a proper Hydrometric Survey of Ireland carried out as soon as possible.</P>

There will be a good many other things necessary besides that; to pick out one thing like that for mention would seem rather to weaken the case. If we pass the resolution, recommending unity of control, and if the Government agree to it, the first thing they will have to do is to establish this very survey which Senator Moore wants us to recommend.  It would be much better to request the Government to take up the matter of the unity of control for these purposes.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the resolution.  I am in sympathy with it <Col N="1082" /> generally.  It is important in many respects. We have no coal mines in the Free State so far developed as to be of much use in commerce.  I trust that with the new Government these coal mines are at the beginning of their prosperity. There are many cases where there is water power of considerable value that could be worked much more economically than by the use of coal. The difficulty up to this has been the collection of different Boards operating from Dublin, Boards such as those controlling the Shannon Navigation, the C.D. Board, which has ample powers over water supply, the Drainage Boards functioning here and there.  I have some experience in those matters, because I was interested in a very important water power scheme that succeeded in developing something like a three thousand horse power.  I found I was up against several interests.  The farmers were afraid their lands would be flooded.  Others were afraid their lands would be dried up.  The difficulties were immense.  If we had unity of control of all those Boards which have been functioning up to this it would be a great matter for people who might be anxious to invest in industries as the Government would be able to give them information.  They ought to take compulsory powers if it is necessary in the interests of industry where no industries are going on at present.  I think if water power were properly developed it would lead to the establishment of very large industries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there is control for the other things, but there is no hydrometric survey, and it is a very important part of my motion that there should be a survey.  It is an addition to the establishment of general control over the other things, so that people would know exactly the water power they have to depend on in different places.  If a man wishes to set up an industry he would then be able to go to a particular place and be able to say that in such and such a place he had got a certain water power to fall back upon. There are two demands of importance; one is the unity of control, and the other is the hydrometric survey.  Without that hydrometric survey the industrialist who wants to set up an industry will not know what power is available, and he will have to get engineers and other people to find out for him and have to pay a lot of money.  Moreover, there will be all sorts of competition, and things will be put forward.  Therefore, I think it is nearly as important, if not quite as important, as unity of control, that people should know exactly what water power they have.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest that if the Government establish unity of control over these different bodies that are interested in the development of water power, the first step that the Government will be obliged to take will be to institute a hydrometric survey of their own.  They could not possibly go on these different hydrometric surveys that have been made.  They would be <Col N="1084" /> obliged in their own interest to institute a new survey.  Therefore, I think it is unnecessary to put this in the resolution, and I think we should be content with demanding unity of control realising that the first step the Government will have to take will be to institute a new survey of their own.</P>

      <P>Are we clear that one thing does follow the other?  It has been stated here that there are various boards of control, and Senator Jackson has told us of the opposition he met with from one direction or another.  The resolution in its amended form would simply co-ordinate these various Boards as far as this particular matter is concerned, and the Government might rest at that and not go any further.  They might establish unity of control over these various factors.  Senator Moore's idea is to keep them moving.  When you come to a hydrometric survey, that is not a work that can be achieved or completed or accomplished in a week or a month or a year.  For the purpose of being of any value to the industrialist who wants to invest his money in water power, there must be some guarantee as to continuity of supply and uniformity.  He will want to know the maximum and minimum within the 12 months, not only in one year, which might be dry or wet, as the case may be, but over a series of years. That is the work that the hydrometric surveyor is asked to do, and it will be an absolutely initial work.  If you are going <Col N="1085" /> to develop the water power of Ireland and start at once, that is the initial step, because it will take some time to complete it.  Other things may be done within a year, but your hydrometric survey and your data and figures and conclusions from it must be spread over a series of years.</P>
      <P>Your meteorological records of half a century ago, of the rainfall, etc., in that period, are practically no use to-day. It is within our knowledge that the whole climate of the country has changed.  Years ago, when we were boys and girls, we knew to a week when the snow would come, and how long it would last, and when we could skate on the ice. You cannot make calculations of that sort to-day.  The climate and the whole atmospheric conditions have changed.  For practical purposes many of the reports from the various boards on these matters are useless to-day.  I want that point cleared up.  I take it, the inner meaning of Senator Colonel Moore's insistence on the last paragraph is, that he considers it the only factor that will keep the Government moving.  In order that this movement should be of immediate benefit to the country, it should be put in hand, as it will take a number of years before any conclusions can be drawn from such data. The latter paragraph does not compel the Government to establish at once this survey, but in their own good time to set the matter going.</P>

      <P>I certainly do not think it is worth dividing the Seanad on it, but there is an important matter I will call the attention of Senator Colonel Moore to.  As it stands now, the motion begins by calling attention to the importance of developing the water power, but says nothing about navigation or drainage.  Therefore, I think it would be wiser that you would embrace all three.  It would then read: &ldquo;That in view of the importance of the subject matter, the Seanad request the Government to establish unity of control for the development of water power, the improvement of <Col N="1086" /> navigation and drainage, and also to establish a Hydrometric Survey of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I beg to move the adjournment of the Seanad until next Wednesday, and, in doing so, perhaps I would be in order in raising a small point to which some publicity might be given.  A number of Government Bills are of such a character that they might be introduced first in the Seanad.  I think that would help to prevent the congestion of business and add to the usefulness of the Seanad.  I do not think we should pass a formal resolution asking the Government to introduce Bills in the Seanad first, but I think, if you rule with me, and if the Seanad agrees, that we would be glad to give facilities to Ministers to introduce Bills here as it would be in the public interest.  There are some Bills, like the Films Bill, which could have been commenced here, as for some weeks we had no business to do.  Now we have a good deal, and later we may have very little.  I mention the matter, as it is one for general agreement, and perhaps you could convey it to the President.</P>
