      <P>The first business on the Order Paper is the consideration of the Governor-General's Salary and Establishment Bill.  This is a certified Money Bill.  Probably the Seanad will agree that this Bill might pass through all its Stages if some Senator would kindly move a motion to that effect.</P>

      <P>I know we have no power to vary this Bill, it being a Money Bill, but I wish to raise a point which concerns the form of our Public Accounts.  If you take the Estimates, under which portion of the Governor-General's salary is provided for, you will find that they do not show the entire cost of the Governor-General's Establishment. That applies, I think, to almost every Department in the State, as set out in the present Estimates.  There is a foot-note in the Estimates that further expenditure in relation to the Governor-General's Establishment will be found under the Central Fund, Rates on Government Property, Vote 17; Public Works and Buildings, Vote 11; Stationery Office, Vote 25; and Post Office, Vote 59, although I might mention that telegrams <Col N="1000" /> and telephones which, presumably, are also on the Post Office Vote, are specifically provided for in the Estimate.</P>
      <P>I raise this point merely as an illustration of the very confused form in which our Public Accounts are now drawn.  It is impossible, as a business matter, ever to tell from the form of the Public Accounts &mdash; which, I admit, the Government have inherited&mdash;the true cost of any Service.  Large portions of the cost are concealed in other Votes, and when you come to make a systematic examination of any Service you only get its partial cost.  Having made these remarks, which I hope will come to the notice of the Government, I hope that steps will be taken &mdash; nothing can be done hurriedly&mdash; to recast the whole system of our Public Accounts, so that the true and business cost of any Service may be set out on the face of any Estimate, and also on the Appropriation Account which, in due course, must follow the Estimate.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a few remarks about this matter, which. I hope, will not be considered any discourtesy to the Governor-General.  It is a matter of very considerable constitutional importance, although some people may think it a matter of words.  Words are very important at the present time. We have had a war about words during the last year, and a good many Deputies, elected by constituencies, have refused to take their places on account of certain words.  Therefore, I think we ought to be very careful how we use words.  A great writer once said they are sometimes like the fabled dragon's teeth that sprang up as armed men.  They have done so in this case.  The Governor-General, in his address to the Seanad and the Dáil a few months ago, read a telegram from the King which, I presume, was drawn up by the King's English Ministers.  He also read a reply to him, in which he used the same words as were used in the other telegram.  I do not know, but I presume, that that answer was drawn up by our own Ministers.  Anyway, the words were exactly similar.  I should like to call attention to these words, because it is a matter of very considerable importance.</P>

      <P>Then the discussion would not be relevant to this Bill.  The motion before the Seanad is, that the Bill be read a Second Time.  If there were any words in the Bill to which you took exception your appropriate remedy would be to move that they be deleted, but, I am quite satisfied that a discussion which would turn on certain words, used elsewhere, and under other conditions, would not be in order.</P>

I have just received intimation that the Minister in charge of the Bill is not able to attend for the moment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE LOUGHREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the motion in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Government be asked to appoint a Commission, with power to examine voluntary witnesses, to inquire into and report on the desirability or otherwise of adopting the Metric System in Saorstát Eireann, and that it be a special instruction to such Commission to consider very carefully all the various possible intermediate courses between full adoption and non-adoption, such as adoption of the Metric System for measurements of length and area, but not for weights or capacity, adoption for official use (including Government contracts and stores and dutiable commodities), but not for general use (and so on), with a view to reporting on the desirability, if so thought fit, of some such partial adoption, if full adoption is considered, after inquiry, not to be desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion asks the Government to appoint a Commission to inquire into the advisability of adopting the Metric System.  My original intention in proposing the motion was to afford an early <Col N="1003" /> and ample opportunity to the Government to consider fully the advisability of adopting the Metric System.  From my own observation on the subject, I believe, the present time is opportune, as we are now in a position to act independently and in advance of Great Britain.  To do so would put us in closer touch with the requirements of foreign trade, and tend to promote direct commercial dealings with the Continent.  The Seanad is aware that this system is obligatory in every European country, except Great Britain, Ireland, Russia and Turkey.  It is obligatory in the Argentine, Chili, Peru and Mexico.  It is permissive in the United States, Egypt and Japan.  It has been made permissive by the Metric System Act of 1897, for use in Great Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>One important consideration turning on the fact that the system is bound to come sooner or later, is, even if no part of it is thought feasible at present, that the people generally should be made familiar with the values and advantageous simplicities of the system of units.  School children should be taught to regard it as something which will be an everyday concern of their lives, and not a remote study of foreign weights and measures.  People generally should be made as familiar as possible with this system of units, and the proposed Commission would do a great deal to effect that state of affairs. I quite realise that this question is so big that an individual opinion does not count very much, but I think it is of sufficient importance to warrant us, and to warrant the Government considering it in all its aspects with a view to seeing if it is advisable or desirable to adopt the system partly or wholly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the motion, if I may be allowed to do so.  The Senator who moved the resolution has raised what is a very interesting and, to my mind, a very important question.  Whether it is possible, with the many Inquiries that are before the country at the present moment, with many Commissions sitting. or likely to sit, to proceed very rapidly with this question is another matter.  At all events it is well to begin.  From the point of view of trade, there is no doubt about it <Col N="1004" /> that if we could assimilate our system of measurements, and so forth, to the Continental systems, it would make a very great difference to us in the way of foreign trade.  Before we get as far as that I think we ought to try to assimilate our local measurements, which are extremely difficult.  The metric system would be a solvent of many difficulties that confront the farmer, the purveyor, the wholesale merchant, and so forth, and it would be a very great advantage if our foreign trade is to be extended.  Personally, I would like to go further and have a decimal currency in this country, but these things are all in the future, and will come.  As the Senator stated, they are largely decimal in the United States and metrical in South America and the greater part of Europe, so that it is only a question of time until this country will assimilate itself both as regards measurements, quantities, distances and principles of its currency to the systems prevailing generally in the world.  I imagine, as time goes on, that England herself will find she will have to make some change in her arrangements in this respect. Whether we in this country can succeed in doing anything immediately, I doubt, but, at all events, there is no reason why we should not start to consider the question, and enlist public interest and public sympathy in what is a very important, very necessary and very material reform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. J.T. O'FARRELL Mr. J.T. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this motion.  The superiority of the decimal system is incontestable from the point of view of arithmetical simplicity.  For this reason alone I think the motion should commend itself to the Seanad.  It is a very important fact that by adopting the metric system we would save at least, I think, two years' training of the children in school.  One of the great drawbacks of the English system is the lack of any connection between one set of tables and another.  They are mostly of a lengthy and complicated character, and involve an incalculable waste of time in learning during school years, and are mostly forgotten shortly afterwards.  For instance, given the specific gravity of a quantity of iron, the Frenchman can at once estimate its weight in volume, while the English or the Irishman would have to sit down and work it out at great length, or give it up as a hopeless task.  The British system <Col N="1005" /> has really nothing to recommend it except the fact that it exists.  It is hopelessly out of date.  The foot length dates back to 958 A.D., and there are other lengths which are unintelligible to the foreigner.  Almost every country has adopted the metric system, and even the United States has simplified the measurements of length by dropping the foot and the mile, while of weights it has dropped all but the lb., and uses a ton of 2,000 lbs as a standard.  They have also, as every one is aware, adopted the decimal point.</P>
      <P>The arguments are all in favour of adopting the Metric System in Ireland. The one argument for retaining the old system is that it is in existence, and that it is the one in existence in England.  I find in the &ldquo;Manchester Guardian Commercial&rdquo; for May 3, an article which shows that even in England people are giving serious consideration to the question of adopting the Metric System.  The motion, as far as it goes, does not commit us definitely to adopting the whole or any part of the system, but I certainly think there is a very strong argument in favour of making inquiries on scientific lines as to the advisability of adopting this system, which most of the other nations have found it desirable to adopt.</P>
      <P>Motion put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>We will now proceed with the report of the Standing Committee on Standing Orders.  It may be necessary to interrupt the progress of its consideration, but we can go on with it as far as conditions will permit.  I would like to say to the Seanad, in considering this report, that these Standing Orders number 103 altogether.  Most of them have already been approved of and adopted.  A few are presented for the first time, and, while I do not in any way wish to curtail the discussion, I would suggest to the Seanad that, having regard to the fact that they have already been reviewed practically in the whole, no discussion should take place, except in reference to some matter of real importance, arising out of these new rules.</P>

      <P>Orders Nos. 1 to 15, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P>16.  Should the Cathaoirleach or presiding Senator desire to address the Seanad, except for the purpose of controlling the proceedings of the Seanad or ruling on points of order, he shall vacate the chair, and the Leas-Chathaoirleach or other Senator, as provided in Standing Order No. 3, shall preside in the interval.</P>

      <P>No. 16 is new, in so far as it provides that in the event of the Chairman, or whoever may be presiding in his absence, wishing to intervene in the course of a debate, save for the purpose of regulating the proceedings, or ruling points of order, he shall vacate the chair, and that some other Senator shall preside in the interval.</P>
      <P>Nos. 16 to 19, inclusive, agreed.</P>
      <P>20.  No Senator is entitled to speak twice upon the same motion or amendment, except to close a debate upon the original motion of which he was the proposer, even though the same be amended, or except in explanation of a material part of his speech, in which he may have been misconceived, and in the latter case he is not to introduce new matter. But a Senator is not precluded from speaking on an amendment by reason of his having spoken upon the original motion, or upon any other amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to No. 20 I wish to say that it has not been very accurately drafted.  What was in the mind of the Committee was this, that the Senator who moves a motion should have the right to close the debate upon that motion, and the question then that we considered was, that if that motion were made the subject matter of an amendment, this right of the Senator to a general reply be preserved, and it was for the purpose of preserving it that the words &ldquo;even though the same be amended&rdquo; were inserted.  These words have rather the opposite effect, and I would recommend the Seanad to leave them out altogether.  I do not think it is wise or right that the Senator who moves a motion, which has been amended, should have a general right of reply afterwards, <Col N="1007" /> because the amendment might have the effect of making the motion quite different to what he had wished, and he would be supporting a motion, as amended, of which he did not approve.  I think if we preserve his right to a general reply, where the original motion stands unamended, we are giving him everything he needs, and if the Seanad would approve I would ask them to leave out the words, &ldquo;&lsquo;even though the same be amended,&rdquo; and to adopt No. 20 with these words omitted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended speaking on it.  I think it is rather an unnecessary order to put in here.  There are occasions in the other House over the water where speeches are read from end to end.  For instance, when Ministers have to make certain definite statements on matters of policy, and it is desirable that they should not make any slip in the particular words they use, speeches are read.  In the Dáil the other day this question was raised, when one Deputy read a speech and the Chairman passed it by.  He said he thought it would be more desirable that people should not read their speeches, but he did not actually rule it out of order.  I suggest that this should have been put in a more general way, although I quite agree it would be undesirable if people continued to read long speeches.  I remember they did so in the Dáil on one occasion.  When the Treaty was being discussed there was a series of 70 or 80 speeches, one after the other, nearly all of which were read, and most of them were not, I think, made up by the people who read them, and everybody was very much bored.  If that sort of thing were to happen it would be intolerable.  I would like to leave it to the judgment of the Chairman whether these things should be done or passed over.  I think this is more unnecessary in the Seanad than almost anywhere else because I do not think anybody has made <Col N="1008" /> a speech in the Seanad that lasted more than ten minutes.  I would prefer if an amendment were put in, &ldquo;subject to the decision of the Chairman.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, in practice, that is really the way it works out, and has worked out in the British House of Parliament.  There is a sort of general rule of etiquette that no member has a right to read his speech, but unless it becomes an abuse it is ignored by the House, and the attention of the Speaker is very seldom called to it. The illustration you gave shows that there are occasions when, undoubtedly, it is desirable that the speaker should be very careful in his utterances, and in those cases the House takes no notice of the fact that a member is reading from manuscript. I think if you leave this as it is you may, perhaps, trust to your Chairman to follow on the same line.  Of course, if you wish to insert the words, &ldquo;except at the discretion of the Chairman,&rdquo; I do not object, but the rule, as it stands, will be interpreted by me in the same spirit.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is anything contentious in that.  I think the Seanad will agree that the proposer of the motion, after it has been criticised, has the right to reply, and the Standing Orders are calculated to deny him that right, unless these words are put at the end of this rule in the Standing Orders.  It happened about a fortnight ago in connection with an important matter that one of the Senators who moved it was very nearly being denied the right of replying to criticisms on his motion.  I do not think any of us here desire that should occur again.</P>

      <P>I would like to support it.  I think it applies to cases where the motion is before the Seanad, for a certain time, and there is a motion which is accepted.  &ldquo;That the question be now put.&rdquo;  That, of course, has to be put without discussion or amendment, and, when it is carried, the object of this amendment is that before the original motion is put the mover of it shall have the right to reply to the arguments advanced against it.  I think that is only fair, for you will realise that if a motion is before the Seanad, a very eloquent and persuasive speaker may just have addressed the Seanad.  Somebody thinking with him may see an advantage in moving &ldquo;That the question be now put,&rdquo; when the Seanad is under the influence of that particular speech, and if the motion is carried, under the Standing Orders as they are, I think the original mover would have no right of reply to any of the speeches made.  This amendment is calculated to give him that right, and for that reason I think, in the interests of debate and fair discussion, it is one the Seanad generally can accept.</P>

      <P>I see the Minister is in attendance here now, so we will postpone the further consideration of Standing Orders and resume it when we have disposed of the Damage to Property Bill.  The Seanad may recollect that when this Bill was in Committee under consideration here, certain amendments were inserted, some of them on the motion of the Minister in charge of the Bill and others on the motion of Senators.  As regards some of them, it was stated at the time that, while accepting the amendment, the form of it might perhaps require adjustment, and I think to that is to be attributed the fact that these amendments have come back with certain amendments made to them in the Dáil.  We have now to consider these amendments made in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The first amendment is as follows:&mdash; Section 10, Sub-Section (1) (ii.). To delete all the words after the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; in line 1, and to insert instead thereof the words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever a partial re-instatement condition is attached to a decree, the person by whom such condition is to be performed may, at any time within three months after the date of the decree, submit to the Judge a Scheme for the application of the compensation to which the condition is attached in or towards the erection of a building or buildings of a residential character at any specified place in Saorstát Éireann in lieu of the substituted building specified in the decree, and if the Judge is satisfied that the building or buildings specified in such <Col N="1013" /> Scheme will be suitable to the neighbourhood in which it is proposed to erect the same, and that there is a demand in that neighbourhood for buildings of that character, the Judge shall amend the partial re-instatement condition attached to his decree by substituting therein the building or buildings specified in such Scheme for the substituted building originally specified in the decree.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;shall, subject to such conditions as shall be prescribed by the Minister for Finance, be accepted at its nominal face value in payment of all duties payable to the Revenue Commissioners of Saorstát Éireann, by or in respect of the death of the person to whom such security was issued, or in respect of the death of any subsequent holder who had been the registered holder of such security for not less <Col N="1014" /> than twelve months previous to his death.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment of some substance.  The section was adopted in the Seanad making it possible for these Bonds to be tendered in payment of death duties without any restriction. The matter was considered in the Dáil, and this amendment was adopted.  The object is to allow them to be tendered to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of death duties when those death duties arise in respect of the death of the original holder, or of the subsequent holder, who has been the registered holder for not less than twelve months before his death.  I understand that this proposal is on the lines adopted in certain British securities.  The matter is felt by the Minister for Finance to be one of some little importance, because even if there was only to be a very slight depreciation in the value of these securities it might lead to very large quantities of them being tendered in payment of death duties.  The actual amount gained by people tendering them might be very little if the security depreciated to 2 per cent.  They might depreciate if they were the best securities possible, owing to large quantities being put on the market, and our idea is to do everything reasonable to see that the securities do not depreciate. Market conditions might cause depreciation, apart from the value and type of securities.  If these securities were to depreciate to 2 or 3 per cent., that might lead to their being acquired for the purpose of being tendered in payment of death duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue receives about £1,000,000 per annum from death duties, and it would be a serious thing, from the Exchequer point of view, if, instead of cash for £1,000,000 we received securities.  It would mean that the Minister for Finance would have to go into the market and borrow £1,000,000.  It was felt by the Dáil that no hardship would be imposed, provided that a person who bought securities twelve months previously could go and tender them in payment of death duties, and also that the original holder could tender them at any time.  The provision in the beginning of the amendment about being subject to such conditions as shall be prescribed by the Minister for Finance has, I understand, something to <Col N="1015" /> do with the method of tendering, and it is purely a matter of form.  There is no hidden snag in it.  Somebody suggested there was.  I have not got a copy of the British provisions by me, but this has been drafted entirely along the lines adopted in the provisions of British securities.  We thought that we might be doing as much as could be expected if we did as well as the British Treasury in the matter.</P>

      <P>I beg to move: &ldquo;To insert after the word &lsquo;shall,&rsquo; where first occurring, the words, &lsquo;be made capable of registration and.&rsquo;&rdquo; This is the first time in the Bill that registration has been made a qualification for those bonds, and it would be possible for the Minister for Finance to make this amendment null and void in its effect by merely issuing bonds which were not capable of registration.  The words I suggest be put in are that the bonds shall be made capable of registration which are issued in payment for these claims.  Therefore, all the bonds that will be issued will be purchasable, can be registered by the purchaser, and can be used in payment of Death Duties. As regards what the Minister was saying about bonds introduced, and about such conditions as can be prescribed by the Minister for Finance, they are introduced to make Sections 6 and 7 run together.  The Minister for Finance may create such securities bearing such interest, and subject to such conditions as he shall think fit.  As this comes before Sub-section 7, I think that is why they are introduced.  They are perfectly correct, therefore.  I think the Government's suggestion is reasonable.  I think all bonds should be capable of being registered and therefore applicable to the benefits of the clause.</P>

    <P>We were further authorised to inform Mr. de Valera that:</P>
    <P>(1)  Military action against him and his followers would cease when the arms held by them were delivered into the effectual custody of the Free State Executive authorities. The arrangements for the delivery of the arms and the place of their deposit would be made with as much consideration as possible for the feelings of those concerned.</P>
    <P>(2)  Prisoners to be released on the satisfactory fulfilment of (1) and the signature of each prisoner before release to the conditions of the document above mentioned.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Free State Government would keep a clear field for Mr. de Valera and his followers to enable them to canvass for the votes of the people at the next election provided they undertook to adhere strictly to constitutional action.</P>
    <P>We were requested to ask Mr. de Valera to give the names of the leaders on whose behalf he could speak and to state his opinion as to what proportion of the rank and file of the present armed opposition would agree to be bound by his decision, and also as to what amount of acceptance the proposals when approved by him would receive from the prisoners.</P>
    <P>We saw Mr. de Valera on the evening of Thursday, May 3rd, and informed him of the Government proposals.  He agreed to carefully consider the proposals and to report to us in a few days. We afterwards received a message from Mr. de Valera that there were some points on which he was not clear and which he would like further to discuss, and accordingly it was arranged for Mr. Douglas to see him on Saturday evening, and he then promised to give us on Monday, May 7th, a written reply to be conveyed to the Government.</P>
    <P>We both saw him again on Monday evening, May 7th, and he showed us a <Col N="1021" /> document which he suggested should form the basis of a document to be signed by Mr. Cosgrave and himself. This was discussed, and he undertook to send us a revised draft on the following morning.  The draft as received by us is attached herewith (beneath).</P>
    <P>He stated he believed he had included in the document all the essential points in the Free State Government's conditions, and that he considered paragraphs 1 and 2 in this document to be essential to a statement of principles of Government.</P>
    <P>In <i>paragraph 3a</i> he had considered it necessary to add to the Government's proposal the right of reference to the people.</P>
    <P>With reference to the statement of the Government that they could not reopen the question of the Oath, Mr. de Valera stated he had nevertheless felt it right to include paragraph 4, because he believed even if they could not do so they should be asked to admit as a general principle that there should be no barrier to elected representatives who accepted the main principles taking their seats.  He also stated that he felt it his duty to make it clear that full and satisfactory co-operation of all citizens for the good of Ireland could not be assured if any elected representatives were prevented from taking part in any future Parliament because of an Oath to which they could not honourably subscribe.</P>
    <P>He stated it was his considered opinion that the condition as to the effective control of weapons could be best guaranteed by the proposal made by him in paragraph <i>d.</i></P>
    <P>He considered paragraphs <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> and <i>f</i> were reasonable suggestions for carrying out the Government's offer of guaranteeing a clear field for the election.</P>
    <P>With regard to the condition of the Government that prisoners should individually sign acceptance of the principles proposed, Mr. de Valera stated that he did not consider this necessary. When he will sign he will do so on behalf of all Republican forces, including prisoners, and will assure himself before signing that prisoners when released will act in the spirit of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Mr. de Valera stated that he spoke on behalf of the combined Republican Government and Army Council, who, <Col N="1022" /> with the exception of one member not available at the moment, were aware of the proposals made except in so far as they had been altered in conversation with us, and he stated that before signing he would take steps to assure himself that they would act in the spirit of the agreement.  He also requested us to state that he considered it important that on the conclusion of peace, civil servants and others formerly in the public service should as far as possible be reinstated if they so desired, and that no previous action in support of the Republican cause should be a bar to employment.</P>

    <P>We handed this report to the Government, and, in reply, Mr. Jameson received the following letter, signed by the President:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Right">8th May, 1923.</P>
    <P>Dear Mr. Jameson,</P>
    <P>The Government was hopeful, from what you reported to us of the conversation Mr. Douglas and yourself had with Mr. De Valera, that even at this late hour he was minded to turn definitely aside from the paths of violence and destruction he has trodden for so many months, and along which he has led those who looked to him for guidance.  The Government, anxious to facilitate the restoration of peace to the country, set down in writing, in short and unambiguous terms, the fundamental preliminary conditions upon which peace must rest. You have brought back to us, not an acceptance of these conditions, but a <Col N="1025" /> long and wordy document inviting debate where none is possible.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs 1, 2, and 5 of this document are guaranteed by the Constitution, and therefore should have no place in peace conditions.</P>
    <P>We have already informed you we could not consider Paragraph 4.</P>
    <P>Mr. de Valera well knows we are already preparing for an early election, and if he accepts the preliminary conditions, we have made it clear we would give every possible opportunity to all parties to obtain votes.</P>
    <P>We have informed you that we must insist on effective control of all arms, but we would be prepared to invite the Bishops to act through local clergy as intermediaries for their collection.</P>
    <P>Once we were satisfied arms had been handed over in good faith, prisoners who admitted that the terms had been accepted on their behalf, and that they were bound by them, would be released.</P>
    <P>The Government has to say now that the conditions already specified are conditions from which the Government cannot and will not depart.  Accordingly, no further communication with Mr. de Valera can be entertained save only a communication indicating his definite acceptance of the terms stated in writing and handed to you for his signature.</P>

    <P Just="Right">Dublin,</P>
    <P Just="Right">8th May, 1923.</P>
    <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>We enclose herewith a copy of a letter received this evening from Mr. Cosgrave, which requires no comment from us.  An Dáil meets to-morrow afternoon, and we assume the Government will then make a statement and possibly read our report to them.  It is, therefore, essential that any reply which you may wish to send through us should reach us to-morrow not later <Col N="1026" /> than 1 p.m., when our responsibility in this matter will come to an end.</P>

    <P>Dear Sirs,</P>
    <P>I have received your letter and Mr. Cosgrave's reply, which has disappointed me not a little.</P>
    <P>My offer generously embraced every principle of National value that I could conceive our opponents to be honestly fighting for.  I have been met by rigid insistence on a condition in a form which is well known by everyone conversant with the situation to be impracticable.</P>
    <P>May I thank you both for your good offices, and express my appreciation of the impartial manner in which you reported our discussions.</P>

      <P>No. 39 is one that, I think, should be put in in <Col N="1028" /> the form in which it now stands in order to direct the attention of the Seanad to the distinction between Special and Select Committees, a Select Committee to be a Committee to which the Seanad would refer a Bill in preference to referring it to a Committee of the Whole House, and I thought it a convenient thing that the word &ldquo;Select&rdquo; should be confined in its use throughout these Orders to a Committee of that kind, other Committees to be called &ldquo;Special Committees,&rdquo; so that the Seanad will understand that wherever the expression &ldquo;Select Committee&rdquo; occurs it means a Committee less than that of the whole House, to whose consideration a Bill has been referred.</P>

We propose, instead of that, that the form should be that the Seanad do pass on to its next business, or that the matter be adjourned <i>sine die</i> or to a day to be definitely fixed.

      <P>I have the following motion to move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad ask the Government to press upon the British Government the return to Dublin of the pictures mentioned in the unwitnessed codicil to Sir Hugh Lane's will.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1038" /> This is an old question.  We have been agitating now for some years, and I have some reason for saying that the opposition against the return of these pictures is dying away.  I think the justice of our case has been generally admitted. It is simply a question of the inertia of Government and of giving them the necessary impulse towards arriving at some definite decision.  It is necessary, however, I think, to remind you of the circumstances under which that codicil was written.  A good many years ago now Sir Hugh Lane established in Dublin a famous gallery of modern pictures. When he established it there was no modern gallery here in which students could study, and they had to go abroad to do so.  Sir Hugh Lane was no mere picture dealer, but in the words of an eminent authority, he lifted the trade of the picture dealer into the realm of art. He sold pictures merely that he might buy other pictures, and he bought pictures in order that he might endow a great gallery.  After he made the Dublin Municipal Gallery the most important collection of French pictures outside Luxembourg, he was somewhat discourteously treated by some of the Dublin newspapers and certain persons, and an acrimonious controversy arose.</P>
    <P>In 1913, under the impulse of that controversy, he made a will leaving certain pictures, generally known as the Hugh Lane French pictures, to the National Gallery of London.  These pictures had been given to the Municipal Gallery conditional on certain requests being carried out.  Those requests were not carried out, and he gave them to the English National Gallery.  He felt the pictures were not valued here.  He lent them to the English National Gallery to show that they were real pictures of worth.  Then under irritation he made this will, by which he left all his property, with the exception of those French pictures, to the National Gallery of Ireland.  He left certain pictures to the Municipal Gallery, but he left the French pictures to the London National Gallery.  Two years later, in 1915, when he was going on a journey to America, which he knew to be dangerous, he made a codicil by which the National Gallery was to return the pictures known as French pictures back to Ireland.  He wrote that codicil in ink.  He signed it <Col N="1039" /> on each page.  I have a photographic copy of it in my hand; when he made a slight correction in the date he initialled that correction.  No document could be more formal except for one omission. He never had it witnessed.  He spoke of this change of mind to various people. I have in this pamphlet three affidavits of how he spoke of changing his mind, and wishing that Ireland had his French pictures.  Of his intention there can be no question whatever.  From those various documents I think I may read you one affidavit made by his sister:</P>
    <P>I, RUTH SHINE, of Lindsey House, 100 Cheyne Walk, London, S.W., widow, do solemnly and sincerely declare as follows:</P>
    <P>The late Sir Hugh Lane was a brother of mine, and he is hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;my brother.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In January, 1915, my brother spoke to me of making another will.  He went to Dublin, however, without having done so.  It was there (on February 3rd) that he wrote and signed his codicil and locked it in his desk at the National Gallery in a sealed envelope addressed to me; it was very clearly and carefully written and I have no doubt whatever that he considered it legal.</P>
    <P>My brother had no ordinary business habits in the ordinary sense of the word, and was ignorant of legal technicalities.  He dictated both his wills to me, the first leaving all to the Modern Art Gallery in Dublin, and the second leaving all to the National Gallery of Dublin, with the exception of the French pictures left to London. But for my persistence, neither would have been witnessed; even when he dictated the second will he had forgotten all I had told him about that necessity.  So little am I surprised at there being no witnesses to the codicil that my surprise is altogether that he should have written it so carefully.  He must have made rough drafts, as he composed letters with great difficulty, and the codicil was so well written.</P>
    <P>I think from my knowledge of him that if he thought of a witness at all he would perhaps have considered that a codicil to an already witnessed will needed no further formality. <Col N="1040" /> When he sealed up the envelope he was going on a dangerous journey to America, and was so much impressed by that danger that at first he had refused to go at all unless those who had invited him for business reasons would insure his life for £50,000 to clear his estate of certain liabilities, and he thought he was going not in seven or eight weeks, as it happened, but in two or three.</P>
    <P>I have approached this subject without any bias in favour of Dublin, but as his sister, anxious that his intentions should be carried out, and I make this declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true and by virtue of the provisions of the Statutory Declaration Act, 1835.</P>
    <P Just="Right">RUTH SHINE.</P>
    <P>Declared at Markham House, King's Road, Chelsea, in the County of London, this 13th day of February, 1917.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Before me,</P>
    <P Just="Right">G.F. WILKINS,</P>
    <P Just="Right">A Commissioner for Oaths.</P>
    <P>That codicil would have been legal in Scotland.  It seems to us that a request made to a great Gallery is something different from a request made to an individual; that a great Gallery like this cannot desire to retain property which was left to it by accident, and that it must desire, as we do, the return of these pictures if they are set free by Act of Parliament legalising the codicil.  We believe that that Act of Parliament can be obtained.  One Irish Chief Secretary had prepared such a Bill, but it has been pushed aside by the pressure of Parliamentary business.  It is very important for Ireland to recover these pictures. With the addition of the French pictures the Municipal Gallery is more than doubled in its importance, for those pictures are complementary to the pictures here in Dublin.  He was not only a connoisseur; he had the gift of arranging pictures so as to display them to the best advantage.  With those pictures there, we should have in the Municipal Gallery a possession which in future generations would draw people to Dublin, and help in enriching the city and the whole population by bringing those pilgrims.  The actual money value of the pictures is <Col N="1041" /> hard to decide, because pictures constantly change their value, but about twelve years ago they were valued at about £75,000.  It is quite probable they are worth more now.  One picture, by Malet, might be bought at £20,000 They also have this further importance: they will never be in the market again.  The great pictures of that period in French art are already finding their way into national collections.  It is precisely for that reason that certain English critics have tried to keep the pictures in England. They know that if they cannot keep these French pictures in London they can never have a representative collection of French art.  In fighting to recover these pictures you are fighting for a unique possession which will always remain unique and always give prestige to the Gallery that contains it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GUINNESS</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion.  In doing so I have very little to add to what Senator Yeats has so eloquently told us.  The hard facts are that Sir Hugh Lane&mdash;I think there can be no controversy about it&mdash;undoubtedly wished to leave the pictures to Dublin.  Artists very often forget business methods, and, unfortunately, Sir Hugh Lane forgot to have this codicil witnessed.  That being so, there is no doubt that the National Gallery are the legal holders and possessors of the pictures, and they cannot give them up without an Act of Parliament. All that is being asked is that the Government of the Free State should approach the British Government with a view to a short Act being passed to give the trustees of the National Gallery power to return those pictures.  As to the artistic or educational value of the pictures I am not an authority, and I cannot speak.  Everybody has his own views in regard to French pictures, but that they have an actual money value is evident, and I think it is a pity, other things apart, that if these pictures are worth anything from £70,000 to £100,000, and have undoubtedly been left to this country by this will, that this country should be deprived of a valuable collecton, valuable in money, possibly also valuable from an educational point of view.</P>

      <P>Before putting the motion, perhaps the Seanad will allow me to congratulate Senator <Col N="1042" /> Yeats upon the very judicious and very persuasive speech he has made.  I have had these documents, some of which he referred to, all before me, and they establish an overwhelming case in favour of the proposition that the late Hugh Lane not only intended to leave these pictures to the Irish people, to Dublin, but that also he believed that he had effectively done so.  He did not, however, through a mistake, carry out the formalities required, with the result that the National Gallery, which holds these pictures at present as Trustees, have no option but to retain them unless they get statutory relief.  Accordingly, the object of those who have been agitating to get the pictures returned here has been to induce the British Government to introduce a short Bill which would enable the Trustees to do lawfully what, I think, they must feel themselves they are almost bound in honour to do.  It is for that object that this motion is being introduced.  Speaking for myself, I am very glad it has been brought in, and I do hope that the Government of the Free State will pursue the matter.</P>

      <P>Senator Yeats has taken a very good opportunity of bringing this very interesting question forward, and I congratulate him upon his presentation of the case.  There is no need for him to labour the point as to the value of the pictures.  Those interested in artistic matters appraised them at their value, which is very high indeed.  There are two special reasons why we should take a particular interest in this matter.  In the first place, there is no doubt whatever that Sir Hugh Lane meant that these pictures should come to Dublin, but owing to what is, practically, a legal technicality, his wishes were not carried out.  It is rather interesting in connection with codicils to see that only the other day a case was decided in England where a codicil&mdash;a very shaky codicil&mdash;was recognised by the Law Courts.  That is <Col N="1043" /> one point in favour of our contention.  I think that this is a propitious time to move, as there is a feeling on the other side of the Channel that these pictures should be returned to Ireland, and I have no doubt that if our Government takes up the matter and makes friendly representations to the Government on the other side, that they will see their way to bring in a Bill to enable the transfer to be brought about.  We have, as Senator Yeats reminded us, a very beautiful Municipal Gallery in Dublin&mdash;one of the very best.  If we could only get these other pictures, the Gallery would be a really marvellous Gallery, and I hope we shall get them back.  I think we shall get them, and I hope when we do that the municipality of Dublin or the Free State Government will see that a proper building is provided somewhere for the housing of the Dublin Municipal Gallery.</P>

      <P>There is only one point which I think has been passed over, and that is that if Sir Hugh Lane had been shot in France the codicil that he wrote would be, I understand, perfectly legal.  There was a special Act brought into the English Parliament making the wills of soldiers legal under these circumstances. But he was not killed in France; he was drowned coming from America practically under war conditions. Therefore, although it is a little outside the scheme, it is really spiritually much the same thing.  I have been interested in this matter all along, and I remember once when Sir Hugh Lane came over I met him, and we discussed it, and I know the anxiety he had for having a Gallery in Dublin.  His loss was one of the greatest that ever occurred to Ireland, because if he had lived he would have made not only a great Municipal Gallery, but a great National Gallery. He was a great purchaser of pictures, and could buy them where no one else could buy them.  He was, indeed, a great loss, but we hope that his wishes at the end will be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>The following motion was handed in by me:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That, in the opinion of the Seanad, <Col N="1044" /> it is desirable that steps be taken as soon as possible to establish a Patent Office for Saorstát Eireann, and that the attention of the Government be called to the advisability of appointing a Committee to enquire as to how best this object may be effected and relations established with the Patent Offices of other countries, by which the rights conferred on patentees may be interchangeable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Since coming to the Seanad I received a message from the Government stating that they were already considering this question of establishing a Patent Office in Ireland.  They have asked me to withdraw the motion in the meantime.  I therefore, with the permission of the Seanad, beg to withdraw the motion.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The amendment of the Government in Section 13 should come in in sub-section 7.  What I move&mdash;and this is really a Government method of dealing with the matter&mdash; should undoubtedly come into sub-section 7, which reads: &ldquo;The Minister for Finance may, for the purpose of the foregoing sub-section, by Order, create such securities bearing such rate of interest,&rdquo; etc.  The proposal is to insert between the words &ldquo;securities&rdquo; and &ldquo;bearing&rdquo; in line 6 the words &ldquo;capable of registration,&rdquo; so that it will then read &ldquo;create such securities capable of registration bearing such rate of interest,&rdquo; etc.</P>

      <P>That concludes the business on the Orders of the Day, and with reference to our next meeting I should mention that up to the present there is no prospect of any business being available for next week. Consequently we shall not meet next week unless something happens in the meantime, in which case I will see that Senators get proper notice.  As I understand the calendar, the week after that is Whitsuntide, so that it is unlikely there will be any business that week either.  That probably means that the Seanad will not now meet until Wednesday three weeks.  Of course, that is subject always to any business of importance requiring to be attended to from the Dáil, or to anything that occurs in the interval, which might make it desirable for the Seanad to meet.  If so, I shall have the members summoned with proper notice.</P>

It is a statement made by the President, and was issued in order to give Senators an opportunity of knowing the substance of the proposals.  I thought it would be of interest to members to have it.  It is not the statement I made, but it contained the proposals of both sides.</P>
