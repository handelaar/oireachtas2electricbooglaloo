      <P>Before the suspension of the Standing Orders is moved in order to take the final stages I would like to draw attention to the fact that certain Senators took an interest in the various stages of the Bill.  They are not here at <Col N="1812" /> the moment, and possibly they might like to make some observations before the Bill would be finally passed.  Before the adjournment last night, I think the understanding was that the first thing we would take up to-day was the Committee Stage of the Land Bill.  Perhaps for the reasons I have stated it might be well to defer the Report Stage, and so afford an opportunity for discussion.</P>

      <P>I have no objection whatever, but I would like to emphasise that the position of the various matters on the Orders of the Day should not be taken as conclusive as to the sequence in which they would be taken. I considered it was advisable to get done with matters that did not appear to be controversial.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion the Minister for Local Government, who is not here, promised to explain one particular matter regarding the absence of any maximum figure that might be spent in connection with any election. That was one of the matters on which we desired information.  It is quite obvious there is not any maximum fixed. We had hoped to prepare an amendment or amendments to cover the point, but owing to the tremendous business during the last few days and the long hours of sitting, nobody has had time to consider the matter.  As this is an urgent measure I frankly cannot see that it will be possible to amend it now, and get the amendments considered in time by the Dáil.  This is the one serious flaw in it, and unless we could get general agreement as to the nature of the amendment to be introduced, I hardly think it desirable to hold up the Bill on this point alone.</P>

      <P>A good deal of attention was drawn to that point, which is a serious one.  In view of that, I think it is safer to postpone the Report Stage until later in the day, so that any Senator who wishes may have an amendment prepared for submission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that in the debate on the Committee Stage the second section of this Bill came in for some criticism, there being a question as <Col N="1813" /> to whether the section, as it was originally drafted, would not enable the Executive at any time, without consulting the Oireachtas, to accept any regulations that might at any time in the future be put forward by the League of Nations. I had a conversation with the Attorney-General and the Minister for External Affairs, and as a result I beg leave to propose the following amendment: &ldquo;To delete the word &lsquo;may&rsquo; on line 36 and substitute the words &lsquo;are or subject to ratification by the Oireachtas hereafter may be.&rsquo;&rdquo; The section would then read: &ldquo;It shall be lawful for the Executive Council of Saorstát Eireann either as a condition precedent to the admission of Saorstát Eireann to the League of Nations, or at any time after such admission, to accept in the name and on behalf of Saorstát Eireann such regulations as are, or, subject to ratification by the Oireachtas hereafter, may be prescribed by the League in regard to its military, naval and air forces and armaments.&rdquo; The amendment, if accepted, will make it quite clear that the Executive may accept any regulations now in force, which, of course, is essential if they are to give the necessary guarantee, but if any new regulations are hereafter brought into force the confirmation or ratification of the Oireachtas would be necessary.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion when this Bill was under discussion I am afraid I did not make myself quite clear to the Minister.  I said that Ireland would not be represented at the League of Nations except in the Assembly. I used the word &ldquo;Committee&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Council&rdquo; where the representative of the British Empire speaks for the Dominions.  The Council is a body that does the entire work of the League.  The Assembly only meets once in the year, and the Council meets very often.  The Council's work cannot be interfered with by the Assembly.  I am anxious to get some information, as I do not think we have a great deal of information in the matter.  I had hoped some memorandum would be given to us in regard to the powers and conditions of the League.  I want to know now if it is the Council that does most of the business and that the Assembly only meets <Col N="1814" /> once a year; that the Assembly has not the power to upset what the Council does, and that on that Council Ireland is not represented except through the representation of the person who is there on behalf of the British Empire and its Dominions.  I also want to know, if Ireland goes into the League of Nations, does Ireland stand in with the debts of the League of Nations?  I understand it is very heavily in debt indeed.  If we enter the League of Nations do we take part and parcel of that debt?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Seanad will permit this Bill to be finished to-day, and I do not think there is any objection to the matter being discussed now.  It would be just as convenient if Senator Douglas would give some information on these points now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I was unable to be present at the last stage of the Bill, and one or two points were put forward by Senator Mrs. Wyse Power that I would like to be allowed to be referred to as well.  Without in any way interfering with what the Minister will say, there are some points and queries put forward by her that cannot be answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no.&rdquo; They involve explanation, and perhaps are to some extent a matter of opinion.  It is quite true that Ireland would not be, by virtue of her application for membership, on the Council of the League, nor would any other nation, no matter how independent, be able to obtain membership of the Council immediately she was accepted as a member of the League and as a member of the Assembly.  There are some nine nations, I think, represented on that Council. Four of these now are so-called permanent representatives.  The others are elected by the Assembly of the League. Ireland will be unquestionably eligible for membership of that Council if she were elected to the Assembly, quite apart from British representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not correct to suggest that on that Assembly or in any matters respecting the League that Canada is represented by the British representative, or that the <Col N="1815" /> British representative acts for Canada, or likewise that the British representative would act for Ireland.  It is laid down in the rules and regulations of the League that if the Council has under consideration any matter whatsoever which concerns any member of the League, then that member is entitled to be present and take part at the Council meeting when the affairs concerning his country are under consideration.  If Ireland is accepted as a member of the League, then she will be entitled to attend the Council meeting if and when the Council considers anything she is vitally interested in.  That attendance would be in addition to the representative of the British Commonwealth, who might be present at the League as a member of the Council.  I think these things are important, and should be made as clear as possible.  One point that I would like to make in answer to the suggestion made by Mrs. Wyse Power is this, that I demur entirely to the suggestion that the principal work of the League is done by the Council.</P>
    <P>My personal opinion is that it is the Council that has failed, if there is failure, and not the Assembly or Committees or Secretariat.  The Council has been unable to achieve much.  In many respects it has been a failure, but not an absolute failure.  It is the Assembly which has dealt with social, labour and international questions.  It is my opinion that the real work of the League has been done by the Assembly, the Secretariat and the Staff, who are directly responsible to the Assembly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EarlofMayo" hpid="The EARL of MAYO The EARL of MAYO">
      <NameTxt>The EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Committee which meet regularly, and are responsible to the Assembly.  I received a letter from Francis Hackett, who is a well-known Irish-American journalist whose opinion on this matter is of considerable importance, because of his having to some extent the Irish-American view, and his having a great enthusiasm for our becoming a member of the League.  Here are some extracts from his letter:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;With a view to writing articles for America I have been going into the work of the League in connection with the opium traffic, the traffic in women, the international labour office, the <Col N="1816" /> treatment of racial minorities, etc.  It seems clear to me that Geneva is a magnificent field for Ireland if properly represented and backed; and I have found Americans, Poles, Spaniards, Swiss and French of this opinion.... The smaller nations need and desire the presence of a clear-minded and outspoken delegate who is disinterested, unhampered, informed, and positive. They would welcome it and profit by it.  The entire Liberal Press&mdash;Continental and American&mdash;is ready for a strong injection of sincerity by an Irish delegate.  The Dominions, I gathered, see in Ireland a force that can be active and positive so far as their own expansive tendencies are concerned. Former residents of Ireland, and men of Irish blood in the Dominions, look with expectancy and sympathy to the work of Ireland at Geneva.  For this collection of reasons, the opportunity here should engage Irish imagination. Geneva is not a dead place.  It is a resonant place, and will be immensely more so.  Germany, United States and Russia must join.  The caution of Foreign Office is still in the blood of many members of the Secretariat. But some of the best men I have met for years are here, and sympathetic to the possible big role of Ireland.  They feel and say that Ireland can afford to be detached, critical, and especially humane.  They want her voice to be raised; and they see her as capable of realising spiritual values which otherwise may not be realised.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on he writes, &ldquo;There is also most important work for Ireland in the International Labour Office, and there should be a number of Irish women available for the secretarial work. Every other nation has seen to it, that first-rate women have come to Geneva for this work.  I need hardly say that for the more important work, women as well as men have proved available. On some of the Commissions they are 50 per cent. in actual representation. ....The basic qualification is vision. In general I am fairly sceptical about the &lsquo;big role,&rsquo; but I am certain that Ireland can make a place here so big, so influential, so effective, that no other chance it has had for years&mdash;outside its chance to frame a Constitution&mdash; can compare to it.  This depends, as you know, on deep preparation, independent <Col N="1817" /> thinking, the right kind of patience and generous feeling, and the right kind of man.  I hope you will not think I am a busybody to urge the importance of it, but I believe that from here the business of the Six Counties can be settled, from here the real commercial growth, and the real diplomatic future of Ireland can be directed, and the personality of Ireland conveyed to best advantage to the Press of the world. Only these fruits cannot be gathered unless the sowing is well considered, deliberate and seasoned by the best sense.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This letter is strong.  It comes from a man with imagination and a real affection for Ireland.  We have already got on the staff an Irishman.  In looking over a more or less official report of the staff from a United States source I was interested to find that he was put down as a representative not of Great Britain but of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Of course, he is not a representative in the sense as if he was appointed here, but you have Ireland actually serving in a responsible position as head of one of the sections of the Labour Department of the League of Nations.  I have had several letters from him, and I know he has been in close correspondence with the Minister, and that of itself has done a good deal to make some of us feel that real work for Ireland, and for Europe, can be done by us if we are prepared to go into the League.  There is one other thing I wanted to say.  There are arguments against the League, and there are a number of people who feel that Ireland might be better off outside the League. In my opinion if the appeal of Ireland for admission is accepted we ought to go whole-heartedly into it and act with one voice in support of our representative there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will answer it.  Senator Douglas might, perhaps, have been a little more specific as to your first question.  I understand Senator Douglas to say that when the Council meets, if there is any matter that affects a particular Dominion, say Ireland or Canada, coming before the Council, they could not discuss that without giving <Col N="1818" /> an opportunity for the representative of the Dominion to be heard, and you want to know whether the representative of that Dominion would have any voting power, apart from the vote given by the representative of the Commonwealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with that I do not think they have a vote but it is distinctly laid down that in a case of a dispute either of the disputants can lay claim to have the matter brought before the Assembly and dealt with by the Assembly.  The Council has no power to deal with it except with the consent of the disputants.  You can have it discussed by them but the right to have the discussion of your claim brought before the whole Assembly remains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>The last time this matter was before the Seanad certain outstanding questions were left in abeyance because we could not get definite information about them.  One was this: whether if Ireland joined the League she would in certain eventualities, be committed by her membership of the League of Nations to a war of which the country as a whole did not approve.  Now we are asked to enter this League of Nations, but there is still a great many questions and matters in abeyance upon which neither Senator Douglas nor any of the Senators interested is able to give us a conclusive answer.  Speaking generally the main object of the League, as we all understand, is to secure the future peace of the world; that there shall be no more wars.  We have also recently been coquetting with another movement in that direction, namely the Inter-Parliamentary movement, and I think we have in a sort of semi-official way decided to join that movement.  That also has for its main object the elimination of war.  Well, probably when we reach that stage in which the Parliaments and not the Cabinets alone shall decide as to whether there shall be peace or war we may find ourselves coming very near to the millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think if the people, who suffer most from war, through their Deputies or representatives had the deciding voice as to whether there shall be peace or war and if the countries' representatives have really the power to say whether or <Col N="1819" /> not one country shall go to war with another, then I think you will have a very deliberate choice made, because it is the people who are really most concerned and always suffer in war.  Now the Inter-Parliamentary Union, so far as I understand its purport and trend, makes for this, that it is Parliaments and not Cabinets that will decide as to peace or war, and that it is Parliament and the representatives of the people and not a Cabinet of Ministers that is the voice of the people when ascertained by referendum or otherwise or however arrived at and by that means we will have practically seen the end of war.</P>
    <P>Now representation on the League of Nations so far does not strengthen the view that the League is really sincere in its proposed aim of ending war.  Do we find to-day the Allied Powers, who are the dominating factors and forces of this League of Nations, showing any great disposition to disarm?  As a matter of fact they are strengthening their military, their naval and their air force positions and acquiring every other arm of offence one against another; they are doing that while giving lip profession to the fact that they are there for the purpose of terminating or putting an end to war.</P>
    <P>We want to know, and I think it is only fair before we take this step that we should know, how far politically and financially this country would be involved by membership of the League of Nations. By politically I mean this: If by a majority the League of Nations should decide upon a certain course meaning war, although not immediate, but ultimate, in some part of the world, are we to be dragged after the League in that adventure, and are we to be politically and also financially involved?  Senator Mrs. Wyse Power asked a question as to what extent we would be involved in the debts of the League.  I do not understand the nature of that question.  All the component parts and units of the League, including Ireland and England, are involved in huge national debts.  I do not think it is in that sense that Senator Mrs. Wyse Power asked the question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no doubt as to the Senator's question.  It was whether there was not already a substantial debt incurred by the League, and <Col N="1820" /> she asked would Ireland, in coming into the League, have to bear her share of that debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>That clears up the point. Now, as between the Assembly and Council of the League, by the Covenant of the League it would seem they have equal powers.  They take into their purview all matters concerning the wide world from every point of view and direction, but they can only come up for discussion either before the Assembly or the Council.  I take it that the Council is really the Executive of the Assembly of the League.  The Allied Powers, I understood Senator Douglas to say, are permanent members of the Council, and the other members are appointed there by election for a certain period.  The Allied Powers seem to have a dominating voice; they are permanently there, and they largely influence the question of policy in regard to any question which comes up before them.  There is a limited representation from the Assembly to that Council, I understand, for a definite period, and Ireland would have to take its chance amongst the other 40 or 45 or 46 units by ballot or otherwise to get elected to the Council, and then only for a definite period.  While on the Council it would have a voice in the Council and, of course, power to vote.  Senator Douglas says even if she was not a member of the Council the Council would not decide in a matter in which Ireland was directly concerned without inviting a statement from the representative of the nation.</P>

      <P>Might I just intervene for one moment.  We are getting a little out of order.  At present we are on the Report Stage, and it was only in deference to Mrs. Wyse Power's question that I suggested that Senator Douglas might deal with the questions that were raised.  But to regularise matters <Col N="1821" /> now I take it the Seanad will agree that we should proceed to the final consideration of the Bill, and then Senator Kenny can continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much more to say on this subject, but I would ask the Seanad to pause before coming to a decision.  I do not say now that we should not join this League, nor do I say that we should.  All I say is that we should pause before coming to a decision, because the worst that can happen is that at one meeting of the Assembly, which, I understand, is to be held about September, Ireland would not be represented. The League is not a thing of to-day or to-morrow, and I hope it will be a permanent institution.  We are a very young Nation, and have our own troubles at home and our own load to carry.  We have as much as we can carry at the moment, and it is important that we should keep clear of all entanglements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no margin in our finances to permit of our taking any further financial risks, or of involving ourselves in questions that will be entirely outside of our control and into which we may be drawn, no matter how loudly we may protest.  If we are members of the League we will be overborne and out-voted, and may be <Col N="1822" /> committed to a policy from which we cannot withdraw, and which, perforce, we may have to follow, and if we do not follow willingly, we may, I understand, be saddled with our share of the financial results of some policy or other with which we do not agree.  It is a very serious thing for any Senator to ask us to subscribe to the membership of this League unless he is in a position, definitely, to give us an assurance, and to back that up with documentary proof that these things will not happen, or that under any circumstances they cannot happen.  Unless he is in a position to give us that assurance he ought not to ask us blindfoldedly to enter into a combination of this sort, the result of which we cannot possibly forsee.  Anyone who stands up here authoritatively, or presumably in an authoritative sense, and who is not able to give us these definite assurances should not ask us to join the membership of this League, because I think the Oireachtas and the country ought to have such assurances before it is involved in a matter of this kind.</P>

      <P>Arising out of Mr. Kenny's speech, I desire to point out that the Government has already made application for membership of the League.  Therefore, whether we like it or not we are committed to the principle of membership of the League.  Senator Kenny said we would have no vote in the Council if we were not a member of it. I think that point has already been explained by Senator Douglas who stated that any disputant, in a matter that came before the Council, and with the consideration of which he was not satisfied, could ask to have it brought before the Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kenny seems to think that the whole object and the aim of the League is to attain universal peace.  That seems to me, as the Minister for External Affairs has said to be an aspiration.  The immediate advantage and object of the League is to provide international co-operation. There are many points of immense importance upon which international co-operation is required.  There are such questions as labour, white slave traffic, the opium traffic, postal arrangements, and several other matters.  I am perfectly satisfied that in joining the League we cannot possibly be involved in war <Col N="1823" /> without the ratification of our own Oireachtas.  Senator Kenny also referred to the Inter-Parliamentary Union.  The object of that Union is not the same as the League.  The object of the Union is to press the Governments of the various groups which belong to it to use their influence on the League in every way which Governments can use their influence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mrs. Wyse Power made the point that she was anxious to know what chance Ireland had of getting on the Council of the League of Nations.  I have a frank answer to that, and it is that there is an extremely small chance of Ireland getting on the Council.  I would not like it to be thought that in anything I said in advocating membership of the League that I imagined that next year the other Nations were immediately going to elect Ireland on the Council.  I do not imagine that, nor do I believe it.  I do not believe that we are in such a position in Europe that we could claim such representation at the present time, or in the very near future.  At the same time the power is there to elect Ireland on the Council, but I am afraid that it is hardly likely to be exercised for some considerable time.  Senator MacLysaght has pointed out that if a disputant is dissatisfied with the decision of the Council on a matter which he has brought before that body that he then has the right of appeal to the Assembly.</P>
      <P>On the question of finance a certain number of units are laid down as regards population, and I am quite satisfied, having read practically everything that has been sent out by the League, that the commitments of each member of the League are only to the extent of the number of units fixed for each member, and if we enter for one year, we enter for that year with a budget and with our number of units for that budget, and are not obliged to pay more than that.  A change took place recently in the method of apportioning the units which cannot come into force until every single member of the League has ratified it.  This is proof of the fact that we could not be committed to go any further than the number of units allotted to us without our own ratification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important to realise that <Col N="1824" /> this League is not a binding Assembly. It is an Assembly for co-operation.  The whole basis of the League is a number of free nations agreeing to certain regulations for the time being, and the fact that practically unanimous ratification is required for any changes that are made shows absolutely the freedom of each nation in the League.  Senator Kenny wants documentary proof that nothing will happen in the future.  All I can say in answer to that is, that it is beyond me to give documentary proof to prophesy as to the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is not quite a correct interpretation of Senator Kenny's point.  The Senator asked that the Seanad should be furnished with evidence, by documents, to satisfy it that in the event of war, in the event of the majority in the League of Nations being in favour of war of a particular kind, that the dissenting minority should not be dragged into that war against their wishes.  I think that was Senator Kenny's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I misinterpreted the Senator.  I thought he was referring possibly to new rules being formulated in the future which would bind him.  If he read through the present regulations of the League he would find that he would not be so bound.  I am in agreement with him in this, that if the representatives of the people, preferably the people themselves, are to be consulted before a country is committed to war, there will probably be no more wars.  That is one of the things that we could bring into the League of Nations, because we have it definitely laid down in our own Constitution that this country cannot be committed to a war without the assent of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our representatives in the League will be bound by the Constitutional powers of this Oireachtas, and they cannot commit us to anything that is unconstitutional in our own Constitution.  We will be one of the nations represented in the League, but we cannot be committed to war without the assent of the Parliament of our own Oireachtas.  That provision in our <Col N="1825" /> Constitution is one of the first contributions that we have been able to make in regard to international peace.  I do not, and I never did, advocate our membership of the League because I thought that we were likely at the outset to be elected members of the Council.  What I do say is this, that there is an international organisation and an international secretariat, and we simply cannot afford to cut ourselves away from that if we can possibly work with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanePower" hpid="Mrs. WYSE POWER Mrs. WYSE POWER">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. WYSE POWER</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not to be taken, simply because I asked some questions, that I am opposed to our joining this international body known as the League of Nations.  If that were my opinion I should say that I was a very poor pupil of the late President Arthur Griffith.  I asked some questions so that I might be perfectly sure joining the League, or membership of that body, would be for the good of Ireland.  It is now admitted that we are not likely to be elected as members of the Council, because all the odds are against us.  In any case, some of the other Dominions, which are bigger in the eyes of the world than we are at present, would possibly be chosen before us.  I desire to ask now how often does this Assembly meet, and how often does the Council meet.  We are told that if things do not go in the Council as we want them that then we can appeal to the Assembly.  I want to know if the Assembly has the power to annul what the Council has done.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER FOR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr. Desmond FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Senator Mrs. Wyse Power's questions, Senator Douglas, I think, has given a fair account of the Council of the League.  The League is composed of the Assembly, the Council and the Secretariat. The Council is composed of four prominent members known as the &ldquo;Big Four,&rdquo; Britain, France, Italy and Japan. If America came into the League it would be known as the &ldquo;Big Five.&rdquo; Besides these, there are four other nations who have got representation by election. These nations are Spain, Belgium, Brazil and China.  Ireland may or may not be elected to the Council.  The chances are against her being elected, because she is only one of the 49 other nations of which only four can be elected, so that the chances of Ireland being elected on the Council are about 10 to 1 against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1826" /> The Council's decisions have to be unanimous, and that applies also to the Assembly. If, for instance, a case in which Ireland is concerned came on appeal before the Council, Ireland would have the right to go before the Council and to be heard, but not to vote.  If any other country which is a member of the Council is involved in that dispute with Ireland, that country has not the power to vote in the Council.  The Council's decision must be unanimous, but quite independent of the Council's decision, the country which is a disputant and is involved with some dispute with Ireland, would have in that case the right to insist on going before the Assembly, and the Assembly, as the principal body, would then have to decide whether the decision of the Council should run.  Regarding debts, Ireland would be committed to the extent of her subscription.  As I said here on a former occasion, I cannot give the exact figure as to what the subscription would be, but approximately it would amount to about £10,000.  I understand that we would pay subscription equivalent to that paid by New Zealand.  As far as I can learn, the subscription will be based on other countries' subscriptions to the International Postal Union, but, as we are not members of that Union, I cannot say what our subscription would actually be.  Senator Kenny, in his speech, seemed to fear that in joining the League we might be committing the country to war.</P>
    <P>In joining the League we will have to submit certain documents, and among them will be our Constitution, which lays down quite clearly that this country cannot be committed to war without the assent of the Oireachtas.  On the question of the amendment to Article 10 of the League, this matter was raised by Canada in 1921.  The interpretation of that clause was submitted to a Council of Lawyers, who held that the Article merely contained the governing principle to which all members of the League subscribe. The method of the application and enforcement of the Article thereafter is laid down in the succeeding Article. They held that the members are not obliged to take part in any military action. Of course, from the nature of our Constitution, which will be before them if they accept us, as they must accept us, they must recognise that we have limitations in our Constitution.  It would be <Col N="1827" /> impossible, therefore, for your representative or for the Executive Committee as a whole to commit this country to war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DEA</NameTxt>
      <P>We seem to know very little about this League of Nations.  The gentleman who was responsible for its construction, I believe, was ex-President Wilson, and it appears to me to be a very weak fact in the case relating to the League of Nations that a representative of the country for which President Wilson spoke does not happen to be a member of the League of Nations.  It appears to be that the United States does not look on the League of Nations as a useful body. It may be a very useful body later on, but at present we are in a position of darkness regarding it.  We do not know what powers it has.  It seems never to have exercised any powers, or to be useful in any way to any nation.  I would be very sorry if Ireland found that it was useful, or that it was a source of strength and that she should be denied the opportunity of joining the League, but I am not sure.  The Minister has not clearly understood Senator Mrs. Wyse Power's question, that is, what the cost will be. He gave an approximate cost, in the first instance, as an entrance fee, and he gave New Zealand as an illustration.</P>

      <P>Well, if it is measured by population it would mean that Ireland would have to pay £20,000, because I believe the population of New Zealand is only about 1,500,000.  That might be a very small sum to pay to get in, and if the advantages were of much value to Ireland I should not have any objection to paying it.  At all events, it occurs to me that with all this pressing legislation before us, which we have to get rid of in a few days, this is a subject <Col N="1828" /> which might with great advantage be postponed for the new Parliament to deal with, and I suggest that it be postponed for three months.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I think it would be a very great advantage.  We could inquire more into the value of this League of Nations, and we could inquire particularly as to what the cost would be, for that is very important in our present financial position.  In principle, I have no objection, but I want to know where I am, what I am going into, and I think the country ought to know what its commitments would be, whether it would entangle them in any warlike affairs or otherwise, and the subject will not suffer by having it postponed for three months. It will be a great deal more satisfactory if we can get a large fund of information during the next three months as to what the advantages of Ireland entering the League of Nations would be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. BAGWELL Mr. BAGWELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I second that, and I associate myself with Senator O'Dea's remarks.  We were told by a Minister yesterday that the financial state of the country made it desirable that every pound should be carefully looked after. We have just heard that the cost of taking out membership of the League of Nations is £10,000 a year.  It may be worth £10,000 a year, but I am quite certain that we Senators do not know in what way it is worth that, and we have not had the time to acquire that knowledge. We ought to have that knowledge in our minds before we agree to a measure that will cost us £10,000 a year at a time when every pound ought to be saved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very regrettable that a great question of this kind should be considered upon the basis of a few thousand pounds more or less.  I think it should be viewed from a wider standpoint altogether.  Some people seem to think that it is desirable to build a paper wall round Ireland, that we get inside that and have no intercourse with other nations, and that we are going to commit ourselves to something dreadful <Col N="1829" /> if we commit ourselves to international intercourse of the ordinary kind.  Apart altogether from the aspirations of the League of Nations, the very fact of the international intercourse which it provides is, I think, of very great value, and it will help, perhaps, to widen the views of those of us who have concentrated on very narrow national political questions during the past two or three generations.</P>
      <P>We know that the League of Nations at present is, perhaps, an aspiration, but we know also that aspirations are the inevitable precursors of achievements.  We know that there are dangers of a world war, which, with modern appliances at present being perfected, may mean the wiping out of civilisation in many lands. The only existing medium of trying to avert such a frightful calamity is the League of Nations.  It may not have achieved much up to the present with the difficulties in its course, but we have been given ample proof here of some very useful and beneficial things that it has achieved.  What it has achieved is really no indication of what it may succeed in doing in the future.  Apart from that international recognition gained by entering it, the League of Nations will, I believe, serve us abroad.  Our representatives in other lands are meeting with certain difficulties at present; certain questions of recognition, and so forth, have been raised.  These are inevitable, of course, in the case of a new nation, but I think a great many of them would be smoothed away if, at the next meeting of the Assembly, Ireland is admitted to membership.  If we turn down the Bill at this stage it will mean that Ireland's admission will have to be postponed for another year, and I hope that Senators will not allow a question of £10,000 or £15,000 to stand in the way.  It may be a big sum in certain respects, but in questions of this kind it is very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told, and I think it should be obvious to everybody, that we are not committed to war against our will, that our own Constitution covers the action of our own Executive and the Oireachtas in all circumstances.  It would be very undesirable, therefore, to turn down the Bill.  It commits us to comparatively little.  The risks it entails are absolutely nil, while the benefits to be obtained may be material, and, at all events, it will enable us to make <Col N="1830" /> some contribution towards the progress of civilisation and the prevention of a war which may be the last that humanity may have an opportunity of engaging in.</P>

      <NameTxt>The EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second time the Minister has explained most clearly and definitely the exact position of Ireland with regard to the League of Nations.  I do not wish to repeat all that has been said, but I think the Seanad should find out what exactly it will cost the country if we join, and although I very often disagree with the Labour Members who sit behind me I agree with the last speaker that I think it would be a great mistake if Ireland were not to join, if she could. The conditions are these.  It is the Assembly of the League of Nations that elects to the Council.  There are 49 eligible for election and, as the Minister said, it is not likely that Ireland would be amongst these 49, but if questions arise that affect the country Ireland can appear before that Assembly and state her reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with what the Assembly has decided.  So much for that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say something with regard to what Senator Kenny said.  He said that the nations were not disarming as far as he could understand.  Has he forgotten the Washington Conference? Has he forgotten what Lord Balfour put to the French Government when he said, &ldquo;What do you want all these submarines <Col N="1831" /> for&rdquo;?  Has he forgotten that America has actually decided to take a number of her largest battleships and sink them in the Atlantic Ocean?  Has he forgotten that Japan said she would do what she is going to do?  Has he forgotten the enormous assembly of destroyers, of which I have seen a photograph, which America is scrapping, and which are in harbour waiting to be bought up by the ship-breakers.  I do not wish to seem more clever than anybody else in the Seanad.  That would be ridiculous.  But if the members had, last year, really read the statements in the papers and some of the debates that occurred on the other side they would perfectly well understand the state of affairs that exists now with regard to the League of Nations.  Let me say at once that, of course, it is entirely in the hands of both Houses here to decide the question of war, but I may say this that no League of Nations, no Council, will ever stop any nation from attacking another.  That is perfectly certain, and if we are attacked I think that we shall give a very good account of ourselves. I quite agree with what the last Senator said, and it is tautology to say that I hope that we shall take our part in this Assembly, do it with an open mind and get the best we can out of the conditions that we find.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the debate I have been greatly troubled about one thing.  Senator MacLysaght, who gets at the kernel of a thing very quickly, says that if the Seanad decides now that they will not agree to the Free State joining the League of Nations it is a direct vote of want of confidence in the Government.  Are we or are we not in that position?  Because it is quite evident that there are a good many of us&mdash;and I candidly confess that I am one of them&mdash;who should like more time to consider this.  But if it is a fact that the Government have so committed themselves that for the Seanad now to adopt an opposite view and postpone this matter for three months&mdash;in which case we will have a freshly elected Oireachtas and a Government with a new lease of power&mdash;if we are throwing discredit on the present Government, of course, it would influence very much the decision we shall give.  I do not propose at all just now to try to make points against <Col N="1832" /> immediate action.  I think Senator O'Dea is right, but I do think that the Government should tell us definitely how they stand in the matter and in what way it will affect what they have done.  Their representation will be affected by what ever attitude the Seanad now takes, and if we had that quite clearly before us we would know where we stand.  Are we or are we not throwing an aspersion on our own Government if we now decide to postpone this for three months?</P>

I am asked whether I have forgotten all these appeals made by Lord Balfour and by Washington to France and other of their rivals to disarm, while at the same time they took very good care not to disarm themselves.  I find no lobe vacant or available in my brain for storage of that sort.  I distinctly remember that I allocated a special lobe in my brain stored up for an occasion, and the occasion has not presented itself, for the latest policy adumbrated by Great Britain, in which she has arrived at the conclusion that her naval arm, or the naval arm of any great Power, is no longer to be the deciding factor in aggressive war, and that it must give place to airship development, and that England has now committed herself to a very expensive programme of airship building. This is the reason why Great Britain, through her spokesman, Lord Balfour, is making pious appeals to all potential rivals both in trade and for world domination. This appeal to the United States and others to disarm&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Bills like the Land Bill, Public Safety Bill, and others have been discussed for weeks and months in the Dáil, and we have been obliged to discuss them very hurriedly, because the Government have said that the need for them is so serious that it is absolutely necessary we should waive our own opinions about them.  With that I thoroughly agree, but I do not think it is consistent that they should bring in a Bill which, however important, is not a matter of urgency.  I do not contest what Senators have brought forward as to the cost and probability of being involved in war.  I do not think there is danger of that.</P>
      <P>I do not see how the position of Ireland would be prejudiced by the postponement of this measure until the election of a new Dáil.  The only thing would be, if the Government said it was a point on which they could not withdraw, that should be taken into consideration.  Am I right in saying we have already received an invitation to attend the Colonial Conference of the League of Nations, which meets in September?  I understood an invitation has been sent to Ireland to send a representative to the Colonial Conference. I think Senator Douglas would probably know that there is to be a Colonial Conference.</P>

      <P>I explained a couple of days ago the reason why this Bill was brought in was to allow the Oireachtas to consider the matter, and decide about it.  The reason we brought the matter in when there is real urgency about legislation is this: Last year when there was only one House in the legislature of the country&mdash;the Dáil&mdash; that Dáil passed a resolution calling on the Government to take steps to join the League of Nations as soon as the Executive considered it feasible.  The Executive considered the matter and decided it was very much in Ireland's interests that we should join the League of Nations, and join this year.  Therefore, on behalf of the Executive, I wrote making application for membership.  The matter came up here, and this House suggested that no such action should be taken without the declared assent of the Oireachtas, as it now exists.  We brought the matter up here to allow it to be discussed. It is possible to withdraw, but if we withdraw we place ourselves in this position&mdash;that the Executive of the country, acting on a resolution passed by what was then the sole legislature in the country, took steps to approach the League and asked for admission to the League, and that later on we changed our minds and withdrew that application. It puts not only the Executive themselves, but the country in a slightly ridiculous position.  At the same time, I do not wish to prejudice other people's opinions, or to make them agree to a thing which they think is bad for the country.</P>

      <P>A curious confusion has arisen, principally in the mind of Senator O'Farrell, as to what our procedure of this morning was.  I think it was probably because it was taken before he was able to attend.  As a matter of fact the Civil Service Regulation Bill was the Bill under consideration, and not the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Bill, and the Civil Service Regulation Bill was to be put through its Committee Stage.  Then, there was a suggestion that the Standing Orders <Col N="1836" /> should be suspended to enable the concluding stages of that Bill to be taken.  At that moment Senator O'Farrell rose and called attention to the fact that some promise had been given about the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Bill.  The Seanad then got it into its head that we were dealing with the Electoral Abuses Bill, whereas we were dealing with the Civil Service Regulation Bill, and which had at that moment been put through Committee, and the question was not the consideration of the Electoral Abuses Bill, but as to whether the Civil Service Regulation Bill would be put through its remaining stages, so Senator O'Farrell would be quite permitted to proceed as we have not reached No. 4 on the Order Paper at all yet.</P>

I notice in the marginal note to clause 8 of this Bill a statement that the Commissioners are to hold examinations for army, police and county surveyorships if required.  In my opinion and in the opinion of a great many other people those words &ldquo;if required&rdquo; should be taken out.  I would suggest that we add to Section 8 that all appointments to the engineering surveying, higher clerical, or medical staffs of all local bodies shall be filled by the Civil Service Commissioners by competitive examination.  I think I need say nothing to recommend it.  I know that a great many members of the Seanad agree with the views that are embodied in this proposal.

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say, Sir, that this matter of examinations for County Surveyorships is sufficiently provided for by Statutes, already in operation, and there need be no misgiving whatever regarding future appointments to the position of County Surveyor.  I indicated in the Dáil that pending the passing of this Act and the setting up of those Civil Service Commissioners that owing to the fact that some three or four vacancies existed amongst the various County Councils for the position of County Surveyors I intend to ask the Civil Service Commissioners to hold examinations for these positions.</P>
      <P>With regard to the larger question that is raised by Senator Barrington, we are impressed with the desirability of getting to the point he wishes, but we do not think it wise to include what I might call an omnibus clause which ought to have and will get ultimately, perhaps very shortly, considerable support from various parts of the country. Rates are raised by those local bodies; they are raised at the instance and through the acts of the various members of those local bodies, and if we were to lay down a hard and fast rule with regard to this matter without any cooperation from them, it would be to some extent interfering with them in their work.  We admit that the State contributes a very considerable sum of money annually towards Local Government. They have had this prescriptive patronage, we may call it.  During the two or three years that the Local Government Department of Dáil Eireann functioned it endeavoured, and it actually insisted in a great many cases, on having such examinations held for such appointments.  Dealing with the matter in detail and seeing how far it would be possible to make a success of examinations of this sort we do not think it would be wise to insert words here making it mandatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various schemes have been suggested and various suggestions have been made as to how best a scheme for Civil Service for local authorities could be adapted to the needs of the country.  We know that the officials of those bodies vary in number and in the quality of the work they have to do.  Without considering that, and arranging for a regular code of examinations, perhaps a code of promotion, <Col N="1839" /> and so on, I do not think that the purpose the Senator has in mind would be suited by this omnibus clause.  As regards the necessity for it, I hope the appreciation of its necessity by the local authorities will be such that we will be able to get agreement ultimately, and that it will be the subject of consideration for another Bill.  It will then be fairly well threshed out.</P>

      <P>The position with regard to this Bill is one that I desire to put frankly before the Seanad.  Prisoners have been held for many months now by the common law powers of the military&mdash; by the powers inherent in the military when dealing with a situation of war or armed revolt.  There was no statutory power for the holding of those prisoners, and it is possible that the Courts, having regard to the marked improvement in the country within the past few months, may decide that, although arms are secreted throughout the country, and although there is an organisation challenging the existing fabric of the State, a condition of war or armed revolt does not exist.  If the Courts were to decide that, the Executive <Col N="1840" /> would have no legal authority for the holding of any prisoners, and would have no option but to release on the country the ten or twelve thousand prisoners now held.  That is the position which I would ask Senators to consider.  It would involve the immediate and indiscriminate release of all who are now in military custody. That consideration raises a position of urgency in the matter of the passing of this Bill.  A <i>habeas corpus</i> application is at present under consideration by the Judges, and I understand that a decision may be given to-morrow morning. It is eminently desirable that the Executive should have legal authority for detaining prisoners, as distinct from the common law powers of the military, by to-morrow morning, and I would ask the indulgence of Senators for the consideration of the Report Stage of this Bill now.</P>

Every person is entitled to know what he is being detained for.  If you claim the right to detain without trial or charge a prisoner, he has at least a right to be told why he is being detained.  We opposed on the previous reading the giving of power either to the Minister or responsible Military or Police Officers to deprive people of their liberty without reasons being assigned.  It is the most elementary principle of justice that a person should not be deprived of the most precious thing he could possess without at least being told the reason for it.

      <P>All of us are in favour of the liberty of the subject but we are not in favour of the unlimited licence of the subject to do whatever he may feel inclined to do lawfully or unlawfully, and we ought to be more concerned for the safety of the country. The man who is in prison is there for stated reasons.  He has a record behind him for lawlessness and for doing that which he feels inclined to do by means or methods which commend themselves to him but not to any law abiding person. Apparently in prison he is unrepentant, and if set at liberty apparently he will pursue the same course for which he was arrested, and by which he menaces the safety not alone of the subject but of the whole community. He has power to disturb the peace of a whole district and to menace the lives of thousands of people.  Is it contended here that so long as he continues that attitude in prison and out of it that we should release him in the interests of the liberty of the subject and place the unfortunate people of his district at his tender mercies?</P>

      <P>Pardon me one moment.  There is no provision in the Standing Orders dealing with the question of the right or power of a Senator to raise upon the Report Stage an amendment which has been rejected in Committee.  The procedure in other cases varies.  We have no Standing Orders on the subject, and all I wish to say while I am not going to prevent it on this Bill I do not want it to be regarded as a precedent that we should follow the practice by which an amendment rejected in Committee cannot be repeated on the Report Stage.  Under the circumstances in which we are, and in view of this particular Bill I am not going to stop Senator Farren, but I do not want it to be set up as a precedent.</P>

      <P>I want to move at the end of Sub-section (6), to add the following words: &ldquo;And in no case shall the provision of this section become operative until the expiration of three months after the passing of this Act.&rdquo; I move that on the strength of a suggestion made yesterday when the section was under consideration.  I hope it will appeal even to those who have supported the principle of flogging in the section itself. I think we can all hope to carry on for three months with the powers at the disposal of the State without having recourse to flogging.  Without the lash we have made considerable progress.  The result of accepting this will be that it will give the new Parliament the power to review the position if it so desires.  It will give that Parliament the right to consider the Act, and repeal or amend it as it thinks fit.  I think in debating a new principle of this kind of a very serious <Col N="1847" /> character in the dying hours of the Parliament, which for obvious reasons cannot be looked upon as representative as it might be, it is a dangerous thing to do, and the least that might be expected is that we should give the new Parliament an opportunity of considering it.</P>

      <P>The whole section. I will move it that way, although I only intended to move it in regard to Sub-section (4).  With the leave of the Seanad I would like to amend it in that form. That would not mean that a crime committed after the passing of this Act shall not be amenable to the punishment set out under Sub-section (4).  It would mean a postponement of the punishment. If the incoming Parliament desires it they can put the full section into operation after the period of three months has elapsed.  My amendment now reads: &ldquo;In no case shall the provision of Sub-section (4) become operative until the expiration of three months after the passing of this Act.&rdquo; These words are to be added to Sub-section (6).</P>

      <P>If the next Parliament does not like this Bill, or any Section of this Bill, it can amend it in a single day by a one clause Bill.  Senators are optimistic about the future.  The future to be normal, or anything like normal, would want to be a big advance on the present.  I do not know whether Senators are judging the country by the conditions in Dublin or the counties around Dublin, but there are large areas in the country where robbery under arms is at the moment routine.  A Senator the other day handed me a list of raids on premises in Offaly.  They have gone on steadily every second and third day right through May, June, and right up to <Col N="1848" /> July.  If the Senator supporting the amendment is familiar, say, with what is happening in West Cork, as I think he is, I am rather surprised that he should support the amendment.  At the moment, in certain areas, both of these offences are the normal and the routine, and imprisonment will not check them and deter the people who are living by their guns.</P>
      <P>Imprisonment as a deterrent is largely blunted in this country for a combination of reasons.  It is a fine thing to get up and speak humanitarianism and confine it to the criminal.  It was a question of having pity on people who are under the the harrow, and taking steps necessary to stop the persecution.  One can dilate on flogging, quote Parnell, talk about the British Army and Navy, and talk about the priests and clergymen of other religions who were persecuted in the past, but the bald fact remains that the only two classes of people against whom it is proposed to use the Bill is the man who robs with a gun, and the man who burns his neighbour's property, and not even to those who have done that in the past, as this Section does not apply to any offences committed before the date of the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>It is a fair warning to the gun-man and the torch-man, and we should really take a broad view of our responsibilities to the people of the country, and recognise that they have a right to be protected in person and property, and the means we are using, and the methods we are adopting to protect must be the methods that will, in fact, protect them.  That is the case with this Bill, and this Sub-Section of the Bill.  There is an absolutely indefeasible right in the people to live secure in their person and property.  If imprisonment is not a deterrent, and I am absolutely satisfied it is not a deterrent, and is not going to be a deterrent, then we have no cause for not debating a measure that would be a deterrent. That is the problem that Senators, like the members of the Dáil, and members of the Executive Council have to face, that the Government is failing in its most elementary function in many areas.  The Government cannot be allowed to fail here, and if it did fail here then the people of the country would have a perfect right to call upon a Government elsewhere to protect them.</P>

      <P>For several reasons I agree with the amendment.  But my main reason is that if those things are going to be inflicted just in front of a general election, I believe there are people on the other side who will say that it is not a free election, and who will go out and stop all elections.  Half a dozen men would stop any election.  I guarantee if you give me half a dozen men armed with revolvers and put those men in a motor car you can stop any election in Ireland.  Last year in one constituency there were 170 polling booths, and if you wanted to protect all the polling booths you would want 100,000 men.  How are you going to do that?  People will say, if we are not going to have a free election we will have no election.  Therefore, I strongly oppose those severe measures, and I cannot understand why the Government brought the amendment in, because, in my mind, it revolutionises all things. Now, it is said that no stated reason should be given.  I have a strong objection to the clause as it stands.  I fear it will cause the greatest damage.  I was greatly surprised to hear from the Minister that the Government is failing in all its powers.  I have heard the Minister say in every constituency: &ldquo;What splendid people we are!  We have established order, come along and give us your support.  We are the only people.&rdquo;</P>

I was down in Castlebar recently, and Ministers were stating what a wonderful success they had.  Now the Ministers say the Government is failing in all its parts. Banks may be robbed and houses may be burned, but, if so, why go around the country and claim such wonderful success? I think the amendment was brought in most inadvisedly.</P>

      <P>Colonel Moore tried to convey a more or less political impression that the freedom of elections was hindred by this particular clause and that it was aimed at political opponents.  To my mind that is completely irrelevant to the clause we are discussing.  This clause enables malefactors to be punished as we consider they deserve to be, and to postpone such punishment for a period of three months is, in other words, to make the clause inoperative.  If arson or robbery with violence is occurring then I say it would be very improper for us to withhold further power to prevent such crimes taking place.  I believe flogging is the only thing to prevent such crimes. Those may be the outcome of people who, cloaking themselves under nationality, try to become malefactors, men without an atom of nationality, men whose whole desire is against the nation, men who would stop at nothing to destroy the nation so that they would derive some little benefit from the ashes of what they burn.  These are the men, men with  souls, men determined to ruin this country, for whom it is now asked to delay punishment, which the Seanad <Col N="1851" /> yesterday declared to be useful as a preventative, and to allow them to go free for a period of three months.</P>

      <P>I think the last Senator is under a gross misapprehension as to the nature and effect of this amendment. It is not proposed to take the power of punishment out of the hands of the Ministers.  They can take steps which we cannot approve of.  They can take immediate steps to detain those criminals in custody for a period of three months. That is the character of the amendment, and it would seem to me there is a great deal of confusion in the mind of the Minister.  The Minister did not refer to this matter.  He made no reference to the position, at all, taken up by Mr. O'Farrell, or to the fact that he still retains complete power over those people.</P>

That is not the result of the amendment.  As it stands at present the effect would be that no sentences of flogging could be imposed until the expiration of three calendar months from the date of the Bill.

      <P>I beg to record my final protest against the passage of this Bill.  I hope it will be the last time that <Col N="1855" /> this legislature will be turned into the farce that I have seen here to-day, of a Bill of this kind being chased through at a speed which does not allow one to record the sections as they are being passed.  The Bill is of a new and of a terrible character, and it has been rushed through by very discreditable means which could have been avoided if there was a genuine desire to facilitate proper discussion of the Bill itself.  It is a very dangerous thing to assume the role of prophet, but I venture to prophesy that the Minister will live to rue the day that he put this dastardly enactment on the Statute Book.  I think the same prophecy will apply to those who aided and abetted him in doing that.</P>

We were told that we had representative Government and that we have always the Executive to catechise and chastise if they do not do things in accordance with the wishes of the people and of this assembly.

      <P>I only refer to the admission that was made as an indication of the unreality of the whole position in pretending that it is in accordance with the wishes of the Seanad itself.  The amendment I proposed to-day was at least a very reasonable, mild and modest suggestion a postponement of the objectionable <Col N="1856" /> section referred to, so as to give time to the new assembly to consider it. It was turned down almost with truculence which certainly was not a display of statesmanship, or of power or even ordinary consideration.  It was simply turned down by a dead-weight vote, and given no consideration.  A Bill of this character passed under these circumstances not only tends to bring discredit on its movers, but to bring discredit on the nation.  I desire finally to mark my very emphatic protest, not only against the terms of the Bill, but because of the methods adopted to rush it through the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I take the same view as Senator O'Farrell.  Before the luncheon interval we were endeavouring to express our views upon the Bill, as we were entitled to do, but 8 or 9 Senators who, when financial matters affecting themselves were under consideration, debated them for 8 or 9 hours last evening deprived us of the opportunity.  I attempted to speak to this Bill, as I believed I was entitled to, and Senators shouted continually: &ldquo;Vote, Vote.&rdquo; By a dead-weight vote they prevented us from expressing our opinion.  We have attempted to express our opinion on this Bill, believing in our hearts and souls that we were doing the best thing in the interests of the country.  We have no interests to serve here other than those of the people.  We are entitled to give fair expression to our opinion, as we have been elected here to do these things.  We are endeavouring to do them to the best of our ability, believing that we are doing what is best in the interest of the country.</P>

I think that the greatest piece of unadulterated piffle, and I would go further and say unadulterated hogwash I have ever heard, has come from the Labour benches, from those who profess to be out for the ordinary peaceful citizen.  The ordinary peaceful citizen does not care two jots what penalties you impose under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to follow some of the later speakers in trying to invent further unparliamentary language.  I rise for the purpose of suggesting that some of the recent speeches have been somewhat extreme in character, and, if left as they have been just delivered, would give the impression that the Seanad had not given reasonable and proper consideration to this Bill.  I am one who is still of the opinion that it is not a good Bill.  I have not been able to support it, and I cannot yet support it.  At the same time, I have nothing but respect for Senators and others who feel that it would be more serious to defeat and turn out the Government at this stage than it would be to defeat the Bill.  I take a different attitude myself, but I consider that is a position that it is not unreasonable to take, and that it is a perfectly fair position to take up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To that extent I disagree strongly with Senator O'Farrell.  I also disagree with him in his suggestion that we have not improved the Bill, or that it has not been properly considered here.  To some extent I agree.  It has been most unfortunate that this Stage has been rushed as it was, but I do suggest that to a very large extent the rushing of this Bill is the inevitable result of the circumstances we have gone through in the country.  I frankly admit, and I am of opinion, that some Bill was necessary. Although I cannot support this Bill I do recognise the position that Senators have taken up.  I should like to point out and thank the Seanad from my point of view, and also the Minister for the fact that there have been a number of improvements made in the Bill which are by no means negligible.  The Civic Guard and the military officers are now removed from immediate responsibility in the matter, and it is placed on the Minister.  If the Bill is passed as it has been amended I consider it has been considerably improved.  The position <Col N="1858" /> of the Appeal Council has been made clear, and the Minister will release a person recommended after he has given the matter proper consideration. That is a considerable improvement. The position of Judges with regard to using discretion has been made clear in our amendments which I also suggest is an improvement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister says is not exactly the point.  I am referring to what I believe is in the Bill as we passed it.  I am not referring to any promises but to the amendments inserted.  I think if Senator Moore will read the amendments accepted by the Minister he will find that is made quite clear.  An amendment has also been inserted providing for the inspection of places of detention which I believe is a very important amendment, and one which the public will be very glad to see in the Bill.  I say these things because some of the remarks made here would give the impression that the Government had turned everything down, or that we had not considered the Bill properly. I am still of the opinion, at the same time, that it is not a good Bill, that flogging is a mistake, and I am sorry I cannot support it.  I make this speech now because I think there has been too much suggestion that the motives of either those who opposed it or supported it were either to penalise their political opponents or because they did not care about the suppression of crime. Both suggestions are unworthy and untrue. I think that the opposition as well as the support given to the Bill has been given because we recognised the abnormal circumstances of the country, and because of the <i>bona fide</i> attempt to suppress disorder.  I hope that that will be the general opinion of the Seanad, and that it will not go out from here that we really do hold these opinions about each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>No one cares for this Bill.  I do not imagine that even the Government that introduced it are very enamoured of it.  As far as this Assembly is concerned the Bill is laid before us by the responsible Government of the country and they tell us <Col N="1859" /> that in the interests of the country it ought to be passed.  Whether the Bill will realize the expectations no one can say but it comes before us on the Government authority and inasmuch as this is the first Irish Government that we have had and inasmuch as this Government is trying to function under exceptionally difficult circumstances, the Seanad naturally does what it can to investigate the measure seriously and at the same time not in too critical a spirit.  Feeling their responsibility as they do the Senators endeavour to assist the Government in the maintenance of order and peace within the realm.</P>
      <P>It is true that a measure of this importance might be considered for a longer time and I sympathise very much with the feeling of Senators who considered that we had not time enough to debate it.  In fact under ordinary circumstances, a Bill of this kind would have taken weeks to pass.  But then we have to face the facts as we find them.  We have not been living in ordinary times.</P>
      <P>I know at the moment that things are somewhat better in this country, but the man in the street feels that the hands of the Government needs to be strengthened for dealing with exceptional disorder.  It is not a question of the Government victimising its political opponents.  I imagine the Government's primary object is to maintain the liberty of the subject.  We might have made further changes in this Bill if we had longer time to discuss it.  On the whole I agree with Senator Douglas that certain important improvements have been inserted in it, and I do feel that the Senators who have taken a strong line on this subject will realise that under very difficult circumstances the Seanad has endeavoured to do its best.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that that concession has been made by the Minister with regard to the release of prisoners on the recommendations of the Appeal Council.  I regard that as an improvement in the Bill, and I am glad that it has been done.  When I asked the question now I was not aware of it.  On the other hand, I think very serious damage has been done to the Bill by the taking out of those words &ldquo;for stated reasons.&rdquo; I think it would be an improvement to the Bill to have them retained, and it is wrong that they should <Col N="1860" /> at the last moment be taken out even after the Bill had been debated and passed by the Dáil, and by the Dáil in Committee. These words in the Bill would have prevented suspicious and antagonistic feelings towards the Bill.  However, that has been done.  One more or less balances the other.  I am opposed to the Bill for the reasons I have already stated.  I am sorry the Bill has been passed at all.  I am still more sorry it has been passed in such a hurry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacPARTLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Worse, in some respects.  When this Bill was being carried through the Dáil at no time did more than one-third of the representatives of the people vote on the majority side.  I think that the amendment that was put forward to-day left the Government a reasonable opportunity of testing the feelings of the real representatives of the people when they come in after the elections&mdash;testing whether the people are in favour of the Bill or not.  That opportunity has been denied, and this Bill is leaving the Seanad only voted on by one-third of the representatives of the people of this country.  I think that is a matter that is very regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Douglas has, it seems to me, the faculty of agreeing with everybody and disagreeing with everybody at the same time.  But I cannot follow him at all.  He spoke about improvements in the Bill.  I would be glad if he could have pointed out any of the improvements. You, sir, yourself, protested against the rushing of these Bills, and this has been rushed all through.  The business all through is not getting the consideration which important business deserves.  We were told, as the Bill was being again rushed to-day through the Committee Stage, that opportunity would be given to prepare amendments on the Report Stage.  I do not see that these opportunities have been given.  When one of the Senators wanted to wait he would not be allowed to wait a minute or two.  We were given three quarters of an hour and 10 minutes for our lunch.  That is the kind of legislation, and it is about time <Col N="1861" /> that the Government should go to the country and give an opportunity to the people to return a Government that represents them.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Senator the Earl of Mayo I beg to move the following amendment: &ldquo;To delete Sub-section 3 of Section 24.&rdquo; The amendment may be claimed to be simple in character.  This Bill, so far as it deals with the question of Land Purchase, is to be welcomed.  It aims at the removal of one of the greatest sources of contention and unsettlement in the country. That part of the Bill tends to give settlement and security.  The other part of the Bill deals with congestion, and it appears to me not to be quite satisfactory. We have heard a great deal about the 1920 Bill in the course of the debates on this Bill.  I suggest we have nothing to do with the 1920 Bill, whether it was a Bill or the draft of a Bill, and we have nothing to do with any other Bill that ever became law.  We have got to deal with this Bill, and we have got our responsibility in connection with it.  We have no responsibility in connection with Bills we have had nothing to do with. It is for us to see that this Bill does not pass into law in a shape that will tend to harm the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Section 4 becomes law in its present form, the Land Commission would be empowered to take land anywhere at any time for the relief of congestion.  They are not limited to the relief of congests. The scope of the Bill is very far-reaching, and goes very far beyond anything which was ever done in this country or in any other country before.  The Minister has given us reassurances in regard to the way in which this Bill would be administered, but the point that weighs with me is this: this is a Bill which has no time-limit. Now, it should not be possible to do things which are harmful.  Governments and Ministers of Agriculture may change; the Land Commission may change.  The giving of land to landless men was contemplated by the present Minister.  In support of that decision I think it well to quote his utterances in the Dáil.  I will take two which are quite short.  They are quoted from the Report of the Debates of the 4th July.  One quotation is: &ldquo;Practically everywhere untenanted land will be taken up.  We will deal with the congests first, the evicted tenants next, and the landless men afterwards.&rdquo; The second quotation is: &ldquo;Further, go outside the congested areas, and let us take it the Land Commission buys 1,000 acres of land and that <Col N="1864" /> that acreage is held under one title. They have to buy the whole holding. They may require only 50 acres for congests, and they may only have to deal with one congest in the neighbourhood. When he is dealt with the balance is over for landless men.  It is just one estate, one part, one parcel of untenanted land. They buy it for the relief of congestion. There may be 1,000 acres in it and they may require only 200.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reason I have read that quotation is, that I doubt if this Seanad as a whole realises the far-reaching nature of this measure.  When you open the question of giving land to landless men you open a problem which is really insoluble in character.  There are two kinds of landless men, some to whom it would be really desirable to give land.  I put it to the Seanad that the prime motive in this Bill is not the relief of congestion.  That would be ridiculous.  I put it it is not likely that if one congest is only concerned, that the thousand acres would be taken for him alone.  Although there may be landless men in this country, as I have no doubt there are here as well as in every other country, there are a great many landless men who have got no qualifications more than that they have no land and that they would like to have some.  When you try to satisfy that kind of demand you are attempting the impossible.  The immediate effect would be a great loss of security.</P>
    <P>This is not a matter affecting large estates and what are called ranches. This Bill affects all land; large farms are of course more affected than small ones. The Bill will tend to depreciate the value of land in the Free State.  The mere dread of what will happen will bring about that result.  I think everybody will agree that, having agreed on the form of agriculture carried on in this country, you must have large farms if agriculture is to prosper.  If there were no large farms it would be exceedingly hard for the small farmer to carry on.  Improvement in agriculture and developments of all kinds would cease because no man is going to lay out money if he feels he has not a reasonable chance of reaping the reward of his labour.  The cattle trade would tend to be very disastrously affected by any such thing as wholesale breaking up of the large areas of land.  Apart from farming, other sections of the community would be indirectly affected. <Col N="1865" /> Farming in Ireland is the principal thing economically as well as socially.  This appears to me to be unsound legislation. It seems to me the Government are attempting too much, and they are setting their hands to a thing which from its very nature will eventually result in loss of confidence, human nature being what it is and politics what they are.  The cattle trade will be ruined, and agriculture will be ruined.  Unless the Bill is amended I, for one, cannot vote in favour of it, much as I regret voting against the Government, which deserves well of the country for having stuck to the helm in a time of great danger and brought us into comparatively safe water.</P>

      <P>I would like to put a serious plea to the Minister to make an effort to allay the very serious apprehensions that this Bill has aroused. Under the Bill there will be plenty of untenanted land to go on with, and to keep the settlement of congestion going for some time.  It has been hurried, and it is a highly contentious measure.  It has led naturally to a number of amendments designed with a view to rendering it less harmful.  The new Government can consider the matter.  In the meantime, untenanted land in the Congested Districts can be taken straight away and untenanted land outside with restrictions. I appeal to the Minister on behalf of the Government not to adapt an implacable line on this measure, and to remove any acute features of controversy which are gradually growing and causing uneasiness in the country.  The Minister, I am sure, has noticed the uneasiness, and should try to remove this apprehension when it is very necessary that goodwill should prevail.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, I should like to add a few words of criticism.  Senators Bagwell and Sir John Keane have dealt with the matter of the sub-clause.  I wish to discuss it from the point of view of the arrangement of the clause as a whole.  I have heard it said by many who are qualified to be good judges that this Bill is, on the whole, very well drafted, for which due credit must be given to the Minister <Col N="1866" /> and his draughtsmen.  I cannot believe that that compliment could be applied to this particular clause as a whole, for surely it does require some explanation that in one clause you should begin by stating what you wish to do and why you wish to do it, and then proceed to make a number of very proper exceptions to your general rule, and then in your third sub-clause wash away all those exceptions. For what reason?</P>
      <P>No reason, it seems to me, is assigned for these exceptions which are taken away under the same governing purpose &mdash;that is to say, for the purpose of relieving congestion.  That seems to me very curious.  I hope the Minister will be able to give some explanation.  I preserve, I hope, an open mind on the subject as a whole, and I certainly do not wish unduly to criticise the Government in a Bill with the general principles of which I agree, but I hope that, apart from those arguments, which have been dealt with as to the danger underlying this clause, the Minister will give us some explanation as to why the clause was necessary at all&mdash;that is, why it is necessary almost in the same breath to impose a number of restrictions and to remove them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in favour of this clause for a rather different reason from other speakers.  My point is that this clause gives very drastic powers to the Land Commission to take all kinds of land&mdash;tenanted land and land that has already been purchased&mdash;for the sole purpose of relieving congestion.  If I saw in any part of the Bill a definition of the phrase which would limit it to a special purpose, and if in addition to that I saw that the owners or tenants of those lands were to be fully compensated where it would be necessary to take this land, I would not press my opposition, especially if the expression &ldquo;relieving congestion&rdquo; were fully and properly defined in the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDuffy" hpid="Mr. DUFFY Mr. DUFFY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the principle reason given by the various Senators for deleting this sub-section is that it would enable the Minister to provide land for some of the landless men in the country.  I cannot see that there is any real reason behind that, because there is a vast number of men at the present time in the country who can be classed as landless men.  You have in the unemployed insurance list 30,000 of <Col N="1867" /> such.  You have forty or fifty thousand in the Army who will shortly be demobilised, and you have in or about thirteen thousand prisoners, the greater majority of whom can be similarly classed, and I suppose there are 20,000 unemployed agricultural workers in the country.  They roughly tot up to 100,000 landless men, and it seems to be a bogey to the mind of some of the Senators that some of those landless men might get a holding.  Of course, they are not entitled to a piece of their own country, in the minds of those men.</P>
      <P>Another objection to this section is that it gives a Minister very drastic powers. The Minister for Home Affairs asked for drastic powers, and the very same Senators were pleased to be in a position to give them to him yesterday.  I hold that the great majority of those unemployed men&mdash;prisoners, soldiers, and unemployed agricultural workers&mdash;are sons and grandsons of the people who were cleared off the land a couple of generations ago, and they have as good a right to the soil of Ireland, and perhaps a better one, than the men who are at present utilising it in the interests of people across the water, and scarcely giving anyone in this country an opportunity of earning a living on it. The great majority of this land is held as ranches, which give no employment, with the exception of, perhaps, a man to every three, four, or five hundred acres, with an occasional dog.</P>

      <P>In view of what we have heard from the last Senator, I think there is some misconception as to what would eventually be the result of this particular clause.  Is it intended that land should be taken anywhere in Ireland and given to people who have no land?  On the Second Reading the Minister stressed very properly the case of the congests.  He said very little on the other question raised by Senator O'Duffy.  I would like to know whether the land is intended not alone for the congests but for landless men.</P>

      <P>This is, perhaps, the most contentious part of the Bill, and every issue raised in the Second Reading has been raised again.  I was appealed to by Sir John Keane not to be implacable, and he said let there be goodwill. I am about four months on this land question.  At the very beginning I <Col N="1868" /> stated in the Dáil that, as far as I was concerned, I was not prepared to settle the land question.  It is like the old adage:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The good old rule, the simple plan,</P>
      <P>That they can take who have the power,</P>
      <P>And they will keep who can.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The difficulty we have been faced with the whole time is that on the one side you have opposition from the people who want to take over nothing, and on the other side you have opposition from the people who want to take regardless of the equities of the case or of previous agreements.  We dealt effectively with the people who wanted to take.  Now, we have the Bill in the Seanad.  There are 100 amendments, and at least 30 of them are directed to cutting down in the Bill what was accepted both by farmers and landlords. I would like anybody to give a specific denial of that.  I was asked not to refer to the 1920 Bill.  The reason I have referred to it was that it was accepted between all the parties really interested.</P>

There were some slight changes in the Bill as it passed the House of Lords which resulted in altering the numbering of the sections, and people who have not taken the trouble to read the Bill carefully have great difficulty in finding in the 1921 Bill what they want if they have not the 1920 copy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not trimmed my sails to any wind in the Dáil, and I do not intend to trim my sails to any wind here.  I tried to do the fair thing in regard to this Bill. The difficulty I was in all the time was that I was faced with two classes of irreconcilables&mdash;one class that wanted to take all they could, the other class that wanted to do the other thing, and there is not much between them.  In the Dáil I appealed to the goodwill of all parties, the Labour Party, the Farmers' Party and the Independents, and I got it, and we passed that Bill.  I depend on the men of goodwill through the country, and I am satisfied that I have the men of goodwill here in the Seanad&mdash;that the men of goodwill of all parties in the Seanad will regard this as a compromise, and as an attempt to bring goodwill to bear on this subject, and an attempt at least not to be implacable.  Senator the Earl of Kerry wants to know why do we draft the section in this way.  First of all we state what we would take; next we state the exceptions, and then we state we will take this excepted land in certain contingencies.  We put the sub-section <Col N="1870" /> deliberately in that way in order to make it plain that we would only take the excepted land when the other land was not available.  I am advised by the lawyers that there is no doubt whatever about that on the section.  That was the intention, and as it is the intention I do see why we should fight against it.  I do not want to fight against it, and hence I intend to put in words to make it clear.  I will add these words: The Land Commission shall not without the consent of the owner (this is Senator Sir J. Keane's amendment) acquire land from him under the powers taken by them under Sub-section (3) of this section so long as there is other unacquired land in the same locality suitable for relieving congestion which does not come within the exception in Sub-section (2) of this section, and which the Land Commission could acquire without exercising the special powers given by the said sub-section.  That is already in.  It is clear, I say, on the sub-section, but in order to show <i>bona fides</i> we will amplify it and put it in black and white.</P>
    <P>I am told that the Bill is the important thing&mdash;that the Land Commission may change.  I agree that the Bill is the important thing.  The words of the Bill are the important thing.  Where in the section, or in any speech of mine is there any warranty for the statement that we could take a perch of land under that section for any other purpose, except relieving congestion?</P>
    <P>The section reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing sub-sections, where the Land Commission before the appointed day declare in the prescribed manner that any land wherever situated, herein-before excluded from the operation of this section (other than land which comes within the description in Clauses <i>(f)</i> of Sub-section (2) of this section), is required for the purpose of relieving congestion, then such land shall vest in the Land Commission pursuant to this section.</P>
    <P>I stated time and time again in the most explicit language in the Dáil that we could only take land in the first instance for the relief of congestion, and under this sub-section we can take it for no other purpose.  This sub-section is slightly narrower than Sub-section (1), which is for the relief of congestion and for the purpose of facilitating the re-sale <Col N="1871" /> of tenanted land.  That applies to untenanted land not being demesne.  Under this sub-section there is no question that land can only be taken for the relief of congestion.  It says no more and no less, and it means what it says.  I am asked by Senator Linehan what is the meaning of congestion.  If we were dealing with anything but the land question, concerning which at least twelve or fifteen Land Acts have been passed&mdash;I suppose every one of them containing the term&mdash;I would not be surprised.  There is a suggestion thrown out that congestion is a vague term, a sort of exotic term that is simply not understood here, and requires explanation in the year of grace, 1923. &ldquo;Relief of congestion&rdquo; is in every Land Act, and was, I suppose, interpreted by judges thousands of times.  Does the Senator believe that a congest can be a landless man, or that congest can be other than a tenant?  I take it that he will go that far with me, that a congested tenant is a tenant.  What is the difference between us?  What is vague in connection with the term?  I have defined expressly and explicitly the meaning of tenancy in Section 69, so we have two things certain&mdash;the definition of a tenant is quite clear, and it is quite clear that a congest is a tenant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir J. KEANE Sir J. KEANE">

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is really extremely clever, if I may say so.  I will be quite frank, and say I am not quite sure about that.  That does not go one iota against the spirit of what I am saying.  That is a mere debating point.  There is only one thing more to define, and that is what sort of a tenant a congest is to be.  We all know that a congest is a tenant who has an uneconomic holding.  Are we to go further and say in black and white what an uneconomic holding is?  As I say, the Congested Districts Board had a good working rule that an uneconomic holding was a holding which was not £10 in valuation, and they regarded as a congest anyone under £7.  They regarded it as their duty to bring anyone under £7 up to £10.  Everybody who has anything to do with the working of the Land Commission or the Congested Districts Board advises me that it is most unwise to define congest by reference to the valuation. He is defined already by reference <Col N="1872" /> to the fact that he is an uneconomic holder.</P>
      <P>To put down in black and white a definition of a congest by reference to valuation would be wrong.  The Land Commission and the C.D.B. have always been trying in one way or another to get round the cases of absolute congests who do not come within this rule, and, on the other hand, not to deal with some persons who do.  A man might have only a £6 valuation holding and have an economic holding.  On the other hand, a man might have a £12 valuation holding and have an uneconomic holding.  If you are not prepared to trust the Land Commission on an issue of that sort, then put in the Bill some definition as to what the valuation of a congested holding is to be.</P>
      <P>The question of landless men has been raised, and I will try to make the position clear.  The Bill provides that land can only be taken compulsorily for the relief of congestion in the first instance, and as far as demesne land or any land coming within the exceptions are concerned, it was the intention, and the Bill expressly provided, that such land can only be taken for the relief of the congestion. As far as untenanted land is concerned outside these exceptions the position is this.  These are the words, I think, in the 1909 Act as well, and they will be administered exactly the same &ldquo;for the relief of congestion or for the purpose of facilitating re-sale of tenanted land.&rdquo; Under every Land Act since 1903 landless men had to be dealt with and were dealt with.  You have to deal with the herd, with the ploughman, and with evicted tenants, a certain number of them.  This demand from landless men has been growing every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here in the paper from Senator Linehan, amendments that want to curtail the powers of the Land Commission in regard to the acquisition of land. There are also amendments providing that evicted tenants since Brian Boru's time should be dealt with.  Where the land is to come from I do not know. The evicted tenants and every other class of landless men were to be dealt with in the Bill.  As every Senator knows, three or four months ago the agitation in connection with the land question was much more severe than it is now, and you had all sorts of landless men who had no claims to land, and who should never get land, making the shortest cut <Col N="1873" /> to their neighbour's farm, and at the same time giving us timely warning that we had better provide for them in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to deal with a reasonable number of landless men under any Bill.  They had to do it in the 1903 and 1909 Acts.  The question with me was whether I should confine the provisions of this Bill to provisions which would ensure that only reasonable cases would be dealt with.  I confined myself to the provisions of our old friend the 1920 Bill, which contemplates exactly the same thing.  When the Land Commission apply to the owner for a parcel of 1,000 acres of untenanted land, and prove to him that they want 700 acres to relieve congestion, in many cases he will say: &ldquo;take the lot.&rdquo; There is no use in leaving him the tail-end.  In some cases they will offer the whole lot if half is taken compulsorily.</P>
    <P>If the landowner goes to the Judicial Commissioner on the attempt of the Land Commission to acquire untenanted land&mdash;I do not mean the exceptions outside the demesnes&mdash;the Judicial Commissioner will not put him on his proof so absolutely rigidly as if it were demesne, by reason of the fact that we have in the Section the relief of congestion, or to facilitate the re-sale of tenanted land.  They will get enough of untenanted land one way or another, without any specific provisions in the Bill in regard to giving the Land Commission compulsory powers to acquire land for landless men.  They will get, between the voluntary clauses and one way or another, enough of land to deal with genuine cases of landless men.  It would be impossible otherwise.  It was necessary under the 1903 Act.  There is not a Senator who does not know there is no estate in the country could be rearranged if you had not a few holdings for a few landless men in connection with it.</P>
    <P>It would be extremely dangerous to give the Land Commission power to acquire land compulsorily for landless men when land enough will fall into their hands to deal with the maximum or minimum number of landless men.  the big reason for not giving the Land Commission power to acquire land specifically for landless men is that we mean to deal with congestion first.  I made it plain in the Dáil that in order to get over the difficulty of migrating tenants <Col N="1874" /> the Land Commission must make it perfectly clear that they are buying land for congests, so that when we want to migrate congests into another county we will not be met by combinations of landless men preventing the congests from coming in, and asking the Land Commission to exercise the powers in the Bill if there were any such.</P>
    <P>I appeal for a little give-and-take and for less implacability, from Senator Sir John Keane, and I tell him with his knowledge of the subject that that is the only possible way we can deal with it. This subject is so difficult and there are so many contingencies, and so many human relationships mixed up with it, that the Land Commission must have a little discretion or they cannot rearrange an estate.  They will be able to oil the wheels a little bit.  We can do no more and no less in the Bill than we have done.  If you say to the Land Commission you are not to give a single landless man a holding on any untenanted land, even in the congested districts, you defeat the objects of the Bill and the Twelve Apostles, if they were Land Commissioners, could not carry it out.</P>
    <P>That is the position with regard to landless men.  You must give a certain amount of discretion to the Land Commission. We have tried to draft a Bill so that the Land Commission will have a certain amount of discretion and that the Judicial Commissioner would know exactly what the spirit of the Bill was, and know how to interpret any case that came before him.  Remember as I have explained there is a new Land Commission, and the Bill provides that at the head of the Land Commission there will be a High Court Judge assigned to that position by the head of the Judiciary. This Land Bill provides that on every important issue a High Court Judge will have the last word.</P>
    <P>We ought not to deal with tenanted land on this Section for this reason. Tenanted land vests in the Land Commission under this Section.  Of course it must vest in the Land Commission.  Whatever is going to happen the landlord's interests, the tenant's land vests in the Land Commission under this Section. Section 28 shows all the tenanted land we will retain and Section 29 says what tenanted land we will resume.  When we come to these Sections we can discuss <Col N="1875" /> the whole question of tenanted land. Section 24 raises no contentious issue with regard to tenanted land.  It merely provides that the landlords' interest will vest in the Land Commission on the appointed day.  Afterwards the date of vesting is dealt with in other Sections.</P>
    <P>Now, there is just one other point&mdash;a point of importance, that point that Senator Bagwell raised about purchased holdings.  I said yesterday about the relief of congests that we should have power to take purchased holdings in some cases; otherwise the Bill would be useless. I said further that it is the last thing we will take, and we will take it only when there is no other land available. I will put in this section, and it meets the security point absolutely.  It will read as follows&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>(a)  If the land so declared forms portion of a holding.

      <P>That is another point. What I was suggesting here as regards purchased holdings is that where we take a purchased holding we shall bind ourselves to give an equivalent holding. Now, as to security, I pointed out yesterday that 75 per cent. in area of the 13 million acres out of the 20 million acres of land in Ireland that was purchased is owned by tenant purchasers under £20 or £25 valuation.  I also pointed out the difficulty of drawing any valuation limit. It might just hit the case we would want. What I do point out is this, that we would never be dealing in fact with more than 20 per cent. of the purchased holdings even in area.</P>
      <P>Now, I do not believe for one moment, and I know the country fairly well, that there is a single one of these 75 per cent. of the purchased holders who feels a bit less secure or who goes to sleep with the least fear by reason of this Bill.  But for fear there would be any unnecessary alarm, and in order to meet the case, we bind ourselves here to give that man an equivalent holding and we transfer the burdens to the annuity.  There is, perhaps, some unfortunate interference with the operations of the 1903 Act.  They are absolutely necessary.  Could we make them less?</P>

      <P>Purchased tenant is hardly correct.  A purchased tenant is the owner of land in fee subject to a mortgage to the Land Commission.  He is in exactly the same position as his neighbour who is farming any land in fee, but did not purchase it from the Land Commission. If we take a purchased tenant's holding, and if the purchased tenant refuses to exercise his option of taking another holding, he will be paid for his holding, and he will be paid in the same terms as we would pay a landowner who owns land in the neighbourhood&mdash;a fair price both to the Land Commission and to the vendor respectively.  If we bought it at any other price it would be useless to us.</P>
      <P>The reality of the case is this: Where we buy out a tenant purchaser, it is the last land we will touch as long as there is untenanted land in the neighbourhood, and therefore it will be a case of a man in Connemara with 100 acres, and surrounded by 20 congests, with his cattle being driven for the last 20 years; he will jump, as a rule, at the proposition of getting a decent farm of equivalent value in the King's County with a nice house on it. There will be 5 per cent. of the cases where we will have to force them.  The real value of compulsion is this, that we can force them.  We go to them and say, &ldquo;You must leave, we want this holding; we will give you an equivalent farm, a better farm.&rdquo; The man who is exchanged always gets a better farm.  If we had not those compulsory powers, that man would want 30 acres more and some rooms added to his house before he would consent to leave.</P>

This whole question is very tricky, and I would like to think over the amendments suggested without committing myself.  The question of price is not satisfactory.  I hope the Seanad will allow me to say something very brief in defence of myself against a charge of unfair methods of controversy.  It has been suggested that there is nothing more than a purely nominal and immaterial difference between those two documents.  In justification of my attitude, I might mention that the documents are entirely different.  There are 34 clauses in the other Bill, and there are 42 clauses in the document I got. Then there are certain manuscript corrections in this document.  All I have to say is that I would like to quote sections that would be available to everybody.</P>

I am quite satisfied even to bring in a freehold, and also not to make any very minute investigation of a Poor Law valuation.  I would ask the Minister to insert that definition in this Bill as well as a definition of the home farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>Purchased holdings may have to be taken under very exceptional circumstances for the purpose of relieving congestion.  We all know that a man who has made a comfortable home for himself will not, after all his toil and industry, leave that home willingly.  He possibly has reared up a family there, and his associations are centred in the district. As the Minister says, there may be a very exceptional case.  It may be a very <Col N="1879" /> great hardship for that man to leave. His financial concerns may be affected. He may be facilitated by the bank, and money may have been advanced to him in regard to what is looked upon as a market price for his holding.  This portion of the clause undermines that basis of valuation. It is suggested under it that he should get what to the Land Commission seems to be a fair price.  There would be, in my opinion, a hardship in the case of that man if he were not prepared to take an alternative farm in another county.  The Land Commission might say, &ldquo;This land, instead of being valued for £50, is worth only £20.&rdquo; That would be a hardship.  Then, again, the Land Commission might say, &ldquo;Here is another farm.&rdquo; Possibly a tenant may take the other farm, and when he gets settled in it he will sell his interests at market price and therefore he can get his 100 per cent. in that way.  He carries some of his financial burdens to the other farm, and the farms are only relatively just the same.  We cannot but look at the uprooting of this man from his holding as other than a very harsh proceeding.  Naturally it might create some feeling in the district, and you would have very poor bidding for the farm in the event of a sale.  No one would dare to go into it. The Minister should take that view of the case.  You would be breaking up a homestead, and it must be considered that in such a matter one can go too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard it remarked here that the farm to which a man would be removed when his own farm would be taken from him could be sold if he wishes to sell it, and he would get a price for it that would be the full market value.  The great danger that one foresees is that this may destroy the value of all marketable land throughout the whole of the Free State, as far as I can see.  I hold that this market value will never again be the same.  It has to be faced. Whether that may not inflict just as much injury as it relieves congestion makes an individual like myself very doubtful.  The farming industry is the main industry on which the Free State exists, and undoubtedly a large number of farmers require financial assistance.  They will require more if they go in for tillage than if they work their farm as ranches or grazing lands, and it is very doubtful that <Col N="1880" /> they will have the same security to offer the banks after the passing of this Bill. I may be wrong.  Senator Kenny seems to think that the balance is in their favour, but, as an impartial observer, I very much doubt it.  If it relieves congestion, and if we are to have the land question finally settled in Ireland, it would be worth it; but it is setting a precedent of hardship and taking away rights which have been granted by law, and that seems to me to be very dangerous.  I do not think, in the present state of affairs, that an independent individual like myself, in the Seanad, who does not own much land, can stand up here and say that his opinion is better than that of those responsible for the Bill.  I think I will follow my Labour friends in this, and say that if we do this we are doing it with great doubt in our minds as to what the ultimate effect will be.  I would urge on the Government, as we go through these clauses, to make it clear whether they could meet some of the difficulties of the case; and if they do, it would meet the wishes of independent individuals like myself.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the remarks of Senators the Earl of Kerry and Jameson on the question of value, as I understand it, when a holding is taken of tenanted land, the Land Commission takes it at what is termed the resumed value, which means the market value. Senator Kenny referred to farmers who have to put their land up for sale, and said that they would be subject to the pressure of congests around them, and that such farmers would be debarred from getting a market value.  When the Land Commission come along and say they require the land for the relief of congestion, they take the land and give the market value.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No; we do not give the resumption price.  It is practically the market value, but it applies to tenanted land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusIrwin" hpid="Mr. IRWIN Mr. IRWIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. IRWIN</NameTxt>
      <P>It was tenanted land I was referring to.  Option is also given to the tenant, as the Minister says, to take a farm of equal value, but he qualified his statement&mdash;and we readily accept it&mdash; that it will be of greater value given elsewhere. Mr. Kenny made a point that such a tenant might go elsewhere and sell <Col N="1881" /> his holding.  If he has the intention of selling, he can take his money.  It would be foolish of him to take a holding in another county, surrounded by congests, but it would be equally foolish of the Land Commission to give him such a holding.  All the uneasiness arises, I think, more from the want of time to dwell on these matters rather than from what we want to do.  These fears would be allayed and all apprehensions removed if we studied this Bill.</P>
      <P>Now, as regards the other point about congests and landless men, to my knowledge the Minister explained it three times at least.  If the Land Commission takes a farm of tenanted or untenanted land for the relief of congestion, there may be, and probably there will be, a certain number of hands unemployed, such as the herd, the steward, and the ploughman; but when that farm is taken for the relief of congestion, is it not reasonable that the Land Commission would give them a strip of land?  They are termed &ldquo;landless men.&rdquo; We associate in our minds, when we speak of landless men, the countless thousands of men without land. To-day we passed a Bill to give powers to arrest men without reason assigned, but none of us expects that the Government will go round the country arresting people in thousands.  Nobody will expect, when this Bill passes, that the Minister for Agriculture will call on all the landless men to come forward now.</P>

The tenant may say, &ldquo;I am eighty years of age, and I am going to die here.&rdquo; The Land Commission may say, &ldquo;Very well die; but we are going to take your eldest son and give him the farm which we intended to give you.&rdquo; That would be giving land to landless men. Now, as regards a small matter which gave rise to the discussion regarding the two Bills, I think what happened is that the Minister quoted from the correct one, as it was the one agreed on between the representatives of the landlords and the representatives of the Farmers' Union at the time.</P>

      <P>Is it wise to start this again?  I understand that the Minister has agreed to the suggestion of Sir John Keane, and I think you will only make more trouble.  I think it would be well, with a view to understanding the discussion, if Senators would realise&mdash;I do not think, from some observations of Senator Irwin, that he does&mdash;that untenanted land in this Bill has a technical meaning, and they will find it if they look at Section 69.  For example, some seem to think that purchased holdings are tenanted lands, because the so-called tenant is living on them.  Purchased holdings are untenanted land in this Bill.</P>

      <P>It would shorten the discussion if I say this: I cannot close my eyes to the fact that Senator Jameson has made a serious point in regard to price.  There is only one difference between us; he agrees that we ought to give an equivalent holding, and that in most cases the tenant purchaser would take it; but he says that this Bill, by reason of the fact that we do not give the market value if a tenant purchaser refuses to take an equivalent holding, taints the whole of the other tenants. There is the point of the market value between us.  We cannot give the market value.  That is clear.  I suggest that these two amendments be accepted, and perhaps we might meet each other on the point before a court.</P>

If copies could be made of these proposed suggestions, so that those interested in them might see them, we could pass this over for the present.

I have heard the Minister's explanation and I regret to have to say that I am not reassured. My reason for that is that, whatever his intentions or the intentions of the Land Commission may be, the Bill as it stands makes it possible to go much further than what we understand to be the relief of congestion&mdash;so much further, in fact, that infinite harm may be done to the whole country.  I cannot take responsibility for legislation that might do as much harm as that.  At the same time, I would like the Minister to know that I give him all credit for trying to do what he believes to be the best under exceedingly difficult circumstances.  What I find fault with is that he has tackled too much.  I would remind him that it is possible, in trying to remove one evil, he may create a greater one.

      <P>I have before me a report of what the Minister said in the Dáil on the 23rd July, which interested me very much indeed.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There will be no land to divide amongst landless men for the next two or three years.  It will take at least two years to deal with the tenants. By that time I think it will be found that you will have at least three or four applicants for every possible holding.  It will be for the Land Commission and, if I may say so, for the Trade Unions to find some way out of the difficulty by that time.  My suggestion is that some such organisation as the National Land Bank perfected should be made use of and improved, so that advances would not be made to individual landless men, but societies of landless men.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I heard the Minister say he was rather afraid that a conglomeration of landless men would come down on to the lands and interfere with the working of the powers that are given to the Land Commission in this Bill.  I only put this forward because I had heard nothing about Trade Unions in the very full statement that the Minister has made <Col N="1885" /> I am not the least nervous, but I think if that was stated in the Dáil in all sincerity and in all seriousness, the Minister might have said something to us about that.

      <P>Senators seem to delight in the rather futile exercise of trying to catch me out.  I am glad that the Senator referred to that.  I think I can give a satisfactory assurance to the Seanad.  May I say at once that I did not refer to it because it did not arise.  In the Dáil, and outside it, I was faced with a demand for land for landless men, and I pointed out that congests must come first, and that when we had dealt with all the congests there would be very little over.  We had to make it clear that the land should be taken compulsorily for landless men, otherwise there would be groups of landless men&mdash;some deserving and a lot not deserving of land&mdash;in every parish like a ring fence round a particular farm who would say, &ldquo;No congest is going to come in here,&rdquo; and there would be three landless men to every congest. I kept insisting that congests must be dealt with first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said under the operation of the Bill we would have enough land in our hands, and I am perfectly satisfied we will, to deal with deserving landless men, but that we will be extremely short of land. I suggested that the trade unions&mdash;and I shall put this to the Labour Party who acted consistently on this Land Bill all the time&mdash;should, now that we have our own Government, and when we can begin to think not about politics but about business, think along the lines suggested by Senator Sir Nugent Everard the other day, of holding land in some form other than individually.  I pointed out that when we had dealt with congestion there <Col N="1886" /> would be very little land and that they should be thinking of the question of how to make the little land we have go round. I pointed out that there would be two or three advantages in doing that.  I am not very sanguine.  I know it will be difficult because it is in the Irishman's blood to hold his own land.  I pointed out the National Land Bank scheme.  We will have a certain amount of land on our hands, and there are landless men who in the ordinary way as agricultural labourers would be getting some of that land.  Let them think seriously now of how we can make that land go round, because there will be very little and it will not be very much good splitting it up individually.</P>
    <P>I inserted the words, &ldquo;any other body,&rdquo; in the hope that some people who are fond of using the land question for some other purposes than politics would between now and this time six years think of the land question as something more than a political problem, and that they would be able to find some organisation like the Land Bank organisation, so that if we had two or three holdings over in a parish we would be able to make more use of them other than to give them to two or three landless men.  There are many possibilities in the &ldquo;body&rdquo; mentioned there.</P>

      <P>Of the two amendments I stated I would accept, one deals with the Land Commission having power to acquire land under Sub-section 3 for any purpose, so long as there is other suitable land in the neighbourhood.  That was Senator Sir John Keane's amendment, and I stated that I would accept it.  The other amendment provides that the Land Commission shall sell an equivalent holding, and transfer the burdens to the proprietor of a purchased holding which they might acquire.  I suggest that the Seanad should accept these amendments, but I cannot close my eyes to the fact that Senator Jameson has made a point that deserves further consideration on Report.</P>

      <P>The Minister's amendments read as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 24: To add a new Sub-Section after Sub-Section (3).</P>
      <P>Where the Land Commission declare that any land coming within clause <i>(a)</i> of Sub-Section (2) of this Section is required for the purpose of relieving congestion, the following provisions shall have effect:&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a)</i>  If the land so declared forms portion of a holding the proprietor or tenant of the holding may, within the prescribed time, and in the prescribed manner, require that the entire holding be so declared, and the Land Commission shall, in that event, either so declare the entire holding or withdraw from the proposed acquisition of the said portion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>(b)</i>  If within the prescribed time and in the prescribed manner the proprietor or tenant of the <Col N="1888" /> declared land so requires them to do, the Land Commission shall, as soon as practicable, provide the said proprietor or tenant with a new holding which, in the opinion of the Land Commission, other than the Judicial Commissioner (subject to the right of appeal to the Judicial Commissioner, whose decision shall be final), shall be equally suitable for the said proprietor or tenant, and of not less value than the declared land. The provisions contained in this Act for transferring burdens and rights on the exchange of holdings by agreement shall extend to any exchange of lands affected under this Sub-section.</P>
    <P>Section 24: To add new Sub-Section after Sub-section (3):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Land Commission shall not, without the consent of the owner, acquire land from him under the powers conferred on them by Sub-Section (3) of this Section so long as there is other unacquired land in the same locality suitable for relieving congestion which does not come within the exceptions mentioned in Sub-Section (2) of this Section, and which the Land Commission can acquire without exercising the special powers given by the said Sub-section.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>The EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Section 24, Sub-Section (3):&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the Sub-Section the words &ldquo;provided always that the powers given to the Land Commission by this Sub-Section should not, without the consent of the owner, be exercised so as to leave in the hands of the owner lands of a less Poor Law Valuation than £400.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is another way in which I tried to get round the effects of the Bill as regards the taking of land in demesnes. After the new Sub-sections that have been accepted by the Seanad I cannot very well see how I can argue in favour of the amendment.  To be quite frank I put the valuation very high, but I was prepared to come down a little in that figure.  I think it would be wrong for me to argue that now, having these Sub-Sections to which we can put in amendments if necessary in the Report Stage. <Col N="1889" /> I will, therefore, withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move Section 24, Sub-Section (4):&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the words from the words &ldquo;farm used&rdquo; in line 37 to the word &ldquo;therewith&rdquo; in line 38, and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;in connection with the owner's residence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a small point, and I think Senator Moore has another amendment in the same sense.  I hope the Minister may be able to accept either or both amendments.  I think there has been a certain amount of misapprehension about the last line in Sub-Section 4.</P>
      <P>That has been thought to be liable to the interpretation, that only a farm which could be shown to be land run at a loss would be included in the terms of this Sub-Section.  According to the wording of my amendment I propose to delete the words from the words &ldquo;farm used&rdquo; in line 37 to the word &ldquo;therewith&rdquo; in line 38, and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;in connection with the owner's residence.&rdquo; I do not think I need elaborate the point.

It is &ldquo;to delete in Section 24, Sub-Section (4) all the words after the word &ldquo;therewith&rdquo; in line 38.&rdquo; I know a great many of those things have been decided by lawyers and judges and their technical explanations are quite beyond me.  I daresay the Minister will be able to explain.  My doubt about it was this last phrase &ldquo;not merely as an ordinary farm for the subject of profit.&rdquo; It would mean that nothing could be sold off it. Everything should be consumed in the house.  It would really mean a cabbage garden, and sufficient grass to supply the house with milk.</P>

What we do say we did is this, we went through the cases and took out the words of the judges, and used the exact wording of the Acts in the 1920 Bill to define a Home Farm.  I have Cherry here and can read the decision of the Judge for you.  A Home Farm is here defined &ldquo;as one used in connection <Col N="1890" /> with the landlord's residence chiefly for supplying the residence and not for the purposes of profit.  Surplus products may be sold or disposed of in the usual way.&rdquo; There are other definitions and they all contain the expression &ldquo;not for the purpose of profit.&rdquo; I went through all these decisions, and they are all very much alike.  The 1920 Bill gave us a nice digest of the lot and we put it in <i>en bloc.</i></P>

      <P>I rise to move:</P>
      <P>Section 24, Sub-section (3): &ldquo;To add at the end of the sub-section the words &lsquo;provided always that in every such case the Land Commission shall, prior to making any such declaration as aforesaid, prepare a scheme showing in what manner it is proposed to utilise the lands, and the names of the persons for whose relief it is proposed to acquire the same and shall furnish a copy of such scheme to the owner of the lands.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1891" /> Section 24, Sub-section (3): To add at the end of the Sub-section a new Sub-section (4), as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  Lands acquired by the Land Commission under the provisions of Sub-section (3) of this section shall not be employed for any purposes other than the relief of congestion, and if at the expiration of three years from the date of acquisition such lands or any part thereof shall not have been so employed, the owner from whom such land was acquired shall have the right to re-purchase the same at the price orignally paid to him therefor, such price to be ascertained if necessary by apportionment, provided always that unless within two months after notice shall have been given to him by the Land Commission that they are prepared to re-convey the lands at such price, the owner does not signify to the Land Commission his desire to re-purchase, all rights given to him in that respect shall cease.  In any case where there is difficulty in ascertaining the owner or his address any such notice to him may be given in such manner as may be provided.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are a number of similar amendments which make clear the operations of these provisions for the relief of congests. If the Minister will give an assurance it will save time.  He has several of my amendments.  I do not say that I would be quite satisfied with a less positive amendment, but if he would make any suggestion which would clear the ground it would be in the interest of everybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have covered two points already.  Before clearing the ground I want to know what ground we have to clear.  There is one thing, and that is that land should only be taken for the relief of congests.  Here we say it shall not be taken if there is any other land available in the neighbourhood.  That is what we have with regard to demesne land.  Here is what we have in regard to land purchase.  We have stated that we will give an equivalent holding, and I have stated that we will consider the question of the price with regard to purchased holdings before the Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>All these amendments are directed to make positive on the face of the Statute what is meant by <Col N="1892" /> relief of congests.  I am suspicious of giving large powers to the Land Commission or to any Executive under certain conditions.  I can see a possible challenge to that point of view, and I will deal with another point and a method by which that might be dangerous at another time.  In this case my endeavour in all these amendments which admittedly are overlapping, is to make quite clear that this process of relieving congests shall not be wrongfully used in any way.  Well now, I have got an amendment here in which a specific scheme with names shall be set out before the lands are vested.  I have got another amendment in which the owner is empowered to repurchase where the land is applied partly to the relief of congests.  On that point&mdash;could the Minister give us an assurance that he will put in words to make it clear on the face of the Statute what is meant by this relief of congests, so that a person whose land is taken can go and argue before a judge that this is being applied to other purposes, so that he can be protected, and could possibly recover his land in exceptional cases.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane professes to have a terrible suspicion of the Government Departments, but when it is a question of delivering the lives and liberties of human beings he has every confidence in the Government and their departments.  Listening to his arguments, and taking them in conjunction with the arguments which he and his followers have put forward on other matters this very day, it is very hard to understand them, and what can one say of the help of these discussions at all?  It is nearly time we made up our minds before we proceed much further as to whether or not it is seriously intended to get through this Bill.  If not, we should proceed with some other business, and not be introducing over-lapping amendments of this kind, and advancing the same arguments in support of them.</P>

      <P>It came from the Labour benches, but it is not inconsistency. In time of armed revolt I am in favour of giving very large powers to the Executive, and for that reason I defend my action in previous cases.  In time of peace I am for protecting the community by the laws against the invasion of an Executive or bureaucracy.  For that purpose I wish to see the law as clear in the matter as it possibly can be.  I may be mistaken, but I am frankly uneasy, after the pronouncements that have been made in the Dáil by the Minister, when he said that power will not be abused. These amendments are to protect the people against any tendency to abuse. I put a hypothetical question to the Minister regarding land which would be vested in the Land Commission and subsequently, for one reason or another, the Land Commission would not be able to carry out their scheme.  Ultimately the land would not vest in the <Col N="1894" /> congest, and would be diverted from its main purpose.  The Minister met me up to a certain point.  I submit that the provisions as at present outlined in this Bill are insufficient to protect the vendor against the land which is taken for one purpose being applied to another.  I beg to move the amendment.</P>

I would be glad to hear from the Minister what are the administrative difficulties in carrying out the schemes. If the Minister or the Government is genuinely anxious to protect the public against the abuse of this provision, this amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <P>This is a proposal to put in a new Sub-Section at the end of a clause.  There are within my knowledge, and within the knowledge of every other Senator, cases which, perhaps, occur more frequently in backward parts of the country where in land planted with young trees there are small open patches on which a certain amount of hay is made, or on which two or three cows might graze. These are generally unfenced and not separated from the rest of the wood.  As I read the Bill, those would be untenanted lands within the meaning of it.  If that is so, there would be no option but to take them over and to use them for the purpose laid down in this Bill.  If that were done they would be used for grazing and a lot of cattle would be turned into them, which would knock down the small trees and damage the larger trees of the wood proportionately. I wish to make it possible, with a view to preservation of wood-land, that the Commissioners should not be compelled to take them over.</P>

      <P>The country does not realise that a big number of farmers in Leinster own untenanted land as well as tenanted land.  The whole gist of the argument here was in respect of the landlord and the tenant, and the present Minister was lauded to the skies for his fair play.  The Minister said he was speaking on behalf of the landlord who had no representation in the Dáil.  Was he thinking that the Seanad was composed of a majority of the landlord class?  I have no love for landlordism, but I would not object if the landlords got a little more for their property.</P>
      <P>There is a more important Section being attacked now.  The landlords are clearing out and the next and the greatest goose is the large farmer, for plucking at the present time.  I would very much sooner support this measure if the Minister said &ldquo;We want all land in the country, and we must have the land for the people all over the country.&rdquo; If he said that I would say &ldquo;quite right, if the country approves of it.&rdquo; But I say, &ldquo;give the people whose property you take, fair market value or something near it.&rdquo; I would support the policy if the Minister said &ldquo;I will have conscription of wealth or a levy on capital.&rdquo; He picks out what he considers an unpopular class, which has no representation in this or the other House, and he victimises it for the benefit of another class.  I invite an expression of opinion on that statement from the Labour Party.  Would it be fair to have conscription of wealth or a levy of capital? I think there is no justice in the Section.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the spirit of the amendment in order to see whether the Minister is going to make any concessions to us on this matter of price.  In many ways it can be done. One suggestion is that the payment should be made in cash, but that is immaterial if the Minister would accept the principle.  There is this big principle. I used the word &ldquo;confiscation&rdquo; in the debate yesterday, and I have since considered whether I was exaggerating, but I am not at present inclined to qualify that.  We know that the nation through its Parliament has the right to do anything. It has the right to take all the wealth of the country and divide it amongst the people of the country.  But experience has proved that there are certain principles in practical politics which have to be followed.  One of the most important of these is the development of industry and thrift.  If the laws of the country militate against these qualities, and if they make a citizen feel that he cannot reap the reward of his labour, you are striking a blow at the economic life of the country, and in doing that you strike a blow at all classes, rich and poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Experience is the only thing of any practical value in politics.  We get doctrines every day, but the people who understand government are very chary of doctrines, but they set great regard on what has, down through the centuries, proved a practical proposition in everyday life.  As the result of that the governments of all developed countries have been very chary about taking property compulsorily because they have known by experience that you may sap the springs of industry, and they have limited their powers of compulsory acquisition to certain public utilities&mdash;railways, docks, harbours, etc.  In doing so they have taken the land at full value, with an extra price, in some cases, on account of it being taken compulsorily, and have given the party from whom it has been taken full and complete powers of appeal.  Here it is proposed to take a <Col N="1900" /> very large portion of the land of this country for a purpose which cannot answer to the hitherto accepted expression of public utility.</P>
    <P>You divide the property of one class up amongst many.  It sounds a very alluring prospect and, no doubt, excites considerable anticipation in certain quarters.  Later on, when this has had a chance to operate, we may be considerably surprised at the result.  This is comparable to the case of property on a very large scale for redistribution among a class of the population who are rather at the bottom of the economic scale.  It is taken compulsorily from those at the top. Should not the principles which govern prices on the narrower issue in other countries govern this?  The Minister and the Government say no.  They say that there are different parties in this matter. There is the person selling who has built up the value of this property by years of toil and labour&mdash;I do not say they all have, but quite a number of them have, and you will not be able to discriminate between those who have and those who have not.  Quite a large amount of this untenanted land is owned by people in quite humble circumstances, and you have to bear that in mind.  The Minister, I do not suppose, suggests that you should open up an inquiry into the private incomes of those whose land is about to be taken, and to distribute the burden according to the total power of the vendor to bear it.</P>
    <P>The Government propose to take that land, and there is a statutory direction that the Judge has got to take cognizance of these facts.  They direct his attention, on the one hand, to the value to the Land Commission and, on the the other hand, to the value to the owner.  The value to the Land Commission implies also the value to the taxpayer. This is a Government Department, and the Land Commission have primarily to regard the interest of the taxpayer.  The Land Commission is taking this land from the individual who, with his family, has built up its value by years of work and enterprise, and they are giving it, possibly, to a congest without experience as to how to work a larger farm, and with no capital by which to finance his increased activities and, possibly, no house and suitable buildings on the land.  If the <Col N="1901" /> Land Commission are going to do that, they have to have regard to the price which will enable this person to enter into that farm properly equipped.  Otherwise it is only making the thing worse than before.  They must, in the nature of the case, be very conservative as to price, and it would be in most cases impossible to finance the incoming tenant on anything like the fair market value of that land.  So in essence, I argue that the provision of the Bill, as it now stands, is a direction to the Judge to give substantially less than the land is worth, and for that reason I have used the word &ldquo;confiscation&rdquo; in its limited sense, of course, because confiscation may be, taking away everything and giving nothing.</P>
    <P>I anticipate that the Minister will say that these provisions are in the 1920 Bill. They are.  I would say this, however&mdash; and I have been very specifically advised on this point&mdash;that that Bill was never agreed to.  This is a statement of fact which it would be very hard to prove, as this is not a judicial assembly, but I am stating it, and I would be prepared to prove it in the proper place, that this Bill was never before any joint meeting of landlords and tenants.  Landlords and tenants met and discussed certain principles which were to be embodied in a Bill.  Some of these principles were embodied in the Bill.  Some of them were not.  They had dissolved altogether before that Bill was printed.  That is my information.  That Bill was never before them, and certain of the principles in that Bill would never have been accepted by the landlords if it had been before them.  That is, however, secondary to the point.  We are not dealing with that Bill, but I think it right to say that as it was brought in so often.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1903" /> After the amendments that have been proposed by Senator Counihan, Senator Colonel Moore and Senator Sir John Keane, there is very little need to say much about this one.  Senator Sir John Keane has gone into the reasons why a man, whether a farmer or anyone else, shall get the full market value of the land.  The object of the amendment is to ensure that the owner, whoever he is, shall get the full market value.  The only value in the amendment is to suggest a possible means as to how that value can be obtained.  Senator Sir John Keane has suggested that the Land Commission, being the custodian of the taxpayer, is bound to get the land for as little as possible.  Senator Bennett has pointed out that a man's holding may be worth a good deal of money and that he cannot get the full market value.  The amendment suggests that due regard should be given to the Acquisition of Land Act passed in November, 1919, the object of which was to see that where land was taken compulsorily, the owner should be given full market value.  One of the clauses of that Act appointed a panel, and in Ireland the panel consisted of the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls and the President of the Surveyors' Institute, or some person delegated by him.  The price of the land is to be fixed by them.  One does not presume to dictate to the Minister, but when he referred to it, as the panel is still in existence, and as land has been acquired in different parts of the country for soldiers who were in the British Army, it is for the Minister, if he does not like it, to suggest something else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to give my reason for shewing that it would be impossible to accept this amendment.  We are trying to put in here the procedure outlined by the Land Commission since the 1903 Act.  Senator Sir Hutcheson Poe was a member of the Land Conference of 1903, and he knows what happened about the price, and what a tremendously difficult thing it was to deal with.  What in fact occurred under the 1903 and 1909 Acts was that the landlords sold voluntarily and the tenants bought.  There was a certain amount of bargaining, inducement and, perhaps, coercion, but in any case land was bought at a price which in all the circumstances <Col N="1904" /> was the best price the landlords could get, and the tenants bought at a price that would leave them an annuity they would be able to pay.  That is the principle here.  Senator Sir Hutchenson Poe knows well that if we bought land at the market price we could not re-sell it.  It would be no use to us.  There was not one single perch of land bought under the 1903 or 1909 Acts at market price, and there are 13,000,000 acres of land in Ireland purchased.  I think that is well recognised.  I think it is common ground that landowners did not get, and did not expect, market price for their land.  It is common ground that if a landowner divided a 400 acre farm into 30 acre farms, and put it up for sale he would get more for each farm than he would get from the Land Commission.  I wonder did a landowner ever get the market price of land.  What we tried to do, and what the Convention of 1918 tried to do, was to arrive at a formula which would express as nearly as they could, the principles upon which the price was reached under previous Acts.</P>
      <P>They arrived at a decision and they put it into a printed Bill, and we have it here. It will not be the business of the Land Commission to say what is the smallest possible price they can get the land for. A Judicial Commissioner, a judge will have to hear the witnesses, if necessary, and apply that clause as a judge to the issue, and arrive as a judge in a judicial way at the price of the land which will be fair to the Land Commission and fair to the vendor.  In doing that, what we are really doing is what was done under the 1903 Act.  In this way we are calling in an independent arbitrator between the landlord and tenant, and we can consider a case like this.  Ordinary negotiations took place between the landlord and tenant for the purchase of an estate under the 1903 Act.  They could not agree, and they leave the whole matter to be considered by the Judge.  That is really what it comes to.  We could not possibly change the price for untenanted land. I ask the Senator not to press this amendment. It would wreck the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPoe" hpid="Colonel Sir HUTCHESON POE Colonel Sir HUTCHESON POE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Sir HUTCHESON POE</NameTxt>
      <P>The only answer I make is this: I presume that in November, 1919, when the Acquisition of Land Act was passed, it was in consequence of the indisposition <Col N="1905" /> of the owners to sell their land at a price that the Land Commission would pay, and the Government thought that by appointing an independent tribunal they would be assured of the market value of the land, or something approaching it. The people need not sell their land. Under that Act there is no compulsion. They could not get a satisfactory price from the Land Commission, and the Government passed this Bill and appointed an Arbitration Tribunal and the price of the land was fixed by them.  If it was right in November, 1919, to pass an Act to insure that a man would get the full market value, why is it wrong to do it now?  I cannot see the sense of that. I do not see if the English Government protected the interests of the people from whom they bought land, why should the Irish Government now reverse that?</P>

      <P>It seems to me that a great many people who are owners of untenanted land may be treated very unfairly.  The Land Commission might consider £10 an acre would be a reasonable price, whereas the real value to the owner might, perhaps, be in the neighbourhood of £100 an acre.  I do not think, in justice to the people who have done their best to farm and to carry out improvements in the best way, that this is a fair way of dealing with them.  I do not see how farming operations can be carried on without the investment of a certain amount of capital.  If you farm on a large scale, you have to put into operation a large amount of machinery and things of that sort.  With a sword of Damocles like this Bill hanging over them, I do not think you will find people willing to invest capital, and the result is that instead of being beneficial to the country the Bill will be the reverse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot quite follow the Minister's argument when he says that if that clause is altered, he cannot carry the Bill.  He can carry the Bill in the Dáil if he wishes.  All I want of him is a statement that he proposes to do no injustice and pay a fair price.  That should be made clear beyond yea or nay.  I would make an appeal on another ground. <Col N="1908" /> This country is more or less on its trial. Last night we voted away in a few minutes after dinner a sum of forty-six million odd pounds, and I do not think I am at all disclosing a secret when I say that we have not got that money.  Where are we to get it?  If we are going to throw aside people who have done their best in the country in the past and treat them unfairly, if we are to buy land at unfair prices, it will not conduce towards making the credit of this country very strong. On the grounds of benefiting the country and doing plain justice by carrying out his undertaking, I would ask the Minister to accept that suggestion of mine.</P>

      <P>I think there is a little confusion.  I do not think the Minister said, or intended to say, that he regarded every line in Sub-section (2) as sacrosanct.  I understood him to say that if those two amendments of his that we accepted were inserted, he would be prepared to consider, with those interested, the question of the price.</P>

      <P>We were referring to a special sort of land&mdash;purchased land. Senator Jameson made a very strong case, and said that we are not taking very much purchased land, but this threat against purchased land will taint the whole price of purchased land, and there are thirteen million acres of purchased land in the country.  It is serious, and I saw the force of that argument from the point of view of purchased land.  I was dealing only with purchased land which was previously purchased under the Land Purchase Acts.  Untenanted land is in a totally different position.  I simply made that remark in regard to purchased land to try and meet Senators who would seriously put up a strong case, from the security point of view, against touching purchased land at all.  A special case was made in regard to purchased land, but if that is now to be translated to tenanted land in general, well, I am not standing for it.  I want to meet Senator Barrington's point.  If I had the drafting of that Section in regard to tenanted land, and if I were the Dáil and Seanad combined, it would go in exactly as it is there.  I am really surprised at the case put up against that.  Surely Senators know that <Col N="1909" /> of the thirteen million acres purchased and resold to tenants, there was not an acre bought at the market value.  Would there be any land purchased if the Land Commission had to buy land at the market value?  Was it even suggested in the conference that took place before the Act of 1903, that land could be bought at market value?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>He probably got a better price, but he never got the market value; it was purely voluntary.  You cannot regard land purchase, having regard to the history of the case, as an ordinary commercial transaction, such as the sale of a shop from one man to another. It has never been regarded as that.  I cannot go and wipe out the history of the last couple of years.  I cannot say to the Irish people: &ldquo;we are going to give the market price for the land, you must pay four and a half per cent. for the money, and consequently your annuities must be more than under the 1903 Act.&rdquo; You are talking here of an English Act for English conditions.</P>

The second is the suggestion of Senator Moore that it should be the market value of the land. The third is the suggestion of Senator Barrington that there should be an appeal, not to the Judicial Commissioner, but to a Judge other than the Judicial Commissioner of the High Court.  The fourth is that of Senator the Earl of Kerry, in which he seeks to have inserted the provision that regard is to be had in fixing the price to the occupation interests of the owner.

      <P>As one who has some considerable experience in the compulsory purchase of land, may I point out that there is a vast difference between compulsory purchase and voluntary purchase?  If people want to purchase land compulsorily they must make the case that it is for the benefit of the community at large.  That, I think, the Minister has done.  But they must further show that they are not going to do anybody an injustice.  That, I submit, the Minister has not done.  I want him to put a provision in the Bill preventing <Col N="1911" /> him from doing that.  As the clause stands there is only an appeal to the Judicial Commissioner.  I have some experience of companies.  The Judicial Commissioner is something like the Chairman of a Company, and after the Company's officials have gone through a proposal and done their best there is not much use in appealing to the Chairman. I want an appeal to somebody other than the Judicial Commissioner.  I have more confidence in the judgment of a Judge of the High Court, and I ask that an appeal be given to him.</P>

He said that the instructions to the Judicial Commissioner were that he would have to have regard to the fair value of land to the Land Commission and to the owner respectively.  He told us again that he could not take out the words &ldquo;the fair value to the Land Commission.&rdquo; I I think we have come to an <i>impasse.</i>  It is no use pushing forward amendments against the Minister who tells us that if they are passed they will wreck his Bill. If we remember that these two lines are essential to the Bill unless we are prepared to vote for ending the Bill we must vote against the amendment.  As time goes on and it is getting late I think Senators ought to make up their minds whether or not they are going to back the amendment which the Minister tells us would wreck the Bill.  If we apply our minds to those lines and ask ourselves &ldquo;Is my amendment against the Bill of such a nature that the Minister cannot accept it,&rdquo; I think every Senator ought to hesitate a long time unless he is prepared to reject the Bill to bring forward amendments which will achieve that result.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not disposed to take the view of our duty that has recently been propounded by Senator Jameson.  I feel a grave responsibility in this matter.  I may be mistaken, but I am going to vote against the Bill unless substantial amendments are put in.  No doubt I will receive very little support, but I will have the satisfaction of having made my protest, and doing what I believe will prove to be in the long run, and sooner than some expect, in the better interests of the country.  The Minister has distinctly disregarded our claim to have anything put in the Bill which will compensate the vendor by virtue of the fact that this land was taken compulsorily.  I can only assume that he regards as of greater importance, the passing necessities of the moment, than the broad principle of security of property.  I know that in certain quarters security of property is <Col N="1914" /> regarded in an extraordinarily narrow sense as bolstering up a particular class. I appeal to the Seanad to take the larger view.</P>
    <P>It is an axiom that if you take property and security and give nothing in the nature of compensation you are running extraordinary risks.  When the Government comes to press their credit with this Bill on the Statute Book they may get a very rude shock.  We must exploit every avenue.  I am afraid the Minister will not meet us but we have to do what is right.  You have two cases, one man, an unpurchased tenant whose land is to be taken under the Resumption Clause. Under the somewhat elaborate machinery of this Bill land goes through a long history.  First it is vested, then it is resumed and after that it is retained. Then an operation comes into force in the Land Commission of buying land in the process of transition.  That land is held by the tenant with his tenant right. Take the other case of a man who has untenanted land.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to admit that possibly the majority of untenanted land is held by landlords or those commonly associated with the landlord class, but a very large portion of it is held by men of the farming class who bought this land with their savings.  You are going to make it possible that a man who paid £50 or £60 an acre for his land to-day is going to be taken into the Courts to-morrow and given such a price as the Land Commission can, with justice to the taxpayer give, even to a man with no reserve or capital.  Is that just?  If it is not just it should not be passed.  In the long run injustice will bring its inevitable consequences. It may be pleasant for a moment, but these honeymoons do not last long.  Specious proposals are sometimes put forward and carried at night, but there is always sorrow in the morning. I say there is no difference in essence between those two things, the one case of a man who bought his land at market price yesterday and the unpurchased tenant who has had his land taken from him at the same time.  I ask that the same treatment should be meted out to each.  When the Government take up this line, having got themselves pledged to a certain purchase and having given certain assurances it is very hard to get them to see the light.</P>

      <P>Quite so.  I am trying to make my case and to argue that it is unfair, and I consider, with all due respect to the Seanad, that if I could make this case before an arbitrator or a judge I would prove that it has a fairly solid foundation.  This amendment of mine assures that these two people get the same price, or that the price be assessed on the same basis.  This is the Act of 1881 which I suggest is none the worse for being old.  It comes in at the end of Section 5.</P>
      <P>These are the terms on which the landlord was allowed to resume possession and which are now being used by the Land Commission when they are resuming possession from the tenant.  They were under the Act of 1881 drafted to meet the case where the landlord was resuming:&mdash;&ldquo;Authorise resumption thereof by the landlord upon such terms as the Court may think fit and require the tenant to sell his tenancy in whole or part to the landlord upon such terms as may be approved by the Court, including full compensation to the tenant.&rdquo; If the Government are making any attempt at consistency&mdash;I have seen evidence of some small crumbs, but I have not seen anything substantial in the way of concessions, although what little we have got we are not ungrateful for&mdash;I claim that untenanted land which carries tenant right and has possibly been bought by some humble person out of his savings should be taken on the same terms as the land of an unpurchased tenant which the Land Commission wish to resume for the purpose of relieving congestion or the settlement of landless men.  I can only leave it to the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the contention of Senator Sir John Keane. There must be in the country a number of men who have within the last 10 or 12 <Col N="1916" /> years out of savings or prospective earnings bought tracts of land at large prices and possibly inflated prices.  Under this Bill these lands are to be taken from them compulsorily.  If the conditions existed which they assumed would exist when they purchased their holdings then the purchase of these farms would have enabled them in the course of time to discharge their liabilities.  Events have occurred, such as the toppling down of the values of farm produce, which have rendered it impossible for these people to pay off any reasonable portion of the purchase price of the holding.  If these lands are now taken at an unreasonable price&mdash;which is possible, I think, under the Section&mdash;the price given to these tenant purchasers will be such as to leave them with a load of debt round their necks due to the bank on the security of their neighbours.  That is bound to occur if a reasonable price is not given.  The Minister emphasised the fact that the whole finance of the Bill is based on a price fair to the Land Commission and he would not accept any amendment which would make the price other than a fair price to the Land Commission or a price that was likely to give&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not one of them and I have no interest in any of them.  I speak with an absolutely detached mind.

This does not refer to the circumstances which Senator Bennett waxes so eloquently about.  It refers to untenanted fee-simple land.  It does not refer to tenanted land.  When we come to the sections dealing with tenanted land we will discuss that question.  It does not refer either, in the new circumstances, by reason of the promise which I gave to Senator Jameson, to purchased holdings.  I am not now going over again the reasons which I adduced for fixing <Col N="1918" /> the price of untenanted land as it is fixed here.</P>

      <P>I accept the statement of the Minister with gratitude. Even though I may have lost my temper, I still say that a number of these people, even with the concessions made on the suggestion of Senator Jameson, will be still under a grave disability.  I may be getting warm again, but I hope the Minister will not follow my example. Even under the Section these men may still be taken away somewhere else, and given a parcel of land which, in the opinion of the Land Commission, will be of a certain value.  All through this Bill the opinion of the Land Commission is the basic factor in dealing with the value of lands.  That is the particular portion of the Bill which I take exception to.  I accept with gratitude the concession which the Minister made as regards purchased holdings.</P>

These people who bought land under these circumstances may be transferred from Limerick to Roscommon or Meath.  Is it likely to assume that a man who gave £4,000 for a farm of 40 acres will get an equivalent of his £4,000 from the Land Commission when their assumption of the value of land is to be based on the value of the land to the Land Commission?</P>

      <P>It is hard for a man like me to form an opinion on this question when one side of the case is dealt with by gentlemen farmers and landowners. Not having the necessary experience to judge I am inclined to take the side of the practical men.  There must be something wrong, although I am perfectly sure that the Minister for Agriculture wants to deal fairly with both parties. Whether he is taking the proper course or not, I am not so sure about.  I was very much convinced by the speech made by Senator Jameson with regard to the credit of the country.  I think that is the supreme point we have to keep in view. If the owners of purchased holdings have to share a considerable portion of their holdings I am afraid it will damage the <Col N="1919" /> credit of the country very much.  It would certainly damage it with the Banks and as a business man I do not want any further leakage in credit.  We have very good credit.</P>

      <P>The Senator who has last spoken is a business man, and I can quite understand that the intricacies of this measure are somewhat confusing. A purchased holder may mean one thing in ordinary plain English, but it means another thing under the Bill.  If I get a piece of fee simple land to-morrow I am a purchased holder, but not in the sense of the Bill.  A purchased holder has two meanings&mdash;it has a legal meaning under this Bill as a man who bought under previous Land Acts and who is now paying an annuity.  It may also mean a man who bought a piece of land from anybody and who now owns it.  I might have made some money in business and decided that I would like to try farming.  I found someone prepared to sell land not subject to an annuity.  I bought it and became a purchased holder.  I want to put a parallel which I think will appeal to business men in the Seanad.  A business man is in the furniture trade, and someone comes along and says to him, &ldquo;I am interested in some poor people in the Coombe who want to furnish.&rdquo; For the purpose of financing the transaction they have to go to some society to be financed. They are people whose earnings are precarious and naturally a certain amount <Col N="1920" /> of risk is involved in the transaction. Someone comes along and says to the furniture owner, &ldquo;you have got to hand over your furniture to these people, no matter what you paid for it, at such a price as will be fair to you and fair to the persons who are financing this somewhat precarious transaction.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I submit that is an absolute parallel to what is proposed to be done under this measure.  I say it is impossible to do it in practice.  It must operate in this way The two prices will be poles apart. What I say is that one man has bought land out of savings, and if you are not going to give him something near the price at which he bought or the market price, you are striking a fell blow at the economic security of your country, a blow that will shake to its foundations the credit of the State.  I cannot conceive how merely for some immediate purpose, or because the Government are not prepared, in any way to help to bridge the gulf between these two parties, that you should&mdash;I use the word advisedly&mdash;confiscate the man who has put his savings into the property.  The amendment goes far to get over that difficulty.  It is justified by the fact that I am only asking for the same treatment for the purchased holder of untenanted land as will be given to a tenant, if his lands are taken for certain purposes.  I do appeal to the Seanad to look at the question in the proper proportions, in the spirit of justice and security.</P>

As that seems to me to be an absolutely reactionary&mdash;if there was a stronger word I would use it&mdash;idea, it is obvious to me that I could not possibly vote for such an amendment when he holds that idea.</P>

      <P>As I was explaining, the figures given in my amendment are those taken from the Representation of the People Act, 1918.  The amount will require to be smaller under Proportional Representation.  But that is only a detail, the principle is fixing the amount.  I understand that in the Dáil no maximum amount was fixed, principally on the ground that correct returns were never furnished and that the laws of bribery and corruption are so strict.  There is a good deal in these arguments.  It is only another instance of the inability to enforce necessary law. After all it is better to have a maximum, because it gives the opponent of a candidate who spends to excess an opportunity for lodging an election petition and having the election voided, and <Col N="1924" /> generally checking extravagant expenditure of that kind.  We had in England recently a successful election petition, and I hope there will be an opportunity to do the same here in some cases at any rate.  The very fact that there is a possible punishment there would in itself act as a check.  But it is a dangerous backward step to abolish the maximum altogether. We have a lot of abuses to wipe out in connection with elections.  In the interest of public morality we should have some check on abuses of this kind, and I think we should be able to enforce it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason that no maximum is provided in the Bill is the changed situation that has been produced by the introduction of Proportional Representation. It is very difficult to fix any maximum that will be fair to candidates in all constituencies and that will be equally fair to all sorts of candidates. Take the case of a constituency like Galway, which has nine members and is of large extent.  An amount that would be fair to a candidate who is going to represent a small scattered minority over a whole county would be obviously far too much for some local worthy who is going to represent his own town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a man had to provide personation agents in every constituency it would take a great deal more than in the case of a man dealing with one small particular area.  The same argument applies in the case of smaller constituencies.  The same scale would not be fair in the case of a constituency with three members that would be fair in the case of a constituency of nine members.  Another reason is that the maximum so far has been practically a delusion.  Correct returns have practically never been presented at any rate in recent years.  I know of an election where the return of the amount expended was £400, whereas it must have been £2,000 at least.  We found when drafting the Bill that it would be well for the present at any rate to have no maximum and to rely on the clauses dealing with bribery, cheating, and all that.  If there is no improper expenditure, except with bribery and corruption, it was felt that no harm would <Col N="1925" /> be likely to accrue from a fairly liberal expenditure, provided it was not spent on anything that was wrong in itself.  After an election or two, with the experience and knowledge that would be gained from the revival of a practice, if there ever was such a practice, of presenting fairly accurate returns it would be possible to legislate further and prescribe some maximum.</P>
    <P>It is not going to help much any particular class of candidate to have no maximum.  Some people may say that the Labour Party would be severely handicapped, but I think it will be admitted in point of fact that they would not be handicapped by any freedom on the part of somebody who is rich to spend freely on legal and legitimate work under perfectly legal headings.  It is not a matter about which I feel very strongly, but I think in view of the difficulty of fixing any satisfactory maximum that would be fair all round and that would press equally on various candidates, in view  the fact that heretofore the law in fixing a maximum was a farce, and in view of the fact that it is thought that there will be no straight fight under Proportional Representation, a fairly free expenditure on the part of a candidate, if legitimate, would not be likely to have ill results, and therefore it would be better to leave the maximum out.  If abuses should grow up they could be dealt with.  People I have spoken to do not, however, fear that there will be any abuses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to support the amendment.  I appreciate the difficulties there will be, but I think the argument in favour of giving it a trial is greater than the difficulties, some of which the Minister thinks are more to be feared than actual, that may arise in its application.  If no limit of expenses is laid down I cannot see any advantage in having a return of expenditure sent in at all.  The limit of expenses in ordinary elections not under Proportional Representation has been of enormous advantage to candidates of limited means and an enormous check on powerful organisations with large funds at their disposal. I do not think that the Seanad should lightly set the proposal aside.</P>

Those of us who have been engaged on elections in this country know that there has been a <Col N="1927" /> certain amount of looseness regarding election procedure.  The number of times a person voted was usually looked upon as a splendid achievement.  I hope that henceforth all elections will be carried out in a clean and honourable manner. Young people, however, who do not understand these things may be advised by people who ought to know better.

      <i>(a)</i>  Any holding in respect of which the standard price exceeds three thousand pounds; or</P>

      <P>I beg to propose Amendment 29 <i>(a):</i>&mdash;To delete the Sub-section (6).  I do this to call attention to the new and important features introduced into this new sub-section which will press very hardly on an unpurchased tenant.  As I read this sub-section under <i>(b)</i> the unpurchased tenant who already has other lands which have been purchased under any of the Land Purchase Acts and which other lands exceed £3,000 in value automatically is a holder of his unpurchased land whatever its value.  That is a new provision. This whole provision is, I think, new in any Bill that has been before the Irish Parliament.  The effect of that is to take away completely for the time being from that unpurchased tenant the whole of his unpurchased land and to hand it over.  Subsequently that land may go through a further process of resumption under the next section, and he may never get back that land if the Government wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will have an opportunity of arguing <Col N="1929" /> what happens to that land under Section 32, but I would ask the Seanad to take a serious view of this matter that they are giving the Land Commission power to take, and keep if they wish for all time, a person's unpurchased land merely because he happens not to have bought or perhaps it is being bought under a purchase agreement, and the value of it exceeds £3,000.  I think this is a drastic piece of legislation.  It is not just that because a man owns land of £3,000 value you take away from him any land in excess of that amount, even land which he may have in his family for generations.  I would ask Senators to examine independently what these provisions mean, and if possible to try and get a clear judgment on the matter of this kind.  I would like to be allowed to withdraw this amendment and to move the next, which is to limit Sub-section <i>(b)</i> only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>These are two very important Sections, 28 and 29, and it would be well that we should get the hang of them in the beginning.  The machinery of the Bill is, shortly, this.  There is an appointed day which varies for different sections, different counties, different areas, as the Land Commission wish. When they are ready to name the appointed day in any area which they think is suitable, they name it for a specified area. There is no such thing as an appointed day for the congested districts, for instance. There might be an appointed day, for instance, for three parishes in the County Galway.  I doubt if they will deal in parishes; they will probably deal in estates.  The appointed day comes when the Land Commission ascertain a few very simple particulars: the name of the tenant and of the landlord, the area of the holding, etc.  Then they can name the appointed day.  They name the appointed day for all holdings except <Col N="1930" /> retained holdings.  I will just read the Section on that point:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The tenant of every holding of tenanted land vested in the Land Commission by virtue of this Act, and to which this section applies, shall be deemed on the appointed day to have entered into a subsequent purchase agreement for the purchase of the holding from the Land Commission at the standard price.</P>
      <P>The second Sub-Section is rather important:&mdash;</P>
      <P>There shall be payable by the tenant to the Land Commission an annual sum, equivalent to the standard purchase annuity for the holding, and the additional annuity (if any) in respect of compounded arrears of rent added to the purchase money, from the appointed day until the gale day next after the holding is vested in the tenant. The Land Commission shall have for the recovery of such annual sum the same remedies as they have for the recovery of unpaid instalments of purchase annuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So that from the appointed day, which can be fixed extremely quickly after ascertaining a few simple particulars, the tenant purchaser is paying a sum which is equivalent in amount to his standard purchase annuity.  We do not call it purchase annuity.  We call it an equivalent sum.  The tenant purchaser has the example of the operations of the 1903 Act all round him, and we do not want to give the impression to him that he was the absolute owner in fee-simple of his holding on the appointed day, and that we were unable to re-arrange the estate, as estates have to be arranged under all purchase Acts.  We want to give him all the advantages of being the owner in fee-simple for the time being.  We are allowing him to pay a sum equivalent to his annuity, and not the old interest in lieu of rent which was always higher than the annuity, and no part of which went in redemption of the annuity, with the result that under the 1903 Act you have sales pending in the Land Commission for 7 or 8 years.  You have tenant purchasers paying interest in lieu of rent which is higher than the annuity and not one penny of which goes in redemption of their advance.  We want to abolish a long-standing grievance, namely, the <Col N="1931" /> interest in lieu of rent period.  We have arrived at the appointed day and the date on which the tenant begins to pay the sum equivalent to his standard purchase annuity.  Then:</P>
    <P>There shall be payable by the tenant to the Land Commission on the gale day on which the first instalment of the said annual sum shall become payable by him an additional sum, equivalent to a proportion of the said annual sum in respect of the period between the said gale day and the day on which the next dividends are payable on Land Bonds issued under this Act.  The Land Commission shall have for the recovery of such additional sum the same remedies as they have for the recovery of unpaid instalments of the purchase annuity.</P>
    <P>Every holding to which this section applies shall be vested in the tenant by the Land Commission by vesting order or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Now, we come to the second portion&mdash; namely, the date of vesting.  In the 1903 Act there was the date of the agreement and the date of vesting.  In this there is an appointed day, and the date of vesting.  Under the 1903 Act, between the date of the agreement and the vesting, the tenant paid interest in lieu of rent.  Under this Bill, between the appointed day and the date of vesting, he pays the equivalent to the standard purchase annuity.</P>
    <P>This is an important section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>All payments made by the tenant after the appointed day on foot of the annual sum payable by him to the Land Commission under this section shall, from and after the vesting of the holding in him, be treated for all purposes as if they had been payments in respect of purchase annuity.</P>
    <P>That is to say that after the date of vesting we make an adjustment.  It is only a matter of book-keeping.  We give him credit for the sinking fund portion of his payment which he has been making between the appointed day and the date of vesting.  That gets over the difficulty of the interest in lieu of rent period, without doing anyone any harm. It is perfectly obvious that if we had to make all the inquiries and all the arrangements, checking accurately, and have everything fixed before we could name the appointed day, that we would <Col N="1932" /> be back to the old procedure.  We are not in a position to do that&mdash;to say the last word on every issue until the date of vesting.  When we have all the details settled we vest, because we know that everything is fair and square.  If we were to adjourn the appointed day until we had every detail settled, then the appointed day would not come for the long period that elapses between the date of the agreement and the date of vesting under the 1903 Act, which is sometimes two and four years and on odd occasions about 12 years.  There are sales begun in 1907 still pending in the Land Commission for a good many reasons, chiefly the war.  The average period is about five years.  If we are to abolish this interest in lieu of rent period and give the tenant all the benefits of paying a sum equivalent to his annuity, and redeeming his holding from a very early date, we must retain any holding we have any suspicion about, that might have to be re-arranged afterwards.  We must do it with a fairly wide sweep.</P>
    <P>There will be 75 or 80 per cent. of holdings&mdash;ordinary economic holdings&mdash; where any inspector will know that the tenant is not going to be stirred.  It is the minority that always make the trouble.  We must, then, as I say, with a pretty wide sweep, exclude from that advantage, to start with, the holdings we have any doubt about, that we think may have to be re-arranged afterwards for any reason.  Hence we exclude any holding in respect of which the standard price exceeds £3,000.  Why?  Our limit is £3,000, the same limit as the 1909 Act, and the same as the 1920 Bill.  We may sell more, and we may not.  We have not made up our minds.  We cannot hold up the appointed day for the other 75 per cent. until we make up our minds.</P>
    <P>The Sub-section reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Any holding in the beneficial occupation of a tenant who is on the appointed day the proprietor of lands for the purchase of which advances have been made under any of the Land Purchase Acts, and whether redeemed or not, if the total amount resulting from the addition to the standard price of the amount obtained by capitalising at the rate of four and three-quarters per cent. the original annuities payable on such advances, exceeds £3,000.</P>
    <P>That sounds pretty formidable, but it <Col N="1933" /> is simple with a little explanation.  Any tenant who got an advance of over £3,000 under the 1903 Act, that advance was counted in for the purposes of the limitation under the 1909 Act, the principle being: how much is the State lending? It does not matter whether it is this Act or that.  There was only one doubt as to the 1909 Act and it was this: Suppose a tenant got an advance under the 1903 Act and had redeemed it, was he entitled to the full £3,000 under the 1909 Act?  There was a rather famous case, <i>in re</i> Mary Sweetman, which was taken to the Courts, and there it was decided that it did not matter whether the tenant had redeemed his advance or not It was to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>That is the law of the land at the moment.  That is not the law of this Bolshevist Government that is out to destroy property and play the deuce with the big farmer.  That is the law of the good old British Government.  That was a provision in the 1920 Bill accepted by all parties.  It occurred to me that it was unfair in one respect and I altered the law for the benefit of the tenant.  This is the case that occurred to me.  A farmer may have two farms.  He may have purchased one under the 1903 Act when the price of tenanted land was much higher.  His advance may be £2,000. He has another farm which is not purchased yet and which is to be purchased under this Bill.  If he had not the bad fortune to purchase under the 1903 Act the £3,000 might conceivably purchase both farms now because the price is low. He has got his advance of £2,000 already and has only £1,000 to spare.  How to put that man in the same position as the man who had not purchased either farm under the existing law was the dilemma.</P>
    <P>After a considerable amount of consideration we arrived at this principle: &ldquo;If the total amount resulting from the addition to the standard price of the amount obtained by capitalising at the rate of 4¾ per cent., the original annuities payable on such advances exceeds £3,000.&rdquo; We took his original annuity. Under the 1903 Act it was 3¼ per cent. on his advance.  The annuity capitalised at 3¼ per cent. would be a lot less.  That is clear.  We are, therefore, putting him in the same position as if he had never <Col N="1934" /> purchased and as if he was to get an advance under this Bill as near as we can do it.  There is only one alteration in this Section from the 1920 Bill, and that is an improvement on the side of the tenant, and on the side of the big tenant.  That cannot be gainsaid.  &ldquo;Any holding as respects which the Land Commission declare that it is not in the public interest that the holding shall be re-sold to the tenant as aforesaid, whether on the ground that the improvement of the holding is essential and practicable or otherwise.&rdquo; We might take such a holding for draining purposes or otherwise. We give ourselves wide powers to retain any holding we are suspicious of in the interests of the other 75 per cent.: &ldquo;Any holding which in the opinion of the Land Commission ought be retained for improvement or enlargement or for utilisation in connection with the relief of congestion, all of which holdings are in this Act referred to as retained holdings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No harm is done to the retained holding up to this stage and the tenant is not put out.  He goes on farming his land in the same old way.  A mark is put opposite his holding in the Land Commission and that is all that occurs for the moment.  The other 80 per cent. of the tenants who are not retained start paying in sums equivalent to the purchase annuities immediately and get all the advantages they would have got if they had actually been vested.  What happens retained holdings?  &ldquo;In the case of every holding retained by the Land Commission (1) The Land Commission shall have and may exercise all or any of the powers exercisable by them as respects holdings on estates vested in them, including powers of resumption of the whole or part of the holding, whether the holding is or is not part of an estate or subject to a judicial rent.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will skip now from what happens to the retained holding, and come to the point where we decide to re-sell it, or portion of it.  The appointed day is fixed, and this is what happens under Sub-section (4) of Section 29: &ldquo;There shall be payable to the Land Commission by the tenant of every retained holding an annual sum equivalent to the standard purchase annuity for the holding, and the additional annuity (if any) in respect of compounded arrears of rent added to the purchase money from the appointed day.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointed day as an appointed day is named for all the holdings whether they be retained or not.  There is a slight mistake there, but I can put that right simply by saying whether holdings be retained or not, that an appointed day is named for all the holdings.  The whole point I wish to make is that an appointed day must be fixed, immediately after a <Col N="1936" /> few particulars have been obtained, so as to avoid the long interest in lieu of rent period.  Then, as I explained in regard to non-retained holdings, the tenant pays this equivalent sum until the date of the vesting, and after the date of the vesting his payments are adjusted, and he gets credit, as from the appointed day, for anything that he has paid into the sinking fund.  The sub-section says the tenant shall pay to the Land Commission an annual sum &ldquo;equivalent to the standard purchase money for the holding, and the additional annuity (if any) in respect of compounded arrears of rent added to the purchase money from the appointed day <i>(a)</i> if the entire holding is resold to the tenant until the gale day next after the vesting of the holding.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to meet cases where we retain pretty liberally.  A great number of these retained holdings will be resold without the slightest change, and if we re-sell they will have suffered no loss, except that on someone's books in the Land Commission a letter &ldquo;R&rdquo; will appear opposite their names.  Therefore, in the case of retained holdings which we re-sell, the owner will suffer no loss whatever, because he is getting all the advantages that apply in the case of other holdings.  If we sell to a man a holding value for £5,000, and that this man has another holding which is valued for £10,000 he shall pay a sum equivalent to the annuity until the date of the vesting, and from that date he shall pay a proportionate sum for the proportionate amount of land that we leave to him.</P>
    <P>Sub-section 6 of Section 29 says: &ldquo;If the entire holding is re-sold to the tenant all payments made by the tenant after the appointed day on foot of the annual sum payable by him to the Land Commission under this section shall from and after the vesting of the holding in him be treated for all purposes as if they had been payments in respect of purchase annuity.  In every other case such proportion of the payments aforesaid as the Land Commission shall direct, shall from and after the vesting of any part of the holding in a purchaser be treated for all purposes as if they had been payments in respect of purchase annuity charged on that part of the holding.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore in regard to retained holdings, they pay a sum equivalent to the <Col N="1937" /> annuity up to the date of the vesting, and after the date of the vesting if the entire holding is re-sold they pay an annuity for the portion of the holding that is resold, that is to say they pay a proportionate part of the annuity, and if none of the holding is resold they pay an equivalent sum up to the date of resumption. So far as Section 29 dealing with retained holdings is concerned the tenant purchasers suffer no hardship, good, bad or indifferent, except that the letter &ldquo;R&rdquo; is put opposite their names in the books of the Land Commission.</P>

What will become of a tenant in that case, or what will become of his residential farm?</P>

I am sorry for the inconvenience and the delay I may have caused the Seanad, but I am acting from a sense of my responsibilities.  The Minister has succeeded in making this question of retained holdings a very complicated one.  The point I want to make seems to me extremely simple.  This sub-section proposes to retain and keep, if they wish, for any time&mdash;that is the point &mdash;any unpurchased land coming within the operations of this Act, whether the holding is that of land purchased previously or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>The mere retention itself may be quite innocuous, but when it gives such power I suggest it is dangerous.  The Minister made a great point out of the fact that, owing to some legal decision, until the purchaser has redeemed his annuity he still is regarded as having had an advance on whatever the amount may be.  I should have hoped the Minister would have had regard to the equity of the case and not merely to the technicality of the case. But here the Minister makes the case as if we were an administrative body, administering law instead of being, as we are, a body making law.  It appears to us as an inequitable case that when a <Col N="1939" /> man paid back money he is to be considered as still having got it; it surely is within our power to make a fresh law to put that matter right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the point that is troubling the Senator I have no very strong views upon it; that is to say, if he redeemed a particular annuity it should not be taken into account.  I leave that to the Senate and I think it is only a minor point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister accepts that view then this section is no longer necessary and my amendment is justified, because the whole case is covered by Sub-section <i>(a).</i>  Furthermore, I am not at all clear on this matter. Supposing this purchaser who is coming within the operation of this Sub-section has acquired this other land by purchase if he or his predecessor in title has not been the subject of a direct advance but acquired it by purchase, he is still, as far as I can see, the proprietor of this land covered by that section.  No advance is made to him.  The advance has been made to him on account of the holding of some other person.  I cannot see the equity of this Sub-section.  I cannot see that it is justified, and I do not think it covers or deals with any case that cannot be adequately dealt with under Sub-section <i>(a).</i>  It will operate most inequitably, because it will enable the Land Commission to get possession and retain, of course, subject to payment always, any unpurchased land if the purchaser has other purchased land of a value of £3,000, and for that reason I propose to divide the Senate unless the Minister accepts my amendment.</P>

      <P>The legal position is this.  Consider retained holdings for a moment.  The landlord's interest in retained holdings as well as the landlord's interest in a non-retained holding is vested in the Land Commission on the appointed day as I pointed out previously. The tenant's interest in the retained holding and the tenant's interest in the non-retained holding is still with the tenant.  As far as this Section is concerned there is absolutely no difference in law between the two, except in the books of the Land Commission, where the letter &ldquo;R&rdquo; is placed opposite the name of the holding.  The tenant is <Col N="1940" /> still the owner of his interest on the retained holding.  The tenant of the non-retained holding is equally the owner and the landlord's interest in the holding is vested in the Land Commission, so what are we fighting about?  It is not until we come to the next Section that we dispose of the holdings.  Now Senator Sir John Keane is troubled by one point, that is to say, that in Sub-section <i>(b)</i> we take into account the previous advances even though redeemed.  That is not a big point and it is a matter in which the Seanad is as good a judge as I am and I am quite willing to take their advice on that point.  I have not the advantage of having Sir John Keane's amendment before me.</P>

    <P>In the case of every holding retained by the Land Commission:</P>
    <P>(1) The Land Commission shall have and may exercise all or any of the powers exerciseable by them as respects holdings on estates vested in them, including powers of resumption of the whole or part of the holding, whether the holding is or is not part of an estate or subject to a judicial rent; and in exercising the powers aforesaid shall have regard to the necessity of relieving congestion, the desirability of increasing the food supply of the country, and the manner in which the holdings have been used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of discussion I have put down the amendment in my name.  I think we have come to the parting of the ways in the Bill. Hitherto, as far as I know, we have been dealing with lands for the relief of congestion, and now it seems to me that we are dealing with lands for other purposes. I would ask the Minister if he would explain to us whether I am right in my view or not.  I would like an explanation from him as to whether we are at the parting of the ways, and whether, having parted our ways, this is not the only Clause for the treatment of a tenant owing or paying an annual rent to a landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; we are at the parting of the ways.  The holding of a judicial tenant, or a present tenant, may be resumed by the landlord for a public purpose at present.  There is no doubt about that.  The owner of a judicial tenancy or a present tenancy is in an entirely different position from the owner of a purchased holding, and it was in view of that fact that this distinction was made, as recommended by the Conference of 1918, after careful investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was to meet the genuine cases that there are through the country, and Senators must realise that the Land Commission must have some powers to deal with the large ranching system.  They got it through following the illustrious precedent <Col N="1944" /> which I have mentioned.  In exercising the powers of resumption which they have they shall have regard to the necessity for relieving congestion, the desirability of increasing the food supply of the country and the manner in which the holdings have been used.  That was to make some attempt to meet the case of the large farmer of four or five hundred acres, perhaps let on the 11 months system, who himself is a tenant, and to meet the thing that has been the cause of land trouble in Ireland for a very long time, and to give the Land Commission some discretion in regard to it.  I ask the Seanad not to be more reactionary in this matter in regard to this particular, important, and burning question than the English House of Lords were.  They were prepared to give the Land Commission that discretion, and why should not we?  We know that this is a burning question.  You ought not to assume that the Land Commission will exercise it wrongfully, and it will take a good deal of explaining in this hour of the day, in the year 1923, if we are not prepared to tackle that problem at least as logically as the people in 1920 and much earlier. That is all I have to say on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>That being the case my reply is that the English House of Lords cared nothing for the tenant farmer of £3,000 worth of land.  Whether his interest was sacrificed or not, I think, was immaterial to them, and I take it that if any particular class is singled out for special treatment it should not be the man who has been victimised by paying possibly a harsher rent even though it were a judicial rent, over a large number of years.  That seems to me to be the particular class which is now singled out for this exceptional treatment.  I would rather that it would have been faced courageously and that you should take all lands for every purpose, practically every purpose, as the power is given in this Section, than that tenanted land which is dealt with here should be the only class of land dealt with for a specific purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That view will not commend itself to the Minister.  I went with him the whole way for the relief of congestion, and if he had asked me I would possibly go the whole way with him for other purposes of the Bill, but I think it is a pity that he should reserve these particular powers as <Col N="1945" /> against the ordinary tenant, and that an ordinary tenant must occupy no land of which the purchase price is more than £3,000.  No man considers a man whose land £3,000 would purchase as in any sense a large farmer.  I take it that in many cases £3,000 only purchases 60 or 70 acres of land and now, under this Bill, any man who owns land in excess of this 60 or 70 acres is liable to have that land taken from him and used for all the purposes for which powers are given in this Section.  That seems to me to be very unjust.  I do not think I need labour the point, but I can leave it to the good sense of the Seanad as to whether it is a fair and just provision between man and man, between purchased tenant and unpurchased tenant, and between all sections that we are trying to deal with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is developing in a very interesting manner, and I think the Seanad deserves great commendation for having been the first of the two Houses to discover what lurks within this Section.  I studied the debates in the other House carefully, and I do not think the thing ever came to their notice, and I am not surprised.  The thing is skilfully drafted, and I doubt if I have discovered all the subtleties that lie within this Bill.  I even discovered some at 5 o'clock this morning, and perhaps at 6 o'clock to-morrow morning I am going to look for more.  This really throws a flood of light on the methods of the Government.  It is courageous to tackle the problem in this way&mdash;to take the unpurchased tenant as the <i>corpus vile</i> on which to let loose the various denominations referred to in Section 21.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was puzzled all along where the land for these non-congests was to come from, because, in spite of the Minister's statement in the Dáil, under Section 24 the thing seemed fairly satisfactory, but I am not satisfied yet.  On the face of it, if the term &ldquo;congest&rdquo; is administered in the plain sense of the thing, it would have <Col N="1946" /> been fairly satisfactory, but here now we find that the land for these various denominations including any other person to whom, in the opinion of the Land Commission, advances ought to be made, is to be taken mainly and primarily out of these retained holdings, out of unpurchased lands in excess of a certain amount, and, as I have shown in a previous amendment, in calculating that amount consideration should be taken of other lands purchased under a previous Act, although the annuity may have been redeemed.  I really think that is an astonishing proposition.  I am past hoping we will carry any amendments.  I feel clearly that it is none the less necessary for the country in these days of wide publicity, when we are speaking to more than to a favoured few, to know what is going on, and this is the first opportunity the country will get of knowing it.</P>
    <P>There is nothing whatever in the Bill so far as I know, to bring out this point, so that it comes to this now.  I did not know, I may say, that such a large quantity of unpurchased land was in the form of ranches.  It is news to me, but no doubt the Minister and his advisers knew it, and they acted accordingly.  But, at any rate, it is the unpurchased tenant who is going to provide most of the land for the settlement of the evicted tenants, landless men, and other persons whom the Land Commission think are entitled to land.  I leave it to the House to say whether the unpurchased tenant is a fair subject for such treatment.  I never knew the unpurchased tenant was fattening in luxury.  I understood that of all people he was the person who was getting all the popular sympathy.  He certainly has had a fairly substantial reduction of his rent under the terms of this Bill, but I think he is going to lose that advantage many times over under the provisions of this section.  Now, let it be clearly understood that is what we are doing.  We are singling out the unpurchased tenant, not necessarily the large unpurchased tenant, who is going to have his land taken not only for the relief of congestion, but for all the other purposes enumerated in this Bill.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The Land Commission shall have, and may exercise all or any of the powers exercisable by them as respects holdings on estates vested in them, including powers of resumption of the whole or part of the holding, whether the holding is or is not part of an estate or subject to a judicial rent; and in exercising the powers aforesaid shall have regard to the necessity of relieving congestion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is to say, they have the landlord's power of resumption for public purposes. They can resume for the relief of congestion, but they cannot go further in regard to this in the taking of a holding.  They can resume a holding or part of a holding if they think it is necessary to do so from the point of view of the desirability of increasing the food supply of the country, and they can take into account the manner in which the holdings had been used, &ldquo;And in exercising their powers aforesaid and the manner in which the holdings had been used&rdquo;&mdash;that was what the House of Lords thought on the Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1948" /> The resumption price is rather important, and we had better be clear on this question of price in regard to resumption. &ldquo;The price of the resumed holding; the compensation which is to be paid to the tenant under this section&rdquo;&mdash;that is, Section 56, quoted here in the Bill&mdash;&ldquo;does not include compensation for disturbance. Full compensation means what would be got for a tenancy if sold in the open market at a fair rent&rdquo;&mdash;(Judge O'Hagan).  That is the resumption price you would get.

There is £3,000 worth left, according to their valuation.  Will that be paid for at what, before this Bill was passed, the land was worth?  A great deal of land has been sold at a very high price.  The price has now gone down considerably.  How much beneath that price is the holder of the surplus to be paid when this is taken from him?</P>

I know that there are certain modifications which I am not clear about at the moment.  The price is a little less, as a rule, than the market price.  I will quote from Cherry a decision on &ldquo;resumption price,&rdquo; though probably the Chairman knows more about it than I do.
