      <P>I move the deletion of Sub-section (4).  My reasons for doing so are that flogging of any description is brutal and brutalising&mdash;brutal to the victim and brutalising to the person who conducts the flogging.  There is no evidence as far as I can find out that flogging has ever succeeded in doing away with any of the crimes for which it was applied. In some case the criminals are so much imbued with the ideals for which they commit these crimes, or are so fanatical that the question of punishment does not enter into the matter at all.  They will depend upon evading arrest if possible.  I would like to point out that flogging is not a proper course to adopt with the majority of the parties in arms against the Government at the present time.</P>

      <P>There is no question here of the people in arms.  It is a question of robbery under arms and arson.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>There are quite a number of offences.  A number of those people whom it is now proposed to flog under this Bill are quite young in years, and their upbringing during the past seven or eight years has more or less brought them into this state, more or less encouraged them to pursue the lines they are taking.  Some of these young boys were children of tender years in 1916, and during these seven years a lot of these young men have been encouraged <Col N="1676" /> to break every law practically that existed as regards property.  To my own knowledge they have been encouraged to raid for arms, and in some cases to go round and collect levies under arms, and I do not think it is a proper course to adopt with those men now, because the same parties who were responsible for educating them into this thing propose to flog them out of it now.  It seems to me it is like teaching a young puppy to follow cats, and later buying a cat and flogging the puppy for following that cat.  That is not the way to get over the difficulty.  I believe that flogging will never solve this question.</P>
      <P>I have in mind an old man of over 80 years of age who was once flogged in the British Navy, and that man to this day if you mentioned the British Navy to him would stand back, take off his coat and shirt and show you his back, and curse the people that flogged him sixty years ago.  I do not want to see any men here suffering for what, mistakenly, they consider to be high ideals.  I do not want these people to go down for the next fifty or sixty years, cursing the people who flogged them.</P>

      <P>I take it that we need not feel called upon to make Second Reading speeches upon this Sub-section, and I take it too that we need not go at any length into the question as to whether this particular penalty had in fact, in the past, succeeded in stamping out the crimes for which it was applied. Whether, for instance, it was the penalty of flogging that stamped out the crime of garrotting in England, or whether it was merely that the garrotters tired of the pastime, does not arise.  What does arise is that these two crimes of robbery under arms and arson are prevalent in the country and have been for the last year, that there are arms hidden from end to end of this country, and that, in addition you have a wave of demoralisation unprecedented in this country, and scarcely equalled in any other country, where crime has been made attractive by being wrapped round in a cloak of political preference or a political ideal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Men have been told to go out and run amok because the country was theirs for the taking.  Senator Duffy suggested in some way that these crimes had been inculcated by people who are now endeavouring to deal with them.  Robbery <Col N="1677" /> under arms was not preached in Ireland by any people assuming to be political leaders, and arson was not preached. The burning of the homes of fellow-citizens was not preached in Ireland before now in the name of any political ideals.  Simply looking on ahead, one has to face this, that if the country is to survive, that if it is to regain any kind of prestige amongst the nations, if it is to settle its grave financial problems, we must stop these crimes, and no prospective Minister for Home Affairs would take office if he felt that for the checking of these crimes he had to rely simply upon incarceration.  Imprisonment as the penalty is very largely blunted, and the criminal will find a hidden gun and go out to live by it, unless we are prepared to take strong steps to stop him and to deter him.  The Senator spoke as if it were proposed to turn on the twelve or thirteen thousand men in jail and to apply these penalties to them.  Sub-section (6) of this section says: &ldquo;This section shall not apply to any offence committed before the passing of this Act.&rdquo; There is fair warning there for the man who goes out to rob his neighbour, and a fair warning for the man who goes out in a spirit of vengeance or in a spirit of sheer blackguardism to burn his neighbour's house.</P>
    <P>But the people of this country have a right to be protected in the ordinary decencies of life.  They have a right to be protected in their person and property, and I say this, that if we were unable to throw up here an Executive that could protect them and if we had not the moral courage to put into the hands of that Executive the power that can alone protect them, then the people of this country have a right to demand that from elsewhere, if not from here, they get a Government that will protect them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder how many times I have heard practically the same words from the Minister.  He is always harping on the same thing&mdash;that the people must be protected.  Again and again we hear the same thing, but we do not hear about the things inflicted upon them.  The Government claim power to do anything they like on the plea that the people must be protected.  These arguments might have been all very good six months ago.  If this Bill was proposed <Col N="1678" /> six months ago I would vote for the Bill as it stands, although I do not like it, and without proposing a single amendment.  But this is a time of peace. I believe the Bill we are considering now is one that will not have anything but a bad effect, and will be provocative of the very worst.  That is why I oppose it.  I believe it is wrong from beginning to end.  We are dealing now with this punishment of flogging.  I do not know whether anyone in this room has seen a flogging.  I have.  I have seen a number of floggings a great many years ago.  It was in South Africa, when I was very young, and these floggings are horrible things.  If anyone once saw them he would not ask to see them repeated.  I have seen men flogged, and I have seen soldiers standing in the ranks looking on at the horrible sight.</P>
      <P>I do not want to describe things that would make people's hair stand, but in reality that is the fact.  A great many years ago, when I was a young soldier serving in South Africa, a certain number of soldiers were getting drunk from time to time&mdash;not an extraordinary number, but a certain number.  It was regarded as a very bad crime, and the General Commanding gave an order that everybody in future who was found drunk should be flogged.  Well, these things always happen in the way you do not want them to happen.  It happened that the very next man who got drunk was a band sergeant in my own regiment&mdash;a man of irreproachable character, who was never brought up in his life before for any offence; a man whom everybody liked.  It chanced there was some rum left over after distribution, and it was put into his room.  He was unwise enough to take some of it, and unfortunately he got drunk.  No one in the circumstances would have ordered him to be flogged, but it was imperative, and he was actually brought out and flogged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole regiment shuddered at that What happened?  The soldier who had been flogged recovered, I suppose, from the physical punishment, but he died a month or two afterwards, not from the effects of the physical blows he received, but I suppose on account of the horror of a man of his hitherto irreproachable character being flogged.  When flogging is made imperative, a case such as I have mentioned is bound to happen.  The <Col N="1679" /> cases that you do not want to happen will happen.</P>
    <P>I object strongly to the mandatory use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; more than to anything else in the section.  As one who has seen the cat used, I object to its use in this country.  I have no sympathy with the people who do the things that the Minister complains of.  I do not excuse these things for a moment, because I have suffered from them&mdash;from burnings and everything else&mdash;just as much as anybody, but from my experience of flogging I could not agree to resort to it as a penalty or a punishment for these crimes. I do not believe it will do any good, but rather that it will do a lot of harm.  It is because of my experience of it in other places, and because I think it will do a great deal of harm, that I appeal to the Seanad not to pass this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this Section of the Bill.  We are told that flogging is a desperate thing, and no doubt it is.  We have been told that to view its infliction causes almost as much pain to the onlooker as to the person who has to inflict it.  But we have got to look at the other side of the picture and to think of the crimes which it is sought to blot out, the type of crimes which, as the Minister told us, were unknown in Ireland until within the last year or two, crimes from which everybody has suffered, including the youngest child, the oldest man, or the weakest woman.  We know that some delicate women have been robbed in their own homes of the few miserable pounds, amounting in most cases to five or six pounds, which they had got together to pay the expenses of their burial.  The money was taken from them at the point of the gun, and that happened in Ireland, which we all thought was a place fit for honest men to live in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because I feel that honest men cannot live in this country until these crimes are put down that I am in favour of flogging.  I have no sympathy for the man who goes out with a gun and holds me up, or who holds up some poor stricken old lady in her home, or an old man on the roadside.  Because this man has a gun he holds me up, and is it because of some humanitarian sentiment that he is to go scathless?  I think that no punishment is too severe <Col N="1680" /> for such a coward, and I think it is the fear of the severe bodily infliction of pain that alone will deter him from the course of crime on which he has embarked. Flogging, we are told, and I am sure the Government has given careful consideration to this, is likely to put a stop to these grave outrages.  It is a form of crime from which this country had hitherto been immune, and I think flogging is calculated to put a stop to the violent courses of action about which we have heard so many complaints. None of us, I am sure, would like to see flogging carried out, but I am strongly in favour of this Bill, because I believe that the threat of flogging will deter these violent men and these lawless men from committing the terrible crimes which have brought so much disgrace on this country.</P>
    <P>I believe that if flogging is resorted to we will have no more garrotters and that these violent crimes will cease.  I appeal to the Seanad and to those in it who are animated by humanitarian sentiments and who talk of the right of the criminal not to allow the right of the honest decent citizen to go for nothing. I think the Seanad should help the Government to stamp out this form of crime so that a man may go on the road as he did of old with nothing to guard or protect him but his two hands.  If a man holds him up then let him make use of his hands, but I think we should have no sympathy for the cowardly man who goes out with a gun, or, worse still, with a petrol can to burn out his neighbour and to shame the face of this fair country and to make it a shambles and a place in which no one trying to uplift the country can live.  I repeat that no form of punishment is too great to stamp out that form of crime.  I believe that the method proposed by the Government is calculated to stamp it out.  I appeal strongly to the Seanad to give this Bill their serious consideration and to show that they are determined that the Government will be supported in the attempt they are making to make our country a happy and a prosperous one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to take up the time of the Seanad for any great length on this subject.  As I said on the First Reading, I am opposed to the flogging clause in this Bill, and because of that I think I ought to give my <Col N="1681" /> reasons, especially as I find them at yariance with a great deal that has been said in the other House, where there was a great deal of wild speaking with regard to flogging, especially as regards the horrors of it.  We have had, to some extent at least outside the House, pictures of certain flogging scenes.  I think it is rather important that we should realise that this particular clause, whether we are in favour of it or against it, has nothing to do with the political situation.  It deals with two forms of crime and with two types of criminals. The man who is guilty of arson is just as much an enemy of the decent Republican as he is an enemy of any particular order in the community.  I think that is a thing that ought to be understood and realised, and that nothing should be said, no matter how we may be opposed to this clause, to suggest that it has anything to do with the political situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been interested for a considerable time in the question of prison reform. Many of my co-religionists have also taken an interest in the question for a great many years.  From a study of this question of prison reform I find from the reports of the prison authorities that instead of flogging leading to a reform of the criminal, that the men who are flogged come back again and are flogged, and that they prefer flogging to imprisonment.  The report of a prison authority that I consulted was that flogging was not a deterrent, but that it had a more brutalising effect on the criminal.  I find the opinion of prison authorities to be that you make a man worse by flogging.  The reason why I am opposed to this clause is not from feelings of sentiment, but simply because I do honestly and sincerely feel it is a blunder to introduce such a punishment. I am not so optimistic as to believe but that some sentences will have to be carried out.  I believe that after six months you may have brutalised and made worse this particular type of criminal for whom we have no sympathy; that is my main reason against flogging as flogging.  But in Ireland there is one other reason and more important than that.  I am not concerned with sentiment, and frankly I have not got sentiment, but unless I entirely mistake <Col N="1682" /> feeling outside there is sentimental objection to this.</P>
    <P>I want, if possible to have punishment for people who commit those crimes, especially the worst crimes, against public safety.  I want to try and secure that there should be no sympathy for them anywhere, but I have really a genuine fear that you will create for them sympathy which is false and undeserved.  I know there is no majority against this clause, but as I am against flogging I thought it was only right that I should state my reasons for that attitude to the Seanad</P>
    <Speaker pid="EarlofMayo" hpid="The EARL of MAYO The EARL of MAYO">
      <NameTxt>The EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the greatest respect for Senator Douglas's feelings, and for the feelings of that great religious body to which he belongs which has always carried out its tenets even in the times of the greatest persecution. That is ancient history now, but it is none the less true, that they have always stood up and objected to this form of flogging.</P>
      <P>But I now turn to the statement that has been made by Colonel Moore.  There is quite a different state of affairs.  The person that he was talking of was on active service.  He was a soldier put in charge of spirits in his own tent.  He drank these spirits.  Remember that on active service you have to act in an active manner, or else all discipline vanishes once and for ever.  I know that case. Questions were asked on the other side about it, and it is well known to the military authorities over there.  It is as well known as Colonel Moore knows it, and, therefore, my belief is that where you have to deal with the crimes that are specialised in the Schedule of the Bill, which are serious crimes, you must have a serious punishment.  I shall vote for the retention of the clause.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardMacLysaght" hpid="Mr. MacLYSAGHT Mr. MacLYSAGHT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLYSAGHT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that this punishment is of sufficient value as a deterrent to make the end justify the means, but, apart from that, punishment already exists for crimes of violence, and Senator Bennett's great eloquence was really wasted when he was talking about garrotters, because the existing law already empowers the flogging of such people.  Beyond that, this particular question of flogging has an exceedingly bad history in Ireland, and anything that is going to give this Government any complexion of Greenwoodism <Col N="1683" /> is a thing I shall vote against every time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments that lead me to support the Government in this matter are somewhat different from those I have already heard.  As it presents itself to me, to carry this amendment is to carry a vote of no confidence in the Government, and I, for one, will not share that resposibility.  If it were a question of an enactment for all time I would give some consideration to it, although I might not necessarily agree with the arguments advanced by Senator Douglas.  But when it is undoubtedly a national crisis, when it is to all intents and purposes a state of war, and when the Government have a great and serious responsibility cast upon them I consider that this House must think more than once, and think with great deliberation and with a full sense of their responsibility, before they refuse to support that Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CorneliusIrwin" hpid="Mr. IRWIN Mr. IRWIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. IRWIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the suggestion to suspend this Section?  Some of us feel very keenly on this Clause, and for reasons that can be imagined better than described in words.  If the Minister said that to quell disorder he needed more men, more guns, or more munitions, he would get them; but if he said: &ldquo;To quell disorder I want the right to use the dum-dum bullet,&rdquo; he would not get it, because it would be against all the principles of the people, and against international usage to do so.  I have supported the Second Reading of this Bill, and I would like to support and give the Minister every possible assistance, but I pause at this.  I regard it as the dumdum bullet of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think also that the Minister underrates his great achievement in the country.  The people have the profoundest respect for his Courts, for his Justices and for his Civic Guards, and his powerful address on the Second Reading of this Bill contained references which were very touching, to the quiet, decent people generally in the country. <Col N="1684" /> I am convinced that the Minister was thinking of these quiet, decent people when he brought in this clause, but I assure him that the quiet, decent people are satisfied with what he has done.  They have the utmost confidence in him.  They can go about their daily work; the roads are open; they can carry on their business, and even when night-time comes they retire to rest with the utmost confidence in the great organisation that he has established.  I hope that he will see some way out of this difficulty, and perhaps adopt the suggestion I have made, to suspend this clause for the present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to associate myself with the excellent tone of the last Senator's speech.  I think, on the other hand, we should be indebted to Sir John Keane for the honest admission as to why he is going to support this section.  He frankly admits that although he would object to it in other respects, because a vote against it might be taken as a vote of no confidence in the Government he is going to support it.  I would respectfully suggest that that is a deplorable state of affairs&mdash;that a responsible Assembly should pass legislation which inwardly and outwardly it condemns simply because to alter or amend it might be taken as a vote of no confidence in the Government.  I think it would be doing a far better service for the Government if the Assembly would make that Government representative by only authorising it to act in accordance with the wishes of the Assembly itself.  I notice that women are not to come under the provisions of this section.  Why are women omitted?  Is that not in itself an admission that the punishment must be very brutalising and of a terrible character, and has it not been admitted that these women have been the chief organisers of arson, robbery under arms, and so forth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated particularly, and I agree, that those who aid and abet these crimes are as responsible, and in some cases more responsible, and guilty than the people who actually do the work. They send out an ignorant, uneducated country boy to carry out these fiendish acts, and they escape the lash, while the fool who carries out their instructions comes under it.  We all feel the enormity of the crimes, and, far from stating that flogging is too severe, I would say that <Col N="1685" /> for some of the crimes it is not severe enough; but you cannot always devise a punishment to fit the crime.  It is well known that there are some crimes so fiendish that it is not possible in any civilised land to devise a punishment sufficiently terrible to meet them.  Therefore it is impossible to try to go on inventing tortures of one kind or another to fit certain crimes.  One of the great causes of the dissolute character of the people during the past few years has been the difficulty of inflicting punishment at all.  The very fact that they knew they would not be arrested, that nobody would come forward to give evidence, and so forth, were the chief contributing causes, and the Minister has said that it has been impossible to bring people to trial because witnesses will not come forward.  Does he for a moment imagine that he is going to improve that position when, if these witnesses give evidence, the punishment will be the lash?  I think it is far less likely that he will get witnesses in these circumstances than if the punishment were of some other character.</P>
    <P>The point that this will act as a preventive has been stressed, and I do not want to go into that beyond saying a few words on it.  It is really a question of the effect upon the mentality of the prisoner himself.  You may break him and crush his body, but you certainly brutalise his spirit.  You send him out after that flogging, the enemy of mankind, his hand against every man, and he is far less likely to become a good citizen than if he had only received the treatment of penal servitude. Then, of course, there is the all-important question of the effect upon the population as a whole, but particularly upon these men who are called upon to inflict this punishment.  We have very eminent authorities upon this effect, and some of them are worth quoting.</P>
    <P>Mr. Llwellyn Williams, the Welsh M.P., says:&mdash;&ldquo;I saw a warder administering twelve lashes with the &lsquo;cat.&rsquo; At first he shrank from administering it, but after four or five lashes had been laid on the naked back, and blood was squirting from it, that warder, instead of shrinking from his task, seemed to be taken with a blood-lust, and could hardly stop himself from inflicting the punishment. A more brutalising thing never happened in my experience.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The author of &ldquo;Crime&rdquo; said:&mdash;&ldquo;It <Col N="1686" /> is far from an agreeable task to watch the face and figure of the flogger as he executes the sentence; and few would deny that the moral effect upon him must be as great as upon the criminal whom it is his duty to whip.  The State, when it sanctions the use of the lash, causes a human being to do just such an act of violence as it desires to check.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have the most convincing statement from De Quincy, where he says:&mdash;&ldquo;Corporal punishment is usually argued with a single reference to the case of him who suffers it, and so argued, God knows that it is worthy of all abhorrence; but the weightiest argument against it is the foul indignity which is offered to our common nature lodged in the person of him on whom it is inflicted.  His nature is our nature; and supposing it possible that he were so far degraded as to be unsusceptible of any influences but those which address him through the brutal part of his nature, yet for the sake of ourselves&mdash;no, not merely for ourselves, or for the human race now existing, but for the sake of human nature, which transcends all existing participators of that nature&mdash;we should remember that the evil of corporal punishment is not to be measured by the poor transitory criminal, whose memory and offence are soon to perish; these, in the sum of things, are as nothing, the injury which can be done him, and the injury which he can do, have so momentary an existence that they may be safely neglected; but the abiding injury is to the most august interest which for the mind of man can have any existence&mdash;viz., to his own nature; to raise and dignify which, I am persuaded, is the first, last, and holiest command which the conscience imposes on the philosophic moralist.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have, therefore, to consider not only its effect upon the unfortunate wretched dupe, the criminal himself, but its effect upon those who have to inflict the punishment and inflict its effect finally upon the community as a whole.  Senator Irwin has referred to the splendid improvement that has taken place, and the success that has attended the efforts of the Minister.  I would appeal to him not to destroy the effect of these efforts, and the success that has attended the restoration of order throughout the country by trying to do too much in introducing this retrograde and brutalising <Col N="1687" /> section into this measure at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words in support of this clause.  I think this Seanad ought to remember that this country was, a very short time ago, very nearly brought to the verge of ruin through robbery under arms and arson.  What stopped that?  That the country was not ruined was simply due to the resolute action taken by the Government. Theirs was the responsibility, and they did stop the thing very largely. They are in a much better position to judge than we are of the chances of the campaign of robbery under arms and arson breaking out again, and it is their duty, and the duty of the next Government that comes in, to keep on trying to prevent the ruin of the country.  I am quite prepared to take the Government's judgment on the point of this particular form of punishment being calculated to deter this particular form of crime.  The Bill is only a temporary measure.  It is to deal with a most desperate evil, and I think that we owe the Government a deep debt of gratitude for having so far cured this thing, as they have cured it, and I think our duty is to support them until we have really arrived at the stage when robbery under arms and arson are not things that may at any moment break out in this country.</P>

      <P>I would like to say one word in reply to what the Earl of Mayo stated.  I want to point out that the result of those things that I described and that Lord Mayo mentioned was that all the Army officers, Generals and all, were so horrified about the whole affair that shortly afterwards flogging was abolished in the Army.  I think that wipes out anything he said on that point. Everybody was shocked and horrified, and the result was that very soon afterwards a Bill was passed abolishing flogging, which is now, I am sorry to say, being revived in this country.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a few words about the Senators who have objected to the brutality of the punishment of flogging on the person who is punished and the man who inflicts the punishment.  Do they ever-think of the brutality of the miscreants, boys many of them, who in the <Col N="1688" /> dead of night break into the houses of the unfortunate farmers, who are not able to defend themselves, and steal their money, watches, and trinkets?  They are simply pure burglars.  My county, Queen's County, until last year was one of the most peaceful in the whole of Ireland, yet, from what cause I do not know, we had as bad a campaign of robberies and midnight attacks on the unfortunate people as in any part of Ireland. People were not in a position to resist. They gave up their goods, because if they did not they would have been shot.  I do not believe that the men who did this were Queen's County men; they may have come from other parts of Ireland. I do not know; but there they were carrying on this campaign.  I have seen women shaking for almost twenty-four hours with the terror caused by these men.  One woman, through the shriek she uttered, got rid of the robbers, but it was at the expense of her health.  If these people do not commit these crimes there will be no punishment.  I quite admit the country is in a different state from what it was a year ago, and that it is entirely due to the determination shown by the Ministry.  They are in a position to know more than we do, and it is not to be supposed that they would bring in a Bill like this unless it was absolutely necessary.  It is absolutely essential that they should have these powers.  We know they will not exercise them unless it is necessary.  The knowledge that this punishment is hanging over these people will stop these crimes, and there will be no necessity to administer the lash.  I hope that is so, but for the time being I do not see how we can refuse to give the Government support.</P>

      <P>We once had a leader in this country, and greatly respected by the country, who opposed the Flogging Bill of 1878.  I refer to Charles Stewart Parnell of revered memory, although perhaps of mistaken politics.  He said, &ldquo;This flogging is an evil thing, and has been used at all times by tyrants for purposes of their own, and so long as it remains it will continue to be used in an unlawful and evil manner.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Seventy-five per cent. of the European countries have abandoned flogging, and with their experience of flogging they did not abandon it without just cause.  I think the Bill, if necessary, could be passed without dissent from any part of the House if this great blot was removed.  Every man who has come into the Seanad, and every man in the Dáil, has come in with the intention of helping the Government to the best of their ability.  Their actions might be disguised, but their motives cannot be impeached. It is said that there are two chief reasons for inflicting this punishment.  One is that it acts as a deterrent.  We know that it has absolutely failed as a deterrent. It is on record, and could be proved, that men who have been flogged for certain crimes have come back in three months, and have been flogged again for the same crime.  The effect on the man I need not refer to, but the effect on common humanity is of a most demoralising character.  We speak here for a great number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard their opinions; they may be ignorant opinions, ill-advised or wrong opinions; and it is the common opinion of the great mass of the people that the Government is doing a wrong and a bad thing in retaining this clause in the Bill.  It has created an amount of opposition, and if we sat here without protesting against that Bill, we need not go back and say we represent the feelings of the great mass of people.  At the moment of flogging all the concentrated and evil passions of a lifetime are embodied. It is said that the whip does not cut.  I have heard people talking here of and comparing it to the thrashing of a boy at school. Thrashing has an ill flavour about it.  Not alone is physical torture endured during the punishment, but the mental terror is something that cannot be described.  All the evil passions connected with the sin and crime of evil days is associated in men's minds with <Col N="1690" /> this flogging Bill.  We may be called sentimentalists; but what if we are called sentimentalists?  I maintain that it is sentimentalism of a kind that does credit to the best that is in human nature. As a rule, flogging may be of two kinds. It may be merely vindictive, on that outworn principle of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, or it may be deterrent.</P>
    <P>In regard to the deterrent aspect, dozens of Senators have already spoken, but the vindictiveness is what will tell against this Government.  There are two classes of people to whom this punishment may apply.  Some of those who are taken up for robbery under arms may, perhaps, be guilty of that robbery on account of political fanaticism.  It it quite possible that may happen.  Their guides may tell them to do certain things, to rob a man at the point of the gun, and these foolish people may do it.  They are innocent of any crime in their souls, and yet they suffer for the sins of others. It is quite possible that instances of that kind may occur if this clause is put into force.  It is said, give the lash a trial. It has been tried, and proved a failure.</P>
    <P>One of our present troubles is that criminals escape detection.  I maintain that that trouble will be aggravated if power to flog is retained in the Bill.  The very fact that this hideous form of punishment will be inflicted upon a criminal will create a certain amount of sympathy in the popular mind with that criminal. Our people are, perhaps, peculiarly constituted in that way.  They have always been fighting against the Government of the day.  Let the Government of to-day take care that the same spirit does not again take possession of the people, and that the same fight and the same ideas that prompted the fight may not work very much to the detriment of the Government. Most of the Senators who have spoken here have drawn a very lurid picture of the frightful happenings in this country.  The Minister and his Government, with the co-operation of the great mass of people, have restored a state of security from extreme turmoil. Is there any reason to believe that at this time, when they have secured that strong position, notwithstanding all the threats we hear from certain quarters&mdash;threats, I think, that are disregarded by everyone&mdash;is it possible at this moment they find it necessary to introduce a punishment <Col N="1691" /> that is abandoned by 75 per cent. of the countries of Europe?  I strongly appeal to the Minister, and I strongly support the suggestion, which I think is a very useful and fair one, made by Senator Irwin that the Minister should hold that clause, say, in abeyance for a few months, and if he finds that crime is continuing he may possibly find a different atmosphere in the country and in this House towards this Bill.  This Seanad is supposed to be a check to hasty legislation in the Lower House.  I appeal strongly to Senators to see to it that they will honestly discharge that duty, and that they will not merely back and support Bills because to do otherwise may be taken as a vote of censure on the Government. If it were a vote of censure on the Government, and if it would be a damage to their chances of keeping order in the country, I venture to say that few in this House would vote against the strongest measure; but the suspension of that clause for a period would not be considered as showing any lack of confidence in the Government, who have done wonders in the face of great difficulties in bringing this country to its present position.</P>

      <P>When listening to the Senator who has just sat down, and to Senator Irwin describing the condition to which the Government has brought the country, it occurred to me that I read in the paper the other day that the spirit of arson is still active.  I thought I read that down in Waterford there were five or six burnings within the last few days.  Senator O'Farrell, when speaking, seemed to think that the women were more deserving of the whip than men.  I want to say if Senator O'Farrell will introduce an amendment into this Bill to whip women I will support him.</P>

      <P>I did not wilfully intend to misrepresent the Senator, but whether it is women or men I do not understand this indignation against whipping those who are guilty of robbery under arms or of arson, nor do I understand <Col N="1692" /> Senators who claim to denounce crime reserving all their consideration and all their pity for the backs of the robber and the users of the petrol can, and forgetting all about the sufferings of their victims.  They expatiate very eloquently on the brutality of flogging, but they are strangely silent about the brutality of the offences for which flogging is administered.  We have heard parallels brought into this affair.  We have heard what Charles Stewart Parnell said about flogging.  On the Second Reading we heard Senator McPartlin eloquently denouncing flogging, and recalling the parallel of '98.  I say it is an outrage on history to recall '98, and endeavour to make it a parallel with the present case.  One would think to hear him denonunce flogging that the present Government were the lineal descendants of Castlereagh and Pitt in the flogging of patriotic Irishmen.  Whom is it proposed to flog?  Who are the patriotic Irishmen?  The men who rob weak women and who set fire to humble dwellings, who set trains in motion with women and children on board.  I say it is an outrage to suggest that it has any parallel with '98.  It is ludicrous to suggest that if our great grandfathers were flogged by tyrants in '98, that we should refuse to flog criminals now.  Senator O'Farrell told us the other day that it was both ludicrous and extraordinary for Senators to support the Government in this Bill.  I say it is neither ludicrous nor extraordinary to support what is right.  The results have proved that the Government and the methods that the Government adopted have been right, and that the prophets of evil who told the Government that they were leading to disaster and that the country would not stand them were wrong.  We are now coolly invited to throw over a policy which has been proven to be right, and adopt a policy of experiment in what Senator Douglas would call &ldquo;spiritual reclamation.&rdquo; But I would ask the Senators to consider where their action in so vigorously opposing this Bill leads them.  They may repudiate crime or any sympathy with crime.  I have no doubt that they do so quite sincerely.  But have they considered what effect their action here will have on the criminal mind? Do they not think that the criminal will think that he has men in the Seanad and the Dáil who will make a big fight to <Col N="1693" /> lessen his punishment and to save his back?  When these people see that there are such men here they will think that their crime has a sort of popular approval, and that, at all events, it does not deserve the cruel punishment which this tyrannical Government proposes to inflict on them.  The Minister for Home Affairs the other day said that the Labour Party were the last in this House who should oppose this Bill.  I thought so, too, especially when I remembered what happened to one of their own class within the last seven or eight weeks.  It is a very mild case compared with others that have occurred in this country within the past twelve months, but it is sufficient to convince me, as I hope it will convince our friends on the Labour benches, of their misspent energies in opposing flogging.  It was the case of a young married man who had lost his employment through the premises in which he was employed here in Dublin being burned last July.  He had been idle for seven or eight months.  He got employment as an insurance inspector, and in order to supplement his small salary by saving his railway fare, as he had to go to the country once or twice a week he borrowed the price of a bicycle.  When riding seven or eight miles outside the town of Tullamore he was held up by three armed ruffians who took the bicycle from him, as well as the few shillings he was bringing home to a sick wife, and left him on a lonely countryside without the price of a night's lodging or the price of a telegram to send to his wife who was waiting and expecting his return.  That poor man as a result of the shocking sufferings he had undergone was in bed three or four weeks and his wife, who was a confirmed invalid, got a great set-back.  I would ask the Senators to put themselves in the position of that poor man and ask themselves whether his suffering and his mental torture on the loss he sustained were less excruciating than the physical sufferings that his assailants would have to undergo if they had been caught and flogged.  I would ask the Labour Party that.  I know that if they went to that man and asked him what he thought about flogging he would tell them that he would suffer twenty lashes to get back his bicycle and his money.  He would also tell them that he believed the <Col N="1694" /> Labour Party could direct their eneriges more usefully for the people they represent than framing amendments here and trying to save the backs of the robbers.</P>

      <P>I think, sir, in listening to the debate that has gone on so far that in spite of a good many irrelevancies and outside matters brought in to try and influence the mind of the Senators that the whole tone of the debate has undoubtedly shown that the Senators are trying themselves to see what way their votes ought to go and that they are judging this clause entirely on its merits.  Undoubtedly Senator Colonel Moore has brought in the Army and a particularly bad case.  If we were dealing with flogging as applied to the Army his speech would have been relevant, but I hardly think that that part of his speech applies at all.  We are not dealing with disciplined men or looking at their class of mentality. Senator Douglas has introduced what I may call the habitual criminal.  I daresay that he may be right; if a man is a hardened habitual criminal flogging does not affect him.  Still I cannot forget as far as they are concerned that when I was young there was an epidemic of garrotting.  That epidemic of garotting was most undoubtedly put down by the application of the lash.  I believe that that is a fact.  I do not think that either of these cases applies to the problem before the Seanad at the present time.  What we are dealing with is a state of practical anarchy.  Of course if the country is at peace, if as so many of my friends opposite seem to think we are going to have peace from arson and peace from robbery under arms then we need not bother our heads how we vote in this matter.  The problem that is before this Seanad is that we are not going to have peace and that we will have to deal with robbery under arms and with arson.  If that is the case we will have to think for ourselves where we will be if it breaks out and if we have refused to pass this clause.  What strikes me in looking back over the last few months is this, there was, I believe, a very difficult state of crime in the country. Banks, private persons and others were being robbed and the situation had got out of the control of the political parties. No one in my position could know how <Col N="1695" /> much of it was due to political advice from leaders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think all the Senators will agree that there was an element of private gain being brought in, and that the robbers who were robbing under arms were not robbing under political leaders and for political purposes, but for their own private gain.  That arose from the bad conditions we have had in the country for the past couple of years or more. That is what this clause is meant to put down.  There is no question about it, the class of robber we are attacking now is a product of the times.  This is a class of crime that was practically unknown in Ireland up to this.  I have been always astonished that in the extraordinary conditions we have had in Ireland there has not been ten times more of this class of crime than we have had. We have seen the authorities who have to deal with these offences using death as a penalty.  I think that death is a horrible way of dealing with crime at all.  I agree largely with Senator Douglas that in cases of robbery under arms and of arson the old law that the man who takes life shall lose his life does not apply.  If this clause will deal with the situation and prevent that final penalty being inflicted in the future, as it has been inflicted in the past, I think we are compelled to come to the conclusion that it is wise to pass it.  That is one of the things that has the greatest effect upon me.  It is a penalty which apparently frightens the coward.  Undoubtedly the people who apply the petrol can and use arms against unarmed people are cowards.  As far as I can see, when you are dealing with cowards physical pain has a great effect. I am not going into the question as to the pictures which have been drawn in the course of the debate.  I think a man who puts a pistol at the head of a woman and who robs her deserves all he can get. If the penalty of flogging will frighten the class of individual that we are all afraid will become a pest in the country, and save the Government of the day from having to use the death penalty as the only resource, then I say we should undoubtedly pass this clause.  Those are some of the reasons which have influenced me.  When the danger is in front of us it will be too late to provide the penalty.  If it is a real deterrent, as I believe it will be, and if the country is <Col N="1696" /> going to be, as we all hope, a peaceful country, the crime will not occur, the penalty will not be needed, and those who would be likely to commit the crime will be deterred by knowing what they would get.  In passing this clause the Seanad will undoubtedly add to the future peace of the country.</P>

      <P>You suggested that this accident of arson or robbery under arms might happen to anybody.  Other Senators spoke in much the same strain. I simply from the first had to visualise those two offences as offences that were undermining society here, undermining the hope of future prosperity, and I had to choose between consideration for the criminal, consideration for the decent people of the country, and consideration for this thing that is trying so hard to be an Irish nation.  Senators need not assume that those who favour this clause, and those who stand very fully for all the provisions of the Bill, are devoid of finer feeling or humanitarian feeling. There is this aspect, too.  This Bill is for criminals.  It is for all criminals.  It is as much for the criminals who happen to think that Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith did right when they signed the Treaty as for the criminals who happen to think that they did wrong.  We are faced now with the aftermath of our own revolt against the British and this last mad revolt against the majority will of this country, and to a certain extent we are faced with the aftermath of the world war.  It is no use to point to countries elsewhere and say that they decided that they could get along without this penalty of corporal punishment.  They did so because they had evolved a condition of civilisation, stability, and of decency of life that enabled them to do without it. I hope we will evolve that, too.  But we have to face the fact that society and civilisation here have taken a definite backward step, and we have to take a definite backward step with our penalties <Col N="1697" /> that will enable us to meet that situation. There was a time when these crimes were not prevalent in the country. They are prevalent now.  If Senators can so stretch their imagination as to imagine the primitive man and the savage gaining predominance within themselves, and they were conscious of a temptation to rob or burn their neighbour's house in a spirit of wantonness, I would ask them to put themselves the question whether they would be more deterred by the prospect of a couple of months' imprisonment or by the prospect of the lash.  That is a fair question.  It is perfectly relevant.  I want Senators to say whether they would be deterred more by the couple of months' imprisonment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A year if you like, or two years if you like.  I ask whether they would be more deterred by two years' imprisonment with the lash or two years' imprisonment without the lash? When I speak of a deterrent I do not mean so much a deterrent to the man who has committed crime from doing it again, but a deterrent to the prospective criminal&mdash;the man who is turning over in his mind whether he ought to go out and burn his neighbour's house.  Take the man who has committed this crime and who has suffered the penalty.  I ask Senators to ask themselves whether the man who has undergone merely a term of imprisonment is less likely to repeat this crime than the man who has suffered the lash plus a term of imprisonment. This is a question that must be faced in a spirit of realism, that must be faced with a recognition of the fact that the savage and primitive instinct has got the upper hand here, and that it must be grappled with, with the methods that have always been used to grapple with savage and elemental passions.  These <Col N="1698" /> methods were only laid aside when these savage passions disappeared.  No man facing a primary responsibility in the Executive Council for security here, for order, and for decency of life would remain in that position if he were told that he could rely only on incarceration as a penalty and a deterrent.  I want Senators to understand clearly that if the Dáil were to take the line that incarceration, and incarceration alone, were sufficient to deal with those crimes in the country, then I would ask the Dáil to find some other man to take the primary responsibility for order here.</P>

      <P>I move: In line 29 to delete the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and to substitute therefor &ldquo;may.&rdquo; This amendment deals with the whole point of the Section, because the ordinary law provides for flogging and the Court has jurisdiction in this respect.  But the Bill deprives the Court of this.  This brings us back to the position we were in when we were discussing the provisions of this measure last evening.  The Court shall inflict certain punishment. Apart from the whole question of the desirability of flogging, we must consider in this amendment whether or not the Courts are practically open to inflict a penalty.  The Minister in his concluding remarks suggested that unless those powers were given he would not accept responsibility or that he would not hold office as a Minister.  I suggest there was no necessity for the Minister to make such a statement, because the existing law provides that such a punishment may be given.  There was no necessity for using that argument, because it is already provided.</P>
      <P>I have never been in sympathy with a man who robbed, and I think it is pretty well known that I never had any sympathy with any person who robbed. At the same time there is more to be considered than the person guilty of the crime.  The Minister said that the present state of unrest is due to various causes, and the first was the European war. Then men were brutalised; they were engendered with a blood lust.  There was no respect for human life.  They were taught those things and the flower of the manhood of the country was drenched in blood in the fields of Gallipoli and Flanders.  All the finer feelings were crowded down by this terrible system. We have now all the aftermath of that. The revolt against the British in this country begot it.  We know that the young boys and men in this country were got into a military spirit and had to obey orders.  I do not suggest for a moment that any of the young men who were in the Army fighting for the independence of this country would be guilty of holding up a citizen of this country for the purpose of robbery.</P>
      <P>I do not suggest that any man who fought for the independence of his country would burn down the home of his neighbour for the mere fact of burning it down.  At the same time I say it is wrong and unjust to pass this measure. I say that the powers are already there to deal with the criminals of this country and that there is no necessity to put this provision in.  Notwithstanding the lecture we got from Senator McLoughlin as to the duties of the Labour Party we know our duty.  Will the supporters of this measure witness the first application of this section?  Will their feelings not revolt at the flogging of people, and are we not to think of the mothers and the fathers of those who may be guilty of those crimes?  Many a good father and a good mother reared a bad son.  What will be the feelings of the father or the mother, particularly the mother, when she knows that her boy is going to suffer the lash?  There is no necessity for inserting this clause in the Bill as it stands.  I hear some of the members of the Seanad talking about meting out punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sometimes think that we all, at some period of our lives, have done some things we ought not to have done, and <Col N="1701" /> I hope when we go, after our span of life has passed, and appear before the all merciful and all powerful Judge that He will be more merciful and take a more merciful view of our crimes than some of the members who have spoken. I do not suggest that I have any sympathy with those crimes, but my whole nature revolts against the thought of flogging.  The people in this country are not bad at heart.  I have faith in them.  I believe this robbery is the result of the terrible times we lived in for the last seven or eight years and will pass away.  I think it would be much better for the fair name of our country if this clause were not passed.  The Minister may have more knowledge than I have. The only knowledge I have is from meeting a great many people in different parts of the country.  I am satisfied we ought to take a brighter view of the future.</P>

      <P>It is as well that Senators considering this amendment should read carefully the Section as it stands.  There is a latitude left in that section to the court, if it is of opinion that there are mitigating circumstances, not to impose that penalty.  I do not myself see at the moment what the mitigating circumstances of arson or robbery under arms might be, but if in the opinion of the court there are mitigating circumstances, then the subsection as it stands leaves the discretion of the court to act accordingly.  The Senator who spoke to the amendment waxed eloquent on the shock it would be to the finer feelings of Senators to witness an infliction of this punishment. There are many things that are necessary and that people do not rush to see taking place.  An operation for cancer, I take it, is not a particularly pleasant thing to look at, and people, except those who are compelled by the nature of their calling to witness those things, prefer not to witness them.  There is a cancer in the body politic, the cancer of those two crimes, and I have never felt apologetic about the method which I recommend that those crimes be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it will be a deterrent.  I believe the fact that those penalties are embodied in this Bill will decide many people who would otherwise rob and burn, not to rob and burn.  It is urgently necessary and vital that people be stayed <Col N="1702" /> from those two crimes.  I do not want to play the financier, but this country at the moment is on the market looking for money, and people who are asked to lend money are not as a rule sentimentalists. They ask practical questions: &ldquo;Does your writ run in every square mile of your jurisdiction, or does it run with a limp?  Is there security for life and property within your territory?  Is there an atmosphere in which a man can invest with reasonable prospect of return, in which men can sow with hopes of reaping?&rdquo; These are practical questions, and the position of this country is that it is on the market, that it must borrow, and borrow largely, to meet the deficit created by the idealists of the last twelve months. I hope some day to be in opposition.  It is a splendid position as you can have it every way.  You can say, &ldquo;When are you going ahead with your drainage and reconstruction schemes?  What about unemployment?  What about housing? When are you going to bring in a Town Tenants' Bill on the lines of the Land Bill?&rdquo; It all means money.</P>
    <P>There are only two means of raising money, from the pockets of the people, or by temporary borrowing with certain prospect of redemption.  I do not know why the Senator suggests that we ought to raise twenty or thirty millions from the pockets of the people.  I take it the general view would be in favour of temporary borrowing.  We must have conditions which attract capital and not conditions which frighten away prospective lenders.  If you have, up and down the country, business places, private homes, post offices, banks and so on, being robbed at the point of the gun, and if you have the material resources of the country being sent up in smoke by the midnight torch, then you cannot go decently before the world looking for money.  This thing is the merest mechanism of Government.  Your writ must run and there must be reasonable protection for citizens, for their person, for their property, before you can go out on the money markets of the world for a loan for reconstruction or anything else, or even for payment of compensation to those who have suffered during the last twelve months.</P>
    <P>There are views that this penalty is a deterrent one, and there are people who want to have it both ways.  On the one <Col N="1703" /> hand, we are told that it is a savage torture, and we are told in the next breath that criminals look forward to it so much that they come back for it again.  One of those things is true and one is false.  Either it is a very drastic, stringent penalty of which men stand in dread, or it is something they like and come looking for again.  All the time I am not thinking of the men who are actually committing one or other of those crimes, but of the man who is turning either way, whether he ought or ought not to commit them.  I think by making it a pretty certain penalty following the offence, as the shadow follows the substance, that you will deter the young people through the country who are wondering whether they ought to burn A.B.'s house or rob a post office in the village.  There is scope left in the Bill for the exercise of certain discretion.  If, in the opinion of the court, there are mitigating circumstances the court can act accordingly.  If there are not mitigating circumstances, we here in our position of responsibility have the courage to say that, normally, in a routine way and in the absence of mitigating circumstances that penalty shall attach to those offences, at least for six months, and the next six months are going to mean life or death for the Irish nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to Senator Farren in introducing the amendment.  One could not fail to be struck by the earnestness of his appeal and the sincerity of his desire to exclude this clause from the Bill.  I, too, tried to picture a man being flogged, with the blood streaming from his back and all the other horrors.  I had another picture on the other side of an old man or woman being flogged, his property being taken, and his life being threatened. Which of the two, if I had been there, would I go to save?  Would I go to stop the man from being flogged, or relieve the man from being robbed?  I would have no hesitation in saving, in the first instance, the man whose life was in danger from the criminal.  If that be so I think the argument for flogging is sustained.  Senator Farren obviously desires and believes that flogging should not take place, but in this particular section by the substitution of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; for &ldquo;shall,&rdquo; if such change be made, the probability that flogging will <Col N="1704" /> take place is increased.  That would not be so if we had followed out the lines suggested by the Minister, that the certainty that flogging was to take place, was likely to be a deterrent to the crime. I feel, if you substitute &ldquo;may&rdquo; for &ldquo;shall,&rdquo; you will have your fiend who goes to rob with violence or to burn saying, &ldquo;God is good and there are kindhearted people in this world.&rdquo; He will take what to him is a sporting chance. For that reason I shall oppose the amendment, because I believe if it is carried, the chances are that flogging will be greatly increased.</P>

      <P>Most of the discussion seems to be altogether outside the amendment, because it has been a repetition of the discussion on previous amendments.  It is quite evident that the Minister and some of the Senators are somewhat uneasy in their own consciences and are rather afraid of their actions, which they have no time to justify by their arguments.  The arguments advanced by Senator Bennett would apply equally to all the law of the land. There are various crimes and punitive provisions of various crimes, and in every case the Judge has discretionary powers.  No one will allege that these powers are being abused by any judges or the fact that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would not act as a deterrent.  There seems to be a glory taken in reversing the ordinary procedure of law as far as this Bill is concerned. There has been a great deal of boasting of the progress made in the restoration of order.  The Minister talks about the necessity of restoring national and international confidence, but I put it to him when outsiders are told that the conditions of the country are so disturbed that Parliament found it necessary to impose a measure of this kind which makes it compulsory on the judge to inflict the lash it is a question of opinion as to whether or not if we pass this Bill it will act as an alarm signal to the nation rather than an indication that we are approaching better times.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill I tried to point out that on account of this flogging section we would oppose the whole Bill.  We believed that it would not have the <Col N="1705" /> effect the Government desired, but quite the reverse, and that it would revive bitter memories in the minds of the Irish people and make the Government unpopular with the great masses of the people.  I also complained of the manner in which this Bill was rushed and that we had no opportunity for considering it.  I am against flogging; I do not believe in it.  Since I saw this amendment in print I considered that it might be thought that I would favour flogging if it were done on a lesser scale.  I would not.

Whether the amendment is accepted or not I do not know. <Col N="1706" /> The threats of Ministers to resign will not make me change my opinion; they leave me untouched.  I do not think many of the Senators were affected by it.

A man who robs must be assumed to have reached the use of reason, and if it is right that criminals should receive corporal punishment, then the degree should be something different from that dealt out to boys and the wording of the section as it stands is simply the wording of all sections in previous legislation dealing with corporal punishment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>If the amendment were to be accepted there would be no need for this section at all.  The section is simply an extension to the whole country of a provision which already exists in the D.M.P. Act, and I submit that the conditions existing in the country make it necessary and advisable to extend the provision.  Property has been stolen on a grand scale through the country for the last year and loot of all descriptions has been taken from the houses that were burned, or that were about to be burned.  This section provides that a person can be put on proof who is reasonably suspected of having property in his possession which is not rightfully or lawfully his, and he can be asked to account for it.  I think Senators from the country with any knowledge of the conditions which have prevailed there, and which to some extent still prevail, will scarcely question the wisdom or substantial justice of Section 9.  If we were to accept the amendment which simply involves proof, then no person could be asked to account for property no matter how reasonable the suspicion that it was not his.  There would have to be definite proof of the fact that he had stolen that property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One hears of big houses being looted, <Col N="1709" /> and people bringing away furniture of all descriptions to their homes.  I heard one story from Leitrim of a man who went to a neighbouring mansion and coveted a large gilt-framed mirror and brought it home.  He found that it would not go in through his door or window, and there did not seem any practical way of getting it into his house short of taking the roof off.  He left it lying against the back of the house overnight, and his cow settled the problem next morning by driving her head and horns through the mirror.  The reports from the Civic Guards in the various areas of the country have convinced us of the necessity of inserting a section of this kind, that where people are in possession of property which is reasonably suspected of being stolen it ought to be possible to put them on their proof; to call them before a District Justice, and ask them to account for a particular piece of property, and how it came into their possession. I regret that I think to accept the amendment would seriously hamper the Executive in restoring order, and to, as great an extent as possible, making restitution of the property that has gone astray.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AliceGreen" hpid="Mrs. STOPFORD GREEN Mrs. STOPFORD GREEN">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. STOPFORD GREEN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;To add to the Section a new Sub-section (2) as follows: &ldquo;(2) A statement or admission made by any person charged with an offence under this section shall not be admissible in evidence against that person in any other criminal proceedings.&rdquo; This is simply to accentuate the view that there ought not to be any changes in the fundamental principles of the law unless absolutely necessary, and then they should be advertised as being necessary.  The first principle of the law is that a man is held innocent until he is proved to be guilty, and the Judge's duty is to see that he gets a fair trial.  This subverts the whole of that system, and puts upon a man the onus of proving his innocence before a <i>prima facie</i> charge has been brought against him.  The trouble is that he is put into the witness box, and any statement that he makes before he is charged can be used as evidence against him.  That is a profound change in the whole system of law.  What I contemplate with grave seriousness is that if it becomes known through the country that there is a <Col N="1710" /> special system of trial for certain malefactors which deprives them of the ordinary rights of common law, that this will provoke a certain indignation and resentment which ought, if possible, to be avoided.  The Minister has been so conciliatory in considering amendments that are being brought forward that I earnestly recommend this to his consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to take any very emphatic line against the amendment, but I simply want to put it &mdash;if I might use the expression&mdash;to the horse-sense of Senators as to whether the amendment ought to be accepted. If a man, say, is asked to account for a piano, and there is reasonable ground for suspecting that the piano was taken from a Senator's house, and if the man says, as against that, that &ldquo;on the night Senator X.'s house was burned and looted I was murdering A B down the road,&rdquo; should that statement or that admission be ignored to the extent of making it absolutely impossible to refer to it even in subsequent criminal proceedings for the murder of A B?  If an amendment on the lines of this amendment were accepted, I think something would be necessary to make an exception of perjury.  Otherwise a person who came before a District Justice, on being asked to account for how he came by a particular piece of property, could swear what he liked without any prospect of subsequent prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think in an emergency measure of this kind, dealing with an entirely peculiar situation, with a lifetime only of six months, that there is an excuse for departing from the ordinary fundamental principles of law which are very good and very sound in ordinary times.  One could speak for an hour or two at least on the theory that every man is innocent until proved guilty.  Under this Bill dealing with this special period we are asking for a departure from that in certain cases, so that people may be called upon to rebut what is merely a reasonable suspicion.  In the Metropolitan Police Act there is no such provision that a person who is called upon to account for a particular piece of property, and how he came by it, may not be charged in connection with a statement or admission made by him during enquiry. I would not be very emphatic <Col N="1711" /> about this amendment if it were accepted by the Seanad, and I would certainly recommend the Dáil to accept it to avoid delay and trouble.  I put it as a problem to the Senators whether there is any great reason for providing facilities for criminals to evade the law and the just sanctions of the law.  If a man, in the course of an enquiry of this kind, reveals that, although he may have come honestly by a particular piece of property, in fact he was concerned with other criminal proceedings, is there any just reason why he should not be proceeded against for that crime?</P>

      <P>The Minister, when speaking, put an extreme case.  I will try to put an opposite case.  It is quite possible that a police officer may not properly report a statement made by the <Col N="1712" /> person charged.  I remember witnessing a play in the Abbey Theatre called &ldquo;Duty.&rdquo; A police officer represented in the play told a person, when he was arresting him, to remember &ldquo;Whatever you say, or may not say, will be taken down and used, if necessary, in evidence against you.&rdquo; That is a burlesque, but it is quite possible that a police officer, in taking down a statement, like every human being at some period, may make a mistake.</P>

I think at this stage we ought not depart from them.  If a person is guilty of a crime, that person will be arrested if there is sufficient evidence, but he ought not be held responsible for a statement he made in one case and be charged in another case later on because of that statement.</P>

That has been mentioned by one Senator.  Usually when a policeman or Civic Guard charges a man he cautions him that what he says may be used against him.  I am very glad that the Minister stated that this is an emergency measure.

      <P>the District Justice shall, unless the person having possession or control of such land, investments or property satisfies him that such allegation is untrue, order the transfer of such property, in so far as it consists of land, to the Irish Land Commission, and in so far as it consists of investments or other property, to the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>(2)  An order of a District Justice under this section ordering the transfer of any land to the Irish Land Commission shall operate to vest such land in the Irish Land Commission as from the date of the order for all the estate and interest therein which is so alleged to have been bought with or to represent or be derived from such stolen property or any such fund as aforesaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  An order of a District Justice under this section ordering the transfer of any investments or other property to the Minister for Finance shall operate to vest such investments or property in the Minister for Finance, and in the case of investments or other property required by law to be transferred by deed or writing shall operate as a deed or writing duly executed by all necessary parties and <Col N="1714" /> capable of registration (where registration is necessary) transferring such investments or property to the Minister for Finance, and in the case of investments or other property transferable only by entries in a register, folio, or book, shall operate to authorise and require the proper entries for transferring such investments or property to the Minister for Finance to be made by the proper officer in such register, folio or book.</P>
    <P>(4)  All land, investments and other property which becomes vested in the Irish Land Commission or the Minister for Finance under this section shall be sold by such Commission or Minister (as the case may be), and the proceeds of every such sale shall be paid to the Minister for Finance who shall, after paying thereout all costs and expenses incurred in the recovery and sale of such land, investments and property, and not otherwise provided for, apply such proceeds in recouping the person whose property, or the fund which, such land, investments or property represents or is derived from.</P>
    <P>(5)  Any person (including an Executive Minister) aggrieved by an order of a District Justice under this section may appeal from such order to the County Court Judge, and an order of a County Court Judge on the hearing of any such appeal shall have the same operation as a like order by a District Justice would have under this section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind this Section provides the <Col N="1715" /> Minister with power to allege that certain money is not in reality the property of the person in possession of it, and does not compel the Minister to prove that allegation.  As was mentioned during the discussions on Section 9 by Senator Mrs. Green, the onus of proof ought to rest on the accuser.  The Minister does not seem to consider that he should be required to prove guilt in any of these cases.</P>
    <P>It is simply to allege that such and such a sum of money which you have in the bank is not your money and you have not got to prove where you got it, no matter how impossible it may be for you to do so.  The Minister seems to glory in this reversal of the ordinary principle of law, that the accused person is entitled to be assumed innocent until he is proved guilty, and I submit that in a great many cases, and in a great many honest cases, it is imposing a more difficult task upon the person to prove a negative rather than for the Minister to prove a positive.</P>

      <P>Senators have to ask themselves in connection with this Section, and some similar sections, whether the thing we should aim at is to do justice, substantial justice and equity, between citizens or to observe constitutional nicities strictly and to the letter.  I will be quite frank about the kind of cases that this section is intended to cover.  It is well known that throughout the country banks have been robbed on a large scale, post offices have been robbed, property has been stolen and sold, and so on, and that as a result of that people who, a year ago, were men of straw have blossomed out into very considerable affluence.  Men who were labouring men a year ago must have worked very hard, and they certainly must have worked more than an eight-hours' day, and they must, in addition, have got very high wages if they were in a position to buy farms for £3,000 or £4,000, and yet that is the position. Senators are, I am sure, aware of cases of that kind.  I know that members of the Dáil have been speaking to me of many such cases in their own localities. But to prove that theft or robbery against these people would be impossible.  For one thing, you would not have the evidence.  It is quite probable that there were no witnesses to the robbery except <Col N="1716" /> the men who took part in it, and even if there were witnesses, it is putting a considerable burden, even on the most public-spirited of them to expect them, in the face of the intimidation and the resources for intimidation that are still at the disposal of these people, to come forward publicly and give evidence.  And yet we must deal with the case of the man of straw who has blossomed out into a situation of suspicious affluence, and who has bought a farm worth £3,000 or £4,000 as the result of his plunder. We must deal with it.  Justice and fair dealing absolutely clamour for the treatment of that kind of case.  You could not, with any degree of prestige, with any degree of good name, simply turn the blind eye to facts like that which are a public scandal.</P>
      <P>I can imagine nothing doing more harm in a locality than the spectacle, day after day, of a man doing wrong and thriving by it in absolute immunity.  The State that would allow that would be stultifying itself and would be sowing the seeds of future lawlessness.  We must deal with those cases, and this section is inserted with a view to dealing with them.  To ask that absolute legal proof be tabled before any action could be taken is asking the impossible, and does, in fact, amount to a statement that we should not deal with these cases.  I could give the names of eight or ten people in different areas who have bought farms and settled down into prosperity as a result of their criminal activities during the last year or two, and to say that we must produce legal proof against these people is to say that they are to be left in absolute immunity to enjoy the fruits of their plunder.  That would be a scandal.  Human nature is human nature, and when people going the road see men like that thriving on the fruits of their lawlessness it does not help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a natural irresponsibility in this country and a kind of traditional negative outlook to the law, and all that pertains to law.  There are historical causes for it, but it is not going to help to develop a sense of law and a sense of responsibility to see people thriving on the fruits of their crimes, and to see the Government taking no steps whatever to deal with that situation.  Under this Section 10 I will give this definite undertaking.  It could not be worked into <Col N="1717" /> the Bill, but I do state, as I stated in the Dáil, that this section will only be used to deal with these kind of flagrant cases that are common knowledge in a locality, and a certain kind of common knowledge that obtains in the country falls little short of proof.  Everybody knows the circumstances in which, say, a particular individual was twelve months ago when he had nothing, and everyone who sees him to-day tilling a farm which he bought for £3,000 or maybe £4,000, knows that he did not come by it honestly, and knows that, apart from constitutional nicities, it is the real duty of the Government to put that man on proof and make him accountable for his new affluence.</P>

    <P>(2)  Whenever an order for the removal of the trial of a crime is made under this section before the indictment has been found, such crime may be inquired into by a Grand Jury of, and the trial thereof may be had in, the county named in the order of removal in like manner as if the crime had been committed in such county.</P>

      <P>I move: To delete the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in line 7, and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo; My object in moving this is that it seems <Col N="1718" /> that the Attorney-General can change the venue of a trial of any individual indicted for any crime, not alone the crimes mentioned in the Schedule.  It is a recognised constitutional practice and principle that a prisoner may not be removed from the court in which he would be normally tried, and that he should be tried by the Judge who would normally try the case.  No discretion whatever is left to the Court in this matter. The Attorney-General has simply to say that the venue of this trial must be changed, and the thing is done.  The change of venue has many objections, and I think, in the present condition of the country, where local evidence is so important, the objections carry great weight.  We can imagine the charges that may be brought against men, and the Minister has referred to the suspicions that are little short of evidence that exist in localities in regard to those charges.  If the venue is changed from Cork to Dublin, or from Dublin to Galway, these witnesses are not so easily available and the local colour is distinctly absent.  It is a source of great expense to those who are defending that prisoner. As I say, I think the section is entirely opposed to recognised constitutional principles, and should, in my opinion, be altered in that respect.  It is not a very big change, but it leaves some discretion to the Court, and I think the Minister should have sufficient confidence in his Courts to allow them to deal with such cases.</P>

      <P>The effect of this sub-section as it stands is really to treat the High Court with contempt.  It simply means that the Attorney-General of the day shall order them to do a certain thing.  There is no option whatever. Is it unreasonable that the Court be given some opportunity of considering the reasons stated by the Attorney-General for a change of venue?  There seems to be a terrible suspicion as to what the Courts are prepared to do in everything connected with this Bill. If the Attorney-General is able to state reasonable grounds, there is no justification for supposing that the Courts will refuse to take them into consideration and make the order.  I suppose we must not assume that the Attorney-General will make flippant applications <Col N="1719" /> of this kind, and surely the Courts could be trusted to do this.  I hope the Minister will grant that much, in any case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators should ask themselves, in connection with this amendment, what is it that is really involved? The Attorney-General, being of opinion that conditions in a particular area render a fair, impartial trial of a particular case impossible, gives a certicate to that effect.  To insert &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in line 47 practically imposes upon the Judge the duty of trying that question and of deciding that question as to whether the conditions in an area are so bad that the case cannot be fairly heard and fairly tried there. But the Judge has very little knowledge at his disposal in regard to the conditions in a particular area.  The Executive Council has, and the Attorney-General is, of course, in touch with the Government and knows what the conditions are.  The Judge does not, and it is not too much to say that the certificate of the Attorney-General, given in that way, can be simply acted on as of course.  As to the necessity for this section at all, the question is not really raised by the amendment.  I am not speaking without the book in this matter. Solicitors have reported again and again that, owing to conditions of terrorism&mdash;local terrorism&mdash;juries have found verdicts in flat conflict with the evidence tendered, not in many counties, I am glad to say, but certainly in a sufficient number of counties cases have been decided in that way by juries to justify the inclusion of this Section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is involved in the amendment is, are you going to put the duty of deciding whether the conditions in an area are such as to render a fair and impartial trial impossible.  The Senator's amendment puts that upon the Judge.  I submit that the Judge is not in a position to have that detailed accurate knowledge with regard to the conditions of an area, and that the Attorney-General has by his contact with the Government, and by his contact with the police reports and so on.  It is a reasonable thing that when the highest law officer of the Government sets his hand to a statement that the conditions in a particular area are so bad as to render an impartial hearing of a particular case impossible, that that ought to be accepted <Col N="1720" /> by the Courts as a matter of course.</P>
    <P>There are certain kinds of cases around which local passions and local prejudices arise, and Senators do know when that kind of thing happens that a fair trial in that case is impossible in the area where it originated.  In the interests of abstract justice the proper course to take is to remove that case entirely out of the inflamed area, and bring it up to a place where none of those local passions and prejudices have play, and have a trial in a calm area by men whose minds are not influenced by prejudices on one side or the other, not influenced by passions, and not influenced by any local intimidation, or tendency to intimidation, that may have grown up around the case.  I stand for the Section and against this particular amendment, because I think the certificate of the Attorney-General, a responsible lawyer, and the highest law officer of the Government, ought to be accepted by the Courts as a matter of course, and that the question as to whether what he says is true or not ought not to be thrashed out in the Courts.  Judges sitting in Dublin do not know what the conditions are in West Cork or Ballinasloe, but if the responsible law officer of the Government tells them that the conditions are of such a kind that that particular case could not be tried there, that should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>This raises a very important point.  We must remember that we are setting up precedents here that might be used hereafter.  I grant what the Minister has said, that sometimes it might not be desirable to have a trial in a certain locality.  The amendment does not suggest that you should abolish the right to a change of venue.  It says that instead of the Attorney-General going into a Court and saying &ldquo;you cannot have a fair trial here and it must be transferred,&rdquo; the amendment leaves discretion with the Judge.  If he is satisfied that the Attorney-General has good and sufficient reasons for a change of venue, I suppose in every case where good and sufficient reasons are given the application would be granted, but he should give these reasons and the Judge could exercise his discretion then.  It is a most important point, as we are setting up a precedent here that might be taken <Col N="1721" /> up afterwards.  We have heard a good deal about this being a temporary measure for six months, but we know when these things are passed and become law, they are made permanent, and that they may be used, not for dealing with an abnormal state of affairs, but may be incorporated later on, and the precedents are set up <i>ipso facto.</i></P>
      <P>If the Attorney-General says that the state of affairs existing in a particular part of the country does not permit a fair trial being granted the Judge has no option but to transfer the case.  I am looking at this matter, not from what is the position at the moment, but what is likely to be the position in future.  We all know that Attorney-Generals are appointed in the general order of things because of the political coat they have on, and I have no doubt that Attorney-Generals in this country will be appointed by the party in power, or members of that party.  I can foresee at some time in this country when, if the Government want to get at their political opponents, as has been done before, the servant of the Government, the Attorney-General, if this precedent is set up, can go into the Court and order a change of venue, and the Judge of the Court, the responsible custodian to the people, will have no option but to accept the dictation of the political party or the Attorney-General. The Government, surely, will see that there is grave danger in setting up a precedent of that kind.  Under the existing conditions the Irish Attorney-General has not been appointed because of political services to a political party. I am satisfied also that if the Attorney-General went before the Judges of the High Court, and put the case before them that there were good and sufficient reasons why the trial should not take place in a particular county, the Judges would accede to his request to change the venue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we should allow a discretionary power to rest with the Judges as to whether or not they should grant the application.  If we pass this it means that we are denying to the Judges the right to perform one of the principle functions for which they have been appointed. We should make it analogous to the practice established in most other countries, that the Judges of the High <Col N="1722" /> Courts should have a deciding voice in these matters.  It is a very dangerous precedent to set, and it makes no difference to this Bill, because in the present circumstances, I am satisfied, no judge of the High Court would refuse the application of the Attorney-General.</P>

      <P>I wish to point out that this section does not apply only to the crimes mentioned in the Schedule, but it applies to other crimes.

I hope the Minister will not divide the House on this amendment, and even if he accepts it, it will leave the Bill as strong as it is.</P>

      <P>The Senator says that not to insert the amendment would be making the Attorney-General the judge, jury, and prosecutor.  The effect of the section as it stands is to make the Government the judge of whether the conditions in a particular area are such as to enable them to decide whether a particular trial could be held.  It does not involve the trial itself.  It is simply a recognition of the fact that the most authoritative opinion or judgment as to the conditions which prevail in a particular area is the opinion of the Government and the amendment would make that a contentious matter.  If you had &ldquo;may&rdquo; there instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; someone else may come along and say the conditions in that area are ideal, and that the citizens in that area are supermen, absolutely above any local influences, or any local terrorism or intimidation, and that they would try the particular case fairly and impartially.</P>
      <P>The Government's opinion ought to be the best opinion as to the conditions which prevail in a certain area, and the certificate of the Attorney-General on behalf of the Government ought to be accepted as a matter of course by the courts.  It does not involve the trial itself. It has nothing whatever to do with the merits or demerits of the case.  The case will be tried elsewhere, and the Attorney-General will simply submit his side of the case, and the defendant the other.</P>

      <P>The position seems to be that Senator Colonel Sir Hutcheson Poë does not object to an amendment by Senator MacPartlin which would make the section read: &ldquo;by responsible persons to be appointed by the Minister, who shall discharge the functions aforesaid without remuneration.&rdquo; I think that embodies all that is really required that the persons shall be of standing in their locality, that they shall be reputable persons, that they shall have no official position, or be paid by the Government, and that they will merely perform their duties in a public-spirited way.  If they find anything wrong in the internment camps that calls for attention, they can report the matter to the responsible Minister.</P>
      <P>I would ask those who favour the Committee to accept the amendment by Senator MacPartlin as a reasonable compromise. Why I had some objection to the committee was that I thought there were five or six internment camps in the country, and that there would be travelling and other expenses in connection with visiting the internment camps, and in times like these every pound that can be avoided is important.  My idea is to get responsible local people to perform this duty in a purely honorary capacity. If persons are detained at the Curragh, I would undertake to get six or eight local people, reputable men, to undertake this duty.  That could be done similarly in Dublin, and in other places where detention camps are situated.</P>

    <P>Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to revoke, annul, derogate from or prejudice the exercise by the Military Forces of Saorstát Eireann of any of the powers or authorities exercisable by them by virtue of military necessity arising in the course of the performance of their duty to suppress rebellion or vested in them by virtue of their having been entrusted by the Executive Government with the duty of securing the public <Col N="1725" /> safety and restoring order throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the Section the words, &ldquo;save that where any matter or thing may be done in virtue of the powers or authorities aforesaid, and may also be done under this Act, then such matter or thing shall be done under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill would appear to provide for the transition from military to civil authorities. If it really did this, the powers of the military authorities would decrease in exact measure with the increase of the powers given to the civil authorities.  This is not quite the case, because the military have still power to seize and dispose of cattle, and in another Section of the Bill the Executive Authority has that power also.  The proposal is that that right should be reserved by the Executive authority alone, and anything they have power to do under this Bill should be done by them and not by the military.  I believe there will be no withdrawal of the present powers vested in the military, and I think it will ensure that the Act is carried out with greater justice, and that the confidence of the people will be strengthened by the Executive Council doing the act rather than the military authorities.</P>

      <P>I see the Senator's object.  The amendment raises a highly technical matter, and I am not very confident of my own powers in explaining the basis for an objection to the amendment. It is important, in dealing with a Bill of this kind, to set down nothing which would seem to limit or derogate the ordinary common law powers of the military in a time of war or armed revolt. I will go all the way with those who have expressed hopes that no such situation will confront us in future; but yet my own commonsense and judgment tells me such a situation is at least possible. We ought not, in a Bill of this kind, to even appear to limit the powers of the military in dealing with such a situation. If the state of war lasts, it is reasonable that the ordinary military powers should remain.  If, on the other hand, the state of war ends, there will be no authority except this Act, and the amendment therefore is unnecessary.  The Senator <Col N="1726" /> took a very useful illustration when he touched upon the seizures of stock. Seizures of stock have been carried out by the military in the past because that was a particular form of disorder which, if allowed to remain unchecked, would have swamped the country.  That could only have been dealt with by the methods adopted to deal with it.  The idea that a menace of that kind could have been grappled with by ordinary trivial prosecutions for trespass in a summary court, is simply ludicrous.</P>
      <P>I would give this undertaking: that in practice we will not base any seizures of that kind on military necessity.  When, and if, this Bill becomes law seizures of stock will be based on the Bill and not on any inherent common law powers of the military.  I cannot say when the courts will finally decide that a state of war or armed revolt is at an end.  The moment they so decide, there is no authority except such authority as this Act gives and it would not be possible to plead military necessity if the courts decide a state of war or armed revolt is at an end.  There may be a recrudescence, and that may be local or general.  It might be confined to a small area in the country. If it is then the plea of military necessity would only prevail for that particular area and one would have to rest on the Act for other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>The only objection to the amendment is the objection which the Law Advisers of the Government have put to me that if we set down a provision of this kind in the Bill, we jeopardise the powers of the military in dealing with the situation. The present Attorney-General did score a very considerable victory over the British administration by bringing out that point by the very fact that they brought in certain regulations to deal with the conditions here, and they could be taken as excluding the more general powers that the military have inherent in common law for dealing with the military position, and he succeeded in establishing the point that when they set out certain provisions and regulations, that in fact they were agreeing to limit this to these provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our object in this Bill has been to ensure that nothing that we set out in the Bill will fetter the military in their powers for dealing with the situation.  I <Col N="1727" /> believe that such matters as the seizures of stock should be based strictly in future on the law, and that no plea of military necessity should be advanced when there is statutory provision.  But at the same time owing to the possibilities of the future we have to be very careful not to derogate common law powers.</P>

      <P>I think I am right in saying that there could be no offence in the absence of guilty knowledge.  To prove knowledge is an almost impossible task.  It is exactly the same position as when a person is found in possession of stolen property.  He is charged with the offence, and it is for him to establish complete ignorance on his part of the fact that it was stolen.  If under this Bill a revolver is found in a man's trunk, he is charged with possession of the revolver without proper authority.  If he can convince the Court that he had no guilty knowledge of its presence there, that it was planted there by someone else, then there is no offence in law without guilty knowledge.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is inherent in that paragraph of the Schedule as it stands.  The effect of putting in the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; would be to place on the prosecution the onus of proving the state of a man's mind.  You cannot prove the state of a man's mind.  You can charge him with an offence, and if he can convince the Court that there is no guilty knowledge, then he will be acquitted.  I am afraid the putting in of the adverb that the Senator suggests would be to set an impossible difficulty in the task of the prosecutor.</P>

      <P>The person charged with aiding will be acquitted if he convinces the Court that he had no guilty knowledge.  That is implicit in the law that a person cannot be punished for an offence that he had no guilty knowledge of, or the knowledge that he was committing an offence.  There must be according to the text books, <i>mens rea</i> about it.  There must be guilty condition of mind.  If there was not a guilty condition of mind then the Court will acquit. But it would be an impossible thing to put on the prosecution the onus of showing the condition of the man's mind.  He is charged with an offence, and if he can show that he was innocent in the matter then the Court will acquit him, even though, in fact, he had done an act which materially assists the criminal. I think An Cathaoirleach will bear me out in that exposition of the matter.</P>

      <P>I would not like to give a positive opinion on a matter of the kind which, of course, may be the subject of discussion and argument hereafter in the court.  But it seems to me that as the clause stands that aiding and abetting must be for the purpose of committing an offence.  It is difficult to show how any conviction could be sustained unless it can be proved that he knew an offence was about to be committed. Again, it will be difficult to understand why he should be proved to be guilty of helping to escape unless he did it for that purpose.  My own impression is that &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; would not help the Section very much.  I do not think either that it would embarras the Government very much if they put it in.  Perhaps if the Minister would say he would reconsider it on the Report Stage it might meet the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is to allow Land Bonds to be accepted in payment of estate, succession, or other duties.  When the Compensation for Injuries Bill was before the Seanad a clause of very much the same effect was introduced into the Bill and accepted by the Government and formed part of the Bill.  The wording of the amendment as it appears on the Order Paper is not altogether in the form that I personally would have drafted it.  I think if the Government are prepared to accept these Bonds they should be also subject to the same conditions as they agreed to in the case of the Damage to Property Act.  That is to say that the Bonds should be accepted by the Revenue Commissioners of the Saorstát by, or in respect of the death of the person to whom such security was <Col N="1731" /> issued or in respect of the death of any subsequent holder who had been a registered holder of such security of not less than twelve months previous to his death.  I think that additional provision is required.  It is admitted on all sides that Death Duties may be looked upon as a tax on capital.  Communists have agreed on that point.  It would be a very reasonable thing that where capital, such as land or property, is taken away from the holder of that land, and he has paid for it in Bonds that on his death those Bonds should be treated as capital, repayable to the State.  I think there is very little doubt, but that the amendment will be accepted, but what I am really interested in is to hear what the Government will have to say on that point.  I am sure there will be no hesitation in accepting it.</P>

We have further provided in the Bill that the Judicial Commissioner, when taking into account the redemption price of those superior rent interests and of head rents, shall have regard to the price paid for the lands out of which the rent was payable.  These are two provisions which we inserted specifically in relief of the vendor.  I am prepared to accept the amendment which appears later on in the name of Sir Hutcheson Poë.  That will go very far to relieve the case of vendors heavily encumbered.  We have put in those provisions&mdash;the two I have mentioned&mdash;and I am prepared to meet that provision to go some way towards meeting the point that we should as far as possible meet the case of the heavily encumbered vendor.  The Treasury are very much against the acceptance of that.  Senator Guinness is right when he states that something similar went into the Compensation Bill.  I am informed that a million of those bonds will come in in a year, and it will be necessary for the Minister for Finance to liquidate them.

      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The redemption price of head rents shall be fixed according to the following scale, viz.:&mdash;When the head rent was 50 per cent. or over, the redemption price to be 15 years' purchase; 40 per cent. and under 50 per cent. of gross rental, 16 years' purchase; 30 per cent. and under 40 per cent. of gross rental, 18 years' purchase; 20 per cent. and under 30 per cent. of the gross rental, 20 years' purchase; and under 20 per cent. of gross rental, 22 years' purchase.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have very little time to frame a considered amendment, and I endeavoured to draw up a scale to meet the conditions which were existing in estates where there were large head rents, and where those head rents were bought by land speculators within the last twenty-five or thirty years for the purpose of securing to themselves large increments of capital <Col N="1734" /> when they believed that this question was about to be settled.  I am absolutely against the idea that any man with any consideration for his position as a landlord or a tenant should rush into this question.  I should say that they should be put in a position to secure some totally different proportion to the amount the vendor is going to secure. I feel we should be satisfied that it will not be possible for a land speculator to obtain any great increase on the amount he paid for the land.  I know in many cases where he bought head rents for a small price he was most meticulous in his own rights, and my amendment is to prevent him now from getting from the vendor the sum of money to which he is totally unentitled.  I think some promise might be got from the Minister that such a thing would be rendered impossible. I think that the terms cannot be considered unfair to the head rent charger, and I believe that they will give great consolation to a vast number of owners who have large head rents on their property, who were prevented hitherto from selling by the existence of the head rents, and who in many cases could not sell their property, even if they were prepared to, owing to the disinclination probably of some tenant to buy in view of future legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That was put in to save the vendor.  I am certain that this amendment which tries to apply standard figures to something which is not standard itself, might save a particular vendor, but it probably would do more harm in the majority of cases than it would do good.  It would be out of the question, I suggest, to apply standard figures like that to rents which are not standardised in any way. We meet his wishes by providing that in fixing the redemption price of the superior interest the Judicial Commissioner shall have regard to the price received by the vendor.  The Judicial Commissioner in fixing the price of head <Col N="1735" /> rents formerly took into account the security and anything else.  That was the old rule.  We ask him to take into account a little more than the security&mdash; namely, the price which the vendor received for the lands out of which the head rents issue.</P>

As Senator Bennett pointed out, there are certain cases in which speculators have come here and bought head rents at a ridiculously low price, say, ten years' purchase.  A great many people have done that in the hope that there might be a redemption of 25 or 30 years. Power should be given to consider the price at which those head rents were purchased.</P>

Where there is a hardship done by our provisions as to price, we are trying to divide the hardship as fairly as we can.  We ask the Commissioner to take into account the price of the land when fixing the price of the head rent, and we allow him to take into account the circumstances of the case in that way.  I think it would be unfair to penalise a man who buys head rents by reason of the fact that he is a sharp enough business man to buy them at a suitable time. He will not get a tremendous price for them under this Bill.</P>

      <P>With regard to the statement of the Minister, this Bill, in line 39 says: &ldquo;In fixing the redemption price of superior interests, the Judicial Commissioner shall have regard to the price received by the vendor for the lands out of which such superior interests issue.&rdquo; That is entirely a new phase with regard to head rents and those other superior interests.  The head rents, quit rents, and tithe rents, especially the head rents, were one of the finest securities in the world.  These <Col N="1736" /> words: &ldquo;received by the vendor for the lands,&rdquo; put a new complexion altogether upon that valuable security.  I have been paid for head rents, and I have had to buy them out.  They were excessively valuable securities.  This introduces a new phase into the old rule that the price you could get for these had regard not to the price received for the lands, but to the security, which was a very fine security indeed.  I am not personally interested now in any way, as I have sold, but I should like it to be clearly understood by the Seanad that by these words this security is being dealt with in quite a different manner from that in which it was dealt with under the Act of 1903, which settled the land question between many parties in this country.</P>

      <P>Senator the Earl of Mayo has voiced what should occur to any person, that Senator Bennett's proposal penalises certain persons, who apparently have made good bargains, by attacking the quality of the security which they have purchased, and which has always been a first class security. I should have thought somebody might have criticised the Government, as Senator the Earl of Mayo has, for the way in which they decrease the value of that security by taking into account the price which the vendor is going to get.  That is a question that has never been considered before in valuing a head rent. Many serious questions will come before us as to the value of title, and while, for reasons which may be sufficient, we may consider it wise to pass something which will damage the value of property which has not hitherto been damaged in that way, I do not think that it would be wise, because some people may have made sharp bargains, to put on a sort of penalty which will damage the legal value of the property.  That would be a very dangerous thing for the Seanad to do, as we may very soon find ourselves wishing to appeal to the legal rights of the holders of property.  If this can be quoted against us, it will be a very bad precedent, and I quite agree that the Section goes as far as any of us ought to agree to.</P>

      <P>The question of speculators buying the head-rents has <Col N="1737" /> never come before me before.  I suppose there are cases of that sort and, therefore, it is an excessively difficult point to deal with.  I admit that.  I understood what the Minister stated was that you cannot particularise with these speculators. They have to take their chance in the financial world and in the market.  I think the number of those cases is very small indeed, but I am subject to correction. It has come as a surprise to me that such cases occurred in this country.</P>

      <P>I move: Section 9, sub-section (1), to add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;for a period not exceeding 67 years.&rdquo; The Section does not indicate to the purchaser for what period or number of years he is to pay this annuity.  If the amendment is accepted the purchaser will have some idea of the period for which he will be liable for the annuity.  In some previous Acts the number of years the annuity was to be paid was specified, particularly in the Ashbourne Act, which provided that the annuity was to be paid for 49 years.  I am not sure about the other Acts.</P>

It was not inserted in any previous Act except the Ashbourne Act, which was financed in a different way, and not on the same principle as the Acts of 1903 and 1909.  It is a mathematical matter, a matter of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division I am told.  The term is between 66 and 67 years.  I am as sure of that as I would be of any matter I would be informed of by my particular authorities. It is quite certain, I am told, as a matter of mathematics, that it will be 67 years. People who have not forgotten their logarithms have looked it up.  The figures may be 65.9 or 66.8.  In any event there is no necessity for the amendment as the Bill provides that the annuities shall be paid until the advance is repaid, and that the Sinking Fund shall be 5/- per cent. Putting all these things together you get 67 years.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;To delete Part 2 of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken this opportunity by this amendment to raise certain important issues which, in my opinion, and I hope in the opinion of the Seanad, are issues of great gravity.  I want to call attention to certain aspects that cannot properly be treated within the scope of any individual amendment.  The first point I wish to make is the extraordinary precipitate haste at which we are asked to consider this most important measure, which I hope to show, not at undue length, is more far-reaching than any measure, in my knowledge, ever put on the Statute Book dealing with this country. <Col N="1739" /> The Bill was before the Dáil from, I think, three weeks to a month, and here within one week we, responsible legislators, have got to go through this whole measure, consider its full bearing draft, and try to carry essential amendments which are necessary in the interests of the community.</P>
    <P>I, with others, some highly experienced in matters of land legislation, have been considering this Bill to the best of our ability in the short time we have had, and it is only since I came into the Seanad a little over an hour ago, that the point has arisen on this Bill which will give some idea of the magnitude of the questions involved.  Under this Bill the Land Commission retain any holding over £3,000 in value.  They can only re-sell or they have power only to re-sell up to the value of £3,000.  In calculating that sum of £3,000 any other property previously held, freehold or bought under a purchase Act, in the possession of the vendor must be taken into consideration. It shows how important it is to consider this question deliberately and without any undue haste.  If an unpurchased tenant has another farm which he bought under a previous Act, or has a farm which he may hold in fee, and that farm is valued by the Land Commission up to £3,000, the Land Commission are not bound; it is entirely discretionary with them to make any further advance to him for the purpose of repurchasing the holdings that they have retained.</P>
    <P>If that is the case, look at what it may mean.  A landlord may have a demesne&mdash;many demesnes would be valued at considerably more than £3,000. That has all to go into hotch potch. All that has to come into the consideration, and any further land he has above that value can be obtained by the Land Commission, and they are not bound to allow any resale.  Well, you see what that means.  That is the most far-reaching measure of confiscation that it is possible to imagine.  And here in 7 days we have got to deal with a measure of which that is only one of a number of most drastic and far-reaching provisions. Therefore I say that so far as I can understand this Bill there are no means in it under which the machinery by which the price of any other land in the possession <Col N="1740" /> of the vendor is assessed.  There is machinery for arriving at the price in other cases, but not in this case.  We have no means in the 7 days to seek legal advice.  One has got to do the best one can and even at the risk of being mistaken to call the attention of the Seanad to these important matters.  This provision of taking land anywhere for anybody is an important one, from the point of view of security.</P>
    <P>There are, before me, instances of the grave alarm there is growing up in the country on account of these provisions. All land, even land purchased under the previous Acts, is liable to be taken and divided up.  There may be certain powers which appear to be safeguards in the Bill, but when you come to read them you will find they are only dexterous pieces of phraseology.  When you come to argue them before a judge they have a plain meaning, and that is as the Minister said: &ldquo;We have power to take any land anywhere for the relief of congests.&rdquo; There is power to take land to relieve congestion, you are going to give the Government power to break up land anywhere all over the country.  I do not say it is right or wrong.  I am not arguing that question now, but I do say it is reducing legislation to a farce to ask us to come in and give one week to enact a measure of that far-reaching consequence. You may only take one farm in a district. But that is going to have an effect on the security of land in that district.</P>
    <P>It is going to strike at the very root of our economic life, and yet we are to do this almost unconstitutional act, to ask this to be done as an emergency, practically almost as a matter of panic legislation. For that reason I would ask the Minister whether due weight cannot be given by the Government to this important matter, and whether it would not be possible to take it as an agreed measure, by making such amendments as would take out such dangerous confiscatory provisions. I use the word deliberately.  I will argue it later on.  This has nothing really to do with what we hitherto believe to be land purchase, which is land acquisition. I ask that the Government allow that to be dealt with after the Election in a spirit of more judicial frame of mind.  I know that in making the suggestion I run the risk of jeopardising <Col N="1741" /> the whole Bill, and I feel the consequences of that most acutely.</P>
    <P>I am told, and I do not dispute it, that possibly I myself, in a small way, and many of my friends, to a greater extent, may get far worse treatment in some future Bill than the present.  I assure you that I feel that very acutely.  When I got to a quarter mile of where I am standing I spoke to a friend who is reduced almost to destitution.  He has to live in three rooms in his own house, and he is reduced to that destitution merely by the fact that he has not received his just dues for three years, and it is a difficult position.  I am not easy to know what one's duty is under such circumstances.  If I consider my personal inclination, I would say &ldquo;take all you can, get rid of all this confusion, and let all these things take care of themselves.&rdquo; But as a member of this Seanad I cannot do so.  I have the national interests to think of, and I want to rise superior to my personal interest. I think that this Bill is going to do incalculable harm in its broad provisions in the country, and I feel it my duty to make every effort to alter these provisions. I am sure that every Senator here will have that point of view before him and will examine this Bill from the point of view of the national interests only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COUNIHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to support the amendment I may say that I, too, feel my responsibility in the matter.  I say the Seanad will be well advised, and they will do what the country expects them to do, by supporting Sir John Keane's amendment.  By doing that they will prevent hasty and ill-considered legislation, and I maintain that is the duty of the Seanad and it is what the Seanad was created for.  I have been a constant supporter of this Government. All the measures which we have passed up to now were necessary for the good of the country, and any of these measures which would be found wanting in the near future could be amended any time. If once you pass this Bill and lay down the principles it embodies, you will be creating another land war, a land war which, in its intensity, will be greater than the ones that have passed.  I do not think the Seanad or the country realises the sweeping nature of this measure, and I do not think the Government as a whole <Col N="1742" /> realises the responsibilities that are being undertaken.</P>
      <P>In one clause it is set out that the Land Commission can take land anywhere and at any time.  That is a very sweeping clause, and it will destroy security in the land.  I am not objecting to land being taken.  I say that it is for the good of the country that land should be taken here and there, and taken in large acreages, but the Land Commission and the Government should not rush at such a pace.  Land or any other property taken by compulsion should be paid for at the fair market value.  According to this Bill the tenant should get a price which would be fair in the opinion of the Land Commission.  What would that price amount to?  In most cases lettings of good land would be worth £100 an acre.  To the Land Commission it will be worth as much as they can let it out to congests and landless men, and these people cannot pay more than the average farmer is at present paying. That would amount to from 25/- to £2 an acre.  On that basis the Land Commission would bring the price down to £45 an acre, and that price would work out in actual cash value to about £40 or less. I maintain the Land Commission should not be the judges of the price.  If the Government insists on taking land by compulsion, either tenanted or untenanted, they should give us an opportunity of appealing to a High Court Judge.  We have all had experience of appealing from an Income Tax Supervisor or Inspector to an Income Tax Commissioner.  When your case is heard by the Commissioners they always say &ldquo;ditto&rdquo; to what the Inspectors or Supervisors state.  If you want to create confidence in getting a fair value, you must have an appeal to the High Court Judge.  If the Minister or the Government will grant us this point we do not want to wreck the Bill, and we would be satisfied to facilitate the Government in every way, and to expedite the passage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Earlier in the day Senator Sir John Keane warned us not to create a crisis; now he invites us to create a very grave crisis indeed.  He is inviting us, in fact, to create disturbance. He wants the Minister to discriminate, and point out what land it is necessary to take.  How in the name of goodness can the Minister do that?  How can you <Col N="1743" /> frame that in regulations within the compass of the Bill, unless you do it in the innocuous way in which the British did it.  They said that a man was not a congest unless his valuation was under £10. Take the case of a demesne; it may be all woodland, garden or pleasure grounds. The home farm might be described as untenanted land.  If the Minister framed his Bill to take untenanted land only for the congests of the district, that is the land he should take.  In the same district you may have what is commonly known as a rancher.  He may have one thousand acres.  The congests in the district are to get part of that.  The Minister proposes to take every case on its merits.</P>
      <P>If any unfairness does arise, and if anything is done by the Land Commission that should not be done, the Minister is to be here brought to account. The Land Commission would say that in the Bill it is in cold print, and they must take land no matter what hardship they might inflict, and they cannot take the other land.  We know how the Government have preserved the rights of property owners at enormous expense, and at enormous cost in blood and treasure and risk.  Is there any Senator here who can charge the Ministry with having neglected its duties?  Yesterday Senator Counihan warned the congests as to the futility of taking land of twenty or twenty-five acres.  He said that that land is worth £100 an acre.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CorneliusIrwin" hpid="Mr. IRWIN Mr. IRWIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. IRWIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  In so doing Senator Counihan evidently has not done what Mr. Balfour did when establishing the Congested Districts Board, <i>i.e.,</i> he took a visit to Connemara.  Mr. Balfour for twenty years refused to do anything for the congested districts, but he was not twenty minutes in Connemara when he was convinced of the urgency of the problem.  I invite Senators to go and visit the congested districts.  My definition of a congest is a man trying to farm without land.  He is on rocks trying to grow a patch of potatoes and corn in the shallow clay in the crevices. At seasons he beholds his crop washed away by heavy rains.  That is the man who is warned not to take twenty or twenty-five acres of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Seanad to leave individual and party and class interests <Col N="1744" /> aside and to take a national view.  This Bill is brought in with the intention of dealing equitably with a large section of the community that have been too long neglected.  These people have become impatient with golden promises, and any retarding of this Bill will help the flood gates of rising anger.  They have waited for this day, and let us not, for minor reasons, withhold what is necessary for them for their existence.  I back the Ministry to treat the landlords equitably. They have done that in other portions of the Bill, and why suspect that they will not do likewise in the remaining portion. As to the future, when this Bill is passed, some Senators anticipate the wild rush of congests for land.  That will not happen. When the Bill passes, the Minister's difficulties really begin.  He will have to go down to the West, and I pity him trying to induce people to leave their little cabins in the rocks and bogs.  They would almost as soon cross the Jordan as cross the Shannon.  I appeal to the Seanad to help and trust the Minister and his Land Commission, who are trained experts, and who know this question.  If any injustice is inflicted on any Irishman of any class or section he can come to the Seanad or the Dáil, and I am sure he will get justice.</P>

      <P>I hope I shall not be misunderstood, but I cannot help saying that the very able and interesting speeches we have heard would be more appropriate to the Second Reading of the Bill.  I thought that we were discussing the Bill in Committee, and I am anxious that no time should be wasted, and although there will be considerable hostility to the Bill amongst certain members of the Seanad, it surely would be hardly honourable on their parts to try, by a side-wind, to defeat the Bill, for we know if that resolution is carried the Bill is as dead as Julius Caesar.  I know that that is not the wish of the Seanad as a whole.  I am convinced that the good sense of the Seanad must realise that this is as good a Bill as we are likely to get under present circumstances. No doubt improvement could be made, and I think the Minister has shown his willingness to help those landlords who will be in an unfortunate position when the Bill is carried out, but I do not think it is right to try to destroy the Bill by a sort of side-wind.</P>

      <P>This is the second occasion on which it was suggested that this Bill should be adjourned until after the elections.  I do not want to be put in the position of politicians carrying this Bill to get any capital there may be out of it.  We did not introduce this Bill from the point of view of the elections, nor from the point of view of the landlords or tenants, but genuinely from the point of view of doing the best thing for the country as a whole under difficult circumstances when Irregularism and other things were flourishing.  I know something about the 1920 Bill and the 1909 Act, and when I hear terms like &ldquo;confiscation&rdquo; and &ldquo;most radical piece of legislation on the Statute Book&rdquo; applied to this Bill by Senators like Sir John Keane and Mr. Counihan, I am strongly tempted to think of the boy who cried &ldquo;wolf,&rdquo; and I find myself half-wishing that some people would get a taste of confiscation.  This resolution was useful, from the point of view of clearing up one or two points which, I think, were misunderstood. The limitations on advances are the same as in the 1909 Act, which says that no advance exceeding £3,000 shall be sanctioned, except under certain circumstances where an advance of a larger amount not exceeding £5,000 may be sanctioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">

      <P>Does that take into account any other property which the vendor may have in his possession?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it does.  If a tenant receives advances under the 1903 Act that would be taken into account. We allow the Land Commission to make an advance of £3,000.  We allow the Land Commission to exceed it, and to go further, and taking all the circumstances into account which influence them in exceeding it they could give a man a little more land if they are prepared to take money for the balance. Our terms are every bit as good as those in the 1920 Bill.  Now, with regard to any land anywhere the only radical difference between this Bill and that of <Col N="1746" /> 1920 not accepted by Karl Marx, but accepted by Lord Balfour, Mr. Chamberlain, and Lord Birkenhead, and the Executive Committee of the Land Owner's Convention, is that we give the Land Commission power under well defined circumstances to acquire purchased land for the relief of congestion. Untenanted land, even demesne land, could be acquired under the 1920 Bill.  If any Senator has any doubt about it I will read the section for him, and I think that Senators before making wild statements should read these Bills.  The only substantial difference so far as the powers of the Land Commission are concerned to acquire land is this : that we give the Land Commission power to acquire compulsorily. I will explain that when we come to Section 24.</P>
      <P>Now, with regard to the price I wonder was Senator Counihan speaking as a farmer when he talks about price. I heard a good deal from the farmers in the Dáil.  Their idea was not the market value or a £100 an acre, but present rents reduced by 50 per cent. and capitalised. Senator Counihan who is a farmer says that this land should be bought for a £100 an acre.  That should have been stated earlier.  I draw attention to this point that we are not back into the 1920 Bill, or the 1909 Act, or even back to the price discussed by the 1903 Conference.  I do not think that it would suggest that the market value, or £100 an acre, was suggested in the 1903 Conference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. COUNIHAN Mr. COUNIHAN">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity we did not hear that earlier.  That was not the idea of the farmers in the Dáil, especially when it came to the landlords.  The least we ought to do is to be consistent.  We have suffered up to the present from undue influences.  On one side you have people wanting to get rid of their own liability on something like compensation terms, and on the other side you have people when it comes to pressing their own interests who want to bring us back to the good old days of the Conservative English Governments of 20 years ago. Is that an exaggeration after listening <Col N="1747" /> to the speeches we have heard?  It is hard to settle the land question.  There is no doubt now with regard to appeal to the High Courts.  There is an appeal on every vital point that arises under the Bill.  There is an appeal to the High Court Judge; there is an appeal to the Judicial Commissioner and the Land Commission Bill which was passed a long time ago deals with the Judicial Commissioner under Section 3.  Now the Judicial Commissioner is head of the Land Commission.  We abolish the Estate Commissioners.  We have only the Judicial Commissioner and the Land Commission left.  The Judicial Commissioner is retained in every line of the Land Commission Bill, and has the last word in every important matter.  People say it goes too far, and that the judge would interfere with the administration. He is to be a High Court Judge assigned to that office not by the Executive Council, but by the head of the Judiciary.</P>
      <P>In this Land Bill we arranged deliberately knowing that it was necessary to give the Land Commission wide powers and knowing that it was important that these powers should be exercised fairly and judicially in order to meet everyone of these points which are rather troubling some Senators that the High Court Judge who happens to be a Judicial Commissioner shall have the last word.  When I hear Senators talking about what the Land Commission will do and will not do, and suggesting that it will be grossly inefficient and even worse in this matter, I want to know why are the Land Commission under this Bill going to do what the old Land Commission never did; that is, act inefficiently and act corruptly, for they would be acting corruptly if they did some of the things suggested here.</P>

      <P>If the Commissioner decided that this referred to landless men he would be acting corruptly.  That is all about it, because there is no question of doubt about it.  Since the Act of 1881, &ldquo;relieving congestion&rdquo; is a well-known term which occurs in every one of the Acts. I suppose it has been used by Judges 50 times over.  No Judge could ever mistake the meaning of it.  No Judge could possibly think that a congest was a landless man.  On the face of it, any Judge who decided that a landless man could be a congest would be acting corruptly.  We have an appeal on every important issue arising out of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  On every issue arising out of it you have a High Court Judge to decide the case.  We put in these provisions expressly, as I say, because we knew that this Land Bill would have to give wide powers to the Land Commission.  There is just one other point, the re-sale Sections.  The re-sale Sections are taken word for word from the 1920 Bill, except that they are brought together.  The 1920 Bill deals, on the one hand, with the congested districts and, on the other, with the non-congested districts.  We have practically abolished the distinction and we bring the provisions together.  But for every provision in our Bill in regard to the re-sale of retained holdings, there are similar provisions of the 1920 Bill.  If any Senator sees any differences I invite him to show them.  With regard to the re-sale of untenanted land I will read the <Col N="1749" /> 1920 Bill on that question, Section 13: &ldquo;Where the owner of a parcel of untenanted land which is vested in the Congested Districts Board by virtue of this Part of this Act resides on the land and uses and cultivates same as an ordinary farm in accordance with proper methods of husbandry, then if the price of the land does not exceed £3,000, the Board shall....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What are our provisions?  &ldquo;Where the owner of a parcel of untenanted land which is vested in the Land Commission by virtue of this Act uses and cultivates the same as an ordinary farm in accordance with proper methods of husbandry, then <i>(a)</i> if the price of the parcel together with the value of any other lands in the possession of the owner as ascertained by the Land Commission does not exceed £3,000, the Land Commission shall re-sell to him.&rdquo; Note the distinction. In the 1920 Bill the owner must reside on the land.  We take that out. We do better in regard to the re-sale sections. We take out the express provision that says that the house must be on the land, and we say that the Land Commission shall re-sell £3,000 worth of land without it being taken into account whether there is a house on the land or not, if the land is being worked as an ordinary farm.  These sections have been described as Socialistic and confiscatory and all the rest of it.  In regard to the resumption price of holdings our provisions are also the same.  If anything, our provisions are better than the 1920 Bill, which was the policy for the settlement of the land question of Mr. Balfour, Mr. Chamberlain and Lord Birkenhead, and which was adopted by the Landowners' Convention and by the Farmers' Union, in agreement with the Landowners' Convention, at the offices of the latter in 1920.</P>

      <P>Question: &ldquo;That Section 18 stand part of the Bill,&rdquo; put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 19.</P>
      <P>(1)  In the case of every holding to which this Act applies rent and arrears of rent accrued due up to and including the gale day next preceding the date of the passing of this Act shall not be payable by the tenant and no proceedings against the tenant for recovery of arrears of rent shall be begun, continued or enforced after the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>There shall be payable by the tenant to the Land Commission a sum hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;compounded arrears of rent&rdquo; ascertained as provided in the sub-section following.</P>
      <P>(2)  Compounded arrears of rent shall be a sum equivalent to the total rent and arrears due on the gale day next preceding the passing of this Act in respect of rent accrued since the first gale day in the year 1920 less a deduction of 25 per cent.: Provided that any payments made by the tenant after the second gale day in the year 1920 shall be appropriated to the rent which accrued since the first gale day in that year.  In any case where a hanging gale is customary any payment of rent shall be deemed to have been made in respect of the gale next after the gale in respect of which it was actually made.</P>
      <P>(3)  Compounded arrears of rent shall be payable, as to so much thereof as does not exceed 75 per cent. of the annual rent, immediately after the date of the passing of this Act and as to the balance, if any, on such date or dates before the appointed day as may be prescribed by the Land Commission: Provided that in any case where not less than three years' arrears are due and the tenant so requests in the prescribed manner one half-year's compounded arrears of rent shall be added to the purchase money and repaid by means of a purchase annuity calculated at the rate of 4¾ per cent. on the amount thereof added to and consolidated with the standard purchase annuity for the holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1752" /> (4)  Compounded arrears of rent shall be collected and accounted for to the person or persons entitled thereto by the Land Commission in accordance with rules made by them.  Provided that the Land Commission shall when paying over the amount collected first deduct therefrom income tax and such sum to go towards costs of collection as the Land Commission consider reasonable and proper.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where any money has been levied or recovered by a landlord after the 28th day of May, 1923, under or in consequence of any judgment or decree in any proceedings against the tenant of a holding to which this Act applies for the recovery of rent or in ejectment then:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if such money shall have been levied or recovered prior to the 3rd day of July, 1923, and so much thereof as consisted of rent exceeds the sum to which compounded arrears of rent would have otherwise amounted, or</P>
    <P>(b)  if such money shall have been so levied or recovered on or after the 3rd day of July, 1923, and the entire amount thereof (including rent, costs and expenses) exceeds the sum to which compounded arrears of rent would have otherwise amounted,</P>
    <P>the difference between such rent or such entire amount (including rent, costs and expenses) as the case may be and the sum to which compounded arrears of rent would have otherwise amounted shall be set off against the moneys to become payable by the tenant in lieu of rent as hereinafter provided, and the equivalent payment by the Land Commission shall be proportionately reduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move: Sub-section (2):&mdash;To delete, in line 19, the figures &ldquo;1920,&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the figures &ldquo;1921.&rdquo; The meaning of this and the next amendment is to reduce the amount of the compounded arrears of rent from three to two years, less 25 per cent.  This is the most objectionable section of the Bill from the unpurchased tenants' point of view. Three years are to be paid, one year at the present time, one year at the passing of the Bill, and the balance before the appointed day.  That would cause a great deal of hardship to a large number of unpurchased tenants, and the payment of these arrears will leave them in a serious financial embarrassment at the beginning <Col N="1753" /> of their career as tenant purchasers. From the National point of view it is very desirable that they should have a fair start, and that they should not be encumbered with a load of debt.  I am not aware that there was any general cessation of payment of rent for a longer period than one year.</P>
      <P>I am sure that if there are tenants owing three years' arrears the greater part of that was due to their inability to pay it, and not because they withheld the rent from the landlords.  Under no previous Land Purchase Act was there any provision for the payment of such a large sum of arrears.  In the Land Law Act it was made impossible for the landowner to recover more than two years' arrears.  In the 1920 Bill there was no mention of payment of any arrears, nor was there any statement as to the payment of the costs of providing the landlords' title.  I think the amendment is a very moderate one, and that the landlord who gets two years' arrears out of three should consider himself very fortunate.  That this Bill is perfectly fair to the landlords, considering all the difficulties we have to encounter in this country, is proved by the speeches that were made in the House of Lords on the 23rd of this month by the Earl of Birkenhead and the Duke of Devonshire.  I think that opinion has been corroborated in this Seanad by Senator the Earl of Mayo, who stated that English landowners would jump at the terms offered in the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will just read a short extract from the speeches in the House of Lords referring to the comparison between the terms offered by this Bill and the 1920 Bill.  The Earl of Birkenhead said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental question was: &ldquo;Is this Bill as between the different parties an equitable Bill, or is it not?&rdquo; The price, including bonus payable under the present Bill in the case of <Col N="1754" /> first and second term rents, was greater than the minimum price including bonus, payable under the Bill of 1920 (the Earl of Midleton dissented). The noble earl had omitted from his calculations the fact that under the present Bill the costs of sale were payable by the State, a provision which added 2 per cent. at least to the bonus of 10 per cent. payable on the purchase price.  Further, provision was made for repayment of arrears of rent, not by the tenant, but by the Land Commission.  No such provision was contained in the 1920 Bill, and he doubted, whether if that Bill had passed into law, the landlords would ever have received one penny of the arrears which even then accrued.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the statement of the Earl of Birkenhead, which was corroborated to a certain extent by the Duke of Devonshire who said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the case of first and second term rents, under the 1920 Bill the maximum price which a vendor could receive in respect of a one hundred pounds gross rental was £1,740 5s., and the minimum £1,496.  Invested at 5 per cent. the maximum gave the vendor a future income of £87, and the minimum of £74 5s.  In the case of third term rents the figures were:&mdash; maximum, £1,804 1s., giving a future income of £90 2s.; minimum, £1,770 7s., giving a future income of £88 5s. Under the 1923 Bill now before the Irish Parliament, in which there was a flat rate all round, for first and second term rents the purchase price (taking the same basis) was £1,505, giving to the vendor an income of £67 7s., and third term rents, £1,626, giving an income of £72 5s.  The actual money which was given for £100 gross rental under the 1923 Bill (£1,505) was greater than the minimum which was proposed under the 1920 Bill.  It was based on £1,496 for first and second term rents, but of course the income was less by reason of the rate of interest being 5 per cent. in the case of the 1920, and only 4½ per cent. under the present Bill.  The difference is one which would very severely affect a great many landlords.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That shows that there are very generous terms given to the landlords under this Bill and that they need not ask the <Col N="1755" /> full pound of flesh as regards these arrears.  In a lot of those cases those arrears would never have been collected. We all know that in a great many cases the arrears of rent have to be wiped out year after year by landlords, and we, as representatives of the State, will have to look into the future of these 70,000 unpurchased tenants, whom we will expect to pay punctually and regularly their annuities for a long number of years.  I think it is a very bad policy on our part that we should insist on the payment of the full three years' arrears.  Where it is due, two years' arrears ought to be sufficient.  I think, if my amendment errs in any respect, it is because I do not propose to provide for a reduction of one year instead of two.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose the amendment.  On the Report Stage of this Bill I undertook to consider the whole position as far as I could in a detached manner.  I have no interest in the landowners.  Yet I feel that this clause would be a great injustice to many small holders in Ireland.  I take a concrete case.  There are many owners with, say, £100 a year.  For the last year or two, owing to the agitation, they found it impossible to collect their rents. They are now met with the position that they cannot provide for themselves. They had to live entirely on the goodwill of the shopkeepers and others who allow them to run up debts.  Take, as I said before, a concrete case of a person who has a rental of £100.  We assume that they believe that a sum of £300 is due to them.  The Government step in and say: &ldquo;No, £300 is not due to you. What is due to you is £300 less 25 per cent. reduction.&rdquo; Now Senator Linehan comes in further and says.  &ldquo;Why should you get that £225?  You will only get two-thirds of it, which would be about £175.&rdquo; So that these poor people who have nobody to represent them or to speak for them are to repudiate all their debts and are to go down unhonoured and unsung.  There are a number of people who, I believe, could have paid if they wished to pay.  All of us who purchased, discharged our liabilities and paid our annuities.  I hope and believe that the new owners created under this Act will discharge and pay <Col N="1756" /> their liabilities.  If they are not going to do so, I believe the State would not advocate this Bill.  Are we now to suggest that because men agitate sufficiently they are to have sums of money owing by them wiped out?  That is not a precedent that we should allow as acting fairly between man and man.  For that purpose I move my amendment, and I congratulate the Government and the Dáil for having tried to act reasonably between the landlord and tenant in most Sections, and on this particular Section they have acted reasonably.  I do not think they have acted unjustly to the tenant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the fact that Senator Linehan occupies a prominent position as Chairman of the Farmers' Union in Cork.  But the Farmers' Union has made a point of acting quite distinct from the Unpurchased Tenants' Association, and that may explain why Senator Linehan is not fully instructed in the matter, because the records will show that in a portion of his own county a substantial portion of arrears of more than one year's standing are due.  On a point of arithmetic he suggests that if a further year's arrears are wiped off, you reduce the arrears to two years.  The landlord will be getting two out of the three due.  If he looks into the matter he will find that the landlord will be only getting one and a half out of three years, because the 25 per cent. deduction presumably remains.  With regard to the extracts quoted from speeches in the House of Lords, I have only this to say, that those gentlemen said this Bill was fair, and I do not see why this Seanad should now by accepting the last proposal suggested by Senator Linehan make it unfair.</P>

    <P>Amendment 5 (Senator Thomas Linehan): To delete in Section 19, Sub-section (2), line 21, the figures &ldquo;1920,&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the figures &ldquo;1921,&rdquo; withdrawn by leave.</P>

      <P>I desire to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 19, Sub-section (2): To insert after the word &ldquo;year,&rdquo; in line 22, the words &ldquo;save where, by the usual custom of the estate, the tenants paid their rents yearly after the second gale day of the year, only a half-year of the payment made after the second gale day of 1920 shall be appropriated to the rent which shall have accrued since the first gale day in that year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not think this amendment would be regarded as controversial.  It is necessitated owing to the fact that on a minority of the estates rent has been paid annually.  I will take a specific case.  For the year ending September 30th the rent was paid in November. Under the Bill as it at present stands half of that rent must be set off as against the half year ending March 31st. If that same tenant had followed the usual practice and paid one moiety in May and another in September, no such readjustment of the receipts would be necessary.  It is only to make the whole thing more equitable throughout that I move the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>To suggest that any issue arising on the arrears question is non-controversial is to make a suggestion which is hardly correct.  This is noncontroversial in one sense.  It has been said, and might be argued, that the principle of the section is that any rent paid within the three years should be appropriated to the three years.  It is controversial in that sense.  I think the amendment does not exactly meet the point which Sir John Keane wishes to meet.  If he wants to get in that point, perhaps I might suggest that the amendment would read as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Save that in a case where the payment of a yearly rent in one annual sum after the second gale day in the year is customary, a half year's rent out of the amount paid after the second gale day in the year 1920 shall not be so appropriated.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That approaches the thing from a different angle.  A great many sections and people are trying to reopen the arrears question.  I put it that you cannot settle issues in this connection really equitably.  At best they are in the nature of a compromise.  The general principle is there that a man should pay his debts, and when you are dealing with a man who does not pay his debts you are dealing with him on lines of pure expediency. No matter how I could draft the section, it would not be so perfect as that you could not find some points which could be improved.  This is not a very important point.  It does not affect a great number of landlords and tenants, and in the circumstances I would ask the Seanad to leave the section as it is.</P>

The Minister <Col N="1759" /> has made a suggestion, and it is very difficult suddenly to arrive at its effect on both landlord and tenant, but as the clause stands the effect is that the rent due in November, 1921, would be practically and absolutely reduced by 76 per cent.</P>

Perhaps, in view of that it might be as well to let the amendment stand over until the Report Stage, when Sir John Keane will have his alternative.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the following amendment standing in the name of the Earl of Mayo:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 19, Sub-section (4), to delete &ldquo;all,&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;facts,&rdquo; in line 42, and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;less the statutory deductions and such costs of collection as are actually incurred.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statutory deductions have been referred to here simply to see that they have not been lost sight of.  They may be lost sight of if not brought into the clause in parenthesis.  As regards the cost of collection, the draft of the original clause is a little obscure, and its obscurity is in favour of the Land Commission. I think it would be better if the concluding part read &ldquo;and such costs of collection as are actually incurred.&rdquo; That would safeguard the interests of those people who in the past have been <Col N="1760" /> accustomed to the collecting of rents. I refer to agents, etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I support that. With regard to the statutory deductions, the Minister may say that it may not be necessary to specify that, as it is inherent in the existing law, but it would make it clearer if it were inserted.  It is not an equitable thing to place any additional expense on an owner.  Where the owner has been paying an agent or solicitor to collect his rent he should be allowed to do so.  Where he does not do so, and where he bears the expense himself, he should have a claim to be appointed collector, and if you like the cost of it should be paid to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the amendment, &ldquo;less the statutory deduction,&rdquo; I do not quite understand the point.  Surely the deduction, for instance, of one-eighth is made from the assessment and not from the income tax.  Surely what happens is that when the assessment is settled with the Revenue Commissioners the statutory deductions are made on the assessment, and the vendor pays income tax on the final figure as assessed.  If the Land Commission did not take over these estates the vendor would settle his assessment with the Commissioners of Inland Revenue and pay income tax, and afterwards if his rent was less than the amount which he had actually paid he would get a refund.  Here we get the rent, and pay the same as we would pay dividends.  We deduct the income tax. The assessment is a matter afterwards between the Revenue Commissioners and the vendor.  He settles his assessment, and gets, say, a deduction of one-eighth, and that figure is so many pounds.  If his income tax is too much he goes to the Commissioners and gets a refund, just as he would have got a refund if, after collecting his rents, he was able to show the Commissioners that he was assessed too high.  This amendment, if it means that we should prepare the assessment from which the statutory deductions are made, would mean that the Land Commission would have to do the functions of the Inland Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would be impossible.  I may be misunderstanding the amendment, but if you are asking us to take the assessment <Col N="1761" /> and the statutory deduction from the assessment you are asking us to do what the Inland Revenue Commissioners are paid to do.  There are no statutory deductions that I know of from the actual rent.  They are made on the assessment.  I think there was some idea that we would say that this was not rent, that it was compounded arrears of rent or payment in lieu of rent, and that there would be some technical point arising by which the vendor could not get his usual deduction of one-eighth. There is no danger about that.  The fact that your rent is reduced by twenty-five per cent. does not directly or indirectly prevent any vendor from getting the usual statutory deduction he would get in respect of the assessment on his property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is some misunderstanding, but it can be cleared up in the passage of this Bill. The practice hitherto has been that any owner of land can elect to be assessed either on Schedule A on the poor law valuation less the statutory deduction or on the rent received less the statutory deduction.  Whichever method he adopted, the statutory deduction of one-eighth was allowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is where we differ.  I am advised to the contrary. I am advised it was always allowed whether you elected to be assessed on the poor law valuation or on the rent received. In any case, these compounded arrears are income, and all the landlords are asking is that the practice hitherto prevailing will still prevail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot expect the Land Commission to find out how the owner elects to be assessed, and then make out the assessment on the rent and make a certain deduction.  It would take a tremendous staff to do that. There is no question of doubt, if the Land Commission deducts the rent the owner can go to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, get all deductions, and have the matter adjusted.  The Land Commission are saving vendors a lot of trouble by taking over estates and collecting rent for them, and handing it over to them as if it was interest in lieu <Col N="1762" /> of rent.  On the other point, the cost of collection, it is apparently feared that the Land Commission would pay some of their own officials and would not act fairly in the matter.</P>

In any case where an abatement or allowance of the rent of a holding to which this Act applies is voluntarily given by the landlord, the nominal rent, less the amount of such voluntary allowance, shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be the annual rent to which such holding is subject at the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are some cases where tenants of non-judicial holdings have been for years in the habit of receiving temporary abatements, and if something like this is not inserted in several of these cases the compounded arrears of rent, calculated according to the Act, will be greater than the amount of rent which they have been paying for some years past.</P>
      <P>I have got a receipt here in one of these cases where the rent was put down at £10 13s. 9d. half-yearly, with an abatement of £3 4s.  The cash is £7 7s.  If some clause like this one is not put into the Act, instead of that tenant paying £7 7s. he would have to pay £8.  The compounded arrears of rent unless such a provision is made will be greater than the actual rent they have been paying.</P>

    <P>(1)  In the case of every holding to which this Act applies, rent shall not be payable by the tenant in respect of any period after the gale day next preceding the date of the passing of this Act.  There shall be payable by the tenant to the Land Commission as from the gale day next preceding the date of the passing of this Act an annual sum in lieu of rent equivalent to 75 per cent. of the annual rent to which the holding was subject at the passing of this Act which sum is hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;payment in lieu of rent.&rdquo;</P>

This sum, less such deductions as aforesaid, shall be paid in equal half-yearly instalments, and in accordance with rules made by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>(5)  If the interest of any person entitled to receive the rent of a holding or holdings shall not be sufficient to constitute him a person having power to sell to tenants under the Land Purchase Acts, any rent payable by him to the next superior landlord in respect of the holding or holdings shall be reduced by 25 per cent., and, if necessary for the purpose of ascertaining the rent payable by such person in respect of the lands comprised in the holding or holdings, any rent payable by him shall be apportioned by the Land Commission as the justice of the case may require.  Similar provisions shall supply, and proportionate reductions shall be made in the case of any superior rents payable by any superior landlords who have not an interest sufficient to constitute them persons entitled to sell under the Land Purchase Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This Section was meant to meet the case of a judicial future or present tenant whose holding was occupied by a sub-tenant.  It does not apply, as it states, to any person whose interest is not sufficient to constitute him a person having power to sell under the Land Acts.  It does not apply to long leases of more than sixty years, or fee farm grants, or leases for life renewable for ever.  It only contemplates the case of a tenant having a sub-tenant on a holding. When we had to deal with arrears we thought it only fair to spread the loss. Take the case of a judicial tenant whose rent is £80.  He has a sub-tenant who is paying £100 rent.  The sub-tenant pays £100, leaving a profit rent of £20 yearly.  Under our proposals the £80 will be reduced to £60 and the £100 to £75. The section provides that the rent of the sub-tenant and the rent of the tenant shall be reduced by 25 per cent.  As a result of the reduction the judicial rent is £60 and the rent of the sub-tenant £75, leaving a profit rent to the judicial tenant of £15.  If we omitted the section the result would be that the judicial tenant, the middleman, so to speak, would still be paying £80, whereas the sub-tenant would be getting a reduction of 25 per cent., and would only be paying £75, so that there would be a loss on the tenant of £5 yearly.  The section is to meet the case of a tenant with a sub-tenant on his holding, and who has not sufficient title to enable him to sell.</P>

      <NameTxt>The EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult indeed to understand this.  If you divide it into two parts and stop at the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; you have a clear understanding of the section.  And then you go on, &ldquo;for the purpose of ascertaining the rent payable by such person in respect of the lands comprised in the holding,&rdquo; etc.  My contention is that &ldquo;a person&rdquo; comprises all persons who hold land.  The effect of that is that a middleman or sub-tenant whose interest is not sufficient to constitute him a person having power to sell may be in receipt of rents from the occupying tenants of £500 per annum, while the rent payable by him to the superior landlord may be £100.  Does it mean that the £100 per annum is to be reduced by 25 per cent.?  If so, it would be manifestly unfair to the superior landlord.  If the superior landlord question is wiped out I have nothing more to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The superior landlord is not wiped out in this sense.  We ask the superior landlord to take the rent reduced by 25 per cent.  I can imagine a case of a judicial tenant with a rent of £10.  He let his holding, if you like, to a sub-tenant for £200.  It would be, in the circumstances, unfair.  It would be taking a very great advantage if he could reduce the head landlord's rent of £10 yearly by 25 per cent.  Of course, he would be receiving his rent less 25 per cent.  We are again dealing with tenants and with a general question.  When you reduce rents by 25 per cent. you are certain to do some individual hardship. The question is to do as little as possible. Our idea was to try to spread this loss of 25 per cent.  I do not know if we are <Col N="1768" /> agreed on that.  We wish in Sub-section 5 to deal only with tenants who have sub-tenants.  We considered it very carefully from that point of view, and that was the only possible way we could draft the section.  We meant to make it clear, and I am told by the lawyers it is clear, that the only sort of middlemen who would not have power to sell under the Land Purchase Acts would be tenants who are middlemen or owners of short leases.</P>
      <P>An owner for life in fee-simple can sell, and so can the owner of a fee-farm grant or a long lease renewable for ever. The only possible middlemen we could refer to are tenants or owners of short leases.  If it is a judicial holding, an ordinary tenancy, and if such a tenant has a sub-tenant on the holding, he must under the Act get the reduction.  That is only fair, that the tenant who is a middleman should be entitled to a reduction as against the landlord.  If the middleman had not a sub-tenant on the holding there would be no question about it.  It would be unfair that the landlord should have the benefit by reason of the fact that the tenant was unfortunate enough to have a sub-tenant It is clear, if we did not give that reduction to tenants who have sub-tenants, and if we gave the reduction to the sub tenants and not to the tenants, cases such as I have quoted would arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EarlofMayo" hpid="The EARL of MAYO The EARL of MAYO">
      <NameTxt>The EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed, and I think it is quite possible, that a middleman or sub-tenant has found farms and has been able to buy cheaply because the tenants have suddenly become hard up.  He has bought several of these farms, and holds them and has to pay very little rent.  Therefore, the landlord ought to be able to get his full rent without any reduction from men who have really gone into the country to speculate on the poverty of tenants who have not been able to carry on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>You refer to people who bought tenants' interests.  For the one case of a man who bought a tenant's interest cheaply&mdash;and it was not easy to buy a tenant's interest cheaply during the last five years&mdash;there are any amount of other cases of widows and that sort of people where the judicial or present tenant of holdings have sub-tenants.  These cases are far more numerous, and we <Col N="1769" /> must give them the same reduction in rents as the people who have no sub-tenant. The reason they have sub-tenants is because they are poor and because they are unable to stock their land.  You might have hardships in the other direction.  You may have cases, as you suggest, where the tenant has a rent of £10 and gets £200 from a sub-tenant, but, on the other hand, you might have far more hardship in the other direction.  We could not give a reduction of 25 per cent. to every tenant, except a tenant who happened to have a sub-tenant.</P>

      <P>Sections 20, 21, 22, and 23 added to the Bill.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 24.</P>
      <P>(1)  Where the whole or part of a holding of tenanted land, which is vested in the Land Commission by virtue of this Act, is sublet, otherwise than for the purpose of temporary depasturage, agistment or conacre, or for temporary convenience or to meet a temporary necessity, then for the purposes of the provisions of this Act, as to the standard price and as to resales by the Land Commission, the following provisions shall have effect:&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a)</i>  If the entire of the holding is in the occupation of a sub-tenant, the rent payable by the sub-tenant shall be taken to be the rent payable in respect of the holding, and the sub-tenant shall be taken to be the tenant,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1770" />
      <i>(b)</i>  If the entire of the holding is in the occupation of two or more sub-tenants, the portion in the occupation of each sub-tenant shall be treated as a separate holding held at the rent payable in respect of the sub-tenancy and the sub-tenant shall be treated as the tenant thereof.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(c)</i>  If portion of the holding is in the occupation of the tenant, and the remainder is in the occupation of one or more sub-tenants, the portion in the occupation of the tenant shall be treated as a separate holding held at an apportioned part of the rent payable in respect of the entire holding, the apportionment being made according to rateable value, or (if that portion is not separately rated) according as may be determined by the Land Commission (other than the Judicial Commissioner) and the tenant shall be treated as tenant thereof, and so much of the remainder of the holding as is in the occupation of any sub-tenant shall be treated as a separate holding held at the rent payable in respect of the sub-tenancy, and the sub-tenant shall be treated as the tenant thereof.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(d)</i>  Where portion of a holding is sublet and that portion is of such character that it ought not in the opinion of the Land Commission to be treated as a separate holding for the purposes aforesaid, the Land Commission may treat the holding as if the portion was not sub-let or in the occupation of the sub-tenant.</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purposes of this Section, Sub-section (2) of Section 15 of the Irish Land Act, 1903, shall apply with the substitution of &ldquo;the Judicial Commissioner&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Land Commission,&rdquo; and the substitution of &ldquo;the Vendor&rdquo; for &ldquo;the owner of the Estate.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I beg to move Amendment No. 12 and 14:&mdash;To omit all the words from the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 45 of Sub-section 1, Section 24, to the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; in line 48, and in Section 24, Sub-sections 2 and 3, to delete these sub-sections and to substitute therefor the following new sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where the Land Commission, be fore the appointed day, declare in the prescribed manner that any land, wherever situated, is required for the <Col N="1771" /> purpose of relieving congestion, then such land shall vest in the Land Commission, pursuant to this section.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where the owner is not in possession of more than 300 acres of arable land the foregoing sub-sections shall not apply to&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>(a)</i>  Any land which has been purchased under the Land Purchase Acts or is, on the appointed day, the subject of an actual purchase agreement thereunder, lodged with the Land Commission before the date of the passing of this Act; or</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b)</i>  Any parcel of untenanted land which is a demesne, home farm, park, garden or pleasure ground, or any holding usually occupied by a person regularly employed on such demesne, home farm, park, garden or pleasure ground; or</P>
    <P>
      <i>(c)</i>  Any parcel of untenanted land which consists of or forms part of land which was purchased under the provisions of the Irish Church Act, 1869, for a sum not exceeding two thousand pounds; or</P>
    <P>
      <i>(d)</i>  Any holding or parcel of untenanted land which, in the opinion of the Land Commission, possesses a substantial value or utility, whether potential or actual, as building ground; or</P>
    <P>
      <i>(e)</i>  Any &ldquo;glebe,&rdquo; as defined by the Act of 38th and 39th Victoria, Chapter 42, which now is, or hereafter shall be, held or occupied by any &ldquo;ecclesiastical persons,&rdquo; as by the same Act defined.</P>
    <P>The foregoing sub-sections shall not apply in any case to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>(a)</i>  Any land which is not at the date of the passing of this Act substantially agricultural or pastoral, or partly agricultural and partly pastoral in character, or any land comprised in a holding the main object of the letting of which was for a residence; or</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b)</i>  Any land which is vested in or held in trust for the State or any Government Department, or is held by any local or public authority (otherwise than as tenants thereof) for the purposes of their powers and duties as such, or is held by any corporation for the purposes of a railway, tramway, <Col N="1772" /> dock, canal, water, gas, electricity, or any other public undertaking.</P>
    <P>This matter of purchased tenants is of the greatest importance, and it is a question that will be very seriously raised throughout the country, that the lands of purchased tenants are no longer sacrosanct.  I believe it will cause very great trouble.  It is from this point the biggest objection to the Bill comes.  The Minister knows that I am just as much in earnest about the question of congests as anybody else.  It is of the greatest possible importance, and it has to be settled somehow.  The difficulty one has to face is how to get sufficient land for them.  I have tried to make arrangements by this amendment, and to effect a compromise.  The whole of my amendment is to make a sort of compromise with the Minister, and to say to him: &ldquo;Yes, we have land.  You want land for the congests; you can take it, but with one exception, that a man must be allowed to have and to hold 300 acres of land which you cannot touch.&rdquo; If he has 400 acres of land, the Land Commission take away 100 acres.  If he has 700 acres, they can take away 400 acres, and so on.  The real reason is that the Land Commission shall have the power they claim on condition that they leave the owner of the homestead 300 acres and on condition that he cannot be turned out of it.</P>
    <P>The amendment is an attempt to allay some of the difficulties that have already been raised.  The Minister, in reply to the question of confiscation, stated that the only real change in the matter had been in bringing two classes which were formerly excepted within the powers of the Land Commission&mdash;namely, old purchased tenants and demesnes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand this amendment, I am not very clear about it.  It seems that any land in excess of 300 acres can be put into a sort of heap and used for congests and other purposes the Government may see fit. I only wish to deal with one aspect of this case now, which arises out of amendment 12.  This question of relieving the congests is the essence of the whole measure, and I am sorry to get my teeth into it, but I cannot help it.  I feel that the whole future of our country, our peace and happiness are involved.  The Minister <Col N="1773" /> said we were quite safe in the hands of the Oireachtas and its servants in the Land Commission, and, above all, we have got behind that the power of the Judiciary in the form of an appeal to the Judicial Commissioner.  I am not satisfied on the mere technical aspect that those safeguards are assured, and I will take these things as if I were trying to argue them before a Judge.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission schedules certain lands they require for the purposes of congests.  They come before the Judicial Commissioner with their scheme.  They naturally are unable to dot the &ldquo;i's&rdquo; and cross the &ldquo;t's&rdquo; of the scheme.  They are not bound to give the particulars of every individual they propose to put on the land.  They put up good <i>bona fide</i> cases.  There are groups of congests in the same county, and there is a scheme to migrate other congests.  The Judicial Commissioner vests the land.  When that is vested the owner has no more to do with it than any other person in the community.  The title has passed completely out of his possession.  Now we come on to the Land Commission again.  For good cause they find that they cannot bring their scheme into operation.  It might be that these congests will not come.  It may be that circumstances of which we all know may have come into operation.  At the Agricultural Commission we had evidence that there is to-day an estate in the congested districts with houses built on it and ready for occupation.  The peculiar circumstances of this case have been of long standing.  Agrarian crime and unrest have not coincided with irregularism. For various causes these houses are unoccupied.  The power of the law is not sufficiently strong.  The vendor of that land is out of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission may have unwittingly to revise their scheme, and if they find that it is not possible to get congests to come to a particular area, they may have to go to other people.  I need hardly say there are plenty of people willing to come in and enter upon the land.  Now, that land is being applied to a totally different purpose for which it has been taken and vested, and the owner has no legal status to argue his case before a Court.  A gentleman, a <Col N="1774" /> high legal dignitary, suggested to me that this might be got over by the owner asking to be heard as a ratepayer in the public interest.  Was there ever anything so fanciful?  In the cases I have outlined the Land Commission can put in anybody they like under Section 31. They can put in all these people, &ldquo;including any other person to whom, in the opinion of the Land Commission, an advance ought to be made.&rdquo; When the Minister says my fears are illusory, I would ask him to deal specifically with the cases I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I argue that the Government are seeking those powers to take any parcel of purchased lands no matter how small for the relief of congestion. I am always willing to give the Government every reasonable power to acquire land for the relief of congestion; but to give them the power to take any untenanted land anywhere for the purpose of relieving congestion will be to render the security of any man who has bought land parlous in the extreme.  If it is done, I think, the security of the country will be absolutely diminished, and the desire expressed by the Minister that we should secure and enhance the stability of the country so that money could be advanced on loan, will be destroyed. I may be told there is no possibility of these farms being taken.  I would ask Senators to deliberately apply themselves to the section.  I would direct their attention specially to Sub-section 2.  That specifically includes any land purchased under the Land Purchase Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reading of that clause is this, that no matter how small the farm, it is in the power of the Land Commission to take it if they require it. I do not think that the Seanad would consider it just to take a small farm of 30 to 60 acres for the purpose of relieving congestion.  I may be told it would not be so used.  We can look a little bit ahead.  I think it is our duty to guard against the possibilities of anything being subscribed to by us at this moment which would render it possible for a man who is a small owner, and who would require the rights for his people that those rights should be filched from him.  I, as a juror, read such into it, and for that reason I support Colonel Moore's amendment that these words be deleted, and then I feel <Col N="1775" /> that under this section there is no danger that a small portion of land will be taken for the purposes of congestion.</P>

      <P>You allowed Senator Moore to travel over not only the amendment the last Senator was discussing, but the whole of Clause 24. Clause 24 is the real kernel of the Bill. It is the clause which gives immense power to the Land Commission and to the Government to take land all over Ireland for the purpose of congestion, and for the purpose of putting landless men on the land.  In the Second Reading debate where the Minister explained his Bill, he said very truly that it would take many years to settle congestion. Many Governments on the other side of the water had tried it, and many Governments had tried to remove congests from one part of Ireland to another.  I quite understand the wishes of the present Government to deal with congestion. I know what congestion is.  I have seen it in its worst aspects.  I feel that in this new Government the question must be dealt with, and I may have something to say on it later on in the clause.  I am not in favour of deleting the whole of this clause, because that is what Senator Moore's amendments mean.</P>

      <P>I am transferring the whole power of taking land out of that clause and leaving them very much greater power in Sub-section (3).  The seizing of land is divided between Sub-section (1) and (3), Sub-section (3) being much larger and more extensive.  I did not see any reason for that.</P>

      <P>I quite understood the meticulous explanation that Senator Moore has given, but the fact remains that this clause is the kernel of the Bill, and later on I shall have something to say about its details.  The whole gist of Colonel Moore's speech was to wipe out this clause.  That is the impression he made upon my mind, and I daresay on the mind of some others.  If Section 24, Sub-section (1) and the others are all moved together, I for one shall not vote with him on that.  When it comes to dealing with the clause in certain parts then I reserve what I shall have to say on it.  My experience in this Committee, and I have had some experience on Committees on the other <Col N="1776" /> side, is that the Minister in charge of the Bill has done his best under the most difficult circumstances, and I know the pressure that is being brought to bear on him, pressure of all sorts, from all sides, and from interested and uninterested parties, and parties on the other side that wish to make mischief in this country.</P>

      <P>Senator Colonel Moore's two amendments attempted to meet the case by allowing us to do everything we wanted to do under the section, provided that we must leave a man £300 worth of land whether it be demesne or purchase land.  It was a genuine attempt to meet the difficulty.  I have considered this question from every point of view.  I am afraid that distinction makes all the difference.  There is enough of untenanted land in Ireland to deal with congestion.  When I speak of untenanted land I do not mean demesne land or purchased holdings, and I do not mean that portion of tenanted land which is over £3,000 in value.  It is extremely hard to get accurate figures on this question of congestion.  The operations have been so complicated as many things have occurred, and occurred so rapidly, with regard to the land question during the last twenty years.  The best figures which I have got lead me to the conclusion that there is enough of tenanted land to deal with congestion if we had the land in the right place.  Shortly there are not more than 150,000 congests in Ireland purchased and unpurchased. These are, in my opinion, the maximum figures.</P>

      <P>Families.  There are 30,000 or 40,000 of those who cannot be dealt with, and who present a problem that must be solved outside land purchase. They cannot be dealt with for this reason, that there is no untenanted land, demesne or purchased land, or any other kind in the neighbourhood.  There are no big tenants amongst them who can be migrated, and it would be quite impossible to migrate them without taking down a regiment of soldiers and doing something which would take on the character of a big eviction, and who, by reason of the fact that they are living in out-of-the-way places like Connemara, are unsuitable for migration, and are <Col N="1777" /> unable to adapt themselves to a new environment, and in whose neighbourhood there is no other untenanted land of any kind, demesnes or purchased holdings, or even big holdings of other tenants.  It is a problem of the future to deal with that.  That would leave 100,000 congests, who could be dealt with.  Now, there are between 900,000 and 1,000,000 acres of untenanted land and arable land, leaving out demesne land, unpurchased in Ireland.  These figures are for the whole country, but they give you the perspective.  The land is of a valuation anything between 15s. and £1 per acre.</P>
      <P>These figures are the result of a lot of investigation, but certainly the figures with regard to areas of land are accurate enough for our purposes, and undoubtedly 100,000 congests could be dealt with on the 900,000 acres of untenanted land if we had all the land in the right place.  The average valuation of the congests is about £4 10s. or £5.  Therefore, it would take land of £5 valuation to give each one an economic holding.  If you assume that the 900,000 acres are worth a valuation of 15s. you will find that the figures fit in.  As a result of all the research I have made I do feel that there is enough of untenanted land in Ireland to deal with 100,000 out of 150,000 congests, and possibly with the 150,000 if we had the land in the right place.  We have not the land in the right place.  If we could carry the land around with us there would be no difficulty about it.  If those figures are correct there is only one way to deal with congestion, and that is by substituting or migrating the big tenant.  You will get a small percentage of the small tenants to migrate within the same county, but the problem will have to be really tackled by way of migrating the big tenants and migrating the owners, or even the purchased holders to a certain extent; but if you are not prepared to give the Land Commission power to resume the holding of a big tenant and migrate him, and offer him the equivalent elsewhere, and to resume holdings, where necessary, of big purchased tenants and migrate them, then say so, but you cannot solve the question of congestion and you can make no decent attempt to solve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever we do, let us be quite sure of the effect of what we are going to do. Senators are quite sure that the provisions in the Bill are going to lead to <Col N="1778" /> general insecurity.  You can be far more certain that you cannot deal with congestion, and that you are only playing with congestion if you do not give the Land Commission power to take purchased holdings in certain cases.  Of course, the Land Commission will offer what the Judicial Commissioners consider equivalent holdings elsewhere. Senator Colonel Moore suggested that we should leave 300 acres of land sacrosanct where it is demesne or purchased holdings. I realise it is a serious thing to reopen the work done under the 1903 and 1909 Acts.  I know there are many influences through the country who want to re-open the whole question.  I know it, because I have been pressed on this question, and if Senators only realised the number of other directions in which a great many people want to re-open the operations of the 1903 Acts they would probably be surprised.</P>
    <P>The Government realise fully the seriousness of re-opening the operations completed under the 1903 and 1909 Acts. We know it is a serious thing for the State to give a holding, and then to come afterwards and take it back.  That can only be justified by very serious reasons, and should only be given to the Land Commission under very definite safeguards.  If the Land Commission has not power to take purchased holdings where necessary, to resume the holdings of large tenants, as well as power to take a certain amount of demesne land, then they cannot deal with congestion.  We are only playing with it, and let us make up our minds that we are not to deal with it, and that we could only deal with it at too big a price. This is only for a specific purpose and where no other land is available, and I am willing to make that clearer, though I maintain it is clear in the section.  I had thought along the lines that Senator Moore suggested of making a maximum, but we found that that distinction made all the difference.  To meet the case of the general insecurity, the case put up that small purchased tenants all over the country are at present trembling in their shoes for fear we are going to take their holdings, I had thought of putting in some maximum.  There are 13,000,000 acres of land purchased out of a total acreage of 20,000,000, including towns, waterways, bogs, etc., and I should say <Col N="1779" /> that nearly 75 per cent. of that area represents holdings under £25 valuation. Does anybody suggest that any of these tenant purchasers of £20 or thereabouts valuation are really trembling about this Bill and the prospect of the Land Commission taking their land?  There is no use talking about general insecurity. There would be no general insecurity amongst people owning 75 per cent. of the purchased land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>They know it perfectly well.  If one thing is fairly well known, it is, if we propose to take any land of any kind anywhere for the relief of congestion. You might say, &ldquo;Why not lay down a limit?  If 75 per cent. in area of the purchased land is owned by holders so small that you are not going to take that land in any circumstances, why not make that clear in the Bill?&rdquo; We could do that.  We could say that we would not touch any holding of £20 or £25 valuation, and that would settle the case once and for all as far as 75 per cent. of the area of purchased land was concerned.  But would it be worth while, especially as it would suggest to everybody over £25 or £30 that we were going to take their holdings, when in fact we are not?  Here is the difficulty. I lay down a limit of £3,000, and say that a man's land up to £3,000 is sacred. That is just the kind of farm you might want to take.  Lay down a limit, if you like, of £1,000.  If you go into Mayo, Kerry, Donegal, or any of the congested counties, you may have thirty little congests stuck there together, with one purchased farm next them of only 100 acres, and no other untenanted land of any kind near them.  You could, perhaps, make them economic on that farm. Say there are five congested tenants stuck away in a corner of Connemara, with one fairly big purchased holding near them, which is a very common thing.  That is just the holding you will want, and your limit of £1,000 bars it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Land Commission have a general discretion, and if you protect that discretion, as I claim we have protected it as well as we possibly could, they can <Col N="1780" /> go to that man and say to him, &ldquo;We will sell you a nice holding in Meath, and they could migrate him.  We may have acquired untenanted land in Meath; and why not?  I am talking now of untenanted land&mdash;land which is not demesne.  We may have acquired it in any county&mdash;Co.  Galway, for instance, where there is a great deal of untenanted land not purchased yet, although half of it is a congested county.  We could go to a man and say, &ldquo;We will give you a holding a little better than your own, with a decent house on it, in some county thirty or forty miles away, and will sell it to you.&rdquo; He is a fairly well-off man, well educated, and able to adapt himself to the new surroundings. We are in a position to compel him to go, and he will go.  If we could not compel him to go, he might tell us that in no circumstances would he go.  The best we could hope for would be that he would go up to see the holding in the next county, and want at least twice as good a holding.  That is a typical instance of what the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board are up against.  The same applies to tenanted land.  We must have power of resuming tenanted land.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission at present can resume tenanted land for a public purpose. The 1920 Bill, realising that, gave us all these powers in regard to tenanted land.  We must have power to resume this land, because a very common case will be where we will find a large tenant with 100 acres in Connemara, with twelve or fourteen small tenants around him.  They could be made economic on his holding.  We could give him a better holding outside.  In 70 per cent. of cases he will be glad to go. In 30 per cent. of cases he would not go.  There is not the same hardship in making him go, because he is better able to adjust himself to the new surroundings, as he is better educated, and in the public interest we must take these steps.  That is the reason I say that we cannot have this £3,000 limit, and that I find it impossible to put down a limit. As I say, we could put a limit, and say we will take no purchased holding over £25 valuation.  That would be no good. We might find ourselves with a 40-acre holding in Achill or on the coast in Mayo.  I know there are such cases. <Col N="1781" /> The Land Commission know that there are plenty of cases of purchased holdings of 40 acres that would just deal with the congestion around them.  We should have power to take them, especially as we can give the tenants better holdings elsewhere.</P>
    <P>If you are not prepared to give us power to take purchased holdings, where necessary, hedged round with suitable safeguards, and if you are not prepared to give us power to take demesne and resume tenanted holdings, we cannot deal with congestion, and we may as well say so.  With regard to Senator Colonel Moore's suggestion, that this £3,000 limit would apply to demesnes, here is the difficulty.  You have a demesne of 300 acres with one congest adjoining it. Five or ten acres would make him economic, or otherwise we might have to migrate him.  It is too bad that we could not take the five or ten acres in a case like that.  That is the difficulty of putting down a limit.  The question is so complicated, and the facts and circumstances are so varied, that you must leave somebody to deal with this difficult question.  No Act of Parliament could be drawn so subtly and so closely as to cover every case.  Anyone who knows anything about the land question knows that the circumstances are extraordinary and that it would tax the ingenuity of the subtlest draughtsman to cover every case.  It could not be done.  You must give wide powers&mdash;that was always recognised&mdash;to the Land Commission.  That is the fairest way in the long run.  We can and do justify giving wide powers to the Land Commission by saying it is the only department with a High Court Judge at the head, and its acts must be carried out judicially.</P>
    <P>I have not the slightest doubt myself, no matter what Government is in power, but that the Land Commission will carry out its duties as impartially in the future as in the past.  Senator Sir John Keane pointed out that when the Land Commission took land for the relief of congestion, and that when they went to the High Court Judge they could not have a scheme to show the judge.  Of course they could not.  Anyone who knows the first thing about the land question knows that.  It is very pleasant to quote this dilemma, but it is more difficult to solve it.  We will have to show a High Court <Col N="1782" /> Judge that there is congestion in a neighbourhood, and that we propose to deal with these congests in that neighbourhood. At the time the claim might be to take out four of these congests. Afterwards, for one reason or another&mdash; and reasons change rapidly&mdash;we might decide to leave them there, take out a big tenant and put him in the same acreage of land in the demesne, and put the four congests on his land.</P>
    <P>We do not say that the Land Commission shall show a scheme to the Judicial Commission when land is being taken up.  It would be impossible, but they must persuade the High Court Judge that they want that land for the relief of congestion, if it is demesne land.  The judge will have to be rigidly satisfied that it is wanted for the relief of congestion, and that there is no other suitable land available.  I am willing to make that clearer if I can.  I think it is clear in the Bill as drafted.  That dilemma is there, and cannot be got over, human nature being what it is.  The Senator says we take this land for the relief of congestion, but afterwards circumstances that we all know arise, and we find we cannot deal with the men there.  Senator Sir John Keane was careful enough to point out that that did not start to-day or yesterday.  The circumstances are not here to-day, and if we get another few months, there will not be a man in Ireland in another man's holding.</P>
    <P>We cannot legislate on the assumption that the Government of the day is not able to maintain the laws.  In the piping times of peace the English Government was unable to prevent agrarian outrages, largely because they delayed in dealing with the land question.  Notwithstanding all the irregularism of the last year, and the opportunities people had to confiscate their neighbour's property, land, or anything else, at the present moment there is less land in the hands of nonowners, than I suppose in any period for the last fifty years.  I do not know of a single case and if there is one, the owner is trying to hide it.  There has not been a single attempt that I know of made by the men we have dealt with so drastically, to hit back.  I am telling you what we are going to do after taking land <i>bonâ fide</i> for the relief of congestion. You cannot legislate on the assumption that the Government is unable to maintain <Col N="1783" /> the law.  If the Government is unable to maintain the law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is a contingency that no efficient Land Commission would allow to arise.  I have said that I am willing to make it quite clear that this land can only be taken when other suitable land cannot be acquired.  I have slightly amended an amendment of Senator Sir John Keane.  The proviso to Sub-section 3 was put in after Section 2 deliberately.  First: we took power to take land; secondly, we made exceptions; thirdly, we provided that in certain contingencies these exceptions could be touched.  We did that to make it clear that the accepted land could not be touched when other land was available.  As Senators say, there is some doubt about that. I am willing to add this Sub-section:&mdash;&ldquo;The Land Commission shall not without the consent of the owner acquire land from him under the powers conferred on them by Sub-section (3) of this section, so long as there is other unacquired land in the same locality suitable for relieving congestion, which does not come within the exceptions mentioned in Sub-section (2) of this section, and which the Land Commission can acquire without exercising the special powers given by the said Sub-section&rdquo; I trust that makes it abundantly clear; under Sub-section (3) it is pointed out &ldquo;and where other suitable land cannot be obtained.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The position in the Bill is that we acquire untenanted land compulsorily. We acquire the holding of a tenant purchaser compulsorily; he has no option. We are then in a position to make an offer to him.  I do not say it is mandatory on us to do it, but of course that is what invariably would be done.  We are in a position under Section 31 to make him an advance, and in all cases it would be much cheaper for the Land Commission to give those men a holding elsewhere. It would be much more satisfactory for the tenant coming in.  The transaction in all cases is one of mere routine.  With regard to tenanted holdings, our powers are derived under Sections 28 and 29. We resume the tenanted holdings.  We retain them first under Section 28, and, if necessary, we resume them afterwards. These are the exact provisions of the 1920 Bill in regard to holdings.  The reason I quote the 1920 Bill is that I would have thought a Bill accepted by the Farmers' Union and the Landowners' Convention would be found acceptable.</P>

      <P>A Bill that was accepted more than once by the Landowners' Convention and by the Farmers' Union, and offered by the representative of the landowners at the Conference which was held in the Land Commission, and which broke down three months ago, is now, I find, too radical, and must be made more conservative.  With regard to purchased tenants, we take their holdings compulsorily; we can only take them for the relief of congestion, and we can only take them when there is no other suitable land available.  In all cases the Land Commission, as a matter of practice, will offer them a holding elsewhere, which would be much cheaper and simpler for them to do.  If the Senators wish I would insert a provision that they shall offer those holdings.</P>

      <P>With regard to untenanted land, I will not agree to insert a provision making it mandatory on the Land Commission to offer a new holding to a tenant.  In 99 cases out of every 100 they will do it.  There may be a case where they could not do it.  The Land Commission, for the relief of congestion, are entitled to the same powers of resumption as the landlord.  I do say there is a special case in regard to purchased holdings.  I am willing to go as far as possible to meet that.  While, of course, the business of this Bill is to deal with tenanted land, to make tenants tenant proprietors, and to make uneconomic holdings economic, still I will not insert a provision in the Bill making it mandatory on the Land Commission to give an equivalent holding in every case to the tenant whose holding they resume.  They will do it in ninety-five per cent. of the cases.  It will be much easier and simpler for them, but I would not make it mandatory. There would be circumstances that would make it impossible in a given case.</P>

      <P>I want to deal with the figures as given by the Minister, and I shall attempt to support my figures by documents.  I hope the Minister may be able to document his before the Bill leaves the Seanad.  The matter is complicated, we know.  The question of congestion was dealt with by the Dudley Commission in 1908.  I will give you a quotation from the digest of the evidence of that well-known authority Mr. Finucane, one of the Estates Commissioners. Here is the operative part of the quotation: &ldquo;The inference from figures was that the total area of untenanted land was not sufficient to raise half of the existing holdings under £10 valuation to that standard, as the total available was 620,000 acres, while land required would have a valuation of 1½ millions. Defeciency of land was greatest where it was most needed.&rdquo; I do not want to be unfair in controversy.  Mr. Doran produced different figures.  Mr. Finucane said Mr. Doran's figures were based on personal inquiry, whereas his were based on the valuation figures.  Circumstances have altered since, and the case is less favourable to the Ministry now because a certain amount of this land is no longer untenanted, but is in the occupation of other parties.</P>

We want to bring in Cavan, where there is substantial congestion.  I put it to the Seanad to be very careful about this matter.  This Bill is being rushed through the Seanad with frantic haste.  We have heard, and I think somewhat with apprehension, or without approval, of the wholesale change of populations in the Levant between Turkey and Greece, how people, as a paper scheme, were taken from one place to another, as if they were inanimate, or of the animal species, and removed from place to place.  We are getting into the academic and doctrinaire discussion about migrating people.  Let us remember that these people have very strong feelings.  In these adjustments let us remember they are human, and have many deep affections for their homes.  When the Minister stands up. and, with the facility which we admire, talks about compulsory removal of men and sending them from Roscommon to Meath, let him remember that these people cannot be dealt with in that purely formal manner.</P>

      <P>Would I be in order in asking the Minister whether, in dealing with these purchased holdings he has, at all, looked at the question as regards the value of those holdings, what will be received by the holder, and has it any relation to what the holder may have borrowed on those holdings?  Because, in a great many cases farmers borrow and sign bills on the strength of the acknowledged value which they have in their holdings.</P>
      <P>Merely looking at the proposed change from the banker's point of view, we may have a very large number of bills in each district, to which farmers have placed their names, and the value of their names to the bank depends on the value of their holdings.  If this Bill means that these tenants are going to receive much less for their holdings than they are worth to-day before this measure is passed it may mean a serious economic change in the whole banking conditions of the country, and I would like to ask the Minister whether he has given consideration to that point, or whether I am entirely wrong in thinking that this Bill may work a very serious difference to the wrong side in the valuation of the holdings which are being dealt with under it. If it does do so, and if the bankers of the country are put face to face with the position that a Bill like this may take away from the value of the holding of an admittedly honest man who has put his name to a bill&mdash;and on which he was perfectly right to borrow&mdash;then I say that he may be stepping from one difficulty into another, and I would like to know from him in what way this Bill does affect the value of purchased holdings which we have been discussing so fully.</P>

If he does not enter into an agreement and get as good a holding as he had, all that the banker will have to look to will be the money that he has paid for his present holding.

Here is an entirely new lot of holdings to which such a thing has not applied before.  We have not had time to consider what the effect of this will be.  What I would like to do would be to sit down with some of our banking experts and see how this does apply. Take a county in which there are a lot of these holdings.  I would like to ask the banker how many bills have we got there?  How will this affect us?  Will this matter mean a lot of our security being taken away from us?

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that I ought to say a few words now.  This is probably the most important amendment on the whole Bill, certainly on the most important part of the Bill&mdash;in fact, the hinge of the whole Bill.  We have listened to the Minister, who spoke extremely fairly&mdash;nothing could be more so&mdash;and showed an absolute knowledge of the whole subject.  I know the subject pretty well.  Everything he said was true.  I do not contradict it, but I <Col N="1790" /> think he has exaggerated the difficulty of removing congests.  I have seen a large batch of congests moved from the Party mountains to near Lough Mask, some fifteen miles off, and put on demesne land which was vacant adjoining my own home.  Houses were built for them, and they moved down there without any great trouble.  They took land which other people thought they had a right to get.  I thought there would be a great row about it, but there was not, and they are living there now.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is quite impossible to move congests.  I know there are great difficulties.  Everybody likes to live in his own home, but you have to balance that against the large owner&mdash;I mean a farmer of 15, 20 and upwards to 50 or 100 acres.  The owner of the land may have purchased his holding.  He may have been born in the place, and struggled to buy it and improve it, and are you to sacrifice all his sentiments merely for the sake of obstinate congests who will not move out of little bog holdings up in the mountains?  We know that those people flock by thousands to America.  They have no hesitation on a week's notice taking a ship from near Cork or some place else, and sailing off to America. They are as much at home there as they would be in their own districts.  They are getting letters from home, and they have relations and friends there.  According to the Minister, they will not move twenty or thirty miles away from their homes.  You have in this matter to balance the reluctance on their part against the hardships that you are imposing on men who had the foresight to buy their lands.  The hardship is very great.  Are you going to let the obstinancy of these little congests living on the mountains stand against the rights acquired after great hardship and at great cost.  I am not speaking for the landlords at all.  I am speaking for all the people of Ireland.  When you bring down a lot of congests and stick them into a little demesne or into a park-demesne, say, with 300 acres of valuable land, the demesne is no longer of any use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hunting is gone in a great part of the country, I am sorry to say, and so is shooting.  The man who lives in the country must have something to do.  The only thing left to him is farming, and <Col N="1791" /> this he cannot do if you are going to put these congests in and utterly ruin his demesne, merely because they will not move a little further off.  Senators do not know as much about these matters as those of us who live in the congested districts, with congests all around us. It is well you should think of what you are doing&mdash;the injury you are doing one man and the advantage you are giving to another.  I am not prepared to do that. I admit all the Minister says.  Yet I would not feel competent to advise this great revolution and harsh taking of the land against the will of the owners.  The Minister said that a great many of these large farmers can be induced to move. If they can, there is nothing more to be said about it.  I cannot vote for taking away the land of a number of people in this way.</P>

      <P>I beg to move Amendment 13:&mdash;In Sub-section 1 of Section 24 to insert after the word &ldquo;County&rdquo; in line 45 the words &ldquo;unless the Land Commission shall think fit to determine that any such untenanted land was not to be vested.&rdquo; This amendment was brought forward in the interests of a comparatively small parcel of owners who are resident in congested districts, and whose expropriation, I think, would be very undesirable not only in their own interests, but in the interests of the State generally.  There are a number of retired business men and retired professional men who are living in these counties, and in some cases they have from 50 to 100 acres attached to their holdings, and they supplement their incomes by farming.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill it is in the power of the Land Commission to take the land attaching to those residences, which may be in ring fences like a small demesne, or which may be some little distance away. We have heard a great deal about congestion, and I am quite alive to the evils that the unbridled exercise of the powers given to the Land Commission under this Bill may bring about.  I should like to see as many as possible excluded from the operations of this Act.  These people have been connected with these counties for a long time, and if you deprive them of these small holdings attached to their residences you will probably drive them out of the country.  A great many big owners have been driven out of the country already by the destruction of their homes and it is not in the interests of the State that any owner, large or small, should be obliged to leave the country. This amendment would exempt these small residential holders who have a reasonable plot of land attached to their residences.</P>

Could not the Minister, without in any way giving up any of the essentials of this Bill, do that somewhat more gently and more gradually and more considerately?  Why <Col N="1793" /> is it necessary except that it is in those two mysterious documents?  The 1920 Bill did not even receive a First Reading in the House of Lords.  Except that it is in that Bill, why is it necessary to do it in this way?  If it is going to be done, cannot it be done gradually?

      <P>Now, Senator Sir Hutcheson Poë, in supporting this amendment, mentioned retired army officers and those sort of people who come and settle down in the congested districts to live quietly and enjoy the sport to be found in these wild parts of Ireland.  He also spoke of them bringing up their sons like country gentlemen to enjoy field sports and open air sports and delights which every Irishman enjoys from time to time, and he talked about getting on a pony and taking up a gun and going out to shoot blackbirds.  There is an amount of sentiment about that, but it is ingrained in these gentlemen, and it is ingrained in their children.  There was a statement made the other day in the <i>Observer</i>, that a great many of the people who left Ireland were sorry they had left it, and were longing to come back.  I do not want these people in the Congested Districts to get it into their heads that they are going to be driven out of this country. No Minister, whether he belonged to a Free State or Republican Government, wants to drive these people out of the country.  They are perfectly harmless. They do not mix in politics, and are respectable members of the community. I would like, therefore, to hear from the Minister what he is going to do in regard to this amendment.</P>

      <P>I think the amendment is unnecessary.  What the Senator seeks to accomplish is already provided for in Section 24.  There will not be one appointed day for vesting all over Ireland. <Col N="1794" /> It will be impossible to do that.  There will not be anything like a thunderbolt when the land does vest.</P>

      <P>But the owner does not own the land any more after it vests. The land is removed entirely out of his control.  Nothing that he has paid on it can be recovered.  It is taken away from him.  It is like as if I had £100 lying on deposit receipt and someone came to me and said: that now belongs to the Government, and not to me any more.  I cannot see any difference, and that seems to be what Sir Hutcheson Poe is driving at.  The owner does not seem to have a voice in the matter at all, except when the Land Commission has acquired it for the purposes of re-sale it will no doubt be left on his hands, but he will have no further ownership in it.  We have not even an assurance that before the Land Commission declares the land to be required that the owner will be heard at all in defence of his own title to be left in possession of the land.</P>

      <P>I see the Senator's difficulty.  If the land is untenanted, and if it vests in the Land Commission then the Land Commissioners are owners, and all claims against the land attaches to the purchase money, but that is no new doctrine.  It was the doctrine of the Land Act of 1903, and of the Act of 1909.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This Clause deals with tenanted or untenanted land.  With regard to untenanted land, if the Commission takes it all claim attaches to the purchase money.  With regard to tenanted land, only the landlord's interest in the tenanted land vests in the Land Commission, and until all the estate is re-arranged, and all other arrangements made the land vests in the tenant.  That is the arrangement in the Bill.</P>

You may require one or two, but you do not want <Col N="1795" /> to take the whole, and I want to ensure that these people will be left in possession.</P>

We shall re-sell if the holding is not valued for £3,000, and we do not put in any provision about the necessity for having a house.  The Land Commission will endeavour to administer the whole interest, and where they can cause the least hardship to a party it may be taken for granted that they will do so.  That is their desire.  I feel there is some misunderstanding between <Col N="1796" /> myself and Senator Jameson.  We may, perhaps, be at cross-purposes.</P>

      <P>I am not quite satisfied about this amendment.  Does it mean to say that a residence which has a small farm attached to it, which is practically to all effects and purposes a demesne in point of view of utility and amenity, is not to be excluded under this provision?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the object is to be the reverse.  Sub-section <i>(b)</i> contains certain exceptions.  One of them is that any holding the main object of which was a residence, and the point raised by Senator Butler was that it should retain that character at the date of the passing of the Act.  In other words, that it should not be unless the land comprised in such holding has been used for at least three years prior to the passing of the Act as an ordinary agricultural farm.  His object was to exclude from the benefit of this exception any holding which, although it might be called a residence, had been for three years previously used as an ordinary farm, and the Government, through the Minister, suggests that that result might be better achieved by the use of the words &ldquo;and which at the date of the passing of this Act retains its residential character.&rdquo; It is only to preserve the character of residence up to the date of the passing of the Act.</P>

I do not think that such a farm ought to lose its residential character merely because it was not used as an ordinary farm at the time of the passing of the Act or three years before it.</P>

In Section 69, page 27, line 14, where they come in, is as a definition of land which is not tenanted land, or in other words land which is untenanted land.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that they may be added at the end of the section as an amplification, and to make sure that that particular class of land should come within the scope of the section.

The position is not altered by reason of there being an agister, a tenant of conacre, or someone who has taken a letting for temporary convenience.  It would be altered if we did not provide that such persons were not tenants.  If there were tenants it would vest, but we have provided that they shall not be regarded as tenants.  It does not, therefore, vest either as tenanted or untenanted land.</P>

      <P>I beg to propose the following amendment:&mdash;In Section 24, Sub-section (3): &ldquo;To insert after the word &lsquo;or&rsquo; in line 16 the words &lsquo;is a town park or land let for dairy purposes within or adjacent to an urban district or.&rsquo;&rdquo; Town parks were exempted in the Act of 1903, and in the Report of the Sub-Committee of the Convention of 1918, and also in the Bill of 1920.  The Minister in charge of this Bill has referred more than once to the fact that he has based a great number of the clauses in this Bill on the Bill of 1920.  I hope he will bear in mind the fact that town parks were exempted in that Bill.  They were always exempted from land legislation. They have a special value of their own, not so much in the interests of the owner, but in the interests of the town near which they are situated.  It may be wanted for building purposes, for the development of the town, for the promotion of trade, or for various other purposes. It is as much in the interests of towns as in the interests of the owners that it should be exempted.  The value of a town park greatly exceeds its letting value.  A man lets it for £10 or £15 a year, but in the open market it would be worth three times its capitalised value. As regards dairy lands, those are wanted in the interests of the amenities of the town or village for the purposes of dairying, which is of great importance to the poorer people of the district.  Seeing that it has been exempted in all previous Acts and in the abortive Bill of 1920, I hope that the Minister will exempt it now.</P>

      <P>Sir Hutcheson Poë is, in this case, full of the milk of <Col N="1802" /> human kindness, but I foresee a difficulty there may be with regard to town parks, because there are some places where towns wish to increase.  I am perfectly well aware that there are town parks used for dairying purposes, and I feel very strongly on this question of a pure milk supply for children.  It is a great thing to have dairying near towns, because there is not the difficulty of the milk being contaminated in transit.  That is a philanthropic notion.  I do not know what Sir Hutcheson Poë would think of a suggestion to leave out &ldquo;town park,&rdquo; and also &ldquo;let for dairy purposes.&rdquo;</P>

If a town is ringed round with occupiers it would mean there would be owners in fee, and it would be very difficult to acquire land for building purposes except at high prices.  The landlord might be willing to sell quite regardless of the interests of the town.  I do not think that that should be the only factor to be taken into consideration.  Land in the neighbourhood of towns is exempted when available for building purposes. That is the point about which there might be a good deal of contention, and it requires very serious consideration.</P>

      <P>It is not exactly right to say that no town parks were purchased under former Acts.  Where the Land Commission bought parks they often sold them to tenants.  Town parks may be either tenanted or untenanted. Consider the tenanted town parks for a moment.  If the tenants are not temporary but future tenants under the Act they would be entitled to purchase for this good reason.  This Bill sets out to complete Land Purchase, in fact to abolish the relations of landlord and tenant so far as agricultural land is concerned. We could not possibly omit future tenants who happen to be tenants near town, and who worked their land as agricultural land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is then the point, and it is a question of public policy, as to whether there was not a danger in selling all town parks to occupying tenants when that would prevent the town from developing by ringing it round with small owners in fee unwilling to part with their land.  To meet that specific case we inserted Sub-section (3).  Now, if any of <Col N="1803" /> those tenancies on which there are future tenants of town parks possess a potential or actual utility as building ground in the opinion of the Land Commission they will not be purchased.  That goes a long way to meet the objection to purchasing land near towns, and preventing towns from spreading.  Now, with regard to the price, we do agree, of course, that a better price should be given for land held nearer town than for ordinary agricultural land out in the country which is not as valuable from a good many points of view.</P>
    <P>To meet that case we inserted in Part 2 of the Second Schedule which deals with holdings subject to rents other than judicial rents, the words &ldquo;the annuity shall be fixed by the Land Commission on the report of their inspector, and without hearing in Court, regard being had to the nature and situation of the holding, the date of the commencement of the tenancy, the rent payable thereunder, and all the circumstances of the case.&rdquo; Of course, it is a fact that the tenants of town parks whose tenancy may be commenced 10 or 12 years ago, who own the land near towns and being for that reason extra valuable, and who in other respects are on all fours with agricultural tenants, it is only right that they should pay more for their holdings. We have tried at least to take all the special circumstances into account.  We were coerced to complete land purchase and deal with every tenant, to abolish the relation between landlord and tenant and deal with any tenant who in a general way farms agricultural land.  A large number of tenants of town parks would come in.  There were two objections: (1) that it would prevent the development of the towns, and (2) that the price should be something more than that of an ordinary agricultural tenancy. We provided for both.</P>
    <P>With regard to the points about dairying: if it is dairying land the tenant keeps cows.  He either keeps cows or he does not.  The holding is vested as before.  There is no difference if the land is tenanted.  If it is untenanted the Land Commission can vest the holding in trustees, under Section 66, which gives them ample power to vest any land in trustee for the purpose of pasturage or tillage, and these trustees may be any local authority, so that that point is adequately <Col N="1804" /> covered.  In all the circumstances of the case, we have to deal with town parks which were occupied by tenants who were agricultural tenants, and who work their land as a farm.  We had to do it, and it would be a very serious matter from the point of view of carrying this Bill if that were interfered with.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to accept the Minister's explanation. We see that the potential values of town parks for building is there given fair value of the holding.  That meets the point in my amendment, and I am prepared to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the main purpose for which this amendment has been advanced is secured under the Act, this question of building value.  The Minister said that we reserve in sub-clause <i>(e)</i> power to exclude lands of a potential building value. The land is going to vest on a certain date.  The Government cannot claim the spirit of prophecy.  These towns may in 5, 10, or 15 years develop considerable industrial activity, and wish to extend and in the meantime it has been ringed round owing to the inability of the Government to foresee this industrial development, which is quite natural, and we appreciate the owner of freehold land in raising the value as much as he can. Honestly I feel uneasy, and I cannot see that under the Bill at present potential building value does enable development in the future to be forecasted and anticipated and allowed for.  If the Government have any reluctance, and feel that this amendment will spoil the symmetry of the Bill, if they wish to be completely logical and abolish dual ownership in this case, I think they should consider whether the Land Commission will not retain these town parks, so that there will be no possibility of industrial development being strangled by a circle of freeholders round the town.  In most cases these town parks are owned by shopkeepers, and they are accommodation land to urban occupations.</P>

      <P>Before we dispose of the Financial Bills that are on the Orders of the Day it is right that I should say in justification of the members of the Press, who are rather concerned in the matter, that in reference to the incident that occurred this afternoon I have received a communication from the Chairman and Honorary Secretary of their Association to say: &ldquo;We desire to state explicitly and at once that no permission was given by our body to any person to occupy seats in the Press Gallery either to-day or at any other time.&rdquo; In further connection with that incident may I say that I have since ascertained that the facts are these: One of the officers of the Seanad, I being otherwise engaged, spoke to my colleague, the Deputy-Chairman, and obtained from him orders for admission of the two gentlemen concerned.  It was then ascertained that it was important that they should be in touch with those whom they were instructing, and accordingly the gentlemen of the Press saying that they would not interfere with them, and would not inconvenience them, these two gentlemen were accommodated with two seats there.  Had I known at the time that my colleague had given permission to these two gentlemen to be admitted into the precincts of the House I would have accepted full responsibility for the matter, and do so now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President (Minister for Finance) The PRESIDENT (Minister for Finance)">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT (Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with a number of different classes of officials.  First of all, it deals with what has been described as <Col N="1807" /> Dáil Civil Servants.  These are officials who have been in the employment of the First and Second Dáil, and who have been absorbed into the Civil Service of the Saorstát.  By machinery that has been set up by this Bill, it is proposed to give them the superannuation advantages that the present Civil Service of the Saorstát enjoys.  There was a verbal undertaking by more than one member of the old Dáil Cabinet that these advantages would be given to them, and we are carrying out or redeeming that pledge in the First Section.  As regards the Second Section, it deals with the reinstatement of persons who were dismissed from the Civil Service for political reasons.  During the last five or six years a number of Civil Servants were dismissed&mdash;mainly for political causes. Quite a number of others were dismissed for other causes.  A great many representations were made, shortly after the Provisional Government came into being, with a view to having these cases reconsidered. A committee was set up by the Minister for Finance, the membership of which was disclosed to the Dáil. In fact it was at the express wish of a number of members of the Dáil that the Committee was set up.  They examined and investigated a very large number of cases, restoring to their office a large number of Civil Servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once their term of office was determined when they were brought back again, it was necessary to bridge the periods, in order to give them the advantages that they would have had if their terms of appointment had not been determined.  The third Section deals with the reinstatment of members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police dismissed for the same reasons.  There was not a very large number of them, and, speaking from memory, I do not think it reached a dozen, but I am not banking on that as being an absolutely correct statement. At the moment my information is that there were half-a-dozen, but if they numbered two dozen I would not be surprised. Section 4 deals with certain cases of persons belonging to three particular forces&mdash;the Criminal Investigation Department, Citizens' Defence Force, and the Protective Force.  Two of these &mdash;the Criminal Investigation Department <Col N="1808" /> and the Protective Force&mdash;figured in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Citizens' Defence Force does not figure in the Estimates.  A number of questions were raised in the Dáil as to what this Force was, by whom it was officered, and other questions of that nature were asked.  The Criminal Investigation Department is well known, and I do not expect it is necessary to go into any explanation of it.  The Protective Force is also described in the Estimates, and I think no question will arise about it.  The third one&mdash;the Citizens' Defence Force&mdash;was mobilised about March or April.  Perhaps some of the members were mobilised in February.  I do not remember the exact date.  We found after it was mobilised that there was no fund from which the services of its members could have been allowed for.  It was paid out of the Secret Service Fund. These men belonging to these two organisations were mainly used for protecting houses, sometimes for protecting persons.  They carried arms, and in some cases there were casualties amongst them.  One case occurred in Beresford Place where, it may be in the recollection of the Seanad, a bomb was left outside the Income Tax office, and the man on duty there unfortunately opened the door, and the bomb exploded, killing him. Now, we consider that that man gave his life in the defence of the State, and if there were dependants, that those dependants should have some means provided for them by the State for the loss and sacrifice they made for its safety.  Some of them were wounded&mdash; some accidentally.  The particular charge in that case will not be very considerable.</P>
    <P>The fifth clause is&mdash;it appears that somewhere about 1914 the amendment of the Teachers' Pension Rules was in contemplation, but it appears that this particular amendment or order, or whatever it was at the time, did not come into operation until October, and the Pensions Increase Act of 1920 dealt with the period &mdash;I think it was&mdash;the 4th of August, 1914.  Although it is generally admitted that the Pensions Act ought to have applied to the particular amendment that was made in the Teachers' Pension Rules, but could not, by reason of the dates, the teachers who benefited by the amendment did not get any increase in the amounts that they benefited by according <Col N="1809" /> to this particular amendment Last year, very shortly after the Provisional Government was set up, representations were made to General Collins, who was Chairman of the Provisional Government, and he undertook to rectify this particular grievance that the teachers believed themselves to be suffering from by reason of this.  We rectified the mistake as from April, 1922, redeeming his promise to that extent.</P>
    <P>Sections 6, 7 and 8 deal with certain technicalities of the law giving to certain individuals rights that they ought to possess, but by reason of the change of Government or the change of certain Departments they might possibly suffer disadvantages if power were not taken here to rectify them.  Also, in Section 7 there is provision made for determining certain funds and giving certain legal definitions to funds which might otherwise lead to dispute and to the disadvantage of certain officials.  That is a brief summary of the main purposes of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a second time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Agreed.</P>
