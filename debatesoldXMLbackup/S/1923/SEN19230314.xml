      <P>It is usual on the opening day of our proceedings to allow any Senator who has not yet qualified by taking the Oath to do so.  I understand that a Senator recently elected cannot be present at the opening of the sitting, but hopes to be here later on, and I, therefore, propose to adjourn that matter, so that he may have the opportunity of taking the Oath, if convenient for him to attend later to-day.  Now the first matter upon the Agenda is the Second and Third Stages of the District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Bill.  I might mention, as there seems to be some misunderstanding about that, that this Bill is purely a temporary Bill, that it does not propose the permanent appointment of any of the officials mentioned in it, that it is entitled &ldquo;An Act to make temporary provision for the appointment, etc.&rdquo; The whole matter with regard to these District Justices is at present before the Judiciary Committee, and the question as to their future and status, and so forth, is one of the matters upon which that Committee will make a very detailed report.  I only mention that because some of the amendments, of which notice is given, seem to be based upon the assumption that this is a permanent, and not, as it is, in fact, a purely transitory measure until the final form and shape of these Courts have been legislated for, following the report of the Judiciary Committee.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I would like to know if there is any reasonable explanation as to why we only received the Order Papers on entering the Seanad, although it is three weeks since we last met; also, how it is that both the District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Bill and another Bill <Col N="416" /> have been put down for Committee stage, although we only got copies of these Bills as they left the Dáil, when we were entering the House to-day.  I think you will agree, a Chathaoirligh, there is some reason for complaint when we find that the Standing Orders themselves are not being observed, and that it is quite impossible to do our business in a proper manner if this slipshod method of arranging the business of the day is to be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is only right to say that the responsibility for the complaint, the natural complaint that the Senator has made does not rest upon the Seanad or its officials.  My object, of course, is to convene the Seanad as often as possible, as long as there is business for it.  I do not like, and I have been requested by a great many Senators not to do so, to convene the Seanad and to put Senators to the inconvenience of attending here unless and until it is fairly certain that there will be a reason able amount of business for them to discharge. Consequently I summoned them for to-day in the belief, as we were informed from the Dáil, that a certain number of Bills were ready and could be circulated in time so as to be in the hands of Senators, in order that they might have an opportunity for considering them and framing such amendments as they might think fit.  Accordingly I thought that I had a sufficient programme ready that I might place on the Agenda for to-day which would ensure the Seanad being occupied for at least two, if not three full working days.  In that, unfortunately, I have been disappointed.  In the first place I might mention that one of the most important of these Bills, that is the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Bill, which is being circulated amongst the members of the Seanad, was sent to us in the shape in which it left the Committee.  Since then it has been materially altered on the Report Stage in the Dáil, and it was only this morning we received a print of the measure as it now stands, and in the position in which it left the Dáil.  Consequently it has been a premature act on our part, through no fault of our officials, to put this Bill on the Agenda, because it would be impossible to discuss it in <Col N="417" /> Committee to-day for the reasons I have told you, that it was only printed last night, and only came into our hands this morning.  The members of the Seanad will understand that as far as the officials and myself are concerned we have done our best to provide a working Agenda for to-day.</P>

      <P>I think it is only right that I should say, as a country member of the Seanad living more than 70 miles from Dublin, and with railway communication interrupted for the last ten days in my side of the country, that I have been fortunate in the matter of having received copies of all the Bills on the Agenda for to-day. With the exception of the Bill which was only printed last night I received copies of all the others on Monday last.  I think it is only fair to the officials of the Seanad that I should make that statement.</P>

      <P>At any rate the Seanad can quite see that while these little accidents must happen, we hope for the day when they will become less frequent, and that the issue of these papers and the circulation of Bills will become a matter of mere practical routine, and that the members of the Seanad will not have any good reason for complaints by and bye.  At present we are more or less feeling our way, and have got to do it with a certain amount of difficulty, having regard to the difficulties which I mentioned, illustrated by what has happened with regard to this Bill, the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Bill.</P>

      <P>I quite agree.  We shall have to make some regulation by which no Bill will be taken in Committee until the expiration of a certain number of days after the Second Reading in the Seanad.  We shall have to do something of that kind, but up to the present we have been working on Bills that were Emergency Bills, and with regard to which there was great urgency, and the Seanad on many occasions, <Col N="418" /> realising that, allowed Bills to go through under conditions which they would not agree to, I am certain, in the future, as a matter of regular practice.</P>

      <P>Would it not be convenient, in view of what is stated, if we were to take up to-day the Second Stage of the various Bills on the Agenda, or as many of them as we could reach, and to-morrow the Committee Stage of the District Justices Bill, which has been in our hands for a considerable time, and leave until next week the Committee Stage of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Bill and the Electoral Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that would become essential as regards the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Bill, because the final draft of that Bill was only printed yesterday, and only came into your hands and mine to-day, and, therefore, it is plain, I think, that we cannot go beyond the formal reading of that Bill for the second time to-day. I do not see any reason, Senator Douglas, why we might not dispose, if the Seanad so desires or thinks fit, of the District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Bill.  It has been in the hands of Senators for some time; a certain number of amendments have been tabled to it, and I think we might dispose of them.  There is another Bill we might put through all its stages, and that is the Bill with regard to the provision for the family and dependents of the late lamented Arthur Griffith.  This Bill is a money Bill, and we have no power to alter or amend it, and the Seanad will agree with me that it is a Bill that we should put through all its stages to-day.</P>

      <P>Before you put the motion, of course it is quite obvious that my hon. friend is quite right in raising a question on a point of order.  We cannot conduct our business with any sort of satisfaction if the procedure under which we have been conducting the work is persisted in.  Now, we are supposed to exercise some sort of intelligent criticism on the various measures sent up to us. Some of us received some time ago an Agenda setting out that certain measures would be laid before us to-day.  At the last minute we find that this has been changed, through no fault of our executive official, and the result is that we are in a condition of some confusion.  I hope that in future we will have order and regularity in our proceedings, so that Senators, who have other engagements and various other matters to arrange, may have some idea as to what claims are likely to be made on their time here. I think to-day that we are to discuss the Second Reading of this Temporary Provisions Bill, to which there are some amendments.  I do not know if we are going to take up the Local Government Bill.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister, who is here, if all the offices of the Clerks of Petty Sessions are abolished, and if they are getting any compensation, or if they are entitled to any pension.  I think it would help us in discussing the matter if the Minister would tell us how they stand. I believe there are some two hundred of these people, or, rather, there were before this present state of affairs came about.  Their number will be reduced to some thirty or forty owing to the services of the others having been dispensed with.  Therefore, there will be about one hundred and fifty of these people all over Ireland out of employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where the difficulty comes in in assuming that these things will occur in regard to a temporary measure of this sort.  In so far as we have considered this matter in the Judiciary Committee, it is by no means certain&mdash;in fact, it is highly improbable&mdash;that the result the Senator anticipates will flow.  At present you must remember that the number of District Justices that have been appointed is very small&mdash;quite inadequate, in fact, to what will be required if the system is to be adopted generally throughout the Free State.  The existing number are only such as have been appointed to carry out the temporary duties in districts in which it is possible to do so.  If <Col N="421" /> it becomes an accepted part of our judicial system the number required will be greatly in excess of our present number, and, consequently, those officials Senator Moore is interested in may not be dispensed with at all.  That will depend, of course, upon the extent to which the Judiciary Committee may make recommendations and the extent to which those recommendations may be approved in this or the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>That clears the matter to a certain extent, but meanwhile those people have received notices of dismissal, and some of them are in very bad financial condition.  Some of them have written to me saying they are starving, and do not see any way out, and do not know what their position is. I dare say the matter can be quite easily explained.  If the Minister would give us some idea as to what is the state of affairs in connection with these people it would help us very much in considering the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kevin O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I got notice of two questions from Senator Colonel Moore on this matter, and I will answer them now.  The first question is: &ldquo;Would the Minister state the number of Court Districts in County Mayo, and have the District Court Clerks for that county been already appointed?&rdquo; The number of Court Districts in County Mayo may be expected to be about twenty.  The precise number cannot be stated until the scheme of Court Districts required by the Bill to be made has been completed.  Up to the present the old Petty Sessions Districts have only been tentatively grouped.  The second question: &ldquo;Were there some two hundred Petty Sessions Clerks, and have they all been dismissed by one sweeping order, with the result that some are in great destitution, and will any compensation be granted them?&rdquo; Answer: All the disbanded Petty Sessions Clerks are entitled to compensation under the Treaty, and these pensions are in course of calculation by the Ministry of Finance, which is the Ministry responsible for this matter.  The Petty Sessions Clerks' office was abolished, but the Petty Sessions Clerk is not ineligible for appointment <Col N="422" /> to the position of Clerk to the District Sessions Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the question raised has reference to a different matter.  I gather from the remarks made by you (Cathaoirleach) that you assume that Senator Colonel Moore was interested in Justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no, certainly not.  I quite understood what Senator Colonel Moore meant.  What I meant to point out to Senator Colonel Moore is this&mdash;it is quite possible, and I would go so far as to say probable, that a great many of these Petty Sessions Clerks will be continued in the position of Clerks to the new Justices if the scheme of appointing District Justices is developed and extended.  At present it is only in an experimental stage. I may mention that none of the Justices holding office has any tenure at all. They have been appointed purely provisionally and temporarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to the appointment of Justices, but to the question of Petty Sessions Clerks that Senator Colonel Moore raised. I think on the whole this is a good measure, and I am inclined to support it.  But the administration of this Bill will very largely depend upon the people who hold the position of Clerks, or whatever you like to call them, in these new Courts.  What I would submit is that, whether the present occupants have pensions or not&mdash;I take it that some of them are pensionable, probably a number of them are pensionable, and a number of them are not pensionable on account of their period of service and so forth&mdash;I think it important for the administration of law in this country that you should have people who to some extent are conversant with the routine. Anybody who has attended Courts under the old regime will know how much depends upon the efficient carrying out of routine matters.  I hope that the Government will not be in too great a hurry to dispense with the services of trained men, men who can give great assistance in the matter of the application of the law&mdash;I am not saying of the administration of the law.  That is a matter <Col N="423" /> for the Justices, but in the details as to precedent and in finding references to the statutes and so forth, in the old days some Petty Sessions Clerks&mdash;at all events, those certainly with whom I have been in contact&mdash;were very efficient. The Seanad will, I am sure, agree with me that a great deal depends upon the knowledgeable exercise of the functions of those Courts, and I therefore hope that the Government will not be in too great a hurry to dispense with the practical experience of trained men. The appointment of District Justices is a good proposal, and their duties must be defined.  The rearrangement of the country into Petty Sessions Districts is a matter that may usefully be taken in hands, and that must be done to suit the convenience of the various localities as far as possible and to suit their facilities for communication so as to bring these Courts within easy reach of the greatest possible number of those who are likely to use them.  I have already referred to Section 5.  Of course, we know the Civic Guard must act in the place of the Royal Irish Constabulary. As to the matter of the increase of Petty Sessions fees, I would say that if people are foolish enough to go to law there is no reason why the State should not benefit to some extent, and I see no reason why the State should not get a little more money out of them.  Obviously Clause 8 is necessary.  You must have the acts that have been done, the decisions that have been reached, during the period of this practical interregnum confirmed.  You must have some stability somewhere.  Therefore Clause 8 is useful.  The Adaptation of Enactments and so forth are obviously necessary.  I think this is a useful Bill. The only point I would like to make is that I hope that experience in the administration of this Bill will not be lost sight of, and will be utilised as far as it can legitimately be utilised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move, in Section 1, Sub-section (1) to omit the words &ldquo;on the advice of the Executive Council.&rdquo;  I am rather diffident in proposing this, as this is only a temporary measure.  I believe, unless there is some strong reason for it, which there may be in a temporary measure, or in a permanent measure appointing Justices in the way <Col N="425" /> that this Bill proposes to do, that the Executive Council as a body render themselves liable for the responsibility of the appointments, and that if at any time the Houses should challenge one of these appointments, and if a motion should be carried against the appointments, it would be a vote of censure upon the Executive Council, that is, upon the Government.  I believe that the practice is that the Governor-General must act on the advice of a Minister or of the Executive Council, so that I think the words &ldquo;on the advice of the Executive Council&rdquo; are not really needed.  It is quite sufficient to say that it is lawful for the Governor-General of the Free State to appoint fit and proper persons. He can only make the appointments on the advice of his Executive Council or of a Minister of the Executive Council. If such a state of affairs arose as I am suggesting, and that a vote of the Houses should go against the appointment, if a Justice had done something which the Houses disapproved of, and if a motion to reduce his salary was carried, it would be a real vote of censure on the Executive Council.  If the words are omitted there is no difference in the responsibility of the Governor-General to act, but when the responsibility came to be argued it would lie on the Minister alone who recommended the appointment, and not on the whole Executive Council.</P>
      <P>It seems probably quite absurd to raise such a question on a Bill that is only to last for 12 months, and the probability may be that the Executive Council feel perfectly safe in taking the responsibility during the year, as none of these appointments are in the least likely to be challenged in the way I suggest during that time.  I am really putting forward the amendment more for the future, because it does seem a bad practice to quote collectively the whole Executive Council as being required to give their advice when, as a matter of fact, they have to give it in all cases, and it is to be implied in the action which the Governor-General takes.  I have no doubt that the Minister in charge will tell us why it has been done, but I propose to omit these words largely with the object of extracting that information.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies I think it would also be a great advantage to the Seanad if he would kindly tell us whether it is the distinct intention of the Government in bringing in this Bill that it should be a purely temporary measure, because looking at some of its provisions they would seem to contemplate permanence over a substantial period, yet, at the end the last clause says: &ldquo;This Act shall continue in force for one calendar year after the passing thereof, and shall then expire.&rdquo; The reason I am anxious that the Seanad should get a distinct assurance on that point is that a good deal of discussion, which otherwise would take place, might become unnecessary if the Seanad was satisfied that this Bill was intended to last for a year, and a year only, more particularly in view of the fact that the Judiciary Committee has been very busily occupied in considering this very question, and we propose to make an elaborate report upon it, that is to say, as to the duties, constitution, etc., of these District Justices.  Of course the report will only make recommendations, but if this Bill is intended to be anything in the nature of a permanency our recommendations would be too late.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill at present before the Seanad is a temporary measure.  The Judiciary Committee will report to the Executive Council, and legislation will follow on that report, reviewing and overhauling the entire system of administration of justice in the country.  This is a temporary Bill to meet the necessities of the situation existing at present.  As to this amendment by Senator Jameson, neither House could move to reduce the salary of an individual District Justice.  The salaries of District Justices come before them <i>en bloc</i>, and it would not, I think, be entertained that a motion could be put down for the reduction of a particular District Justice's salary.  That is not the way in which the misconduct of a District Justice would be dealt with. It would be dealt with in a straightforward frontal attack on the Minister responsible for the activities of the District Justices.  It is rather in that way that a District Justice's conduct in his <Col N="427" /> office will be challenged.  The constitutional position of the Governor-General is not as well known to everyone as it is to Senator Jameson, and, I am sure, to all the members of the Seanad.  The fact that it is set down that these people are appointed by him on the advice of the Executive Council is simply to make it clear to the meanest intellect in the country that these are not patronage appointments made by the Governor-General of his own will, but that they are appointments made by a Minister who is responsible to the people through the Dáil.  And in that sense these Justices go out amongst the people with a popular mandate.  That it should be the Executive Council should be there rather than the Minister for Home Affairs is, I think, obvious.  The Governor-General does not act, that particular piece of machinery does not move, at the instance of an individual Minister, but moves only at the instance of the Executive Council as a whole.  As I am the Minister responsible for this Bill I would not approve of the amendment, although there is no very vital matter at stake, and I think it is well to have set out in that section that these appointments are made at the instance of a responsible Minister and submitted to the Executive Council, approved by them, and put up by them to the Governor-General.</P>

      <P>I am glad Senator Jameson moved this amendment, if only for the purpose of getting the statement that was so clearly made as to the constitutional position of the Governor-General in regard to the making of these appointments.  At the same time, I hope he will not press the amendment. I think it would be a mistake to have it go out without a proper understanding, without the explanation that has been made fairly clear to us by Senator Jameson, that we were removing words that made it perfectly clear the way the Governor-General could act and on whose behalf he acts in making appointments.  For that reason I hope the amendment will not be pressed on this occasion.  I gather that the object Senator Jameson has in mind will not be lost sight of in the future, as I think it is one of very considerable importance. <Col N="428" /> I gather that this Bill, being only for one year, the appointments have virtually already mostly been made by the Executive Council, and that there is no vital principle involved in letting it pass through.  At the same time, I take it that what Senator Jameson desires is to obviate any semblance of party political appointments in future appointments of District Justices.  If that is what he is aiming at I think his aim is one we could all unite on.  I hope that will be taken into consideration by the Committee considering future judicial appointments, and that the moving of the amendment will bring this matter to a head, so that it will be carefully considered and suitable machinery found by which the appointment of District Justices will be made on the grounds of competency and suitability, without any reference to politics.  I think what Senator Jameson is aiming at will be achieved without pressing the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that Senator Jameson brought forward the amendment, if it was for no other reason than to bring out the statement made by the Deputy Chairman. Under the old regime magistrates or District Justices were appointed because of political services rendered, and not because they had the necessary qualifications for the position.  We know that justice was not meted out in every case, but was meted out according to the political spectacles worn by the presiding Justice.  It is common knowledge that in this City of Dublin a couple of years ago a raid was made on a house for a young man.  He could not be found, but his younger brother was in the house and was arrested, because the brother could not be found, and was brought before the Divisional Magistrate in Dublin. There was no evidence against him only that he had a fountain pen and pencil in his pocket.  The magistrate could not at first swallow at a gulp the request to sentence this young man for committing no crime, and he had to think over the matter overnight.  It is known to most people who take an interest in these matters that the magistrate receives his orders overnight, and this young man was sentenced to six months' imprisonment next morning. <Col N="429" /> That is what comes from appointing magistrates for political services rendered. I am not suggesting that the present Executive Council would be guilty of appointing such men, but I think we should always provide against the possible consequences of people being appointed to responsible positions like this because of political services rendered. I think the Judiciary Committee ought to be able to devise a scheme whereby competitive examinations would be held and men and women would be appointed to these responsible positions because of their qualifications and fitness alone.</P>

      <P>On the whole, I think it is better to leave the appointment of those Justices to the Ministry.  They are responsible appointments.  The Justices discharge responsible duties, and the full responsibility for their appointment ought to remain with those who make them. One difficulty may arise, judging from the remarks made by the Minister for Home Affairs.  It is possible that it may be necessary to defeat a Government in order to remove a magistrate. It might be difficult to defeat a Government, and therefore the magistrate would be practically irremovable.  However, I am prepared to agree it is better to have those appointments made on the authority of the Government of the day. I am particularly glad to see that these appointments are made practically permanent under this Bill.  It does not follow that the appointments will be permanent, but I take it that the purport of the legislation that the Government favour is that these appointments should be permanent ones.  Of course, that makes a good deal for the better administration of justice.  A judge should be permanent and independent, and should not be liable to be influenced by any consideration as regards security of tenure, or a consideration of a political nature. The clause is good as it stands, and perhaps Senator Jameson, having elicted a statement from the Minister, will not press his amendment.</P>

I think the Minister thoroughly understands that, so I do not propose to deal with the speeches.  The words &ldquo;advice of the Executive Council&rdquo; being inserted there are really put in, as the Minister has told us, temporarily to explain what this is.  If it was a permanent Bill we were discussing I really think it would be worth while pressing the amendment.

The words &ldquo;Solicitors of the Supreme Court&rdquo; means that you are getting a man who has had at least five years' study of his profession.  A barrister has, I am told, only three years when he is called, and when appointed he might be two years junior in the practice of his profession to what a solicitor might be.  In appointing District Justices we would be more satisfied to have men of some experience.  It would be well if we knew that they had at least two years' practice at the Bar.  That is putting, quite shortly, the whole object of the amendment.  It is to make certain that no barrister is appointed who <Col N="431" /> has just been called, and that we will have men who have had some practice in the profession.</P>

      <P>If the Seanad were inclined to be enthusiastic about this amendment I would not persist in any opposition, but I would like to suggest just a few reasons why they might hesitate to adopt it.  If those appointments are, in fact, made at the discretion of a Minister appointed by the President, and approved by the Dáil, the Minister is assumed to have sufficient discretion to enable him to decide who is, and who is not, a proper person for those positions. The person who he thinks is to be appointed has to run the gauntlet of the Executive Council.  Appointments of this kind are very carefully considered. The Senator's object is obvious.  He does not wish inexperienced men appointed to positions.  They would be going out among people with the responsibility of administering the law, and the law should not be brought into contempt owing to the indiscretion of such young men.  There is this side of it.  Very frequently in this country, at any rate, you would have men who would be for over 10, 15, or 20 years, managing clerks of a solicitor's office.  Clerks of that kind get special facilities to graduate and become members of the solicitors' profession. You might have men who had all the responsibilities of management in a solicitor's office for 10 or 12 years passing their final solicitor's examination, but who if this amendment were adopted would be ineligible for appointment as District Justices, though they might be extremely capable, level-headed men, and have had 15 or 20 years' close experience.</P>

Several Senators speaking to the last clause stated that it was very necessary that these Judges shall be independent. We all remember in past times the slur that was implied on Removable Justices.  They used to be appointed by the English Government and sent round the country with orders to do certain things, and to punish people for certain things, and if they did not do so&mdash;sometimes they were independent men&mdash;they were subject to removal by the Government, and they required a good deal of pressure.  I knew a man myself who did not like carrying out these orders, but people were forced by the threat of dismissal to do so.  I do not say for a moment that the present Government is likely to do any such thing.  I am perfectly sure they would not, but when we are passing a Bill it ought to be laid down that it should not be in the power of any Ministry&mdash;it may not be this Ministry, but a totally different Ministry in the future&mdash;to adopt the principle that was established in old times of dismissing Judges because they displeased them.  Therefore, I suggest that instead of putting down &ldquo;at the pleasure of the Governor-General&rdquo; to substitute &ldquo;for reasons stated&rdquo;; that means that the Minister who represents the Governor-General shall give some reasons why he is dismissing a man Again, I need not say that I am making no slur at all on the present or any future Ministry, but it is a discretion that ought not be allowed.  It is of the greatest importance that Judges ought to be independent of the Ministry, and that they should not fear the displeasure of any man.  They should be able to give their sentences without regard to what any Minister might think of them.  Remember that crimes are sometimes political, sometimes so-called political crimes, and a Ministry may be in power at the time who would have an object to gain by insisting on certain punishments being made.  For that reason I propose my amendment.</P>

      <P>If Senator Colonel Moore's amendment were accepted the section would then read &ldquo;every person appointed to be a District Justice may be dismissed or removed for reasons stated by the Governor-General of the Free State on the advice of the Executive Council.&rdquo;  Now, to whom should the Governor-General state the reasons, and is it right that the Governor-General should state reasons for any action that he takes solely on the advice of the Executive Council?  Against the general principle that there should be some statement by the responsible Minister when a District Justice is being removed from his office there is really very little to be said.  It would probably, no doubt, at all times be easy to give such a reason, and to give the exact reason, but whether it is advisable to set that down in a Bill as a hard and fast rule is another question.  Men are sent out to administer the law, and it is reasonable to expect from them that going out in that capacity they will maintain a standard of personal conduct fitting men who are sent out to administer the law.  One does not expect them to be plaster saints in their areas, or anything like that.  Still one does expect a high moral standard, a high standard of decency and respectability. A person who would fail either flagrantly or frequently to maintain such a standard would be a proper case for dismissal or removal, and yet it might be a very unfair thing to that man to state openly in the Parliament of the country the reasons for his dismissal.  It would certainly give him very little chance in after life, or in seeking other positions.  Senator Colonel Moore spoke of Removables, and the odium that attached to them, and to the position generally in the past.  I should hope that we realise that the Removables of the past could not by any stretch of the imagination be said to be responsible to or removable by people who were responsible to the Irish nation and the Irish people. <Col N="435" /> Just therein lies all the difference that we have now, although some people have difficulty in realising it, a responsible Go vernment in Ireland, and the people are in the saddle, and any Governmental functions exercised in this country in the future will be exercised by the will and with the authority of the people.  A man who is removable by the Executive Council, because that is what it comes to, by the Governor-General acting on the advice of the Executive Council, with that Executive Council responsible to the people's representatives sitting in Parliament, is in a very different position from the Removable of the past, who simply stayed or went at the wish of people in offices in Dublin Castle. That is the change that has come, and it is a change which people are slow to realise, just as a man coming out from a dark tunnel is blinded by excessive light, but it is a change that makes all the difference, and it is not a fair or just comparison to speak of the District Judges of to-day as comparable to the Removable Justices of the past.</P>

      <P>In discussing Senator Moore's amendment we were again up against the question of a temporary Bill, but I think the Senator is probably perfectly right, if this was a permanent Bill, in asking that Justices should not be made dependent for the tenure of their positions on the Ministers of the day, but I believe that that will certainly be one of the matters that the Judiciary Committee will inquire into. In looking through this Bill one saw this clause, and saw that it meant that a certain branch of the Judiciary depended upon what&mdash;great though the trust we have in them&mdash;is still a political Government. In a permanent measure that would probably not be wise.  There is no question that an authority with power of dismissal must be over these Justices during the continuance of this Bill, and I cannot possibly see how any better authority could be placed over them than the Governor-General, acting on the advice of the Executive Council.  I believe in this that the Government have acted perfectly correctly; they must have some authority over the District Justices, and I cannot think of <Col N="436" /> any better authority that could be put in this temporary measure.</P>

      <P>The Senator's point is very sound.  I raised this matter myself with the Attorney-General as to the advisability or necessity for confining the District Justices strictly to the duties of their offices, as, of course, in fact and practice they are restricted.  The only reason for not putting in such an explicit restriction as that embodied in the Senator's amendment is a reason which An Cathaoirleach will probably appreciate better than most of us.  It is simply so that those men who, after all, have no security of tenure, and who are acting purely in a temporary capacity at the moment, would not lose seniority in the profession.  It applies, I think, solely to those of them who are barristers-at-law rather than to solicitors, but in practice no person acting as a District Justice would be allowed to carry on other work, and, of course, all of them have from 20 to 23 or 24 days actual work per month, and are not likely to attempt other work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would invite the consideration of the Minister as to whether or not if this sub-section is retained in the Bill there would not be a temptation to the District Justice to postpone the consideration of the case until it suited his own convenience. That is the only point I wanted to make.  He might postpone it until he <Col N="440" /> was coming to the district again where the case was to be tried, and the prisoner might be held up longer than was necessary, and I suggest that the District Justice should be compelled to hold a special court, and not to leave the prisoner in custody for a long period, but to deal with him as quickly as possible. If the Minister thinks there is nothing in the Bill which renders any danger of that I will not press the amendment, but I just merely want to call attention to the matter, and I will be quite satisfied if I get a satisfactory assurance.</P>

      <P>This amendment is one which I have been advised by my Department to oppose strongly.  It is a very serious amendment.  It arises from a reluctance to allow a prisoner to be remanded by a Parish Commissioner for a very long time, perhaps one month, which would be possible under this section as it stands at present.  The objections to the amendment are: Although under the Bill as it stands the Parish Commissioner has power to remand for a period sometimes as long as a month, it is not to be assumed that he will use that power except when absolutely necessary. The prisoner will in practice be produced from the custody into which he is remanded on the first convenient opportunity&mdash;that is, as soon as a District Justice finds it at all possible to pay a visit to the locality in question.  The District Justice will be informed by this Ministry that it is highly undesirable that any remand should be allowed to extend in practice over more than fourteen days.  It must not be imagined that even if the amendment passes the prisoner cannot be kept in custody on remand for a very long period.  The only difference will be that under the amendment it will be necessary to produce the prisoner for remand every eight days, and to send him back again as many times as may be necessary.  That is hardly any great benefit to the prisoner.  The period proposed by the amendment (8 days) is too short.  One District Justice took great pains to impress on the Ministry the fact that he could not work his district on an eight-day remand system once the work got normally heavy Apart from the length of the remand, this amendment proposes to confer on <Col N="441" /> the Parish Commissioners the power to refuse informations.  It is the unanimous opinion of those to whom this Bill was submitted, and of the District Justices themselves, that such a power should not be conferred on a Parish Commissioner. Our conception of the duties of a Parish Commissioner in this connection is that he should do as little as possible. He should leave the question of guilt or innocence entirely to the District Justice; he should act merely as a first rough intermediary between the police and the public, so as to prevent the police from keeping people in custody without the consent of an independent civilian.  If the amendment is passed, people will insist on going fully into the evidence and merits of their case before a Parish Commissioner in the hope of informations being refused.  Our Parish Commissioners will not be fit, for a long time anyhow, to hear evidence properly, and to decide the <i>prima facie</i> question of guilt or innocence.  Besides that, they will be, in general, neighbours, and perhaps friends, of the accused, and they should not be subject to the ordeal of having the option of release.  The responsibility and odium attaching to refusing release ought not to be placed upon the Parish Commissioner. The idea was to get away definitely also from the old honorary magisterial system&mdash;from the idea of having people administering the law who were subject to local odium and local pressure of many kinds. In the past you had as magistrates administering the law people who were dependent on the goodwill of the public for their means of livelihood.  They were not independent, and they were not happy.  They realised that themselves, and would tell you so&mdash;that it was almost too big a burden to place on a man, to administer the law strictly, impartially, and impersonally in a neighbourhood where he was depending on the public for his livelihood and the maintenance of his family.  Dispensary doctors, shopkeepers, and so on were placed in that position; and that happened which inevitably might be expected to happen. This Bill which is now before you proposes a clean cut with that idea, and you send out amongst the people professional men who know the law, who are in an independent position, and who <Col N="442" /> will give the people a cleaner and more impartial and a more impersonal administration of the law than they ever had before.  This amendment would constitute a slight departure, but a departure, from that idea to the extent that it would place on these Parish Commissioners the onus&mdash;would put into their hands the power of refusing informations in a particular case.  We do not propose to give the Parish Commissioners that power yet; the amendment involves it, and it would mean that these men would frequently have to face that position in the case of prisoners brought before them.  The question whether they would release or imprison them would lie in their discretion.  We think that local people, subject to local pressure, ought not be placed in that position.</P>

There are a great number of them who have a considerable claim to any offices that may be available of the same sort.  There are also the Registrars of the former Dáil Courts to be considered.  They also consider they have a certain amount of claim, and if the Minister can see his way to give either of these two classes a preference over new people I think it would be only fair to these men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will be general agreement with the reasonableness of giving clerks who have already acted as Petty Sessions Clerks, or as Dáil Court Registrars, preference in the making of future appointments for the District Courts.  While agreeing with that principle, I do not think it would be advisable to lay it down as an absolute condition that any clerk appointed to one of these Courts should have functioned in that capacity in the past.  If such a condition were adopted I am afraid it would tend to restrict the range of selection too much, and that it might considerably hamper the efficiency of the staffs to be appointed to these courts in future.  While agreeing, generally, with the principle, and while hoping that the Government will, subject to efficiency, give preference to those existing officials, I should not feel justified in voting for an amendment which would make all the appointments absolutely restricted to these men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>That about sums up the attitude of the Department to this amendment.  It simply puts a fence around the position, and in practice, says that either of the two classes of men shall be appointed.  In many areas the truth of the position is this: that those who were Dáil Court Registrars are in arms against the Government, and, occasionally, here and there throughout the country you have the position with regard to the old Petty Sessions Clerk, that, in the strenuous times that are past, he took an attitude which made him absolutely obnoxious to the majority of the people in the district.  It is simply a matter of facing facts, that you would destroy your courts&mdash;respect <Col N="446" /> for your courts and their prestige&mdash;by making such an appointment.  Now, things may be right in the abstract, and utterly out of the question in practice. In the face of concrete facts, I certainly would not like to have political responsibility for appointing certain of the old Petty Session Clerks to be Registrars of the present courts.  It would not be good for the courts, and because it would not be good for the courts, it would not be good for the country or for the people of the country.  The whole stability of the country depends on these courts, and on the extent to which their writ runs, and on the respect and obedience they get from the people.  They have to be handled very delicately, and I can assure Senators that the number of factors and considerations that have to be weighed in making the most insignificant of these appointments, is very considerable.  You have to balance one thing against another all the time, and you have to strike a medium.  We have not gone out to victimise or to declare war on any section of the community, but we have had to consider public feeling and popular feeling in the district in which these appointments had to be made, and that was a very relevant factor in the making of them.</P>
      <P>If the Senator's amendment were accepted it would simply add more difficulties to what is already, and, at the moment, a delicate question enough, and the question that has given quite a lot of trouble to the Department, and is likely to give quite a lot more.</P>

But, in view of the delicacy of the situation we had much better to leave the matter in the hands of the Minister, and give him every latitude in these appointments.</P>

      <P>On a point of Order if you are going to take the Report stage now I wish to protest very strongly.  In the first place the Report stage is not on the Agenda.  It is a matter of principle with me because I have no amendment down.  It nullifies the whole value of having stages at all if all the stages are to be taken together. <Col N="451" /> It seems to me to make a farce of stages. For that reason I protest against taking the next stage of the Bill now particularly as there is other business to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it should not be taken so much as a matter of protest as a matter which the Seanad should consider with regard to its entire future procedure.  I am quite certain the Cathaoirleach wishes to carry out the wishes of the Seanad with regard to the various Bills and the various stages of the Bills.  I think, personally, we ought during the next few days, when we will have to consider the revision of the Standing Orders, make up our minds definitely as to whether we wish to take the various stages of Bills as at present. We have five stages for Bills and four stages in the case of Bills coming from the Dáil, as most of our Bills do. There is one stage which is of a formal character.  There are then two stages which take amendments&mdash;First, the Committee Stage, and secondly the Report Stage.  Personally I do not see very much objection, where a Bill has been before the members for a considerable time, and when we have no other business, to taking the Second and then the Committee Stage.  I do think that it is objectionable to take the next stage at which amendments can be moved without at least allowing a moderate time for further consideration.  One reason that I feel rather strongly on the question is that when you make amendments in a Bill in Committee Stage, it is almost inevitable that the very making of these <Col N="452" /> amendments will involve consequential amendments which can not be brought up at the time.  That is, I think, the main reason for the Report Stage, and I think it is almost essential that there should be a moderate time allowed between the two stages.  My personal view is&mdash;and I think the Seanad should make up its mind one way or another without delay&mdash;that there should be at least a week from the time the Bill is received by us until the Committee Stage, and then at least one or two days from the Committee Stage to the Report Stage.</P>

But in view of the fact that the Bill has gone through without amendment of any kind by the Seanad&mdash;except one formal amendment which has been accepted&mdash; it does seem to me that nothing is to be gained by anybody by holding up the Bill until to-morrow.

In this case it would have to be reprinted for one amendment.

      <P>I might mention that the Government wish to insert on the Report Stage another amendment which is purely formal and due to the omission of a certain certificate that may be signed by these Commissioners. That is a purely formal matter, and the way the matter stands is&mdash;and it is well for the Seanad to realise it&mdash;that we are proposing now to postpone until to-morrow the discussion of a Bill which has been fully thrashed out, and as to which only two formal amendments have been suggested from any quarter of the House.  The question is: Is it worth while when our minds are fresh on the subject to put off the Report Stage until to-morrow?</P>

      <P>If I might say, so, in my humble judgment, it is not worth our while.  We have discussed this Bill under very peculiar circumstances. We have had three different <Col N="454" /> agendas&mdash;three different loose sheets of paper with various amendments, and we have endeavoured under those conditions to fit these things in, practically without much consideration.  Still, it is a good Bill on the whole, and our combined eloquence has only succeeded in changing a comma or two.  If we had had more time we might have made more changes.  I do not think it is worth our while holding up the Bill any longer.  I think it would be better finish the Report Stage and have done with it.  The Government are mainly responsible for this situation.  We do not want it to happen again.  If the majority of the Seanad agree to let this Bill be taken and go through the Report Stage now, I hope a similar condition of things will not occur again.</P>

      <P>This Bill is one which I clearly recognise I could not ask the Seanad to consider to-day, in view of the fact that the Bill in its final form has not been before them, but, on the other hand, I would ask the Seanad not to postpone it too long because in many respects the Bill is an urgent Bill.  For instance, there is power given under Section 11, in case of certain local bodies failing to carry out their duties, to appoint Commissioners.  Take the Co. Kerry where there has been no meeting of the County Council and no meeting of the County Board of Health, which controls the County Home, since June last.  The public money has been expended absolutely by the paid officials of the county.  That is a state of affairs which should not be allowed to continue.  As a matter of fact practically no rates have been collected for this year, and enormous sums are in arrear.  Things are approaching a crisis there, and there might easily be a complete breakdown of the whole system of Local Government, <Col N="457" /> There are one or two other counties in which the state of affairs is exceedingly bad, and where it might be necessary to use the powers, which this Bill proposes to give, at any moment.  I would suggest to the Seanad that they should have in mind that some parts of the Bill are urgent when they are deciding to what date they should postpone it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to call the attention of the Minister to one or <Col N="459" /> two facts that may, perhaps, arise later on.  Of course, this Bill is quite necessary, and I do not think there will be any objection to the Second Reading by anybody.  In Clause 41 reference is made to the fact that the elections must be all held on the one day.  That is laid down in the Constitution, and, of course, it makes it very difficult for any alteration to be made now.  I remember that I was down the country last year at the time the elections were being held.  I was speaking to the Sub-sheriff for Co. Mayo who had charge of the elections there, and he pointed out to me how impossible it was for him to carry on the elections if there was even the slightest opposition. He said if three of four men in a motor car having revolvers went around the constituency, in which I think there were 170 polling places, it would be impossible to carry on the elections.  Every schoolhouse in the area was a polling place, and if two or three people went round in a motor car with revolvers, and went to these places and took away the stamps or the ballot boxes, they would render an election for the whole country useless. When I saw the Constitution passed with that clause I foresaw that difficulties might arise.  I know there are some clauses in this Bill to help to get over cases where any difficulty arises by having the polling in these places again. Interference might be very extensive, and it seems to me that it would be very difficult to carry out such an election.  I suggest, and probably the matter has been already considered, that a clause might be brought in where there is serious opposition in a whole district, that different counties might hold their elections at different times.  In that way troops could be sent down to enforce peace or order in a particular district.  It would require 200,000 men at least to guard all the polling stations in Ireland, when then there are 170 in Mayo alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator MacLoughlin is correct.  We made the best provision <Col N="460" /> we could for the difficulty that Senator Moore referred to in Sections 33 and 34 of this Bill.  If any better provision can be suggested when the Seanad is considering it in Committee there will be no opposition from the point of view of the Government. I may say with regard to this Bill that there is very little new and nothing revolutionary in it.  It is confined practically to adapting the existing law to the requirements of the Constitution.  It enacts adult suffrage, that every citizen 21 years of age, whether man or woman, is entitled to be registered as a voter.  It makes provision for the registration of persons over 30 years of age who will be entitled to vote for the Seanad.  It makes provision for Referenda.  There is, of course, no provision in the existing law for holding a Referendum.  This Bill makes the provision because it may happen at any moment that a petition will be presented asking for a Referendum on a particular Bill.  It could not happen for some time, but it might happen this year that the Seanad might take action requiring a Referendum.  There is also provision for the issue of writs and the conduct of elections to the Seanad. There are no provisions in this particular Bill with regard to corrupt practices. The whole subject is so large that a Bill dealing with the matter would be a bulky document, so that it has been divided. This Bill deals with the Dáil, the Seanad and with Referenda.  Another Bill is in draft at the moment dealing with corrupt practices, and will adapt the law dealing with corrupt practices to the new conditions. A further Bill will be required dealing with Local Government generally and the Local Government franchise in particular, which this Bill does not touch.</P>
      <P>I think there could hardly be any opposition to the general principle of the Bill, and that the Seanad should have little difficulty in passing it through its present stage.  Differences of opinion that may exist in regard to it will be disclosed when we come to deal with it in detail on the Committee Stage, and to examine the individual clauses of the measure.</P>

      <P>I think it will be agreed that the Bill as it left the Dáil is an exceedingly fine document, and one on which there cannot be very much controversy. <Col N="461" /> From my point of view, and from the point of view of those associated with me, there are, however, a few blemishes in the Bill that might reasonably and without injustice to anybody be removed so as to make the document even more perfect.  One of these blemishes is the decision to disfranchise a policeman in regard to elections to the Dáil or Seanad, and a referendum.  We, on principle, are of the opinion that no body of citizens who earn their livelihood by honest work, as policemen are supposed to do, and do, should be disfranchised. It is a blot on our political life that an important section of the community should be disfranchised in that way.  After all, there are people in important Civil Service positions who exercise a far greater influence on public life than do policemen, and they have the right to vote, while a policeman is denied the right.  I approve thoroughly of the advisability of keeping policemen and police officers from taking an active part in politics while they are employed at their particular calling, and particularly from taking part in elections.  Personally I have a very vivid recollection of the ability of fifty or sixty members of the Civic Guard under one of their officers around polling booths at the General Election, when they were supporting their particular candidate.  For that reason I have every sympathy with the provision preventing them from taking part in elections.  I do not think, at the same time, that they should be denied the right to vote while that right is permitted to a Civil Servant.  The policeman cannot vote, but the Civil Servant has the right to vote, while he is prohibited from taking an active part in the election.  The next item I touch upon is in regard to the forfeiture of £100 paid by a candidate who is elected to the Dáil but refuses to take the oath and his seat.  We all know that is a very recent innovation and that it was introduced by the House of Lords in 1918 as a blow against Sinn Fein.  I am afraid this Bill was conceived in the spirit of the present day without looking particularly far into the future.  We are fond of saying, with a noted personage in this country, that there is a constitutional way of resolving our differences. <Col N="462" /> One of the constitutional ways would be to give anybody who desires to test the feeling of the electors on any particular question an opportunity of going forward at an election, and, if he were elected, not taking his seat.  I do not think it is in that respect good tactics to penalise him to the extent of his forfeit. We are told, of course, that if he is very strongly imbued with any particular policy he will be prepared to forfeit the £100 in support of that policy.  On the other hand, it may be pointed out that a person who goes for election, and does not get the quota, gets his money back while if he gets the necessary quota for the election he is penalised to the extent of £100.  In view of all the circumstances of the present day, and the encouragement which should be given to constitutional action, opportunities, at all events, should be given to those who decry Parliamentary action, or at all events revert to violence rather than constitutional means, for the purpose of resolving their differences.  I hope, when it comes to the Committee Stage, that the Seanad will give unprejudiced and unbiassed consideration to this view. There is another point in regard to the disqualification of soldiers, policemen, and civil servants from membership of the Dáil and Seanad.  It seems particularly hard that they cannot have the right to go on for election, and, if elected, to take their seats.  We hope to have something more to say when the Committee Stage is reached.  I am very pleased to learn that a Corrupt Practices Bill is to be introduced, and I hope, in the interests of common decency, it will be in operation by the time of the next General Election.  This particular Bill provides for a very extensive franchise. We all know in Ireland at elections &ldquo;the dead arise and appear to many.&rdquo;  Not only do they appear once, but they appear several times.  I fear the difficulties of preventing personation will be great. Personation has been brought to a very fine art in Ireland, and it will be greater at the next election than ever before, seeing that every girl and boy from the age of 21 years upwards will have the right to record their votes.  It will be difficult also in view of the fact that it is always a very delicate thing to ask a lady what her age is.  The difficulties facing <Col N="463" /> the personation agents and the returning officers will be extremely great.  From the point of view of the Seanad elections, the difficulties will be even greater still, seeing that the whole of the Saorstát will be one constituency.  Personally I would not like to have the task of trying to get personation agents for every polling booth throughout the 26 counties.  I do not know whether the present system is cumbersome.  It may be even necessary, before the election takes place, to make some alteration in the law in regard to that.  At all events, the steps which might be practicable for the purpose of providing personation agents in an election for Dáil Eireann will be absolutely impracticable in the case of a Seanad election.  I think no Senator, unless he has a marvellous organisation, can hope to be able to find anything like a practicable number of personation agents throughout the polling booths in the whole of Saorstát Eireann.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the Second Reading of this Bill.  I think it carries out what has been promised&mdash; namely, to give every person in Ireland a voice in the government of the country, but I regret to see omitted from it Local Government Franchise which was originally inserted in the draft of the Bill when it came before the Dáil.  I learned from the Minister that it is intended to bring forward a Bill specially intended to deal with the Local Government Franchise.  I do hope that such a Bill will be brought forward and passed before the forthcoming elections.  Of course, there are several matters connected with that franchise which require amendment.  For instance, a person who refuses to pay his rates is entitled to vote just like his neighbour who always pays them, and there is no disqualification in the existing law for depriving a person of a vote who refuses to pay rates.  I suggested to the Minister when he was bringing forward this Bill to bring forward an amendment to that effect.  Not alone will it do justice to the man who pays his rates, but it may have the effect of inducing people who refused to pay to come forward and do their duty.  As regards Parliamentary franchise, of course everybody contributes to the indirect taxes which are levied by the Government.  We all have to eat and <Col N="464" /> drink, and in that way the money goes into the Government's funds.  The assurance that the Minister gave us that a special Bill will be introduced to deal with the matter I have brought forward meets my views.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw attention to Clause 28, which has reference to infringement of secrecy.  Now, as regards the coming election it would be to the best interests of the country that it should be as free from intimidation from every class as is possible, and the clause here is a very drastic one with regard to the infringement of the secrecy of the election. It has been my experience in municipal elections that a certain class of intimidation has been used by unscrupulous parties trading on the ignorance or the fear of electors.  Notwithstanding the secrecy of the ballot box it is possible to know and discover afterwards how certain electors have voted. In the present conditions if a ballot box is seized at the close of the election, and the Presiding Officer's documents are there, and all the ballot papers and the whole paraphernalia are seized, it will be quite possible for those who seize the ballot boxes and their contents to find out how any particular elector has voted. That point has significance in this respect. Prior to the election it is not outside the power of invention of those who wish to destroy the effect of the election and render it nugatory, to design some means whereby they can intimidate a very great number of electors not only by suggesting it would be possible some time afterwards to discover how they voted, but they can discover immediately by seizure of the ballot boxes how they have voted, and threaten to visit the consequences on that section who in their opinion are not voting in the right direction.  So the secrecy of the ballot box, instead of enabling a person to give his or her independent vote, is nullified in that way.  I suggest to the Minister or the Seanad, by way of an amendment, that this is a weak point of voting by ballot so far as secrecy is concerned. The weak point is that the Presiding Officer puts on the counterfoil of the ballot paper a number corresponding to the elector's number on the Register. Therefore it is a very easy matter, if hostile parties seize the ballot box, to <Col N="465" /> turn up the counterfoil and Register and tell how the elector voted.  That being so, I do not see what exactly useful purpose the writing in the number of the counterfoil serves.  I think it has reference to a demand for a re-count or something of that sort.  If some means could be devised which would not radically interfere with the carrying out of the election by ballot, whereby it would be rendered impossible for those who unlawfully seized the ballot boxes to discover how any elector would have voted, I think it would remove a very serious cause of intimidation from the election.  I think it will strike at the foundation of an independent election unless something of that sort is devised.</P>

      <P>The Bill is described as &ldquo;The National Holidays Bill,&rdquo; and the provisions of it are not very drastic.  It is proposed to do away with the anomaly which exists in Ireland by reason of the fact that there are two sets of holidays kept in the country.  In the country places and everywhere in Ireland, except in the large cities, Church holidays are kept.  It is only in the large cities that Bank holidays are kept.  Now, this is an overwhelmingly Catholic country, and it seems to me that it would be much more suitable to this country if we were to do away with that anomaly and have those Church holidays, or one or two of them, kept instead of the Bank holidays.  The idea is out to a certain extent that what I want to do is to abolish Bank holidays.  I have no such idea. I do want to substitute two or three of the Church Holidays for two or three of the Bank Holidays now kept which appear to me to be not particularly suitable to this country.  I do not think I need <Col N="466" /> say very much more about it except this, that the object of the Bill is to provide holidays in accordance with the needs and character of the people of Saorstát Eireann.  As regards the days which I propose to change, I would propose to introduce Corpus Christi, which is ten days after Whitsuntide, instead of Whit Monday; the Feast of SS. Peter and Paul, which is on the 29th June; and the Feast of the Assumption which is on the 15th August, that would be instead of the August Bank Holiday.  There are various points of minor importance which, if you agree that this Bill should be introduced and printed, I can explain at greater length.</P>

      <P>I feel sure that any of you who have read the papers are aware that when this Bill was introduced into the Lower House some discontentment and surprise were expressed by several speakers at the fact that no member of the Government made any references to the career or the services of the late President Griffith. I feel quite sure that all of us are satisfied that the cause of that omission, whatever it may have been, had nothing whatever to do with any lack of sympathy with President Griffith's widow or with the great services which he rendered to his country. Of course, what happened in the Lower House is no concern of ours, but be that as it may, I hope it will not be thought that it is in any strain of criticism that I suggest that we, at any rate, should take up a somewhat different attitude, and that we should avail of this opportunity to place on record our sincere recognition of the, I would say, almost unparalleled services which President Griffith rendered to Ireland, and our deep sense of the overwhelming loss which the country has sustained by his death. Whatever differences of opinion individual members of this Seanad may have held up to a few years ago with regard to the wisdom, or possibly unwisdom, of entrusting Ireland with a full and complete <Col N="470" /> measure of self government, I think and I hope that we shall all agree on one point, and that is that certainly no man of this generation, and indeed for that matter, no man since the time of the Union has done so much as Arthur Griffith did to materialise the dreams, the passionate aspirations and the longings for self government for which so many generations of our fellowcountrymen have made great, and sometimes terrible, sacrifices.  Even important as the services rendered by President Griffith in that direction were, I think it is infinitely more to his credit that, though he possibly did not altogether succeed in attaining the full measure of his ambition for Ireland, he was still bold enough and patriotic enough to realise that once England had made it clear that, under no circumstances would she agree to an Irish Republican form of Government set up within a few miles of her shores, it would be criminal folly to throw away the substance for the shadow, or to sacrifice another Irishman's life in the pursuit of an utterly worthless and impossible ideal.  Further than that, President Griffith was absolutely loyal and honest to his word and to his bond, and having once set his signature to the Treaty, which he and his colleagues were empowered to accept by his fellow-countrymen, he never swerved one jot from his project, and during that all too short tenure of his office he strove as no other man did to carry out the provisions of the Treaty, and to impress upon all with whom he came in contact that it was the bounden duty of every Irishman worthy of the name to defend and support the Treaty to the best of his power.  In these circumstances, although it is, unfortunately, not in our power to be able to do much to soften or alleviate the blow which fell with such tragic swiftness on President Griffith's widow and his children, we can at least show our sympathy with and our hearty goodwill towards them by endorsing the modest provision which the Government has thought fit to make for them by our whole-hearted and warmest approval.  It is in that sense that I ask you to express that approval, and to adopt this Bill by no uncertain voice.</P>

      <P>I wish to add my voice to that of Senator Colonel Sir <Col N="471" /> Hutcheson Poe.  I was on many points deeply opposed to Mr. Arthur Griffith during his lifetime on matters connected with the Arts, but time has justified him on the great issue that most concerns us all.  He was a man with the most enduring courage and the most steadfast will.  I have good reason for knowing how enduring his courage was.  I first met him a great many years ago, when he and his friend Rooney were editing a little paper which they set up with their own hand as well as writing it. They also paid for the weekly expenditure on that paper.  I know how hard a struggle it was for him to edit and print that paper, and I remember in those days, on hearing how hard that struggle was, I offered to get some of his articles placed in, I think, &ldquo;The Speaker,&rdquo; which was an English Liberal paper.  I remember his reply, that he had taken a vow to himself never to write for any paper outside Ireland. That was for him a vow of poverty, and he kept it.  For many years, at least two or three years, before the end, it must have seemed to him that he was carrying on an almost hopeless struggle and when the final crisis came he showed himself a man of particular value to this country, if it were only in this, that when the final test came he gave his faith, not to an abstract theory, but to a conception of this historical nation &mdash; and we are all theory mad.  On that point he kept himself thoroughly sane, and we owe, therefore, to his memory great honour&mdash; honour that will always be paid by this country.</P>

      <P>I should also like to be associated with this expression.  I do not think that but for the life-work and the very great personal sacrifices made by the late Arthur Griffith that &ldquo;Easter Week&rdquo; would have been possible or that the Treaty would have been at all favourable, and that we would now be here legislating as a free state.  The Irish nation had become apathetic; the nation had lost its title deeds to its nationality; that is practically what it amounted to, and Arthur Griffith discovered them afresh and restored them to his people.  We are to-day on the road he marked out, which must lead us <Col N="472" /> to ultimate and absolute freedom.  We have passed these two great milestones on that road, &ldquo;Easter Week&rdquo; and the signing of the Treaty, which is a practical mile-stone, substantially at any rate, to absolute freedom.  These other little ties that are a source of friction to-day, which bind us to another country&mdash;a very slim bond indeed&mdash;I have no doubt, through the medium of the Imperial Conference, at which we are entitled to sit and have an equal voice with England and all the Dominions, will be ultimately disposed of.  From what I know of the temperament of members of that Conference from overseas, when these sources of friction&mdash;the retention of a few marines or bluejackets on our coast, and even the little thing of the Veto&mdash;when better relations are engendered between the two countries and these matters are brought forward at the Imperial Conference, the large-minded men of the Dominions who are not hide-bound by Imperialism, who have a democratic strain in them, will say to England, &ldquo;What is the meaning of this.  It is of no practical advantage to you to have these little ties sources of friction.  Remove them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And I will say to any man who accuses me of being a Free Stater, I want no better Ireland than Arthur Griffith wanted.  Why should any man or woman here place their record up against that of a man like Arthur Griffith?  From a National point of view we are all but pigmies beside him.  He devoted his whole life to Ireland, and sacrificed his personal aims and ambitions to serve his country.  He refused a position of £2,000 a year because it would take him away from Ireland.  We know what that man sacrificed in yielding to his ideal. His one aim and object was to reach a certain goal.  His whole life was devoted to that and everything else was a minor consideration.  I say he succeeded fully, and there is no tribute that this nation could pay to the memory of Arthur Griffith that would be adequate to the service he rendered to his country.</P>

      <P>I feel I could not allow this matter to go by without saying a word or two.  I happened to be associated, in a small way, with the late President Arthur Griffith in this city during the last 20 years when Arthur Griffith was <Col N="473" /> starting on his work, which has now been practically accomplished.  Very few people know the struggles he went through during those days.  He was not the popular hero that he was in the latter days of his life.  He was almost despised among some people.  Very few people realised fully the sacrifices he made, and all he suffered on behalf of his ideal.  This is a matter and an occasion on which one would not like to enter into any controversy. We are all anxious to pay tribute to the memory of this great man, for he was truly great.  But, I must say in passing that I cannot agree with some of the remarks of the first speaker.  Probably it was a slip on his part when he spoke of the foolish ideal of a Republic. Some of us will not subscribe to that.  But parting from that, we are all sincerely anxious to pay tribute to this great man. He suffered, as I said, a great deal on behalf of his principles.  One little incident comes to my mind just now.  It occured on the first day on which the &ldquo;Daily Sinn Fein&rdquo; was to be published. I saw him then and he was not only editor of the paper, but he was porter and everything else; I saw him with his coat off wheeling in trucks of paper before they went to the machine room.  His heart and soul was in whatever he was doing.  He never worked for financial reward, and he never got it.  It is not necessary to go into matters of detail now, but those of us who were associated with him in the old days know some of the things he suffered, and the sacrifices he made.  I have not much more to say, and I will only add this, that I feel the greatest possible pleasure to see the wholehearted support which this Bill, brought forward by the Government, in memory of the late Arthur Griffith, receives in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>May I very respectfully pay my small tribute to the memory of one whom Senator Farren truly terms &ldquo;a very great man.&rdquo;  I knew Arthur Griffith in the days gone by.  He did me the honour of visiting me in my own house.  He was a great constitutionalist, although some people imagined that he was a revolutionary. Arthur Griffith was a great constitutionalist, and with his ideas and principles I found very much to sympathise. We are all united, I am glad to think&mdash;<Col N="474" /> all sections and classes of citizens in Southern Ireland&mdash;in their reverence to the memory of Arthur Griffith.  We are grateful to Arthur Griffith for his services to Ireland, and I am glad that we are not forgetting that his family and those who are near and dear to him are the wards of the nation's gratitude.  The Dáil has made a modest provision for their maintenance; it is well that such provision should be made, for it would be a sad thing indeed if it could be said that services such as he rendered could ever be forgotten.  He will hold a high place, a very high place, in Irish history. He succeeded in doing what other men of similar spirit and character were unable to accomplish.  May he rest in peace. We can say to-day that his work is done. Our only regret is that he did not live to witness its fuller fruition.</P>

      <P>There is one thing that I think ought to be emphasised in any references to the memory of the late Arthur Griffith, and that is that he set his face sternly against any distinction or differences being made in Ireland between any class or creed.  He hated these differences; he never believed in them and never felt them.  I think it is very fitting that a Parliament with two Houses in a virtually independent Ireland should, with absolute unanimity, make provision for his family.  It would be what he would, if I may say so, have desired.  It is particulary appropriate and satisfactory that with absolute unanimity the Seanad is in a position to endorse the provision made by the Dáil. In this matter he was particularly anxious, not only that the people here who knew what he felt, but the world at large should see that the representation provided in the first Seanad of the Irish Free State would be a proof that there was no feeling of intolerance and no feeling of bitterness, and that the calumny as to the tyranny because of class or creed which had been spread abroad would be given the lie to, and that from now on we should forget these things ever existed.  I make this reference as one who may regard himself as belonging to the minority, and as one who for many years knew how keenly Arthur Griffith felt with regard to the rights of minorities.  In this connection I knew <Col N="475" /> him best, not politically, but as a Trustee of the White Cross and at a time when it was extremely difficult to get into communication with him.  May I say that he determined, from the very beginning, and at a time of keen bitterness, that not one suggestion of a difference of creed as regards a recipient should ever be allowed to have anything to do with the working of the organisation. I often wanted to say that in public, and I now avail of this opportunity to do it.  I also think it would be fitting that we should suspend our Standing Orders and pass this Bill through all its stages immediately.</P>

      <P>I think the mere fact that the Dáil agreed to introduce such a Bill is a greater tribute to Arthur Griffith than anything we could possibly say.  Arthur Griffith was a man of great capacity, of enormous intelligence and wonderful sincerity, and I think it is possible that in whatever capacity he tried to serve his family he would certainly have made for them a colossal fortune.  Instead of leaving them a colossal fortune, he left them penniless.  Ireland was to him Father, Mother, Brother, and Sister, and he knew and realised that in a freer Ireland there would be no great fear for them. He left Ireland to be a Father to them, and the Dáil has shown it means to be a Father to them.  Any words that we might utter here could not constitute such a tribute to his ideals and to his life's work as the action taken by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I cannot allow this occasion to pass without adding a word of tribute to the memory of the late Arthur Griffith.  I had not the pleasure of knowing him personally, but I knew him, perhaps, in the best of ways&mdash; through the medium of his writings; and I consider that these writings have done more for present-day Irishmen than anything else.  They taught us to see Ireland as she really ought to be&mdash;a nation, proud and staunch and self-reliant. They taught us exactly what it was the Act of Union did for us, and made us understand what we might do if we only followed his advice.  The country came behind him steadily and surely, <Col N="476" /> and there could be no greater evidence of that than the eloquent tribute paid to his memory by the first speaker, Senator Sir Hutcheson Poe.  Everyone in this country has come to love it through the teachings of Arthur Griffith, and has begun to see that all that was accomplished under Grattan's Parliament may still be won if only the people unite and develop the vast and splendid resources of their country.</P>

      <P>In introducing this Bill no speeches were made in support of it by members of the Government.  It was thought and believed that the work that the late President had accomplished was sufficiently known to every member of that Assembly not to warrant any eulogy on the part of those responsible for the introduction of the Bill.  The circumstances of the time scarcely permitted of paying those tributes to this great man's memory which in other circumstances, it would have been a possible and an easy task to do. Here to-day in this Assembly we have witnessed the result of the late President's creed for the whole of his life. He believed there was a common platform upon which Irishmen and Irish women of all shades of opinion could meet to work for the best interests of the country&mdash;meet in a place where little petty differences, that sometimes work great havoc amongst people, can be buried and where the best and most patriotic instincts and motives of the people can be directed towards the benefit of the nation.  It is certainly a pleasure to anyone who had association with the late President to have been here and to have heard tributes here from people so long divided from the counsels, if I might say so, of this great man, whose only limitation was that which was imposed by the extraordinary honesty of purpose which animated every act of his life.  There are occasions&mdash;as everyone knows who has any experience of public life&mdash;when one realises that pure honesty imposes considerable limitations on what one can do.  That was certainly a limitation which this man was able to conquer, and it is certainly a great thing for this nation that in this generation a man of his type could be born, who proved <Col N="477" /> that it can be said that a man can be honest and can be a great man.</P>

      <P>Perhaps before I put this motion to the Seanad, they would permit me to say that it is a good many years ago since I had the fortune of forming the acquaintance of the late Arthur Griffith; not, perhaps, in any of the spheres of which mention has already been made by those who have spoken, but in a wholly different arena&mdash;the arena of the Four Courts.  The late Arthur Griffith was frequently a juror in cases where I was a pleader on one side or the other, and we came to know each other, and I have good reason to know that from that time on his feelings towards me were of a very friendly character.  Consquently, I feel privileged to be able to add my testimony very briefly to the eulogium that has been passed upon his character.  The peculiar feature about him was the dogged and quiet persistency with which he followed out his own ideals and he allowed no question of self-interest, no question of advantage or gain to divert him from that persistent path which he pursued.  In his way towards the realisation of those ideals he stopped at no self-sacrifice.  He was capable of the utmost unselfishness, and in the final closing acts of the great drama of his life he showed remarkable courage and a high standard of honour that won the admiration of those who were united with him in attempting to close by an honourable Treaty the long outstanding contest between this country and Great Britain. We have paid him the compliment to-day <Col N="478" /> of tributes from all parts of this Seanad &mdash;tributes from men who differed from him essentially in many of his views and in many of his ideals.  But we are all united by the common belief that in him we have lost a great Irishman, perhaps the greatest Irishman from the point of view of a patriot, of his day or generation. I am sure the country will recognise that we are doing the right thing if we now proceed and dispose of this Bill and pass it through all its stages without further discussion or debate.</P>
