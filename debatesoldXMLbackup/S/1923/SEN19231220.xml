      <P>I beg to move that the new sub-section be deleted. That is the sub-section added yesterday on the Committee Stage.  In discussing the matter with some Senators yesterday, I was convinced that some of us did not realise that one effect of this new sub-section would be to hold up the Bill, for the present close season, for the time which, in the opinion of the Ministry and in the opinion of most people who have knowledge of this subject, would be a period that would be absolutely necessary to have this Bill operating.  As a matter of fact, the knowledge that this Bill was to be promoted has had a deterrent effect on poachers, and I think that now that we have made our position clear, and as I understand the Minister has guaranteed that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is quite clear that the Seanad itself has the power to reconsider the Bill, as referred to it from its Committee, be that a Select Committee or the Seanad sitting in Committee.  Order 70 gives special power to the Cathaoirleach to refuse an amendment which has been rejected in Committee on its being again brought forward.  This is an amendment which has been inserted and I believe I am correct in ruling that the Senator is entitled to move an amendment which will delete that section, thereby asserting its own power to revise the whole Bill as received.</P>

      <P>Standing Order 29 does not apply.  It refers to a decision of the Seanad being rescinded.  The decision made yesterday was a decision of the Seanad sitting in Committee, not a decision of the whole House.  I do not think <Col N="279" /> that Standing Order 29 could be held for a moment to prevent the right or the power of the Seanad to reconsider an amendment which was inserted in Committee and which was sent up to it on report.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, I understood the Minister, on yesterday, to give a guarantee that the spirit of this Section will be carried out under present procedure.  I think myself it would be a very bad thing if you have, as in this case, minimum and maximum penalties laid down, with no power to remit.  The Judge or Justice, if a case is proved, imposes certain fines or punishment.  Now, there might be a case in which gross injustice would be inflicted.  Even in the case of murder there is a remitting authority, and I cannot see why, if we have any confidence in our Government or Ministry, they should be debarred from having that power in this case.  I move that this sub-section be deleted.  I am sure the Minister made it quite clear that the spirit of that sub-section would be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>As the mover of the amendment yesterday, I should like that the Seanad should be quite clear as to what is its position in the matter.  After a clear debate and a vote, the Committee carried this amendment yesterday.  No fresh matter or argument whatever has been introduced, and yet here to-day, without ample notice, anyhow with only the notice that we received when we came here&mdash;in fact, without any notice&mdash;a Senator stands up and asks that our deliberate judgment taken yesterday should be rescinded.  And the grounds for doing that are this, as I understand, that this Bill is so important it should pass in spite of our considered judgment.  In fact, another case of putting us practically in the position of holding up legislation which is in the interests of the country! I think the time has come when this Seanad must clearly consider its attitude.  If the Government regard this Bill as <Col N="280" /> so important they certainly have no right to assume that it is non-controversial. They assumed it was noncontroversial, and, on that assumption, they sent it up to us at the last moment where if it is amended it cannot come into operation until the Dáil reassembles. The Government has made a miscalculation as to the opinion of the Seanad.  The Seanad, after considering my amendment carefully, adopted it.  I can see no possible justification for passing this Bill because the measure is alleged to be of urgent importance.  I do not think I need again argue the amendment on its merits.</P>
      <P>The whole case was heard yesterday, and nothing further has been introduced. We are simply making it quite clear that in serious cases of poaching no person, except the Judge or Justice, who has knowledge of the facts, shall be able to recommend legally the remission of the sentence, and the Government must and can only act on such recommendation.  If the Seanad considered that a wise amendment, one finds it hard to see on what grounds they can possibly change their minds. I would ask Senators to again record their opinion and insist on this amendment being retained.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FISHERIES (Mr. Finian Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane says this Bill is being more or less forced down people's throats.  He says that I have declared it is so important that it should pass in spite of the considered judgment of the Seanad. This amendment is presumably brought forward to have the considered judgment of the Seanad.  I consider the Bill important, and that a lot of its value will be lost if this close season is missed.  It was not the fault of my Department that the Bill was not brought forward long before this.  It was delayed a good deal in the Dáil because of a great rush of business and the difficulty in getting Government time.  It was my wish that the Bill would have been in operation since the middle of November, but it was impossible to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will really be not worth passing if it does not pass now.  It was <Col N="281" /> chiefly directed towards the present close season, when it was first contemplated, and the provisions in it were intended to form part of a larger Bill which will be introduced before the next close season, and which will recodify the whole Fishery Law.  The reason certain provisions were taken out and put into a separate Bill was to handle the situation governing the present close season.  Apart from the question of the loss entailed through the Bill not being in operation this season, and apart from the question of fisheries generally, there is something in the amendment which would create a precedent that would, I believe, be very bad in general legislation.  I believe it would not tend to greater regard for the law, and it would not tend towards the better administration of justice, if the law is so rigid that there is no room for tempering justice with mercy.</P>
    <P>Under the law as it stands, in connection with every offence that is dealt with by a Judge or Justice, no matter what the sentence may be, there is power of remission.  There is power for a reduction or an entire wiping out of the sentence, if necessary, according to the circumstances.  The point the Senator has been making is that no penalty inflicted under this Bill shall be reduced or remitted save on the recommendation of the Judge or Justice. Yesterday I pointed out the actual procedure.  Nobody is going to remit a sentence here without first consulting the Judge or Justice who tried the case.  What is really suggested by the amendment is to cut off the remitting authority altogether, and that is a thing that is not at all advisable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us that he regards this Bill as of such very great importance for the protection of fisheries during the close season, that it is absolutely essential it should become law at once. Up to the present there have been fishery laws in existence; they are in existence to-day.  No doubt, fisheries might be improved, and this Bill proposes to improve them.  But to tell us that everything in connection with fisheries is going to go to pot because <Col N="282" /> this Bill is not in operation, is pure eyewash.  The Minister tells us further that he does not intend to remit fines. If the Bill is so very important as that why does he not accept the amendment? Why does he think that he is in a better position to decide whether or not fines should be remitted than the Judge or Justice who has heard the case and who knows the circumstances?</P>
      <P>We who live in the country know something about those things, and we know that the power of remission has given rise to the greatest scandals. We know perfectly well that the fines are invariably paid by the dealers.  I have already related the case of the man who came to the dealer and got the amount of his fine from her.  He then went to Dublin and got the fine remitted.  The result was that he got a premium on his poaching; he got a premium for destroying the valuable fisheries of the nation.  The Minister thinks he is a super-man, and knows much more than anybody else.  If he thinks that these backstairs influences will not continue, surely the Justice who has heard the case, who knows the circumstances and who is on the spot, is in a better position to decide whether the fines ought or ought not to be remitted, and is aware if there is any injustice being done by the infliction of a fine.  Is he not in a better position to so decide than anybody who has only third party evidence to go upon? There is another question which affects us.  We have had innumerable instances of Bills being thrust upon us here, and we were told to pass them as they were urgent, or else they would be useless.  We have been promised amendments to these Bills, and what do we find?  Bills have come back to us without a single amendment.</P>
      <P>We have been appointed to revise legislation which might be hastily considered. We are supposed to have some knowledge of the country, and if, after careful consideration, we conclude that certain amendments should be inserted, we will not be doing our duty if we do not insist on them.  It is belittling the Seanad and the Constitution if we are treated in this manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Fisheries has told us that this Bill has come back to us for the considered judgment of the Seanad.  Yesterday the Seanad met in Committee and gave its considered judgment.  It seems to me that asking the Seanad to consider, within twenty-four hours, the matter over again, without the introduction of any new reason why it should be altered, is trying, if possible, to take away from the importance and dignity of the Seanad.  Sir John Keane, in speaking against the amendment, realising that he argued thoroughly and convincingly yesterday, took what, to my mind, was the proper course when he left it to Senators to realise the facts as they stand. Knowing that in their minds, carrying with them the conviction which he gave to them yesterday, and feeling that nothing would induce the Seanad to be so volatile as to pass this amendment without any argument but the argument which was brought to us more than once of the necessity of the Bill &mdash;bearing all these things in mind, I think the Seanad will be slow to accept this new amendment.  The Minister speaks of seasoning justice with mercy.  Sir John Keane, to my mind, did season justice with mercy. It was pointed out by him that under this Act minimum penalties are imposed, and that it is incumbent on the Justice to inflict such penalties, but, seasoning justice with mercy, he inserted an amendment that the Justice should have power to recommend that the penalties should be so reduced. If that is not a sufficient safeguard, I do not know what a safeguard is.  It looks to me that the one thing asked is that patronage should be observed. I feel strongly in this matter.  I feel that the opening of this whole question anew is casting upon us an obligation which should not be cast upon us, and is asking us to do a thing which in our inmost mind we know should not be done.  I, for my part, again say that so far as I can, I will never tolerate this hasty legislation.  Whatever cause may be adduced, if I feel the necessity for amending the law, any suggestion of haste will not force me to do what I think is unnecessary and <Col N="284" /> unjust.  We are here for the express purpose of making laws passed by the Dáil more useful.  We discussed this Bill thoroughly yesterday, and the Seanad in Committee, not a Committee of the Seanad, decided that this was a necessary amendment, and, therefore, passed it.  Now, to-day, we are asked to change our mind, but I feel certain that the Seanad will not adopt such a course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I voted on the amendment yesterday, and I am of the same mind to-day.  I think that most of those who spoke in favour of it are men who have experience on Boards of Conservators.  I have had some experience myself, and I found that, with the best intention of carrying out the law for the purpose of preserving the fish, whatever procedure we took was nullified by this power of remission.  I can quite understand that where the minimum penalty is inserted in a Bill, there should be some power of remission, some clause where a Judge in examining a case in which the minimum penalty would not be warranted, but in which some penalty would be warranted, had no other course open except to inflict a penalty and make representations that there should be some remission in that particular case. We found, however, that the ultimate penalty inflicted, after certain procedure was carried out, was entirely out of proportion to the offence.  I saw that our efforts were futile.  With regard to this defiance of the law, I think it will be seen that it is not so much the moderation or severity of the penalty that will deter people from breaking the law, as rather the conviction borne in their mind that they will be punished.  If in nine cases out of ten they could evade punishment, we should try and so tighten our machinery that those who commit a crime may look forward to being captured and punished.  Then there would be respect for the law, and general defiance would cease.  The Minister, at the close of his remarks to-day, said that the object of the amendment was to take away the power of remission. <Col N="285" /> You cannot, however, read that into the amendment.  The resolution actually stereotypes the necessity of imposing the penalty, and it saves, too, the power of remission, but it qualifies this in a way that the recommendation shall be made at the same time as the penalty is imposed.  That is the crux of the whole matter.  A case is brought forward, and the parties on both sides have the privilege of bringing forward every scrap of evidence either for or against.  They fail to do it, and the Judge does not see his way to make a recommendation and he inflicts a penalty.  What has happened?  Even though he does not make a recommendation there was a remission afterwards.  That has been the abuse of all those acts.  We wish to put it out of the power of litigants by any circuitous procedure to cut across the course of justice.</P>
      <P>In discussing this measure after the meeting last night, I took the view that if the Minister subscribed to that, and followed out the procedure outlined in that amendment, and would have it incorporated in a future Bill, seeing that the fishing season has come to such a precarious era, the Seanad under the circumstances, might see their way to withdraw the amendment and let the Bill go through.  If a guarantee were given, I, for my part, would alter my decision with regard to the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. IRWIN</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the motion to have the amendment passed yesterday withdrawn, I do so mainly for the reason that the Bill is urgent. We are all in agreement with the Bill. We are agreed that the Bill is necessary, and we know that if it is delayed it will be useless so far as the season is concerned.  Therefore, this urgency and this necessity far outweigh any advantage that might be gained by Sir John Keane's motion.  The motion <Col N="286" /> constitutes the District Justice not only a Judge but a Court of Appeal in the matter.  There is to be no appeal from him, which, I think, is unheard of under any law.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is an ordinary appeal.  This amendment does not take away the right of the litigant to appeal from the decision of the District Justice.  This only deals with the question of the remission of the particular penalty imposed by the District Justice.  That penalty might be wiped out on appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusIrwin" hpid="Mr. IRWIN Mr. IRWIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. IRWIN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no appeal in the ordinary sense from the Justice who imposes a penalty by way of memorial.  Even if a man is sentenced to death there is a right of petition by memorial to the Governor-General. Further, new evidence may be forthcoming at a later stage which would be debarred from being considered by the Minister for Home Affairs if Sir John Keane's motion were allowed to stand.  It has been explained by the Minister that no action would be taken by him without consulting and without the recommendation from the Justice who inflicted the fine.  The alteration of the motion that was carried yesterday when it enables the Bill to become law and become effective ought to be sufficient to outweigh any advantage of holding up the Bill.</P>

      <P>Several Senators have put forward as a plea for rejecting this amendment that the Minister has made a statement that he will not remit the punishment except under very stringent circumstances.  Ministers do not remain in office in perpetuity. With all respect to what the present Minister said, it is possible he <Col N="287" /> may be changed.  He may go to another Department.  The Bill will remain.  The next Minister is bound by the law, and not by the statement of any Minister. Therefore, I think that question should be left entirely aside.  We should pass the right law, irrespective of any promise any Minister may give.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CLAYTON LOVE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make an appeal to Sir John Keane, and others in favour of the amendment, to view clearly what the Minister puts before us.  Most of the salmon fisheries will be opened next February. Between this and then the poachers will be extremely active.  The chief object of the Bill has been to preserve salmon fisheries by giving preservation in the close season.  The January close season is the most important one.  The Bill is mainly, in fact almost entirely, directed towards the close season for the protection of salmon.  I think Sir John Keane's objection is that very loose legislation in regard to the open season exists on many of the rivers, and his amendment would hamper these people.  But I would appeal to him not to press it, seeing that the chief object of the Bill is to protect salmon in the close season, and the Minister has emphasised the fact that by holding up this Bill for the purpose of including the amendment it could not possibly come in until the middle of next month, or, in other words, ten days before the season opens.  For these reasons I would appeal to Sir John Keane, even though I think he is not, perhaps, as well treated in the matter as he ought to be, and I think his protest is a reasonable one.  Under the circumstances, he would do more good by allowing the amendment to go for the present, and I am sure that the Minister will give him an undertaking that in any future legislation regarding fisheries the spirit of the amendment will be embodied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I voted against the amendment yesterday simply because I thought it was unnecessary, but I hardly feel disposed to support the motion before the Seanad to-day.  I am not inclined to be a party to having the Seanad stampeded into undoing to-day <Col N="288" /> what it did after very mature consideration yesterday.  As Sir John Keane has stated, no new matter whatever has been brought forward. An appeal on the ground of urgency and the promise given by the Minister were made yesterday, and they left Senator Kenny cold.  To-day the very same appeal made in the very same way touched a tender chord in his heart, and he is prepared to undo to-day what he did yesterday.  I think that that form of legislation will not tend to the stability of the Seanad, and it really leaves one in doubt as to whether what is being done to-day is not likely to be undone before we disperse. Personally I will not be a party to assisting in that sort of legislation, and consequently I cannot support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of personal explanation, I do not think that Senator O'Farrell is quite fair.  He has made a sort of gratuitous accusation that I am prepared to undo to-day that which I saw fit to do yesterday. I only stressed the whole position to-day to show that in effect, if what we did yesterday was undertaken to be carried out by the Minister, under the plea of urgency, this being the close season, I was prepared to reconsider my vote.  That is an entirely different matter.</P>

      <P>As the junior member of this Seanad, I should not have intervened in this discussion at all, except that I felt that it is a matter of principle.  I was present during the entire sitting yesterday, and the question involved in this amendment was fully discussed.  In fact, I seldom heard a better discussion.  We came to a deliberate conclusion, and if it is possible, as it appears to be, under the rules, to question the decision of the Seanad, sitting in Committee, with practically no notice to the members, except what we got this afternoon, then, I think the position is really very dangerous.  I treat this entirely as a matter of principle, and I do not think we should have a discussion on the merits as we had yesterday.  We decided that yesterday, and I would very seriously ask the <Col N="289" /> members not to reconsider it, but to vote on it as a question of principle. I say that with very great sympathy for what the Minister said about the urgency of this Bill.  It is, no doubt, very important that it should be got through as quickly as possible, but the urgency is perhaps not so great as the Minister thinks, as the greater portion of the close season, and most of the harm that could be done during the present close season, is over.  As a matter of fact, one or two of the principal rivers in the North-West of Ireland open on the 1st of January, and the rivers I know best, in the SouthWest, in Kerry, open on the 15th, when practically the whole country will be open, so that the urgency is not of such a nature as to induce this Seanad to go back on what it did yesterday. If this is done I do not know where we will stop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally I am inclined to agree with Senator Brown that there is not much use or desirability in discussing the merits of the amendment which was accepted yesterday. I was against it, because I thought the principle of setting right the law where errors occur was necessary, particularly in matters other than fisheries.  But the reason I venture to speak now is because I think we have here a situation which I hope in the future will lead to a more satisfactory method of bringing Bills before us, and for our consideration of them.  It is being complained that an amendment of this kind can be brought without notice.  That is as our Standing Orders provide, because of the desire of members to bring in amendments generally just before 3 o'clock on the day on which we sit.  It was done to convenience them, and it is their desire. In any case, if we take different stages of a Bill on the same day, or one day after, it is almost impossible to provide notice if amendments are to be introduced, and I think we are, to some extent, to blame for the situation, in so far as we arranged to take one stage of a Bill immediately after another, before we have time to see the actual amendments inserted and consider the whole.  That, I think, is very largely <Col N="290" /> the reason why we find ourselves in the position in which we are to-day. When a motion of this kind is brought forward one is almost always inclined to vote as one did the day before. Personally, I hope that as a result of this it will be possible to make some difference in our own arrangements, and also that it will be possible, particularly in the matter of Government Bills, to introduce, at an early stage in the session of the Dáil, Bills which are Departmental, which are urgent, which are more or less of a non-controversial character, and which can be put through at an early stage, and would come to us at a reasonably early date.  We would then have time to put in any amendment we wanted without running any risk of a situation such as this.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a word before the motion is put on this question of the Minister's statement of interfering with the administration of law in the matter of fisheries, especially in view of the close season.  The Minister, on behalf of the Government, has suggested that there is a responsibility on the Government to tighten up the law, and that we by our action are undermining that responsibility.  The facts show otherwise. If the Government feel their responsibility in this matter, why was not this Bill brought in at the beginning of the close season?  The Minister said he wished to bring it in earlier, but we should have no regard for what a Minister feels, because the collective responsibility of the Government is involved in this matter, and if we really felt there was any substance in that argument, that we were by our action giving rein to the poacher, I would feel disposed to withdraw the amendment; but Senator Brown has shown us there was no real validity in that argument, as the close season is nearly over, and the responsibility for any illegal action with regard to fisheries rests not with this Seanad, but with the Government itself.</P>

    <P>Section 8.&mdash;(1) The Commissioners shall conduct all examinations in Saorstát Eireann which are now by any statute or other authority required to be conducted by Civil Service Commissioners and also shall if so required by the Executive Council conduct examinations, competitive or qualifying as the case may be, for all or any situations in the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann, or in the Dublin Metropolitan Police, the Civic Guard or any other police force in Saorstát Eireann or in the service of any local authority or authorities and all or any such other examinations as the Executive Council may from time to time require.</P>

      <P>1.  Section 8, Sub-section (1). (a) To delete in line 33 the words &ldquo;if so required by the Executive Council.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>(b) To delete in line 37 the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;and for medical, engineering and superior clerical posts.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) To insert after the words &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; in line 38 the words <Col N="292" />&ldquo;which posts shall only be filled by competitive examination.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendment as it appears on the Paper is necessarily in a number of disjointed sentences, but the effect of the amendment is this: Section 8 provides that the Commissioners shall conduct all examinations for certain things, and I want to extend the scope of that Section to cover all appointments to the medical, engineering, or higher clerical branches of the Civil Service, and of appointments under County, Borough, or District Councils. I think I can fairly anticipate the answer that will be made by the Government in the matter.  This was discussed when the Bill was under consideration last year, in the temporary measure, which is an exact copy of this, and the Government professed themselves quite in favour of the suggestion we then made.  When they said they were introducing a Bill more specificially dealing with the local government of the country, and that it was in that Bill that these provisions could most properly be inserted.  That I was very glad to hear, and I believe it is quite so, but, after all, it is not that Bill we are dealing with here. The Bill we are dealing with is the appointment of Civil Service Commissioners, and empowering them to hold certain examinations.  If the Local Government Bill is passed, afterwards it is quite possible the Civil Service Commissioners might turn round and say: &ldquo;We have no power to hold these examinations, for the Act under which we are given power to hold these examinations contains no such clause.&rdquo; Therefore, I think it is very desirable to insert such a section here.</P>
    <P>I need not dilate on what is public knowledge, that vast corruption has existed in connection with these appointments, and the desirability for the change has been admitted.  If the amendments that appear in my name are accepted it will mean that all appointments shall be made as a result of public examination, which, I believe, is the desire of the country at large. I am not speaking for myself in that, but the country is absolutely sick of this corruption and wants to end it. The Government have told us they are <Col N="293" /> quite in favour of putting an end to it, and I have no doubt they mean it, and I do not question their bona fides. Some people who indulge in these little games are very cute, and there is no doubt as soon as they get wind of what is on foot they will try to get as many people scraped into the service as possible by back-stairs influence&mdash;I repeat the expression used before, because I think it aptly fits the case&mdash; and the Government, and everybody else, will be faced with the fact that these undesirables are in possession of certain offices when the Local Government Bill becomes law.  But if the amendments I have tabled here are carried out it will prevent that.</P>

      <P>I would like to oppose the amendment.  I presume it is in order, as you have permitted it to be moved, <Col N="294" /> but it is certainly outside the main purpose of the Bill.  This is not a Bill for Local Government reform, and I think it is doing things in a wrong way if this Seanad brings in matters of Local Government reform by the hair of the head, as it were, in a Bill dealing with other matters altogether.  It seems to me you might as well bring in a clause abolishing Rural Councils or decreasing the membership of the Dublin Corporation, as such a clause as this.  When the Local Government Reform Bill is brought in it will contain provisions in regard to examinations for appointments under Local Authorities.  When I was in the Local Government Department I was in favour of making provision that local appointments should be filled in the main, at any rate, either by qualifying or competitive examination. The present Minister for Local Government is of the same mind. Others who have had to do with Local Government also think that such a change should be made.  But it is a matter that will require specific legislation. There may be exceptions; there may be particular classes of posts where you will want to have a qualifying examination and selection afterwards. There may be others in which you would prescribe competitive examination alone.  At any rate, it is a matter of sufficient importance to be legislated for separately.  Senators who feel so very strongly about this, and who feel that they cannot wait until the Local Government Reform Bill comes along, might give material assistance to the Government if they would bring in a measure and have it considered by the Seanad and sent along to the Dáil. They might in that way expedite a change, if they think we are too long about it.  In any case, I would suggest that it is very undesirable to bring in an amendment, altering materially the Local Government law, in a Bill the purpose of which is to regulate entrance into the Civil Service, and to set up a Civil Service Commission to hold examinations and to test the qualifications of candidates for the Civil Service. At present the Civil Service Commission is required by statute to hold certain examinations in the case of County <Col N="295" /> Surveyors.  We are also taking power to direct them to hold any examinations that the Executive Council think ought to be held, but we do not propose to change the Local Government law or to alter, for the present, the power of local authorities.  We do not intend to touch the local authorities.  If we were satisfied that any particular local authority would accept the results of an examination under the Civil Service Commission, and if we could come to an arrangement with that local authority in regard to the expenses of the examination, we would certainly ask the Civil Service Commission to hold an examination for them so as to get the thing going.  But we do not propose to alter the Local Government law at present.  I do not think that the particular Senators who feel that the matter is so urgent should really press on us to do the thing in that casual and not very well-considered way.</P>
      <P>In regard to the police forces, we are making an arrangement that examinations shall be held by the Civil Service Commission.  An examination will be held for cadets in the Civic Guard.  At present an examination for suitability for promotion in the D.M.P. is being held by the Commission.  An examination has been held by the Commission to determine what Civic Guards would be suitable to be appointed Inspectors of Weights and Measures.  In the same way it is intended that army examinations, where written papers can be set, and written answers taken, shall be held by the Commissioners.  There is no use, however, in trying to do everything in one Bill.  We have heard talk about hasty legislation&mdash;and I admit the justice of a good deal that has been said&mdash;but I want to protest against hasty legislation from the other side.</P>

      <P>That is rather straining the point.  These amendments, as I said, are all part of one scheme&mdash; that it should be made mandatory on the Commission to hold these examinations. This Bill is to establish Civil Service Commissioners and to give them certain powers.  It is not a Bill, as the Minister says, to alter the Local Government law.  But if a Local Government Bill, introduced later, requires the Commissioners to hold examinations, they may say that under the statute under which they were set up they have no power to hold those examinations. Therefore, I ask the Seanad to consider the question as a whole.  This is a very small matter, and is simply making it mandatory on them to hold all such examinations as they may be required to do without the requisition of the Ministers.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to disagree with this amendment.  I think there are cases, particularly medical positions, where certain local knowledge is essential.  There are various reasons why a competitive examination is not useful in cases of this nature.  I do not wish to enlarge upon it, but it must be obvious that mere book knowledge is not all that is essential in a man whose duty it may be, for example, to attend the sick poor.  I feel that in this, and possibly other matters, such as the appointment of assistant County Surveyors, that there are standards of character which are necessary <Col N="297" /> and which no examination as to book knowledge would really make the proposed candidate an efficient one.  For that reason it will be necessary for me to vote against the amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to say just a few words on this amendment. It does appear to me that if amendments are introduced dealing with a service which was not in contemplation when this Bill was introduced in the Dáil, namely, the Local Government service, it is possible that more damage may be done by the passing of these amendments than if the matter were not touched at all.  This question of Local Government and its re-organisation is a vast, complex and intricate one, awaiting solution in its own time and in its own way, and on lines which will make for improvement, for economy, and for general efficiency throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know something about local authorities.  I was a member of a local authority for a number of years, and I know something about the attempts that have been made, during the last three or four years, to improve administration by local authorities.  I can tell the Seanad that there are no amendments it can pass, in the form which amendments have taken so far, that any local authority would not drive a coach and four through.  During the disturbed period, from, say, 1920 up to the signing of the Treaty, I was in close touch with local authorities. I endeavoured from my own experience of the usefulness of examinations to impress on local authorities the real necessity for having positions of any importance the subject of examination. I can tell the Seanad that where local authorities disagreed with that view, they held examinations but they confined them to whatever persons they wished to present for examination. You may, and probably will, <Col N="298" /> be faced with exactly the same state of affairs again.  I recollect on one occasion a local authority, having, I think, three vacancies.  A certain number of names were submitted, and it was pointed out that four could stand for one examination, five for another, and three for another, out of twelve applicants for the positions.  The numbers were restricted to these, and not one single person out of the 12 passed the examination for any of the three posts.  It was then presented to us: &ldquo;Your examination has failed.  We want to appoint men.  Are you going to keep us without the service of these men in these important positions and leave open to public criticism the fact that we have vacant posts and want to fill them.  You see now that we cannot get persons with the qualifications you want, but we can get persons qualified to fill the positions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It appears to me that if it is attempted to deal now with what might be called clearing up of the wreckage of local administration, you cannot do it successfully or carefully in this manner. If you do, it is more than likely you will have to pay a very much higher price for the services of the persons who will pass these examinations, and later on, when you are considering economy in Local Government, it may be found that you have not got work for these persons.  I think it is unwise&mdash;and I have some experience&mdash;to press those amendments. It is a service in which you have, I suppose, a very much diversified standard.</P>
    <P>Take the Dublin Corporation for example. It is the largest local authority, and has held examinations for 20 years, and it has paid them well.  Even there you have various services, different from one another, but the examinations are the same for all.  You have the Law Agent's Department, and the Accountant's Department.  Different sorts of examinations would be required for these two Departments.  So far the Corporation has not a separate examination for each.  This particular amendment here deals with &ldquo;medical, engineering and superior clerical posts.&rdquo;  There are cases I am sure in which men, having a number of years' service in Local Government, may be <Col N="299" /> efficient but may not pass Civil Service examinations, although they might discharge the duties where the vacancy exists much more satisfactorily than men not having experience in that parcular line.  There is a danger now in setting up a headline with regard to this without viewing the whole circumstances of the case as they ought to be viewed.  In my opinion it would be necessary to see how it would be possible to reorganise the Local Government service on a more economic basis.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;To insert after the words &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; in line 38 the words &ldquo;which posts shall only be filled by competitive examination.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment is simply to carry out the idea proposed in the last amendment, and as that was lost there is not much use in insisting on this one. The object I had in view, and on which the President has thrown no light, was to put a stop to the corruption which exists in the country.  The President has confirmed my statement by giving instances that occurred to his own knowledge.  All he has told us is that these abuses do exist, but I venture to say that he has not given us any help whatever as to how they are to be met, or as to how this canker which is eating into the public life of the country is to be done away with.  The one object I had in view, in submitting the amendment to the Seanad, was to put a stop to these abuses.  I regret that the Seanad has not seen its way to accept the amendment.  I believe the amendment would have had a good effect. I do not think there has been any light thrown upon it.  Under the circumstances I desire to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>Before that Section passes, I would like to know if the Minister is now in a position to answer a question I put on the Second Reading&mdash;that is, if it is the intention to appoint to the permanent, established staff of the Civil Service those who have been admitted without competitive examination, without at first requiring them to submit either to a qualifying or a competitive examination. I do not mean to include the old Civil Service staff of Dáil Eireann.</P>

      <P>In general, persons who have been appointed to the Civil Service will have to undergo a competitive or qualifying examination but in the case of, say, professional appointments, it is not easy to hold an examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is done by process of selection. Let me give an instance.  A certain County Surveyor, who had a very good reputation as a maker of roads, was appointed to take charge of the Road Section of the Ministry of Local Government. It will be for the Civil Service Commissioners to satisfy themselves in that case that he is a proper and suitable man, and fully qualified for the situation as regards character, knowledge, ability and so forth.  It will not be a question of examination. <Col N="303" /> There are a certain number of posts where examination is not the best test &mdash;where you want experience, knowledge of the world, character, capacity in the handling of men.  These things cannot be determined by examination. For this particular type of post the Civil Service Commissioners would be asked if they would certify the individual. They would not be asked to hold an examination.  It would be within their power to refuse to certify.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister for Finance may from time to time make regulations for controlling the Civil Service of the Government of Saorstát Eireann and providing for the classification, remuneration and other conditions and terms of service of all persons employed therein, whether permanently or temporarily, and may at any time revoke or vary any such regulation.</P>
      <P>(2)  All regulations made by the Minister under this Section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made, and if both such Houses shall, within the next twenty-one days on which either House has sat after such regulations are laid before the Houses, passed resolutions annulling such regulations, such regulations shall be annulled accordingly, but such annulment shall not prejudice or invalidate anything previously done under such regulations.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 8:&mdash;In Sub-section (2)  To delete all after the word &ldquo;if&rdquo; in line 51 up to and including the word &ldquo;resolutions&rdquo; in lines 53-54 and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;either such House shall, within the next twenty-one days on which either House <Col N="304" /> has sat after such regulations are laid before the Houses, pass a resolution.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment of mine is in substance the same as the amendment adopted almost unanimously yesterday in regard to Section 4.  The Minister yesterday told us in regard to a similar amendment that if the Dáil passed a resolution seeking to annul a regulation that the regulation would fall, because the Minister, being responsible to the Dáil, would have to take cognisance of such a resolution, and he indicated that the action of the Seanad on such a regulation, unless supported by the Dáil, would mean nothing.  The position as I see it means that there is no use in placing these regulations at all on the Table of the Seanad, unless a resolution passed by the Seanad takes effect.  At present the Dáil may at any time annul a regulation, but the Seanad cannot do so, except they say &ldquo;ditto&rdquo; to what the Dáil may do.  Either the regulation should not be laid on the Table at all or we should have a right to pass a resolution annulling it, as in the case of the other House.  It may be said that these regulations mainly apply to money matters, but if you read the Section you will find that they will refer to matters other than money matters.  Even on money matters, the Seanad has a right to make recommendations, and the right of the Seanad should always be protected in that regard.  In any event, there will be regulations of a very important character that will not involve financial expenditure in the ordinary sense, and which the Seanad should have some right to voice their opinions on.  I think the Minister will agree that any powers that have been given under these regulations have never been abused.  In fact, I think the tendency has been the other way.  Either Senators or Deputies have not bothered themselves to examine these regulations or, if they have examined them, they have never abused the power conferred on them by trying to annul any reasonable regulation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons I gave&mdash; which did not appeal to the Seanad&mdash; against the previous amendment moved by Senator O'Farrell apply very much more strongly indeed to this amendment. <Col N="305" /> In the first place, these regulations which may be made by the Minister for Finance and laid on the Table of both Houses are in Great Britain made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and are not laid on the Table of either House there, so that there is, as it were, a check on the Minister for Finance here that does not apply to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in England. The regulations will be mostly of a financial character.  They will have a very close bearing on matters of finance and will touch the Minister for Finance in his responsibility for the conduct of the service on the most economical and the most efficient lines possible.  It was proposed in the Dáil that these regulations should be annullable only by the Dáil: that this particular clause should take the form of stating that the regulations might be annulled by resolution of the Dáil and that the Seanad might make recommendations. I opposed that form on the ground that some regulations certainly would not be strictly financial, that they ought to be laid on the Table of both Houses and that both Houses should deal with them equally.  I should point out that many of the regulations will be strictly financial and, therefore, I think it ought not to be in the power of the Seanad&mdash;I am not speaking of this particular Seanad, but of any Seanad that may be elected in the future&mdash;to annul the financial regulations which the Dáil was satisfied with.  It is the Dáil that is responsible under the Constitution for financial business and for the conduct of the finances of the country.  One may agree with that particular feature of the Constitution, or one may disagree with it.  We may even think that some time later it will be changed.  But at present that is a condition of the Constitution, and it lays the responsibility for finance&mdash; for the conduct of the finances of the country and for safeguarding the expenditure of the national revenue&mdash;on the Dáil.  It is undesirable that a regulation which will deal largely with the safeguarding of the national revenue and of getting good value for the expenditure of all money, should be held up by the Seanad acting alone and, perhaps, contrary to the Dáil.  I <Col N="306" /> think it would be interfering with the spirit of the Constitution if we were to adopt, in this particular clause, an amendment which would make it possible for the Seanad to annul the financial regulations made by the Minister for Finance and with which the Dáil was satisfied&mdash;particularly in view of the fact that the responsibility in this particular matter lies with the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I want to put in a caveat here.  I do not want it to be taken at all, especially in adopting a mere amendment that the Seanad adopts the suggested construction of the Constitution just mentioned by the Minister.  You cannot talk of the spirit of the Constitution because we have got the letter of the Constitution and there is nothing whatever, as I construe the Constitution, in its letter that would prevent the Seanad from rejecting a regulation under this Bill merely because it was a financial regulation.  I know of nothing in the Constitution that would affect or control the action of the Seanad in that respect.  I am not giving a decision on the matter because the question has not arisen.  I only want to utter a warning against its being supposed that the Seanad accepts the view of their rights under the Constitution just expressed by the Minister for Finance.</P>

The Section provides for classification, conditions and other terms of service, apart from the question of remuneration, and it may be felt that these are matters on which the Seanad would like to express its views. I do not think the Minister need be so much afraid of the amendment that has been proposed.  I think it is a good one.</P>

      <P>In my opinion the amendment that has been proposed by Senator O'Farrell is the only logical amendment that could be proposed unless, of course, the Minister is prepared to act as he has told us the Chancellor of the Exchequer acts in England and do away altogether with the placing of these regulations on the Tables of both Houses and enact them as he has power to do.  I think that puts the Seanad in a very difficult position.  As Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde has said, the Seanad can legislate or give its opinion on two of the conditions mentioned in the Section, but as I understand it the third condition is outside the purview of the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would venture to present to the Seanad another point of view.  It appears to me that whether the amendment has really in it all the advantages that have been described by Senator O'Farrell or not, it has one serious disadvantage,&mdash;that in a sense it provides for a conflict between the two Houses.  Now, there has never been any such conflict and I do not think there are any indications of one.  While the Minister has taken the point of view that the Seanad might object to the regulations, they might also bear in mind that it would be possible in years to come that the Minister for Finance might make regulations which his House might support.</P>
      <P>Even though the Seanad was not empowered to remove these regulations by passing a resolution, nevertheless these criticisms would be of immense value.  But in these regulations, as well as I can recollect, it is provided that both the Dáil and Seanad should pass a resolution.  If it is left to the Dáil or Seanad, it is more than probable that there will be a conflict between them on the point.  What are the points in dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To provide for the classification remuneration, other conditions and <Col N="308" /> terms of service, of all persons employed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is not intended, I am sure, that individual cases should come before the Seanad.  No case was made in the Dáil for laying open the Civil Service to canvassing or lobbying or anything of that sort by persons employed in it.  It would be highly undesirable that we should leave open the door to any such proceeding as that.  Most of those who spoke about Local Government laid stress upon the fact that canvassing and lobbying and all that was one of the evils of Local Government.  The Minister makes these regulations&mdash;I will say without being in any way disrespectful to Civil Servants&mdash;quite impartially and as if the persons affected were cyphers.  I will say that it is most unlikely, except we get a Minister for Finance who does not know his work at all, that he would make regulations that would not meet with the approval of both Houses.  Take the Constitution as it stands.  It indicates that both Houses are part and parcel of it, and that what passes in one should be considered in the other, but that there should be general agreement.  Here is a case where you are opening up possibilities of disagreement and leaving no possible means of composing those difficulties afterwards.  I think that allowing one House to do something that is not being done by the other House leaves opportunities for friction, and I think we ought not countenance that</P>

      <P>Whatever be the position of the Seanad with regard to this particular Bill, I think we have here a matter that requires a certain amount of consideration, both now and in the future, with regard to the relations between the two Houses.  We in the Seanad are united in this.  We are anxious to do our duty in accordance with the powers given us in the Constitution. I think we do not desire to take responsibilities that have not been given us, but where we have the responsibility <Col N="309" /> we desire to have the power. In the attachments that have been made to several Bills with regard to regulations made from time to time by the Commissioners or by the Executive Council, two methods have been adopted.  Sometimes both Houses are required to pass resolutions.  Sometimes only one.  I can see a very good case made for the English method by which Ministers make their regulations and submit them to the House to which they are responsible.  But because of the fact that none of the Senators is a Minister, no Minister would be responsible to the Seanad nor would the Seanad have the power to act.  But if they are to be sent to the Seanad, then I think the Seanad should have the power to deal with these regulations. We should have the power if we share the responsibilities.  If it is a matter that should not come before us, in so far as it is financial, then it should be dealt with by the other House.  The position seems to be that most of these regulations that come in this form are supplementary to legislation, and the reason they are sent to us is they are regarded as supplementary to legislation. If so, I think we should have power to deal with them.  One point dealt with by the President was, I think, of great importance.  He referred to a possible deadlock between the two Houses under certain circumstances that may occur.  I do not think it is likely to occur in matters of administration, assuming that these and other matters come before the Seanad. I suggest for the consideration of the Government and the Seanad that what ought to be provided is not if one House disagrees that this order or regulation will immediately be invalid, but that if one House disagrees the matter will be sent to the other House for consideration, and that in the same way as a Bill these regulations would become valid.  I think the reason the Government are in the position of resisting amendments here is that they do not wish to place themselves in the position in which regulations of which they have approved will suddenly and immediately end in this House.  If the suggestion I made were to be considered, it might be possible on the Report <Col N="310" /> Stage to provide that when we pass a resolution which will go to the Dáil, we would hear their point of view on it before the regulations or rule would be rendered invalid.</P>

      <P>I was very much impressed by what the President has said, and more particularly as from time to time I have had a fair amount of negotiations with Civil Servants on the other side of the Channel.  I could not but admire the way those men carried on their work.  It does not matter to them a single bit what Government they serve.  I really do think that the farther the domestic relations of the public service are divorced from the political end of the Dáil or Seanad the more efficiently will the public service be discharged.  I think the domestic administration of the Civil Service is very much better left to the Civil Servants, and the Ministers themselves.  With regard to that, is it conceivable to any business man that a Minister, as the head of his Department, is going to promote and put into a responsible position a man who is necessarily going to prepare a great amount of his work, if he cannot rely on that man for the facts and figures which he is to put before the Dáil?  I tell you he could not do a thing like that for his brother.  He could not do it even if he wished.  He could not do it for any friend.  He must rely on the good service he gets and on what is available, and you can better do that by keeping this service away from influences which must affect efficiency.</P>

Surely, if that were the case, the passing of this amendment would be very <Col N="311" /> innocuous?  If, on the other hand, we are given powers that we cannot use, we are placed in a very peculiar position. Senator O'Farrell has put the matter in a nut-shell.

      <P>The arguments advanced against this are of different descriptions, but none of them seems to be particularly weighty.  The President rather overstated the position when he seemed to suggest that the meaning of this amendment was to give an opportunity of voicing the interests of individuals in the Civil Service.  If that is the case, of course the same argument would apply to the Dáil.  I think, however, that is altogether beside the question.  It is of the utmost importance, in my opinion, that regulations governing the recruitment to the Civil Service, and the conditions therein, should be laid before the Oireachtas.  These people have no regular contract of service with the State.  They are very largely at the mercy of the heads of Departments. The efficiency of the Civil Service, the type of person who shall be recruited to it, and the conditions obtaining in it, are all of vital importance to the work of the State. Consequently, if any body has a right to discuss the regulations governing these things, it is the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dowdall asked us to make an act of faith in the present and all future Ministers, and he deprecates interference or criticism in matters of this kind.  That is very undesirable and will tend to make it absolutely imperative on Civil Servants to enter an organisation where they will be in a <Col N="312" /> position to take action that may be termed by many people unconstitutional. If the Oireachtas has no proper surveillance over admission to the Civil Service and the conditions obtaining in it, then somebody will have to act on their behalf.  As regards the bogey of a conflict between the two Houses, if there is a danger of that, why is the Government not consistent?  I had occasion yesterday to call attention to Section 97 of the Courts of Justice Bill, where it is indicated that all Rules of Court have to be laid before both Houses and a resolution of either House can annul those.  If there is a danger of conflict between the two Houses in regard to the Civil Service Regulations Bill, is there not an equal danger in regard to Rules of Court?  There must be some consistency in reference to those regulations.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Seanad passed, almost unanimously, an amendment exactly similar to this.  I can assure the Minister and the Seanad I am not looking for extra powers for this House.  At the same time, I do not approve of that apologetic tone that some Senators assume.  They actually apologise for exercising any power at all.  That is not a proper spirit to manifest.  I do object to the Seanad being treated as a kitten and given a straw to play with, as is the case in the Section as it now stands.</P>

      <P>Before I put the clause, I would like to point out to Senator O'Farrell and the Minister that whether it remained in its original condition, or as it is now amended, it is not drafted in the way intended.  According to the last four lines of it, in the event of either House annulling any single regulation, they would get rid of the whole table of regulations.  That is not intended.  It is only intended that a resolution annulling a particular regulation should annul that only, and leave the rest untouched.  In order to rectify that, it would have to be altered to read: &ldquo;Pass a resolution annulling any of such regulations, same shall be annulled accordingly.&rdquo;  As it stands now, if either House annulled a single <Col N="313" /> one out of one hundred regulations, the whole of them would go, and that is not intended.

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I could introduce the amendment on the Report Stage.  I would, however, like to make my point now.  The clause generally is open to objection, inasmuch as it gives undue power to the Minister for Finance.  I know the Minister dropped a hint that he was, more or less, following the British model, which is, no doubt, correct, because I suffered under it.  It gives the Chancellor of the Exchequer considerable power of making detailed regulations in all Departments of State, and that in effect sets up a spirit of considerable hostility to the Finance Department.  I think anybody who knows the British Service will appreciate that fact.  That hostility is not in the interests of harmonious administration. It is quite conceivable now that a Minister of the Department of Agriculture may, in relation to the work of inspectors in the country, require rather different regulations to those that would deal with those of his servants engaged in a more sedentary occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in practice all these matters are done with extraordinary detail. They must be referred to the Minister for Finance. I know the Seanad will remember the question of financial control.  It is all bound up together.  If you give a Minister a sort of over-riding power in the domestic work of every Department of State, I do not care whether it is in <Col N="314" /> England, here, or in any other country, you will get an element of internal friction and loss of efficiency.  It will be removed to a large extent by giving this power to the Executive Council.  I suppose if this power is given to the Executive Council these regulations will probably be definitely discussed. In all matters of finance the Minister's advice will, of course, have to be taken, but I do not like giving this power by statute to one Minister to interfere, as he can, with the best intentions, with another Department of State.  I think that the circular issued the other day, commendable as it was, regarding the hours of work and so forth of Civil Servants, should, if the spirit of this amendment is agreed to, have been issued not by one Minister, but under the authority of the Executive Council as a whole.  I ask the Government, if they can see their way, to accept the amendment, as otherwise I will have it brought up on the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance must be a member of the Executive Council.  Under the Constitution the members of the Executive Council are collectively responsible for their Departments, so that in actual practice I think no change will be effected.  On the other hand, I think it is undesirable to burden the Executive Council with detailed reports and regulations in cases where it may not be necessary to bring these before it.  I do not think it is desirable that we should enact, by statute, that in a large number of cases matters must be brought before the Executive Council which might be purely routine.  On the other hand, if they are matters of substance, nothing will be gained by such an amendment.  Take, for instance, the question of hours of Civil Servants. That matter was brought before the Executive Council before the circular was issued by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance, in all matters of finance, would be bound to get the consent of his colleagues on the Executive Council, but he is not bound to bring before them routine matters and thus, perhaps, prevent discussion on matters of greater importance.</P>

We had, in another place, withdrawn from the Bill the words &ldquo;if so required by the Executive Council.&rdquo;  I think this is a continuation of the amendment already accepted, with a view to preventing Ministers from arbitrarily inserting in the schedule whatever class of Civil Servants it is desired to exclude for the time being.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment very strongly.  So far as I can see, it involves a very great principle. The object is to make an enactment by law prescribe a certain procedure. This Bill is to ensure that the <Col N="316" /> bulk of those who enter the Government service shall be qualified.  You set up a Commission for that purpose, but at the end of the Act you practically give the Executive the power of scrapping the whole thing.  I do not see what is the object of this piece of legislation, because the Executive Council can hold what examination it likes, as it only has to exempt any people to put them on the schedule and the trick is done.  I think that that rather stultifies the whole of this enactment. There is an increasing tendency to take these powers and practically nullify the main portion of the measure. After all, this amendment is vital because the object of legislation is to ensure the authority of Parliament.  Go back to the constitutional principles and you have three branches of government&mdash;the Legislature, the Executive, and the Judiciary.  It has been by long experience determined that these safeguards are necessary to keep these functions clear and distinct.  I am not at all certain that the necessity for that is appreciated by the Government, but it is for us to see that these prerogatives are secured.  I submit that by this section they are swept away.  I have no doubt that the present Government will not do this, but the power remains. Governments often change, and we have to safeguard the authority of Parliament and not allow a clause like this to be embodied in the Act.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane need not fear there is any attempt to get around the authority of Parliament.  We must not build two great edifices on very little.  This particular provision is in the Bill because it is not pretended that such complete consideration has been given to the matter that there is no class which ought to be added to the schedule.  It might be felt desirable that at some stage the Post Office might be entitled to take on auxiliary postmen for the Xmas rush without any reference to the Civil Service Commission.  There, you should not have the delay of an investigation by the Civil Service Commission. There are no grounds for supposing that in selecting candidates for the Civil Service, the Government is going <Col N="317" /> to go in for something grossly corrupt to get around the provisions of the Act. I do not believe there is any Act drafted so watertight, that if a Government were going to descend to the things Senator Sir John Keane has in mind, it could prevent them.  You must not assume we are going to have an absolutely corrupt Government.  I think we should view the thing in some sort of reasonable way, and not tie ourselves up with too great rigidity.  It should be remembered with regard to the British Civil Service that the matter does not rest on enactments at all there.  The whole system of competitive examination in the Civil Service in Great Britain rests on an Order in Council which may be varied at any time.  I did not know that there were any great abuses of the power that rested with the Government of the day which would be sufficient to sweep away the whole system.  Any British Government could come in and take away examinations altogether.  It might be necessary to add at some time some particular position to the Schedule.  That addition to the Schedule will have to be gazetted.  It may not be done in the dark.  People will know about it.  There will be opportunities of criticism of it in the Parliament. I think in matters of this sort you should allow, under proper safeguards, some reasonable freedom of administrative action unless you are convinced it is likely to be abused, and to lead to corruption.  I suggest it is not likely to lead to corruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the matter of publicity and the certainty of Parliamentary criticism there is quite a sufficient safeguard provided.  There have been in the past various posts exempted by the British from the purview of the Civil Service Commission.  I see for instance here in the College of Science, the Professor of Biology, the Professor of Zoology, and the Professor of Botany.  It might be a desirable thing for us to add those to the list or it might not, but we do not feel that we should swell the schedule at all.  If, in the course of time, it is thought desirable to add any particular class to the list of those exempted, there should be power to do it, and Parliament should <Col N="318" /> deal with the matter, if it were felt that the Government was going beyond what it ought to do.</P>

      <P>One word with reference to what the Minister has said. I am willing to accept Senator Brown's change, but I would like to point out to the Minister, that Ministers, both in the British Parliament and elsewhere, have been making themselves into legislators by Orders in Council.  One of the things most objected to in the British Parliament has been the powers they have taken of late years to do just what they like under Orders in Council.  Anyone who read the English papers in the last two years will have noticed the criticism and resentment of the attitude of successive Parliaments in taking powers from Parliament by issuing Orders in Council.  This is practically the same thing.</P>

I cannot, at the moment, be sure whether there might not be certain classes of permanent employees other than those already mentioned in the schedule who ought not to be exempt, but I cannot think of any at the moment.  I am prepared to have the clause altered in such a way that the power to add to the schedule shall only apply to temporary appointments.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>To add after Sub-section (2) a new Sub-section (3) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Appointments to the unestablished situations referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Schedule to this Act shall be made under the authority and on the advice of the permanent head of the Department concerned in each case.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are six different clauses in the Schedule, and 4 and 5 are concerned with people who necessarily could not be examined.  They are porters, door-keepers, and labourers of various sorts, for whom nobody would, I suppose, expect to have competitive examinations, though I believe that in Trinity College they have an examination for porters.  It consists, I believe, in their being able to write their names and repeat the Lord's Prayer.  That is an antiquated sort of thing which I do not propose to suggest here, although it might be a good one.  My reason for putting down this amendment is that I think it is in the interest of the Ministers themselves, and I think nobody would feel that more than Ministers. One Minister said the other day that he found nothing more disagreeable than the perpetual task of making appointments, or receiving applications for appointments.  Very few people appealed to me, but some did.  I found it a very great annoyance, and I am sure that a Minister who makes appointments must have thousands of applications, and must be in a great difficulty because he does not know who they are.  My suggestion is that the only people who ought to interfere are the permanent heads of departments, and the Minister said the other day, <Col N="320" /> when we were discussing that point, that it would be very easy to suggest some other means than having it done by the Minister himself.  I suggest this.  The Minister may perhaps suggest some better plan, in which case I would be perfectly satisfied, but it seems to me that the head of the department, or some person in it, ought to be the proper person to appoint mechanics, caretakers and such people rather than the Minister, and they will not be affected by political considerations. The permanent head of the department has nothing to do with politics, and he will save the Minister the bother of having perpetual applications made to him for appointments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not recommend the Seanad to adopt this amendment. As a matter of fact the Minister does not know anything about these appointments in the ordinary way. They are done in his name, but certainly, as far as I am concerned, I have never known anything about the appointment of any porter, doorkeeper, messenger, night watchman, charwoman, or cleaner, except a man who lost his arm in the fighting in Easter Week who I asked to have considered for a messenger's position.  The appointments were made by the permanent head of the department of which I was Minister, but at the same time I do not think we should put into legislation that the permanent head of a Civil Service Department is to act quite independently of his Minister, and to be subject to no control by his Minister in anything he does.  All acts must be done in the name of the Minister, and I do not think we could make any regulation or adopt any legislation that would make the permanent head of a department independent of the Minister in the discharge of his duty. At present I believe appointments of this sort are being made by the ex-service section of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which is concerned at the moment in placing demobilised soldiers in any vacancies that may turn up.  But if there was no particular reason for directing these appointments through one channel they would be made on the recommendation of the permanent head of the department, <Col N="321" /> and normally the Minister will not be concerned with them.  I assure you that it is not this kind of appointment that causes trouble to Ministers; it is not when a charwoman is being appointed that members of the Dáil and Seanad beset him.  It is when there are more serious appointments, and I do not think you will relieve the Minister of anything when you are dealing with this particular class of appointment.</P>

The removal of this particular clause from the schedule would mean that recruiting for the police would be taken out of the hands of the police authorities and given over to the Civil Service Commissioners.

      <P>The next matter is a motion by Senator Sir John Keane.  There is a motion, by way of amendment to that, standing in the name of Senator MacLysaght, and there is a motion also standing in the name of Senator Colonel Moore.  I want to suggest to those who put down the various motions what I think would be desirable, in view of the situation which exists, and which may be known to Senator Sir John Keane, but which, perhaps is not known to Senator Colonel Moore, as regards the staff and arrangements between the two Houses.  The Seanad will recollect that they have a Committee on Standing Orders, and this Committee brought in an interim report on the 13th of March of this year, which referred to the fact that a conference had been directed between the two Houses, with regard to the question of the staff of both Houses, and the report to which I have referred contained recommendations resulting from that joint conference.  These recommendations were adopted by the Seanad, and one of them was this: The question of Standing Orders, regulating intercommunication between the two Houses, was discussed.  It was agreed that these matters could best be settled by a joint conference between the Standing Orders Committee of the two Houses, and it was decided to recommend to the Seanad that a Message be <Col N="324" /> sent to the Dáil requesting approval to such a joint conference.  In addition to that, the Seanad agreed, at the request of the Dáil, to appoint a member to a Joint Committee to consider and go into the whole question of the staffing of the Oireachtas, and that Committee consisted of the Minister for Finance, the Speaker of the Dáil, and the Chairman of the Seanad.  We met on several occasions.  We went very fully into the matter, and in the result we prepared a report which was discussed with the President about a fortnight ago, and one or two suggestions came from him, which I, with my colleagues on this Committee, have to go into again.  Substantially speaking, I should tell the House that our recommendations come to this, that with the exception of the position of the Clerk and the Assistant Clerk, all the remaining staff should be a joint staff.  That is to say, the same thing also applies to the Dáil, with very few exceptions, excluding, of course, the Speaker and Deputy Speaker.  Their entire staff and ours is to be a joint staff.  The object we had there, of course, is economy, because that joint staff will not be attached all their time to either House, and we can always have them available according as their services are required, whether in the Dáil or here, and we can get on with a much smaller staff than was originally anticipated.  So far as the Seanad is concerned, if this report of the Committee on which the Minister for Finance and myself acted, is adopted by the Dáil, as I believe it will, and by the Seanad when it comes up, there will be no staff actually or technically belonging to this House, except two&mdash;the Clerk of the House and the Assistant Clerk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee on Standing Orders recommended, and also the Committee dealing with the position of officers, the appointment of an Examiner of Private Bills who would also act as Counsel to the Seanad, but on subsequent consideration when the Joint Committee on Private Bills was appointed, they came to the conclusion that we could work with one Private Bill staff, that there should be only one office, and that it should be worked by one official, and by a Joint Standing <Col N="325" /> Committee for dealing with Standing Orders for Private Bills.  That Standing Committee produced the Standing Orders, and they have been accepted and passed in both Houses.  The Speaker and myself, with, I think, the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, came to the conclusion that we would not require the extensive and expensive establishment in connection with Private Bills we originally contemplated, because these Standing Orders are so detailed and so minute, and I venture to say, though I had some hand in making them, so plain, that we have come to the conclusion that an established Civil Servant would be quite competent to discharge the duty of Examiner of Private Bills. That would considerably reduce the original estimate for the staffing of the Seanad or the Dáil.  At this Conference, the Minister for Finance and myself came to the conclusion that we could dispense with the second Assistant Clerk in the Seanad, that is to say that his position should be made such that he would be available for working on the joint staff of the two Houses. Once we get our Private Bills into operation, we shall have Committees sitting, I hope, dealing with these Private Bills.  These Committees will require Clerks, and the staff we have suggested should form the staff of both Houses.  It includes a certain number of clerks who would be available to act as clerks to Private Bill Committees when they are sitting, in either House, and the proposal is that the third Assistant Clerk in the Seanad should be transferred to that staff and should be available to serve in either House when required in regard to Private Bills Committees.  That would then, as I have said, reduce the exclusive staff of this Seanad to two&mdash;the Clerk and the Assistant Clerk.  All the rest would be, as I have said, members of a joint staff.  If the Seanad wishes I can give them the particulars of these officials that would form the joint staff. However, as this report is not yet in its completed form and has yet to come before the Seanad and the Dáil, probably it would be wiser for me not to go into any further details.  The only reason I have mentioned what I have stated is, that in view of this report <Col N="326" /> being practically completed and this Committee that you appointed still sitting to deal with it, I think it would be more in the interests of both Houses if the motions which stand in the names of Senator Colonel Moore and Senator Sir J. Keane were adjourned until after the Christmas recess.  By that time, I think, this report will have been completed and will be coming before the Seanad and the Dáil for acceptance.  If it is accepted it will cover a considerable portion, though not all, of the ground that would be covered by these motions.  I do not want these motions to be taken off the Order Paper.  I am only suggesting that the discussion upon them would be more useful and help us better if the Seanad had before them in its completed and accepted form the report of this Committee which is working on the same lines.</P>

I mention that because this joint report that you speak of does interfere with some of the members of the staff of the Seanad as we appointed them.  It is really introducing an extern influence, which did not exist when we made the appointments, into appointments which concern us.  Before we do that I think this Committee, that I am suggesting, should assemble and consider this matter.  I have no doubt that what you say as to the number of clerks would probably be accepted by any Committee of the Seanad or by the Seanad as a whole.  But, as the Seanad appointed the present staff, they will have to consider the personnel, because they have only been appointed for a year.  They may make any shifting round that they wish on the recommendation of a Committee. I think that to decide as to what should happen to the third clerk is rather <i>ultra vires</i>, because the Joint Committee cannot do that until the Seanad has decided as to which of the clerks it should appoint.</P>

      <P>I think there is some confusion.  Our staff would be a very large one in the sense that you are putting it, because we have a staff or messengers, of translators, of official reporters, and the staff in connection with the Board of Works. If you take it in that way, our staff would be an enormous one.  All of these officials are in the position to do work for the other House as well.  Accordingly, the idea in appointing this Joint Committee was that the Committee should define what the joint staff was to be, and in defining the joint staff, we have expressly eliminated from it the Clerk and the Assistant Clerk of the Seanad.  They remain the absolute officials of the Seanad, attached to this Seanad, who have the sole control over them and the sole right to appoint them.  All these other officials, like the guard, the messengers, the door-keepers, etc.&mdash;what I might call the official staff&mdash;are all working or capable of working in a similar capacity for the other House.  It was on that account that we were asked to arrange a system by which this joint staff could be cut down to its lowest number and be available at any time for either House, according as the exigencies of the two Houses require it.</P>

      <P>I can understand that there is a difference between the staff of the Seanad and the Oireachtas staff.  The Oireachtas staff is what you have mentioned&mdash;the staff engaged in the work of the whole Oireachtas, Seanad and Dáil.  Last year we appointed three clerks for this Seanad, and I do not think that any Joint Committee has a right to interfere with any of these three until the Seanad has disposed of the question as to who should be appointed on that staff.  Their appointment ends on the 10th January. We might not meet again before the <Col N="329" /> 10th January, and if this Committee which I have proposed is appointed now, it would have time, before the 10th January, to go into and decide this question.  It would, no doubt, have before it whatever recommendations the Joint Committee may make.</P>

      <P>That is the difficulty.  You cannot, as I stated, have this report, as it is not absolutely confirmed. It is in draft.  I could not circulate it amongst Senators until it is absolutely agreed upon.  There are one or two points still open between the Ceann Comhairle and myself.  I have arranged to meet him to-morrow to try and come to a definite conclusion upon these matters.  If we do the report will be presented to the Seanad.  Personally I do not see an opportunity of presenting it before January 10th.</P>

      <P>With all respect, I do not think that interferes with the appointment of the Committee to consider the personnel of our clerks, which must be gone into before January 10th. Otherwise we must appoint them from day to day or week to week, which would not be at all satisfactory.  It was agreed last year, very definitely, that these people should be appointed for one year.  Before the time expires it is only natural that there should be a Committee to go into the question and make a recommendation to the Seanad as to what should be done.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That a Committee of five members of the Seanad be appointed to examine and report what economies compatible with efficiency can be made in the cost of the Seanad.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My object was to effect what you all agree was very desirable in the interests of economy generally, and as a headline to all Departments of State, an investigation into the costs of the Seanad.  Senator MacLysaght has an amendment down which is better and more business-like.  I quite appreciate that it would be very difficult to make a recommendation regarding the cost of the Seanad without also affecting the <Col N="330" /> Dáil.  If the question is gone into jointly it would be a much better procedure I would like to be allowed to withdraw my motion in favour of Senator MacLysaght's.</P>

      <P>That is the very reason.  Senator MacLysaght's amendment is a very proper one, that this Committee should be a joint one to deal with the joint staffing and with economies in the staffing of both Houses.

      <P>I think the Seanad gave the Committee an unqualified mandate to go into the whole question of the staffing of both Houses and to see how far the staffing could be a joint one.  I may tell you in corroboration of that, that one of the propositions made was that the Clerk and the Assistant Clerk of both Houses should be members of the joint staff.  I thought I was carrying out the views of the Seanad on this Joint Conference when I opposed that, as I think each House, in the case of the Clerk and Assistant Clerk, should insist on retaining control of and the right of appointing its own officials.  As regards the other staffs, I saw very good reasons why <Col N="331" /> they should be formed into a joint staff for both Houses.

      <P>I have tried to make it as clear as I can.  We went into the entire staffing of both Houses, and one of the propositions we discussed was what exceptions, if any, should we make from the joint staff for both Houses.  It was proposed and seriously discussed that there should be no exception to the joint staffing of both Houses.  In view of what happened in the early days of the Seanad I was determined that I would not give way as regards the Clerk and the Assistant Clerk of the Seanad.  Accordingly the Committee arranged that the Clerk and the Assistant Clerk should not belong to the joint staff, but should remain separate officers of the Seanad, and be appointed by them. The same applied to the Clerk and the Assistant Clerk of the Dáil.  As regards the work of the rest of the staffs they were to work in both Houses as circumstances required.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad respectfully requests the Government to provide library facilities for the use of the Members of the Seanad.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I will be very brief in moving this motion.  We are suffering great disabilities at present in the matter of papers and documents issued for publication. A large number of important measures are forecasted for consideration, and in no case is it possible, except at great physical labour, to get hold of even the most ordinary Government reports.  In one or two cases I have been obliged by an official&mdash;some Civil Servant&mdash; whom I happen to know, and who has lent me documents, but in doing so always made me promise to bring them back in good time.  That is not a desirable state of things, and, as a permanent home seems a long way off, I suggest that the Government should provide some sort of facilities, if only temporary, whereby members could consult publications, and generally look up references on subjects for legislation. I understand that a Librarian has been appointed and, if I might suggest, there is a library very near.  At present there are difficulties in getting into it, because you must have a pass from an individual Minister before you can go and read there.  If that was made easier, and, possibly, if the Librarian appointed, who, I understand, is a highly qualified person, was placed at the disposal of members who wanted his assistance, they would probably find most of the references, papers, documents and books that they want in the National Library.  I agree that might not do as a permanent arrangement, but, in the meantime, if we are to do our business in a proper way, and not be placed in such very great difficulty in having access to papers, we should adopt some such course.</P>

      <P>Perhaps, before the President speaks, I might put in a plea, and say that the time is getting very nearly ripe when we should have better accommodation. The members of the Seanad have put up with very great inconvenience.  They have few facilities for consultation of any sort or kind, few opportunities of consulting books, and very few ordinary comforts.  The accommodation for the Chairman is of a character which could hardly be described as sumptuous, and the accommodation for the public and the Press is very scanty and very meagre.  We have put up with it for over a year, but I think the time has come when something ought to be done to place us in a better and more improved condition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of more suitable accommodation for the Oireachtas is a matter that I have had under consideration for some time, and I expect early in the new year to put forward proposals.  A Committee was appointed to go into the matter, and I do not think that their report upon it will entitle them to any monuments in the future.  We are here practically on sufferance of the people who accommodated us.  We have overstayed our welcome, I think.  That is a matter which we will have to take into account when considering the recommendations we are to make.  We will have to look into the question of making the National Library available.  We hope to be able to say something on that on the next occasion.  We have also considered the question of a Library for the two Houses, but owing to the limited accommodation here we had no place to put it, and it is at present housed in another building.  With regard to the accommodation of An Cathaoirleach, I know he has shown remarkable patience, and I suppose, in an assembly like this, that it is right and fit that An Cathaoirleach should lend the benefit of his example to other <Col N="335" /> Senators in that connection.  I hope we have not taxed his patience too much, and that when proposals will come up we will be able to provide him with suitable accommodation.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That with the object of avoiding industrial friction throughout the Saorstát between employers and employees, the Seanad earnestly requests the Government to devise means whereby Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration might be constituted immediately, of which the decisions would be final and which would command the confidence of the public generally.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In proposing this resolution I shall be as brief as possible.  The President of the Free State and the Prime Minister of Great Britain have both remarked that there is no question more pressing and urgent, affecting the people of these islands, at the present time, than the question of unemployment. I believe unemployment has been largely brought about through unfortunate misunderstandings arising from time to time between employers and employed.  The present state of this country, as regards unemployment, is deplorable.  Thousands of men are out of employment; people who were once in affluent circumstances are reduced to comparative pauperism, and that is apparent throughout the country. Speaking as an employer, and as a member of an employers' association, I believe I voice the feelings of many employers when I say that we would place far more value upon stabilisation of wages than on reduction accruing again and again in pay and salaries. If we had some definite basis to go upon, in looking forward to the future, we could base our costs on these figures, and, in this enlightened age, I think it is really absurd and deplorable with capital and labour which are so interdependent one upon the other, that both sides should plan, and arrange, to starve <Col N="336" /> each other out in order to see which would prove victorious in the struggle. Here in Dublin bitter experiences have been gone through by both employers and employees.  The port of Dublin has been held up.  In the Midlands and the West, and in Dublin itself, enormous cost has been incurred in despatching goods through the Six Counties and the North generally into England.  Thousands of pounds have been lost.  In the South of Ireland we have passed through a state of things never experienced before.  I have reason to know that in the three months, in which the South of Ireland has been held up, over a quarter of a million of money has been lost.  The loss in wages and salary and in ships turned away from the port of Cork and otherwise has amounted to £250,000 or £300,000 at a small estimate.  Such being the case, I believe that over one million, of money has been lost to Ireland in the last few months.  We have been talking about our expenses here, and enlarging upon that, which is very proper, no doubt, but what are they?  A mere bagatelle, a negligible quantity.  In one week a sum greater than the whole cost of the upkeep of this country for a year has been lost, owing to differences of views between employers and employees in the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, submit the sentiments contained in the motion for the consideration of the Seanad, and I sincerely hope the Government will be encouraged in the near future to follow the example set by the Governments of Australia and of Canada, and that is to set up Conciliation and Arbitration Courts.  I hope, too, that such difficulties as may arise and come before these Courts, will be adjudicated upon by, preferably, a Judge of the High Court. I was glad to see, when reading the debates in the Dáil, that the respected leader of the Labour Party in that House made a proposal, similar to that which I have indicated in my motion, during the consideration of the Judiciary Bill.  His suggestion was submitted in the form of an amendment, but it was ruled out of order, as that was not considered the proper time to bring the subject before the Dáil.  The leader of <Col N="337" /> the Farmers' Party in the Dáil also supported the idea.  I now venture to bring the matter before the Seanad, because I believe the country is ripe for a step in this direction.  In doing so, I believe the Seanad, if it adopts my motion, will be assisting to lay the foundations of an era of peace and prosperity, and of many other advantages for our native land.  I beg to move the resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. GUINNESS Mr. GUINNESS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GUINNESS</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the resolution and to support the suggestion that these Courts of Conciliation and of Arbitration should be constituted. As to what the result will be, it is difficult to forecast.  I notice that, in his motion, the Senator suggests that the decision would be final.  That, also, is a very difficult matter.  In the case of these Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration which have been established elsewhere, the difficulty always has been that the decisions should be regarded as final, but at the same time there is no reason why we should not have some hope in that direction.  We may hope, at least, that by their establishment peace will result as between capital and labour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the motion, I desire to say it is my view that, when people really come together for the discussion of their differences, good results are produced.  In regard to the unfortunate dispute between capital and labour in this country, I feel sure that the responsible leaders on both sides must feel convinced that if such conferences as are suggested in this motion could have taken place, that good would have resulted.  I think, at the same time, that when agreements are arrived at between capital and labour, it will be necessary for the Government to devise machinery to give effect to such agreements.  If the machinery provided by the Government were backed up by the responsible representatives of capital and labour, then, I think, the parties to these unfortunate disputes would soon fall into line, and we would soon have peaceful conditions in the country.  I do not think there would be much difficulty in bringing together the representatives of industry in the country, but to make <Col N="338" /> their decisions effective, in the case of disputes, I think it will be agreed that the support of the Government will be essential.  In Australia, decisions arrived at by Conciliation and Arbitration Courts are made effective by penal enactments, and I think no good result will come about until you have some such provision in this country, if the Courts proposed in this motion are to be set up.  I would respectfully suggest to the earnest consideration of the Government the study of the best means devised elsewhere, particularly in Australia, for the settlement of disputes of the kind we have in mind.  I feel quite sure that members representing Labour in this Seanad would cordially join in any movement which would lead to peace, to the peace which it is suggested could be made possible by the establishment of the Courts referred to in the motion.</P>

      <P>It is not possible, I think, to discuss a question of such great importance as this is at the fag end of a meeting.  We can only deal with it in a scrappy way, and I would have preferred if we could have deferred it until after the Christmas recess when it could be dealt with adequately.  The Senator who has moved this motion deserves, in my opinion, the thanks of the Seanad and of the public.  We are coming to a stage in our development when we must begin to take thought, and when we must, in the interests of a community as a whole, do something or devise some schemes whereby we can bring about industrial peace.  One does not like to take sides on a question of this kind, and it should be possible to discuss the matter without taking sides, and to look upon it from the broader standpoint of the general well-being of the community.  I believe that if the question were approached in that spirit that a great deal of good could be done.  At all events, Australia has shown us how to go about it.  The Australian experiment, however, has not been a complete success, but then nothing is completely successful in this world of ours.  It is the intention really that matters, and, unquestionably, the Australian attempt has been of some use, and has done some good <Col N="339" /> in bringing about conditions under which industry can be carried on under more satisfactory auspices.  One could speak at length upon the subject. There are a great many questions involved. There is the question of the standard wage and other questions of that kind, but we have no use at this hour of the evening, in attempting to go into them.  I am glad that the Senator has raised the matter, because his action will set us thinking about these things.  We are now going to develop the country, and under the constitutional position we enjoy we can do something to promote high moral purposes.  There is no reason why we should not begin to think about these questions, or why they should not be discussed by the public at large.  I think the more we discuss these questions, and the more we go into them in the spirit of attempting to find a fair, honest and honourable solution of them, the more chance there is that progress will be made in coming to satisfactory settlements.</P>
