      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1 and 2 in that order. If Senators agree, I suggest we break this evening at 5.15 and resume at 7 p.m. Senators may not be aware that our former colleague, Mr. Dick Belton, died this morning.  A number of his former colleagues would like to go to the removal.</P>

      <P>We regret very much the occasion which has led to this suggestion of an adjournment at 5.15. Naturally we agree.</P>
      <P>We are also willing to take No. 1 at this extremely short notice, although it was finished in the Dáil only last night.  We agree to this proposal because we are anxious to facilitate Government business in any reasonable way.  However, one is entitled to point out to the Minister that section 13 of the Bill specifically says that the Bill will not come into force until 31st December, 1975, which makes the urgency rather difficult to understand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of their overall programme the Government are committed to the introduction of legislation to eliminate discrimination against women.  The Government have already indicated their general acceptance of the recommendations contained in the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> Final Report of the Commission of Inquiry on the Status of Women.  As Senators will be aware, the Commission recommended, among other things, that legislation should be enacted to ensure the implementation of a policy of equal pay for work of equal value.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that too little attention has been given in the past to consideration of the measures necessary to improve the status of women in employment and indeed in society in general.  Much needs to be done through legislation and otherwise to eliminate unfair discrimination on grounds of sex where it exists and so help to change the prejudiced attitudes which give rise to it.  The Bill now before the House is a significant step along the road towards removing discrimination against women in our society.</P>
    <P>It is our objective as an administration to allow women to play a full part in the life of the State and to eliminate those barriers which prevent them from doing so.  Whilst it is true that many women may not wish to see their family role basically altered, women are going out to work in far greater numbers or are returning to work at an earlier age after their children have gone to school.  The proportion of women in our work-force has been increasing in recent years and it now amounts to 26 per cent of the working population.</P>
    <P>The legislation before the House follows on a number of other measures which have been introduced by this Government.  In this connection I would mention the removal of the marriage bar to employment in the Public Service, the improvement of facilities for deserted wives, the introduction of benefits and allowances for unmarried mothers and the vesting of the entitlement to childrens allowances in the mother.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that this is a Bill to deal with equal pay.  It covers therefore only a limited, though significant, area of discrimination and will not in itself ensure equality of opportunity for women.  In the preparation of later legislation I propose to consider making unlawful certain practices in employment which impede the progress of women and tend to restrict <Col N="311" /> them to the less skilled and more poorly paid jobs.  Such legislation should also provide a means of redress for individual women who feel they have suffered unfair discrimination in employment.  This present legislation will not provide the complete answer to the subordinate position of women in employment.  More fundamental problems such as the nature of their work in industry, the availability of training facilities and of access to these training facilities, all these are matters which will require consideration and which may require legislative treatment.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us provides that a woman will have the right to the same pay as a man who is employed by the same employer in the same place of employment if both are employed on &ldquo;like work&rdquo;.  The definitions of &ldquo;like work&rdquo; follow broadly the definitions set out in the Report of the Commission of Inquiry on the Status of Women and used in successive national wage agreements. These criteria are a good deal wider in scope than those contained in the equivalent British legislation of 1970 and should ensure that the fairest possible comparisons are drawn between jobs being done by men and women.</P>
    <P>In this area of equal pay both sides of industry will have to work together and secure by their joint efforts the smooth transition to equal pay.  I visualise the vast majority of equal pay claims being settled through direct negotiations between employers and trade unions.  Where agreement cannot be reached the easily accessible machinery provided for in this Bill will ensure that disputes can be settled without undue delay.</P>
    <P>Where settlement of equal pay claims cannot be reached by direct negotiation the Bill provides that a party to a dispute can refer it to an equal pay officer of the Labour Court who will investigate it and issue a recommendation.  The equal pay officers will be trained in the techniques necessary to enable them to give informed and authoritative guidance to the parties involved.  If a party to a <Col N="312" /> dispute is dissatisfied with the recommendation of an equal pay officer there is provision in the Bill for appeal to the Labour Court, who will then issue a binding determination enforceable by law.  Appeals may be made to the High Court on a point of law in any such recommendation.</P>
    <P>I have deliberately selected the Labour Court as the body to be the final arbiter of equal pay cases rather than setting up a separate tribunal as has been done in a number of other countries.  In our situation the Labour Court enjoys a high reputation at the centre of our industrial relations system as a body trusted by both employers and unions.  I would hope that this would contribute towards the acceptability of decisions in this area.</P>
    <P>Where it appears to me that a particular employer has failed to comply with the provisions of the Bill and where for one reason or another it is not reasonable to expect an employee to refer her case to an equal pay officer, I will have power under the Bill to refer cases to the equal pay officers for investigation.</P>
    <P>I have included a provision in the Bill making it an offence for an employer to dismiss a woman on the grounds that she sought equal pay.</P>
    <P>In a prosecution for an offence of this kind the onus will be on the employer to satisfy the courts that the dismissal did not arise solely from the making of the claim for equal pay.  A woman who has been dismissed in the circumstances I have referred to should not be placed in the position of having to incur legal expenses in order to assert her rights as given under this legislation.  The Bill therefore provides that she can if she wishes lodge a complaint with the Labour Court that she has been dismissed from her employment because she sought equal pay whereupon the Labour Court will consider the complaint. If the court is satisfied that the complaint is well-founded it can, by order, direct the employer concerned to compensate the woman for loss of earnings.  An employer who fails to comply with a Labour Court order will be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>I have considered whether in the <Col N="313" /> case of a woman who is dismissed on grounds that she sought equal pay there should be a provision in the Bill which would make compulsory her reinstatement. The legal advice available to me however is that compulsory reinstatement would involve some constitutional difficulties.  In the course of the debate on the Bill in the Dáil, I indicated that I was examining the entire question of reinstatement in connection with an Unfair Dismissals Bill which I hope to introduce later this year.</P>
    <P>I may add that the Bill will apply equally to a man who seeks equal pay with that of a woman who is doing like work in the same place of employment.</P>
    <P>I gave careful consideration to the question of the date for full implementation before deciding that the Act should be brought into operation on the 31st December, 1975; in other words, that women should be entitled to full equality with a man who is doing like work in the same place of employment from that date.  As a Government we were convinced that there could be no further delay in nominating a final date for the implementation of equal pay.</P>
    <P>The decision to proceed to full implementation of this measure by December, 1975, has been the subject of criticism, notably by the employer organisations, since it was two years in advance of the latest date for implementation recommended by the Commission on the Status of Women.  In social legislation of this kind it is of course the right of nationally representative organisations to make known their observations, either of opposition or support, but in the last analysis it is for the Government of the day to take the necessary legislative decisions after consideration of all the factors.</P>
    <P>During the course of the Bill's passage through Dáil Éireann a number of important amendments have been made.  Many of these were as a result of representations made to me by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  As a result I believe that both the scope of the Bill and its effectiveness as an <Col N="314" /> instrument for achieving equal pay have been greatly enhanced.</P>
    <P>The following have been the main changes:</P>
    <P>(a)  the field of employment within which a person may draw comparisons in support of an equal pay claim has been extended to include associated companies;</P>
    <P>(b)  the geographical area within which a person may draw comparisons for equal pay purposes has now been defined as &ldquo;city, town or locality&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>(c)  all collective agreements and all forms of statutory wages orders will now be subject to the provision of the Bill after 1975;</P>
    <P>(d)  in the case of a woman who was dismissed on the grounds that she sought equal pay, the Bill now provides that she can obtain up to two years' arrears of remuneration as compared with six months' arrears as originally provided.</P>
    <P>Despite these important amendments I would not contend that this Bill constitutes the final legislative sortie into this area.  It is inevitable that despite the amount of thought and attention that has been given to the preparation of this measure flaws and unforeseen difficulties will emerge in time.  To ensure that I can make a speedy and flexible response to these problems I propose as soon as this Bill passes into law to establish an equal pay review committee representative of trade unions and employers whose function it will be to monitor the progress being made under this legislation.  This committee will recommend to me in the light of the experience gained the steps necessary to correct any deficiencies which may emerge.  I envisage having this group in operation very shortly and I will arrange for adequate secretarial and research support for its operation.</P>
    <P>The Bill fully meets and in some respects goes beyond the requirements of the EEC Draft Directive on Equal Pay.  The enactment of the Bill will also enable us to ratify ILO Convention No. 100 relating to equal pay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> While this first piece of legislation in the field of equal pay may not give complete answers to all of the problems connected with discrimination in employment, I trust that it will be looked on as a practical contribution to the improvement of the status of women.  As I said at the outset, this Bill is only one of a number of measures which will be required if we are to make progress towards the removal of discrimination in all its forms against women.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House welcome this Bill, even though its scope is very limited.  We believe it will achieve some results, though in the whole context of the struggle which has continued over many years to obtain equal rights in employment for women, this Bill will only be a relatively minor step along the road. This and other Bills, which we hope will come from the Minister in this field, stem essentially from the initiative taken by the former Fianna Fáil Government when it was announced in the budget of 1972 that the Government had taken a definite decision in principle to achieve the situation of equal pay.  This Bill is to a considerable extent based on the draft directive recently produced by the Commission of the EEC.  Indeed it is reasonable to suggest that when the Minister refers in his opening speech to the question of the exact date on which this Bill is to come into force&mdash; the original date suggested was the end of 1977, and now incorporated in the Bill is the 31st December, 1975&mdash;the main factor in changing the Minister's mind was that the date at the end of 1975 was laid down quite clearly in the draft directive of the EEC.  The Minister stated in his speech:</P>
      <P>The Bill fully meets and in some respects goes beyond the requirements of the EEC Draft Directive on Equal Pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a couple of points&mdash;I am not suggesting that they are of great importance&mdash;which are laid down in this draft directive and which are not incorporated in this Bill.  I should be <Col N="316" /> interested to hear the Minister's explanation why they are not.  These are essentially matters for the Committee Stage but I might as well mention them now.</P>
    <P>Article 7 of the draft directive provides that provisions adopted in pursuance of this directive and those already in force shall be brought to the attention of workers in an appropriate manner at their places of work. This is a relatively technical matter. It is important that suitable notices should be put up in places of work so that all the workers involved will be quite clear&mdash;they will pass these notices every day&mdash;that they have these rights under this legislation.  This is a valuable requirement in the directive. While there may be some reasonable explanation, on the face of it it seems a pity that the Minister has not included it in his Bill.</P>
    <P>There is also the question, perhaps of more importance, under Article 6 of the draft directive, where it is stated:</P>
    <P>Member States shall ensure that the application of the principle of equal pay is supervised at the level of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not proposing to do this.  He proposes to appoint equal pay officers who will ensure that the provisions of this Bill are carried out.  I do not know how many equal pay officers he proposes to appoint, but obviously the number will have to be limited.  There are many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of premises which will be affected.  While I can see that there will be difficulties in having supervision at the level of the undertaking, that is no reason for not attempting it.  I suggest that the Minister consider if some form of provision should not be introduced into the Bill for supervising, as laid down in the directive, these matters at the level of the undertaking as well as having the equal pay officers.  It will be very difficult for equal pay officers to keep the day-to-day supervision at the level of each small undertaking.  But that would be possible if the matter was more localised.  As I said, these are essentially Committee points.</P>
    <P>Taking the general matter of the <Col N="317" /> position of women in the industrial and commercial life of the country, the main problem is not one of wages. We all know the general figures, not only in Ireland but in other countries, showing that women consistently get far lower wages than men.  This is due in part to the problem dealt with under this Bill: that in cases where women and men are employed at the same work the women are paid less.  But the big discrepancies in the average earnings of women and men are due to more than this simple matter.  The Report of the Commission on the Status of Women, at page 26, gives a detailed list, which I do not propose to read <i>in toto</i>, of the earnings of women as a percentage of those of men.</P>
    <P>The figures throughout industry given for March, 1972, are fairly consistent. Women's wages are in general between 55 and 65 per cent of those of men, in other words, less than two-thirds of those of men in comparable industries.  The position is similar in other countries.  Again I quote from the Commission on the Status of Women, and these figures all apply to October, 1966.  In Belgium, for example, although the total number of women employed in manufacturing industry is 25.8 per cent of the total number of workers, they have only 4.1 per cent of skilled jobs.  In Germany 29.7 per cent of all workers in manufacturing industry are women and they have only 1.6 per cent of skilled jobs.  In France 29.3 per cent of all workers are women and they have 3.6 per cent of the jobs.  In Italy the figures are 30.6 of all workers and 5.6 per cent of skilled jobs are held by women.  Luxembourg has a small number of female workers&mdash;only 5.9 per cent&mdash;and they are one-fifth of 1 per cent of the skilled workers. The Netherlands have 16.8 per cent of the total workers and 2.0 per cent of the skilled workers are women.  The general picture is one where, generally speaking, the women are unskilled or semi-skilled workers.  The skilled jobs are almost exclusively reserved for men.</P>
    <P>The reasons for this are numerous. One of the main reasons why it is so difficult for women to obtain adequate <Col N="318" /> employment is the lack of training. This is not the only problem, as the sad fact is that, even where women are adequately trained, they face similar problems.  In Germany, for example, a female graduate in chemistry earns far less and is offered comparatively less interesting positions than men.  This also applies to other countries.  While 47 per cent of the female employees in the various Government Ministries in Bonn have a fairly high standard of school or university education, they have only 8.9 per cent of the higher grade jobs.  We all know this position exists in this country.  Very few higher civil servants are women.</P>
    <P>In Germany 26.6 per cent of all civil servants and 59.1 per cent of all other salaried employees in the public sector are women.  Only 5.3 per cent of Government administrators and 1.4 per cent of executives are women, there being at this executive level of the public sector only one woman to 137 men.  This is a general pattern which is to be found in all countries. It is not entirely a matter of training &mdash;though that aspect is very important and I should like the Minister to introduce legislation to ensure that women have equal access to training &mdash;but it is also a matter of tradition and prejudice which is as strong in this country as in other countries. There is a feeling that any job of importance must be given to a man. One way of overcoming this is to have more women on interview boards and as recruiting officers.  The Minister should take action on this in due course.</P>
    <P>Many people fear that with more jobs available to women and the willingness of employers to recruit them, women may suffer because this Bill provides for compulsory equal pay. It is feared that, if employers are given the choice of employing a woman or a man at the same wage, they will inevitably choose the man. I would have worried about this a few years ago, but in present economic circumstances in Ireland this fear, if it ever had any validity, is no longer valid.  It may have been valid at a time when there was a very large surplus <Col N="319" /> of labour, heavy unemployment and emigration.  It is not valid now because in many spheres of the economy there is a shortage of labour.  If an employer is looking for a person to fill a responsible position he will take whoever is efficient, irrespective of their sex.  Women need not worry that although they will have theoretical equal pay under this Bill, they will have less access to jobs.</P>
    <P>So far as it goes, one can support this Bill.  The Minister must realise that it only touches the surface of the problem.  Many more things need to be done.  Unless women have equal access to jobs of responsibility and jobs requiring skill, this limited provision for equal pay will have little effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like the other speakers, welcome this Bill.  It is a landmark in the history of the women of Ireland that this Bill has reached this stage even if rather belatedly. This campaign for equal pay for women began in 1888, therefore, it cannot be said that the Bill is premature in 1974.  There has been considerable movement in Europe, America and eastern countries towards the elimination of discrimination against women in all its aspects. This has always been highlighted by the campaign for equal pay.  In his statement the Minister appears to accept that equal pay of itself is a small step in the direction of eliminating existing discrimination.  Legislation of itself is only a small step towards achieving the state we wish to attain.  This area falls within the scope of Parliament.  I am pleased to be here today making this small move towards eliminating what has been a ridiculous situation.  This type of legislation has been in existence in other countries for many years.  The first Equal Pay Act came into force in 1919 in the State of Michigan in the USA.  Yet today American women do not enjoy full equal pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The women of Ireland would be very silly if they felt that any part of this Bill, or similar Bills, is going to control economic equality.  There is <Col N="320" /> much more than that involved.  Indeed I take the comment of Senator Yeats and what the Minister said in introducing the Bill about the importance of having full anti-discrimination legislation on this matter.  There was the case in England very recently where they got equal pay legislation through in 1970 which was to become fully operative by 1975.  In fact, because they did not proceed with an anti-discrimination legislation in other areas, that legislation has proved remarkably ineffective in many ways. The Americans have had the same experience.  Their big impetus towards equal pay came after they adopted a portion of the civil rights legislation in 1967.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister at this early stage not to wait beyond the end of this year before giving us the draft of the next Anti-Discrimination Bill. Experience all over the world has proved that one without the other may mean next to nothing.</P>
    <P>In this country in recent years&mdash; due, I think, to pressure from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the women's organisations&mdash;we have made some important steps forward. Indeed the publication of the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women was a landmark in history. When that was debated in this House &mdash;and I was grateful that we had the opportunity of debating it&mdash;I, unfortunately, was not able to participate in the debate.  I should like to take this opportunity of recording my appreciation of the work that commission did.  The report certainly alerted a lot of people because it is such a well-documented, objective and factual account of the situation in Ireland.  Indeed, it was an indictment of our society.</P>
    <P>However it was in the recent national wage agreements that, perhaps, we took positive steps forward. These were negotiated at the Employer-Labour Conference and by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The wage agreement currently in operation for many people provides for a 17½ per cent narrowing of the gap in some areas.  The Minister has taken the definitions from the national wage <Col N="321" /> agreement and written them into the Bill.  This covers areas of unequal pay which, perhaps, might not have been covered otherwise.  It covers, for instance, the marriage differential which applies to civil servants and in some local authority areas, but is mostly confined to the public sector. That 17½ per cent has meant that the vast majority of women working in the Civil Service have moved towards equality.  Indeed the current national wage agreement includes provision for the further narrowing of the gap by 33? per cent.</P>
    <P>However, we have had an indication of what happens even under freely negotiated agreements and legislation.  The number of women who have actually benefited by that 17½ per cent are relatively few.  It might surprise people to discover that even in the public sector it has not been conceded in many areas.  In the local government sector, for instance, where married and single scales operate for the clerical officers, the City and County Managers' Association have refused to concede the 17½ per cent on all points of the scale, even though the marriage differential exists on all points of the scale.  I do not want to bore the House with the details of that situation; but the problem is far from being settled, as far as I can see.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill itself, I think in many ways it is more a Committee Stage Bill, but there are a few points on which I should like to comment. The Minister says it has gone further than the British Act.  That is the one with which we are most familiar.  We are certainly familiar with the way it operates because the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, both at executive and at advisory committee level, are in close contact with their colleagues in the North of Ireland.  We know of the difficulties they have experienced in the operation of their Act and where the pitfalls are likely to arise.  This Bill is in many ways much better than the English Act.  To that extent I should like to compliment the Minister.</P>
    <P>I agree that, no matter how carefully a Bill is drafted there can be loopholes.  I want to refer to one section <Col N="322" /> of the Bill particularly because the Minister might be able to give some comments in reply.  It is section 2 (3).  It seems to me that that section, as it stands at the moment, is wide open to abuse.  It would not take a very clever employer to use that section as a basis for discrimination. Experience of employers indicates that they are quite remarkable at thinking up grounds, other than sex, for different rates of remuneration. Some tightening up of the wording in that section might be in order&mdash;for instance, the insertion of a clause indicating that payment must be related to actual differences in the performance of service.</P>
    <P>The biggest criticism of the Bill is that when it becomes operative in 1975 it will have but a limited effect. Senator Yeats read out figures relative to the differences between male and female wages I do not want to go over those figures again.  There has been a lot of fuss over the title of the Bill.  As far as the majority of the women of Ireland are concerned they would not care if this Bill was called the &ldquo;Barbed Wire Act&rdquo; or anything else so long as it gave them economic equality.  The Bill is confined to an equal pay concept and therefore it has left out the vast majority of workers, and mostly the lower-paid workers.  The Bill will achieve its purpose in respect of what one might call the &ldquo;white-collar worker&rdquo; because equality is going to be fairly easily established there and in some other areas in industry.</P>
    <P>The situation in the Irish work-force at the moment is, of course, that women are confined to jobs traditionally held by women and men are in male jobs.  By some marvellous coincidence, which I am sure the House will appreciate, men's wages just happen to be that much higher than women's wages.  There will be little basis on which we can establish equal value or light work.  Therefore the vast majority of women in industry will not be dealt with by this Bill.  The Minister spoke about another Bill in his introductory speech and said this Bill will be the most important part of this anti-discrimination legislation.</P>
    <P>The section of the English Act <Col N="323" /> which has proved most effective has been one in which they allowed for the women's rate being brought up to at least the minimum male rate. This may mean that in England you could have a semi-skilled woman getting male labourer's rate, but that is still a vast improvement on the previous situation.  In this area the trade unions have been able to negotiate most effectively in narrowing the gap.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister say that he intends to set up a review committee to monitor the progress of the legislation.  It will be a review committee representing trade unions and employers.  This is one of the matters on which many of the other countries have fallen down. Once we get a piece of legislation we say &ldquo;That is fine.  The employers and trade unions will see to it that that is implemented&rdquo;.  In fact the statistics already read out by Senator Yeats prove that they have not done that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the idea of the review committee monitoring the legislation. I would be very happy if I had the terms of reference of that committee, but I presume it might be too early for the Minister to give them now.  I would also be very concerned to know whether this review committee will have the power to look at the areas of employment which I have just mentioned.  It will be relatively easy to monitor the progress in the public sector, but it will not be easy to know what is going on in the private sector of industry.  This is where the big wage gap occurs.  This is where the Minister will find that the Bill is doing little towards achieving its objectives. Perhaps we could get an annual report, which we could discuss, which would give an indication of how effective this legislation is and where, if necessary, it needs to be remedied.  I know this is not covered by the Commission on the Status of Women.  If the Minister is ever to do anything to help the lower-paid section of women in this community he needs to have something similar to what is in the British Act.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the operative date will be 1975.  I think this is <Col N="324" /> quite a remarkable achievement.  The commission were set up in 1970.  At the time the Irish Congress of Trade Unions felt that the operative date here should not be after the operative date in Britain, and their operative date is December, 1975.  The commission did not accept that, but I am very glad the Minister has been able to make the Bill operative by 1975.  More important than the actual money involved is the fact that it shortens the time in which, as our friends on the radio say, diversionary action can be taken.  It is true that already because of the introduction of this legislation some employers in the city have taken diversionary action. What is called the &ldquo;all-female&rdquo; grade is being brought into existence. This is to make sure that work of equal value and like work will not be easily demonstrated or negotiated. Therefore, the sooner this legislation comes into effect the better.  As a trade unionist who is not necessarily anti-employer, I studied the &ldquo;druidery&rdquo; they got up to in England to avoid the implementation of the British Act. I think the review committee will play a very important role here.</P>
    <P>What we are getting from this legislation is important.  First of all, it is very important for the people it will affect.  I think they will be a limited number.  I welcome also the indication that we are to get further legislation on discrimination.  Perhaps the next legislation will be comprehensive legislation dealing with all the areas of education, training, promotion, access to jobs and access to some unions, which is still denied to some of us.</P>
    <P>It is important for the country's point of view that we can now ratify Article 100 of the ILO Convention and that we can fully adopt the European Social Charter.  Up to now we have asked for exclusions.  These exclusions meant that we retained the <i>status quo.</i>  These are important and welcome amendments to our legislation. It was part of the 14-point programme of the National Coalition Government that they would look at areas of discrimination and do something about them.  The improvements <Col N="325" /> in social welfare benefits and this Bill are a firm indication of the Government's intent in that regard.</P>

      <P>I paused, hoping it would not be a majority of women Senators who would be discussing this Bill.  I welcome the Bill in the framework in which the Minister has placed it: as the first in a series of pieces of legislation to remove discrimination against women.  As such it may be regarded for what it is: a first limited step.  It is clear that this Bill when it becomes operative in December, 1975, will not affect the lifestyle or the status of the majority of women workers in this country.  It is a welcome Bill, but it is only a very preliminary step.  I am pleased that the Minister places it in that context. Also, I should like to commend the Minister for his flexibility while this Bill was being debated in the other House and his willingness to bring in amendments which have improved the scope of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is a danger in beginning with a Bill of this nature, called the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill and referring to the recommendation of the Commission on the Status of Women on equal pay, that it tends to distract attention from the reality.  The reality is that this Bill will not improve the working conditions of the vast majority of women workers.  It will have impact only on the skilled workers in certain areas and on those who have reached a certain level on the scale and who are, as Senator Owens said, to some extent the &ldquo;white-collar&rdquo; women workers in the country.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to refer specifically to this broader context and to press for more comprehensive measures which should come into effect at the same time as this Bill.  I agree very much with Senator Owens that we must benefit from the experience of other countries, particularly Britain, Northern Ireland and parts of the United States, where it has been found that a limited measure of this sort can be evaded unless it is set in the framework of broader measures to eliminate discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be preferable if the first <Col N="326" /> step had been directed towards creating job opportunities for the whole range of women workers, beginning with the introduction of a minimum wage.  In this way there would be less disparity between the working conditions of women within the scope of operation of this Bill and those who are totally outside its range altogether. In Ireland we must be aware of the fact that there are only a very small proportion of women in skilled occupations, in managerial and executive work, or in the various professions.  At the moment there is widespread discrimination in recruitment for a job and in job allocation.  Despite the title of this Bill, that sort of discrimination is completely outside its range.  The average hourly earnings of women generally are considerably lower than the average hourly earnings for male workers.  Once again, except in a very narrow range of employment, that position will be unaffected by this Bill, although the situation is being improved gradually as a result of successive national wage agreements.</P>
    <P>These are realities which we must face lest we become complacent about this measure.  It is necessary to face such realities and to press for other measures to be introduced on a similar timescale to this particular Bill.  These would remove discrimination in the hiring for a job, discrimination in promotion within employment and discrimination in job training.  Also, the whole question of advertising for a job is one for which there is a need for specific legislation.</P>
    <P>To achieve the objective of this legislation it is necessary to cater for the specific responsibilities of women by introducing legislation guaranteeing paid maternity leave for women workers, to provide for particular child-care services, creches, and so on, which make a reality of equality of opportunity in employment.  These are a necessary complement to the particular aim of this Bill which deals with the question of equal pay.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the indication of intent on the part of the Minister in his Second Reading speech, I should like to see a firmer commitment by him on behalf of the Government that <Col N="327" /> these other areas will be legislated for in the same time scale: in other words, a specific undertaking to introduce the other Anti-Discrimination Bills which he promised.  I believe this is essential to any genuine endeavour to bring about equality of opportunity and equality of pay.  These measures should be introduced in a time scale which will make them operative by 31st December, 1975.</P>
    <P>Senators Yeats and Owens mentioned the influence of the European Community on the timing of this Bill. It is appropriate that we note that in this area, as a result of the social action programme of the Community and the draft directive on equal pay, there is a positive stimulus to bring about better social conditions in Irish life.  We are obliged to bring forward the date on which we meet the commitment to introducing equal pay in employment from the latest date of the recommendation of the Commission on the Status of Women, 31st December, 1977, to the date in the Bill, 31st December, 1975.  Sometimes there is a tendency to regard the European Community as a cold, economic capitalist plot, but it is pleasing to affirm that in this area our membership has had a positive effect on social conditions here and on the conditions of the work-force in this country.</P>
    <P>I join with Senator Owens in welcoming the fact that we will now adhere to the ILO Convention No. 100 and also to implementing in full the European social charter.  We have been sadly negligent in adhering to several ILO Conventions.  We must advance rapidly towards the social conditions in other countries in Europe in order to provide for full freedom of movement and for equality of social conditions between ourselves and other countries of the European Community.</P>
    <P>Looking more precisely at the Bill itself, I would like first of all to join with Senator Owens when she asks whether section 2, on the entitlement to equal pay, is drafted in sufficiently precise terms to prevent its avoidance, between now and 31st December, 1975, by employers who wish to evade the implications of this Bill.  The danger <Col N="328" /> is that jobs will be redefined so that the discrimination is not on the basis of sex but on some other basis.  Where this is done sufficiently in advance of the date of operation of the Bill the employer should be able to discharge any burden of showing that this was not on the grounds of sex.  In other words, a careful programming by employers in anticipation of this Bill could allow a sufficiently determined employer to avoid its implications.  The solution is to provide that the minimum scale for the female employee will not be below the minimum for the male employee.</P>
    <P>There is a weakness in the Bill in that investigations by the equal pay officer will be either at the request of a party to the dispute, under section 7, subsection (1), or at the request of the Minister under subsection (2), but no other person can be the initiating party.  If it was possible to allow some other person or body, appropriately a trade union, provided that the union have authority in writing from the individual, it would be a much more realistic way of authorising the equal pay officer to deal with the particular complaint.  The reality very often is that an employee who feels that she is discriminated against in pay conditions may fear she will be prejudiced, not perhaps in the short term that she will be dismissed because of certain safeguards in the Bill, but that it will prejudice her long-term employment opportunity in that firm and prejudice her promotion.</P>
    <P>As well as that it takes a certain level of independence and determination to bring a claim in this way which is akin to a legal action.  It would be preferable that the individual concerned could authorise a union or authorise another body on behalf of that party to bring the dispute before the equal pay officer for investigation, and similarly where it is proposed to bring the investigation before the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill now extends to collective bargaining, and also that the definition of &ldquo;place&rdquo; has been extended to include a city, town or locality and that the meaning of <Col N="329" />&ldquo;employer&rdquo; has been extended to include an associate employer so that it will encompass a holding company or different companies operating under similar management.  These are improvements in the Bill which have been brought about by amendments after discussion.  It would be a further improvement to make the definition in section 2 a more precise one which would prevent evasion, and, secondly, to allow a person to authorise either a union or a group to proceed with the written authority of that person and take the complaint to the equal pay officer or to the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points on the Bill which are largely Committee points.  Another matter which has aroused interest is the statement by the Minister that he proposes to establish an equal pay review committee. I join with Senator Owens in welcoming some monitoring committee of this kind.  However, I wonder whether it would be possible to give this committee a statutory basis by incorporating it in the actual terms of the Bill itself?  This would have several positive advantages.  Firstly, the committee could be given specific statutory functions.  It would be of great assistance if the review committee was not confined merely to a monitoring of the actual operation of the Bill itself but if it had specific statutory authority to make recommendations to the Minister in relation to other areas of discrimination, and as to how they might be removed.</P>
    <P>In addition, it would be helpful if the committee had a statutory duty to report annually to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  These reports give an opportunity for a parliamentary scrutiny of the operation of social legislation of this sort.  The disadvantage of the Minister setting up an equal pay review committee outside the structure of the Act is that the Oireachtas has no specific role in relation to it, and the terms of reference of the committee are at a much lower level and are totally at the discretion of the Minister.  The actual status, the functioning of the committee, is less secure <Col N="330" /> and less independent than if it were incorporated in the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>The value of incorporating such a review committee in the Bill would be that it would allow an independent assessment of the extent to which this Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill was having an impact on employment, the extent to which there were attempts to evade its implications on the lines that have been suggested, and the extent to which it was really making a substantial difference to the life style of female workers.</P>
    <P>Finally I join with the other two Senators who have spoken on the Bill in welcoming it as a first and, admittedly, limited step on the road to equality of opportunity and equality of pay for the women of this country. I seek&mdash;if he is prepared to give it&mdash; a more specific assurance from the Minister that the other measures which he has hinted at will be implemented within the same time scale to prevent the sort of evasion which this Bill is otherwise open to, and to prevent its being a Bill with a rather grandiose title which, in effect, has little impact on the vast majority of female workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to join with other Senators in welcoming this Bill.  It is true to say that, probably during the whole history of the world, down through the centuries, women have been placed in a very different category from that of men. This applied in particular to employment, conditions of employment and remuneration.  This country was no worse than any other country.  With few exceptions women have seldom been given the same opportunities as men to reach the top in various forms of employment.  Of course we have a few striking examples of women who made the grade and who established themselves.  They have gained for themselves a page, a line, or a chapter in the history books.  Generally speaking, the conditions under which women workers lived and worked, not alone in this country but in other countries, were much lower than the conditions which obtained for men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This applied, in particular, inside my own organisation, the INTO.  For <Col N="331" /> years and years there were two, three or four different pay structures within that service.  People were discriminated against on grounds of sex and also on grounds of marital status.  As a trade unionist I tried to fight against this injustice all my life.  I am glad to say that the present Leader of the Opposition was the man who, as Minister for Education, eventually acceded to our request and allowed women teachers the right to remain in the service after marriage.  That was a type of discrimination which we thought was very unjust all down the line: we were aware that women who were teaching small children and women who had children of their own had a much better understanding of the problems of younger children and of family life in general.  I am very glad to see that that has been rectified, and that the thinking, in general, throughout the country has moved in that direction.</P>
    <P>Before we on this side of the House left office, this very measure had already been announced.  It was long overdue.  Many people do not realise the part that women play in the life of the community and particularly in the family life of this nation.  It has been said that: &ldquo;The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world&rdquo;.  It is an undeniable fact that the influence of the mother on children, and on the nation as a whole, is very great. We, as a people, should ensure that women are not discriminated against in any way if they are working and that they should get their entitlements and have conditions on a par with &mdash;or even better than&mdash;their opposite numbers.  I welcome the Bill that aims at doing that.</P>
    <P>We have a lot to be thankful for to the women of Ireland.  On one occasion I heard the late Dan Breen being interviewed about his escapades during the fight for freedom, and the narrow escapes he and his comrades had.  When he was asked who were the people he thought did most in those days, his answer was very remarkable. He said: &ldquo;The ordinary women of Ireland&rdquo;.  This nation owes a deep debt of gratitude to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="332" /> There are sections in the professions who will have an opportunity of benefiting immensely from this.  It is only right that this should be the case. I would always campaign for equal pay for equal work.  In many spheres women are on a par with men.  In particular, since the last war, they have gone into the professions and into many other employments such as driving buses and working machines. Indeed many of them have been out in some of the wars which were fought since World War II.</P>
    <P>Therefore it is right that such a measure should be before this House and that we, on this side, should support it.  It is only part of the social justice to which women are entitled. To have them doing the same work as men and not getting the same pay is ridiculous.  This immediately creates a type of inferiority complex among them.  That should not be, because they are the people who will be rearing the nation's families and they could pass on that type of inferiority complex to their children.  If anything bedevilled the people of Ireland in the past, it was this type of inferiority complex.  We had a feeling that we were not as good as our neighbour, or that we were not as good as other countries.  This should help to stamp out that inheritance which has been handed down to us who were an oppressed people for so long.</P>
    <P>I wonder what effect this measure will have on recruitment into the Civil Service where the majority of the employees are women.  Will it create better openings for men and will it reduce the number of women employed?  I should like if the measure could be extended to those women who perform very important jobs even if they are not of a professional nature, for example, people who work in hospitals, buildings such as this, and various other institutions.</P>
    <P>In the past there was a great deal of discrimination throughout the country.  We were educationally starved in our youth.  The primary schools did excellent work, but there were very few facilities for post-primary education.  Consequently many of our people with brains and <Col N="333" /> talents, through no fault of their own, were not able to get secondary or third level education and are now, in uninteresting positions.  I should like to see this legislation applying to the lower-paid workers.</P>
    <P>This is a good piece of legislation. It will probably have its teething troubles.  As a member of a party which successfully piloted through the Oireachtas social legislation for the benefit of our workers and which tried to improve the lot of the less fortunate members of the community, I think this is an excellent piece of legislation and I am very happy to see the Minister introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>The slogan &ldquo;Equal pay for equal work&rdquo; has been much discussed.  The wording has been changed to &ldquo;Equal pay for like work&rdquo;, but the discussion will continue even after the acceptance of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am sure Senator Owens and Senator Robinson would like it to go on record that their fellow-Senators are overwhelmingly in favour of such a Bill.  Senator Robinson expressed that hope that a male Member of the Seanad would speak on the Bill.  There are very few men who would oppose the principles embodied in the Bill which the Minister for Labour has laid before us.</P>
      <P>There is still something of an idealistic aura about this Bill.  To make it something more than an ideal, to apply it in practice to the people it is supposed to benefit, is the nub of the task which lies before us.  Lip service to the principle of this Bill has been paid for a long time.  Senator Owens and Senator Robinson referred to diversionary and evasive tactics in the next 18 months to frustrate or delay the implementation of the Bill.  While I have no doubt that the terms of the Bill will be implemented in full within State and local authority services I see certain difficulties in regard to its application in small and private concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Federated Union of Employers made some comments in this connection. They mentioned that the period before implementation was not long enough.  Perhaps the Minister, in his <Col N="334" /> reply, could elaborate on this matter and tell us if he would recommend to the Labour Court that pay officers, under the terms of this Bill, should sympathetically consider such cases as will inevitably arise in small firms and private businesses.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that there could be an inflationary aspect.  The fact that the proportion of women in our work force has increased, as the Minister said, to 26 per cent of the working population would on its own be sufficient reason why we should at long last tackle in practical terms the principle of equal pay for like work. It is good to see a Bill such as this coming hot on the track of legislation already introduced to alleviate the lot of the opposite sex, such as the removal of the marriage bar in the Public Service, assistance to deserted wives, and the vesting of entitlement to children's allowances in the mother. These measures have all been very welcome.  This Bill will also be welcomed. The Minister has tried as far as he can to see that the terms of the Bill will be applied as far as practicable.</P>
    <P>I should like if the Minister would say when replying what he thinks the attitude of the Labour Court and the pay officers should be to difficult submissions and cases which will inevitably be put to them by very small firms who will face the inflationary aspect to which I referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like unreservedly to welcome this Bill and particularly to compliment the Minister on the tone of his speech, which was realistic, tactful, modest and accurate. It acknowledged that the Bill does not do everything, but it described precisely what it will do.  Its whole tone was an earnest of the determination of the Minister and Government to carry through the necessary reforms in this large and complicated area of our industrial, commercial and administrative life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps in a tone of levity I must take exception to a sentence in the second paragraph which seems oddly worded: &ldquo;Much needs to be done through legislation and otherwise to eliminate unfair discrimination on <Col N="335" /> grounds of sex where it exists and so help to change the prejudiced attitudes which give rise to it.&rdquo;  There seems to be almost a reflection on the Creator. Surely the sentence should read: &ldquo;Much needs to be done through legislation and otherwise to eliminate unfair discrimination where it exists with regard to sex&rdquo;?  I presume the Minister does not set out to abolish this unfortunate biological phenomenon which goes under that three-letter word.</P>
    <P>However, after that note of levity I should like to go on and say that when the Civil Service (Employment of Married Women) Act, 1973, came through the House there was a great deal of what I felt was undue self-congratulation about the fact that the marriage bar had been removed in the Civil Service area.  I probably struck the only truculant note that day in saying that there was so much more to be done that it would be a dreadful failing and misapprehension if one were to consider that particular enactment to be sufficient in itself, that there were a great number of things involving the semi-State bodies, and property rights, and the situation of deserted wives, which had to be dealt with.  I said on that occasion that I hoped there would be action on them, and I chose to see the Bill as a stepping stone.  I can see now that my truculence and perhaps some of my cynicism, which was occasioned by what I thought was too large a celebration in the House, has been proven to be misjudged.</P>
    <P>This Bill, in itself, and particularly the tone in which the Minister has couched his introduction of the Bill, promises that this whole area of discrimination within our society will be pursued methodically, gradually and intelligently, and with the skill which the Minister has shown on so many occasions so far in his short term in office.  Particularly admirable in the Bill is the fact that it does not content itself with mere aspiration, with the enunciation of a slogan.  For instance, the Minister points out that there will be equal pay officers and that they &ldquo;will be trained in the <Col N="336" /> techniques necessary to enable them to give informed and authoritative guidance to the parties involved.  If a party to a dispute is dissatisfied with the recommendation of an equal pay officer, there is provision in the Bill for appeal to the Labour Court who will then issue a binding determination enforceable by law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is good, clear, forthright language.  It is the kind of language in which this kind of reform should be couched.  It is the language of a Minister who really means what he says and who is not simply window-dressing. I should also like to applaud his tact in laying the responsibility for this on the Labour Court.  Special courts to deal with women's complaints have been set up elsewhere. That would seem to me to be discriminatory and to be against the entire spirit of the Bill, which is towards equality and which avoids that kind of condescension.</P>
    <P>Therefore I should like to welcome the Bill and I should also like to welcome the attitude of the Minister towards the amendments which have been put forward.  These amendments are good and they enhance the Bill.  The acceptance of them is again a further earnest of goodwill in the entire field.  There is just one cautionary note on which I should like to end.  Within a society which has grown up in western civilisation, as we are pleased to call it, recently there is a very strident assertion of the role of women, and very properly so.  I do not like the stridency but the importance of woman and her equality and the need for her equality and her contribution to be recognised are all admirable.</P>
    <P>When the Report on the Status of Women came forward I had only one reservation about it.  It did not say anything about the role of motherhood. It seems to me that there are certain things that women are very good at and certain things that men are very good at.  That is a fact that should be recognised.  It should also be recognised that one of the very great vocations that falls to women is to be wives and mothers.  In the climate that I have described or hinted <Col N="337" /> at, there is a certain rhetoric in the air today which makes many women feel that the role of home-making and of motherhood is somehow or other a less glamorous and maybe in the end a less worthy profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EvelynOwens" hpid="Miss Owens Miss Owens">

      <P>It could not be paid for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It could not be paid for.  It is so invaluable that it could not.  What salary could you offer to a woman for properly rearing her children? It could not be done.  You could not assess it in any terms.  Senator Owen's remark buttresses my point that this particular vocation of womanhood is of enormous importance. It is being downgraded in certain areas of the whole journalistic world today.</P>
      <P>It would be a very great pity if the admirable and commendable zeal which is being shown, particularly here and now, to eliminate disabilities and inequalities should overwhelm that central and very important function which has so much to do with the health and the furtherance of our people.  I should like to echo my colleague, Senator Dolan, who said that, &ldquo;The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world&rdquo;.  While it goes on rocking the cradle it should be content and confident that it is doing perhaps the greatest job that can be done in the world.  With that reservation which is, perhaps, more in the rhetoric of a Redemptorist homily than in the rhetoric of Seanad legislation, I should like quite unreservedly to welcome the Bill and indeed to compliment the Minister on the manner in which he has introduced it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank those various Senators who have spoken on this legislation.  The points that have been raised relate to certain questions involved in it.  I agree with Senator Robinson and Senator Owens&mdash;the point has been made by other Senators also&mdash;that this legislation will only be truly effective when other legislation dealing with related areas of discrimination are also in operation.  This current legislation will come into <Col N="338" /> effect in December, 1975.  I would envisage that the legislation which I have in preparation dealing with the area of unfair dismissal, on the question of recruitment, training and promotion of women, will be operative by the time December, 1975, comes around and this is implemented.</P>
      <P>Senator Owens made the important point&mdash;and I agree with her&mdash;that. while she conceded that the section in the comparable British legislation which provides for an equation between the unskilled rate of male and female employment in industries would not be appropriate to this legislation, the provision in the British legislation has proved of great assistance in raising the pay of women.  I believe however that this current legislation has all the elements necessary to prove the case of equal pay for work of equal value.  I placed a great deal of hope on the formation of the committee I mentioned today, which will be representative of both employers and unions, as a monitoring agency to see that this legislation will prove effective.  It may happen that events will bear out those critics of the legislation who say sincerely that they do not see it as being of great assistance to those women in industry who are lowly paid.  I hope that the committee which we will set up immediately this Bill is enacted will start to work at once to survey the area and begin the work which will be necessary to ensure there is no evasion of the provisions of this legislation. Senator Robinson suggested that the committee should be on a statutory basis.  That necessity does not arise as both bodies from which I would expect nominees to be sent to this committee would be very vigilant to see they are entering a committee which will have some authority.  The need for under-pinning it in this statutory fashion will not be necessary in that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to give the committee secretarial assistance and we will together look at this area and see what other legislative steps, what other measures may be necessary to see that the intent of this legislation becomes a reality for the majority of women <Col N="339" /> working in industry.  The Bill commits the community through legislation to the principle of equal pay and setting out comprehensive definitions which will establish entitlement.  It provides a structure within which equal pay claims can be processed and determined should they not be resolved by direct negotiations.  It provides sanctions against those who are found to discriminate in the matter of pay.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey raised the question of small employees.  There is no provision of this type made in this legislation. After December, 1975, where it can be proved that there is work of equal value, demanding equal responsibility, being performed by a woman, she will have to obtain pay equal to that of her male colleagues. This is the sort of debate which goes on interminably&mdash;whether our social objectives must be price-tagged to the point that we cannot legislate improvements in the social policy area. One often hears&mdash;not so much in these days&mdash;of the economic advantages on the prices level, of our entry into the EEC.  Here is one of the social obligations contingent on our admission to the EEC.  Many of those who were to the fore in stating we must join Europe may not have sufficiently emphasised that there were social obligations in our membership of the EEC.  The price of cattle was not to be the sole reason for joining Europe: anybody looking at the price of cattle at present might not see the applicability of that argument.  There were social obligations and we are serious about living up to them.  Small businesses as well as large businesses must fulfil their obligations in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats questioned whether we lived up to the EEC directive.  This legislation does, in significant respects, go beyond that directive.  As I have stated it provides compensation for dismissal which is not included in the EEC directive.  There is provision in it for a remedy through the Labour Court without any cost to the litigants, the women concerned, and this is not included in the EEC directive either.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> When speaking about fulfilling our obligations in EEC social policy one must not forget that we contribute to the development of EEC social policy. I sit on the Council of Ministers dealing with social policy.  We have had a good influence on the development of European social policy.  It would be wrong to suggest that European social policy evolves without our active participation because we do participate in the development of policy in Brussels in the Social Affairs Committee.  The question of whether it will benefit the majority of women was raised by Senator Robinson.  I have answered this by stating we will have other anti-discrimination measures in operation by the time this legislation comes into effect in December, 1975.  Senator Robinson was worried lest a trade union could not bring a case, on behalf of a woman, to the equal pay officer.  The Bill will permit a trade union to bring a case to the equal pay officer.</P>
    <P>Senators Robinson and Owens were concerned that employers might reclassify jobs before the implementation of this measure.  As Senator Owens stated, this has been the experience elsewhere where such legislation was in operation without accompanying anti-discrimination legislation. This situation should be met by this other legislation being in operation before then.  I also hope the committee to which I have referred will take an active part in notifying unions and employers of such measures before December, 1975.</P>
    <P>Senator Owens was worried that section 2 might introduce unnecessary vagueness.  This section is necessary to ensure there could be payments based on increment and service.  There is, of course, the basis of appeal in all cases where a woman feels there is some injustice occurring under the terms of this legislation.  Senator Yeats and other Senators stated that until women are performing more skilled jobs in industry there will not be a change on a large scale in their status. While their numbers in the work force are increasing, it is true that they mainly occupy lowly-skilled jobs and therefore the less well-paid jobs. <Col N="341" /> Whatever we do in the legislative area, even if we brought in the most wonderful legislation imaginable in this area there remains a great body of public opinion which must be influenced. The minds of organisations must be changed so that jobs with a high-skill content can be opened up to women.  There devolves on the State a great responsibility to see that the necessary training is provided so that women may participate fully in responsible jobs in industry.</P>
    <P>The legislation on recruitment, training and promotion which it is hoped will be introduced later this year, should help in that direction. Finally, there is a limit to what any type of legislation may do in this area. It is not possible to legislate into existence a change in human nature; I do not cherish that illusion but legislation in this area can have an important influence on the formation of public opinion.  That is why I think it is not sufficient for the State to await a change in public attitudes; the State must actively assist in bringing these into existence.</P>
    <P>I accept Senator Martin's gracious comments with thanks.  I did not set out in my speech to abolish sex; I have no prejudices in the matter.  I am not the best qualified spokesman on the virtues of marriage or the lack of them. These larger questions involving the role of women in our society to which other Senators have referred must be dealt with by degrees.</P>
    <P>We cannot overnight change certain outmoded attitudes in regard to the role of women in society.  I agree that no legislation of ours should seek to deprive women of their family role&mdash; that will always be a decision for the individual&mdash;but I think that our legislation and our facilities must permit women, as citizens to join other citizens in society on a basis of equality in regard to jobs and occupations.  In other words, they must be given their full status as human beings in our society.  Regrettably, this has not been their lot up to now and this Administration, as Senator Owens remarked, is committed since the last election to introduce whatever legislation may be helpful or necessary.  In the measures <Col N="342" /> to be introduced later I hope to see that commitment honoured.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> This is a very important motion because it refers to the fundamental right of the citizen to receive an adequate education.  In many areas in this country in days gone by and, indeed, not so long ago, facilities for a reasonable standard of education were denied to our people.  I am not trying to cast any reflection on the fundamental base of education which is first, the home and secondly the national schools of this country.  It is true that in the past and right down the line, the teachers, under deplorable conditions in these schools, gave tremendous service and this reflects eternal credit on those dedicated men and women and, indeed, on the pupils who went there.  The vast majority of our people when they went abroad to seek employment, whether in England, Scotland or America, had nothing better than an ordinary national school education.  That standard was very high.  Many of them were questioned as to whether they had post-primary education of any kind?  Had they attended secondary schools or high schools, as they term them in America? These people were reluctant to admit that during their youth they had not secured post-primary education.  If they had the courage to speak up for themselves and if they did not have an inferiority complex, which was due to lack of education, they could have asserted themselves on a par with many of the people who had post-primary education in the countries in which they were seeking employment.  In many areas in this country very little attempt was made to provide any type of post-primary school to ensure that the people there would have a chance to secure a post-primary education. When the Vocational Education Act, 1930, was introduced, for some unknown reason the people attending these schools were not allowed to take part in the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations, which in those days were the criteria for entry into the Civil Service and other higher paid positions.  Success in those examinations would have given them some social status when they travelled abroad.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that many secondary teachers and people who <Col N="345" /> had a vested interest in the secondary schools ensured that other schools would not be allowed to present students for these examinations.  I am glad that these obstacles have been removed and that the vocational schools have been put on a par with the secondary schools.  It was high time that happened.  Not alone were students prevented from undergoing these examinations but they seemed to have been put into a kind of ghetto and the vocational schools were looked upon as inferior institutions in comparison with the secondary schools where they wore uniforms and where most of the rich people sent their children.</P>
    <P>Any country should lean over backwards to ensure that people, irrespective of their means, get a good fundamental education and have equal facilities to reach the top.  Brains and ability to learn are not all born into the rich families.  Many of the poor and destitute, through no fault of their own, were denied the worthwhile facilities that would have enabled them to live full lives and be of better service to the nation.  In the case of those who were lucky enough to secure secondary education, I think too much stress was laid on academic subjects and not enough on subjects pertaining to technology and subjects which would be of interest to developing countries such as ours where industries needing skilled workers, were beginning to spring up.</P>
    <P>That too is changing.  There should be some way whereby people who left the national school and were unable to go to post-primary school could improve their education so that they would not feel inferior to their neighbours.  Irish people in the past, whether rich or poor, but particularly the poor, placed tremendous value on education.  I know many who would forego their dinner provided they were able to discuss or quote at length from various published books and be on a par with others.  They derive tremendous personal satisfaction from this.  There is great satisfaction in being able to read and write.  It would be wrong if we did not ensure that all our citizens would have equal opportunities and a fair <Col N="346" /> chance of availing and acquainting themselves with these areas of knowledge.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to third level education.  It is something that I, as a national school teacher, have never had the opportunity of experiencing although, I think I got eight or ten honours which enabled me to get into the training college.  Because of some type of an archaic system in this country it was considered that I was not fit to take my place in the university.  I have disputed that all my life.  I felt that, as one who was born on the mountainside, as one who had eked out for himself, through his own initiative to the best of his ability, a place in the educational world, it was very wrong, real discrimination, that I, as a national teacher who had secured honours in every subject to get into the training college, would not be allowed to come out of that college with a university degree. Down the years, when comparisons were made it was found that when people who had the MA, BA, or other degrees from the universities did this competitive examination for entrance to a training college, the highest place any of them reached was 35th.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous change now when people with four honours can go to university.  In those days, everyone of us would have been at university, we would have been the first batch of students there; but because of some archaic British system under which the university was run, this state of affairs obtained all down the line.  Even yet, as far as I know, national teachers cannot receive a university degree when leaving the training colleges.  I am glad to note that the Minister has been moving on that line recently and I compliment him on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator allow me to tell him that the matter has now progressed to a point which is very satisfactory?  We would hope that those going into the training colleges next September will emerge with university degrees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly welcome that.  I have been campaigning for it <Col N="347" /> all my life.  I should like to dwell on this point a little and say that, if that had not happened, we would eventually end up in a few years having as teachers in our national schools, those who, because they did not get four honours, did not go to university. I think that would be very wrong.  We must ensure that we have the best teachers in our national schools, those with the highest possible qualifications, because they are the foundation stone of the whole educational system. The discrimination that existed between national teachers and other students in the third level sphere of education was deplorable.  I am glad to see that it has been rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to universities in general.  I admit that I have not very much knowledge of them.  They seem to be remote so far as we in the north-west of the country are concerned. One does not have to be too observant to notice that there is no branch of the National University, to which we contribute as taxpayers in Counties Cavan, Fermanagh and Leitrim, operating there.  The same applies to the Six Counties.  Such places as Tyrone or Derry have not university education either.  It seems we are classified as the underdogs in education and that we are only in the Stone Age so far as advancement is concerned.  We in Cavan County Council and Cavan Vocational Education Committee on a few occasions made representations to universities to come down to the town of Cavan. It is not a very big place, but it is a very important place to us because it is the capital of the county.  We would like to have seen the university authorities, to whom we contribute, recognising us in some way.  I admit that all the paraphernalia of degree conferring might not be available. There may not be sufficient transport to take the lot down to County Cavan. However, I feel that parts of degree courses, such as the H.Dip in Ed. course and others, could have been brought within the reach of the people of Counties Cavan, Donegal, Sligo, Fermanagh, Leitrim or any other county in that area.  We wrote to the <Col N="348" /> heads of all the universities.  The only people who had the decency to reply were those in Trinity College.  I thank them very sincerely for doing so.  We felt we had a case to make and we made a fair case.  We would have liked to have received some recognition. We do not want to be overcritical about this.  I should like the Minister for Education to tell us who is responsible for ensuring that there is no university in the north-western part of the country and yet the people of Limerick could clamour and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but there are adults who go to universities.  I was not considered adult enough to be allowed enter a university although I got eight or ten honours.  Perhaps this segregation still exists.  I am not taking issue with the Chair but, with respect, I feel that the facilities provided for university education here should extend to adult education.  However if the Chair insists that I cannot refer to universities I will abide by her ruling.  Would the Minister tell me who is responsible for this state of affairs?  Why has it been allowed to exist for so long?  Is there any way it can be remedied? Why were the people in Limerick, who are only 50 miles from the city of Cork and have one of the best roads in Ireland, allowed to make a case for a university while we in the whole north-western end of the country have no universities facilities nearer than Coleraine or Belfast?  That point should be made.  We are not denying Limerick or any other large town the right to seek such education, but we feel we have a legitimate right to know why it is that those of us who are not financially able to travel long journeys to universities are not facilitated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same case is pertinent so far as the Colleges of Technology in Sligo and Dundalk are concerned.  There is <Col N="349" /> no provision for such a college in County Cavan.  They are important institutions.  They provide the technicians needed in our industries.  It was shown that 127 people from Louth attended the Dundalk college last year but there were only five from County Cavan.  There were similar figures in Sligo&mdash;about seven people from County Cavan and approximately 150 from Sligo attended the Sligo college of technology.  This resulted from the fact that the building is situated within easy reach of those people.  These anomalies in our adult education scheme should be remedied.</P>
    <P>Much greater use could be made of Radio Telefís Éireann for adult education. Many of the old canned programmes imported in great quantities from America and England could be dropped.  Surely it would be within the competence of those in charge of education and those who teach, from those in the national schools right up to the universities, to devise interesting educational radio and television programmes on our history, geography and way of life?  Booklets could be published to help people to follow these courses.</P>
    <P>Now that we have entered the EEC there is a crying need for a greater awareness of the fact that we are within a couple of hours flying time of France, Belgium, Germany and other European countries.  This was not the case in days gone by when our adult population went to England, Scotland or America in search of employment. The situation today is vastly different.  Many people now travel to the Continent.  We must wake up and make a greater effort to ensure that our people will become more conscious of the necessity to know continental languages.  To be proficient in any language one must have the ability to convey one's thoughts to another person.  It is fundamental that we have a good basis in the English and Irish languages.  Those two languages are taught very well indeed in our national schools, as the Minister is well aware.  The standard is very high and our children compare very well with children in England or France.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa fáilte a chur roimh an tuarascál seo chomh maith.  This report on adult education will prove invaluable as a basis for discussion of the needs and structures of adult education in the future.  There is one criticism I should like to make about the format of the document.  I hate criticising a document of such importance but it is very repetitive in its outline and, as is inevitable in all types of educational documents, there is a great deal of jargon.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding all this, the document should play a big part in the future development of adult education. Up to now we have been wallowing in uncertainty, not knowing where we were going.  We treated adult education in a very piecemeal fashion.  Any success that has been achieved was achieved through ignorance. The normal process is that there is experimentation first and from experimentation there is progress. One must realise that in matters of education one is dealing with human beings.  Experimentation cannot be carried on indefinitely.  A halt must be called at some stage.  We are not dealing with inanimate objects. We should decide on a definite policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report by the NIEC says that the educational system is a mechanism by which one generation transmits to the next the basic elements of the ever-increasing fund of human knowledge. <Col N="351" /> When one considers that, one must realise that the system must embrace all aspects of education, and all people engaged in education.  No report on education can be final or definitive.  By its very nature education is an on-going thing and for that reason there must be a certain amount of experimentation.  However, as I said, experimentation must not go on indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Adult education is defined in the first chapter of the report as follows:</P>
    <P>The provision and utilisation of facilities whereby those who are no longer participants in the full-time school system may learn whatever they need to learn at any period of their lives.</P>
    <P>That definition could hardly be wider. The report then goes on to examine the concept of adult education from a wide variety of standpoints.  The key word in the definition, to my mind, is the word &ldquo;need&rdquo;.  There are individuals who feel the need for further education.  There are also the so-called enlightened individuals who feel that there is a need for mass adult education.  The irony here is that the people who need it most think they do not need it at all.  There is then a rather strange situation: those who need adult education are indifferent to education in general.</P>
    <P>The role, as set out by the report, for a system of adult education is very ambitious.  Because of being so ambitious, it proposes a radical change in many aspects of education.  If it is to be successful it also presupposes a certain radical change in public attitudes to adult education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the suspension of Business I was about to refer to a very important feature of the analysis of the Report on Adult Education. It is the idea of life-long education as opposed to packing education into a comparatively short period of one's life, specifically the formal schooling years.  We have accepted for generations this idea of formal schooling and then terminating education.  It <Col N="352" /> has never been seriously questioned. It is time to question the wisdom of such a policy now.  This was referred to as far back as 1918 in the Fisher Act in England and in 1947 in the INTO plan for education.  I quote:</P>
      <P>For there are some subjects which cannot be studied properly or with full profit until the student has had some experience of life and until the mental powers are fully developed. This is true, for instance, of the finer and nobler aspects of history, literature, art, economics and politics which are beyond the grasp of young people in their teens and which appeal to the adult in a way in which they can never appeal to the adolescent.</P>
      <P>The adult, unlike the adolescent, has had experience of life and knows something of its problems and complexities.</P>
      <P>This is not a new idea but it is an idea to which we should give some serious consideration.  Indeed the most radical feature of the report would be the social consequences of the acceptance of the idea of permanent education.</P>
      <P>The section of the report dealing with resources points out, and I think rightly so, that the physical resources at our disposal have not been used to the fullest extent that they might have been in the past, but the main resource to anybody interested in this subject is the person himself or herself. The involvement of a person in adult education is two-fold.  The person is there as a learner and as an educator in his own right.  He encourages and entices people to participate in the system if he himself takes the trouble to participate in it. The other main aspect of this idea would be the lack of trained personnel in this field from which we suffer at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great need for guidance. There is a need for an overall structure which would take in the existing structure.  Up to now we have, I would say, three main agencies concerned with adult education&mdash;the universities, in the form of university education and in the form of extra-mural courses; the vocational education <Col N="353" /> committees all over the country; and, in particular, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries through their agricultural committees.  I should here like to voice a certain criticism of the involvement of the universities in the past.  They have not played their part to the full in providing for the hinterland in which they are situated the service which they could give the people.  As Senator Dolan has already said, the university up to now has been the realm of the rich and the poorer man's child did not enter its doors.  This has been regrettable. Senator Dolan mentioned national teachers.  They in the past because of some archaic law failed to gain the status of a graduate on the termination of their national teacher training course.  This now has been rectified&mdash;not, I am sad to say, by a national teacher, who when he was Minister felt that this was not possible, but by a secondary teacher.</P>
    <P>The community schools' idea would be a great help in the structure of adult education.  However, I feel that the difficulty of having them established and the fact that there would be too few when they are established would mean that they would not cater for the full needs in this area.  The recommendation concerned with the feasibility of the &ldquo;Open University&rdquo; is a good one and it should be given some serious thought.</P>
    <P>Chapter 3 is the main part of the report and sets out the terms of reference, namely, to report on the needs of the community in the matter of adult education.  There is an admission that there is a need but there is also an admission that there is a reluctance on the part of many people to express that need.  This brings us to one major difficulty.  This is the idea of motivation.  What motivates a person to seek further education in adult life?  What motivates a tired housewife to go to a night school or a tired husband, having spent his day on the farm, or in the office, to take up a book or to go to a class in furtherance of his education?</P>
    <P>A more serious problem would be the problem created by those people who are termed functional illiterates. <Col N="354" /> These are people who have failed to make the grade in the formal system. Consequently they have now reached the stage where no inducement in the world will entice them into a system where they have already failed.  This is something which must be faced squarely.  Some way to get around it must be found.  I am afraid that the Report on Adult Education is of very little assistance to us here.  It has pinpointed the problem but it has failed to give any solution.</P>
    <P>The problem will become more serious with the advance of technology. Affluence, a higher standard of living and shorter working periods will all tend to give the individual greater leisure time.  The idea of leisure time brings with it the problem of how that leisure time is to be spent.  Unless this country, and indeed, western Europe, faces the fact that we must structure a system of education whereby people in the future&mdash;and not in the too distant future either&mdash;can spend their leisure time in a worthwhile way, society will suffer as a result of our indifference to this problem.</P>
    <P>The mental process is an evolving thing.  It must keep pace with our own standards of living, and with developments in the environment and technology.  In-service training&mdash;which is an in-thing at the moment, if Senators will excuse the pun&mdash;goes some way towards solving the problem. We all know that the professions in general are now demanding that in-service training should be done in their working time.  That still leaves the problem of leisure time and how to spend it.  I am all in favour of professions demanding that in-service training should be taken up during their working hours.  This to me is part of their work.  It makes them more efficient.  Any money spent on in-service training is money well spent. To expect any person to take his work home with him is to expect a certain amount of idealism and enthusiasm. Some people have it, others have not.  In general the demand exists for in-service training during working hours.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of this <Col N="355" /> report is the fact that it aims at an integrated system of education.  Indeed the committee have gone outside their terms of reference in this because they found themselves in a position where they had to recommend a system that included pre-primary, primary, post-primary and third-level education.  This brought them outside their terms of reference but they could not have suggested an integrated system without doing that. The recommendation that a separate section within the Department should be set up to cater for adult education is a very worthwhile idea.  In addition the idea that a co-ordinating committee should be established to bring together all the agencies involved in this field is also a very worthwhile one.</P>
    <P>The report also recommends a radical structural change in our existing set-up.  It mentions county educational committees, regional committees and so on.  We are aware of the difficulties involved.  Changes in the managerial system and in the vocational education system are being proposed. There is a reluctance on the part of some people to accept these changes, so there may be difficulty in having those recommendations brought to fruition.</P>

      <P>The recommendations are worthwhile.  There is a price tag on all this.  On page 135 of the report it states that the gross cost of the recommendations is £6,635,000 while the net cost of the recommendations for 1972-73 in actual expenditure was £4,179,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations as a whole cannot be implemented.  It would be foolish for any Minister, even if he could obtain the money, to try to implement those recommendations <i>in toto.</i>  Education is an evolving matter.  We must proceed slowly.  The only recommendation I wish to make is that any steps which might be taken <Col N="356" /> as a result of this report should be in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with everything stated by Senator O'Toole with the exception of his last remarks when he said that the expenditure of approximately £5 million in this direction would be inordinate.  Much more should be expended.  The first point I wish to make is that if a programme of adult education is undertaken it should be a genuine programme in response to a genuinely perceived need.  It should be radical, honest and effective.  It should be wide-ranging and have long-term vision behind it. One of the worthwhile things which has come to me out of the EEC is a report they have published called <i>Permanent Education</i> in its English translation, subtitled &ldquo;Fundamentals of an Integrated Educational Policy&rdquo;. It was published by the Council of Europe at Strasbourg in October, 1971.  This is not only one of the best things they have produced, but it is in its condensed form one of the finest documents on education I have come across.  It contains a philosophy of permanent education which at times seems to surface in this Report on Adult Education, but which, by and large, does not seem to have been properly grasped by those who framed the report.</P>
      <P>It is easy to criticise those who have worked hard on this report.  That is not my purpose.  I do not wish to engage in a critique of that report as such, though I intend everything I say as relevant to it.  I might take as my point of departure the remarks made by Senators O'Toole and Dolan in the animadversions they have cast on the university role in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am competent to speak on this in the sense I have for the past eight years organised extra-mural courses in University College, Dublin, which has the most extensive extra-mural programme of any university in these islands.  I know its limitations and its achievements.  The limitation relevant to this is the fact that anybody who comes to that course is not, strictly speaking, a subject for adult education or for what the Council of Europe calls &ldquo;permanent education&rdquo;. <Col N="357" /> The people who attend these courses already can assess their needs.  They know what they want, whether it be a course in literature, old silver, antiques, or animal psychology.  They recognise the need and can follow it through.</P>
    <P>That is not what adult education is about or what permanent education is about.  I should like to suggest that the universities, as they are at present, are no more geared to deal with this radical concept of adult education than any other educational agency in this country.  Adult education involves a kind of teaching which few people here can give at present.  There are some establishments, such as the Mater Dei Institute, which has a good deal of experience.  There is the Institute of Adult Education in Dublin.  It must be recognised that the education of an adult is a radically different affair from the education of a child. The basic principle which separates the two methods of education is that when educating a young person he is already accepting a structure of authority and a structure of information and knowledge handed down.  It is easy enough to get him to assent to and acquiesce in that process.</P>
    <P>The education of an adult is totally different.  It has to be a shared experience. To this end the co-operation of the person being educated must be secured at every stage.  One of the worst aspects of the few probes we have made into this field has been the giving of diplomas or the setting of examinations at the end.  It is recognised in this document that that is the wrong approach to adult education. What has to be achieved in terms of adult education is a coming together of the teacher and the student so that assessment, ultimately, becomes a joint consideration, where the two views gradually coalesce and where the person being educated can perceive his lacks, can assess himself, see the teacher's assessment, see the gap between them and then work towards the closing of that gap.  This is a radically different concept from the kind of piecemeal adult education sorties we have been making in recent years.  I have been disappointed during <Col N="358" /> this debate by the fact that so few people have grappled with this primary concern.</P>
    <P>There is no hope of doing more than touching the tip of the iceberg in the few minutes at my disposal. There are two aspects to it.  There is the aspect of functional illiteracy, which was referred to by Senator Horgan.  He spoke about the confusion and humiliation of an itinerant woman in a shopping centre who cannot distinguish between baby foods because she cannot read.  There is the humiliation of a working-class mother who cannot fill out a form.  That is a remedial situation.  That points to a defect in the existing system, not a defect on the part of the teachers. One is not reflecting on them.  It is a reflection on the system.  That calls for one kind of adult education, that is, a distress situation or a remedial situation&mdash;a situation where one has to teach people the basic tools of living, like literacy on the one hand, and numeracy on the other.</P>
    <P>This should not be underrated.  It is of extreme importance.  It will involve an extraordinary amount of tact in finding out the people who can benefit and, having discovered them, getting them to come forward.  There is also the problem of finding remedial teachers adequate to teach them.  This is a distress area.  It is an area which has to be adverted to, but it is not adult education.  That is stopping the gaps where education has to that extent failed.</P>
    <P>I am not a great fan of the EEC but I have to recognise that this report is one of the most humane and profound documents I know of.  The European concept of adult education would be that the person, not just from his school age but from his preschool age, should be given a notion of education as a permanent on-going activity.  It would mean, if children have a working mother, that somebody would come in and look after them so that they would not be deprived, even at that early stage, in their education.  It would mean that when the child went to school he would get that kind of education; and even if he leaves school after his <Col N="359" /> primary certificate, that he would already be prepared to come back into the system from his trade constantly to be re-educated.</P>
    <P>It recognises that within our society, which is highly technological and which involves the alienation of the individual from society, a boy can be apprenticed at the age of 12&mdash; a monstrous thing, far too early specialisation&mdash;and that at the age of 12 he might become highly skilled as a joiner or some kind of craftsman. It would be possible for him, side by side with that task, to constantly come back into the educational system to be educated in areas like drama, painting, poetry, all the inspirational activities to which this report pays very scant attention, in other words, the enrichment of his mind and of his imagination.</P>
    <P>The notion of permanent education here involves from the very moment that a child goes to school that his whole life has open to it an access to education, a constant sortie and return.  That is a radical concept, and if we are to talk about adult education we will have to think in these terms.  We have to think in terms of large price tags.  In other words, there seem to be two things involved in this report.  The distinction I subscribe to is that, on the one hand, there is training and that is what teaches a man his trade, his vocation, and teaches him to earn his living.  There is the other thing which is called education, which has very little to do with that.  This report, strangely enough, goes back to Newman's old idea of a liberal education and makes the point that, if you can educate a man widely at the beginning, you can train him to do anything afterwards, and that you have the wrong end of the stick if you decide to put him in for specialisation at a very early stage.</P>
    <P>In our context a number of distinctions, recommendations and recognitions might be made.  Within the whole area of our lives, we have at the moment an enormous pool of expertise already there which is not properly channelled.  For instance, <Col N="360" /> we have&mdash;I give this only as an instance&mdash;probably the most thriving amateur dramatic movement in Western Europe.  Every town in Ireland have got this.  What is happening there is that people are doing a job, and the job itself is not primarily fulfilling, so they go out and produce a play.  They get together, they work, they achieve all this kind of companionship which is so hard to achieve in the modern world.  One of the points this report makes is that we are people who are put coldly at the centre of things.  We watch television. We imagine we know everything. People talk to us; but nobody listens to us.  That is the condition of western man in our time.  This report is profoundly relevant in a humanistic way to that.  Where do we find people to listen to us?</P>
    <P>We heard a lot of talk about the fact that people go to public houses now and that too many people are drinking.  I suspect that one of the motivations behind that is that they go out from the television sets and they want to meet somebody.  They want to involve themselves in the community.  Adult education is concerned with that and, to return to this question of the amateur dramatic movement, I would see as one function of this&mdash;and I propose it very strongly to the Minister and I am sure will at least be sympathetic towards it and he may even be convinced&mdash;that it would be a marvellous thing if our National Theatre, for instance, made it possible for all these enthusiastic men around the country engaged in drama to come to the Abbey Theatre, an expanded area, and go back with increased skills, not just in how to produce a play, but in the whole theory of drama and dramaturgy and the whole history of drama.  That is just one area.  I give it as an example.  The National Museum, the National Gallery, the National Library&mdash;all of these could also function within that kind of area.</P>
    <P>In other words what is needed is a large over-arching system which will ensure for the individual the minute he goes to school that, even when he leaves school, the possibilities of <Col N="361" /> assessing his own needs are there; that guidance with regard to his own needs is there; that a means by which he can lay a hold on his own destiny, becomes a master of himself as an individual, are there.  That is, in fact, what adult education is about.  I would argue further that that brilliant report, the Lynch Report some years ago, about investment in education is an extremely impressive report but it suffers from one serious flaw in the sense that the very phrase itself &ldquo;investment in education&rdquo; suggests that education is concerned with the marshalling of the individual towards the needs of society.  I would argue that adult education is not concerned with that.  It is concerned with the individual himself.  I am not even sure that the needs of the individual, and the present needs of society, are always reconcilable; but I am convinced that if you have richly cultured and alert individuals within society, society itself may become more turbulent but it will become infinitely enriched.</P>
    <P>Therefore I should like to say one or two things of a practical nature. First of all there is a great deal of research available on this, and this research does not appear in the report.  There is no bibliography in this report.  About ten pages are devoted to various county councils that were consulted but there is no bibliography, and that is a very big defect in the report.  In fact, this one document on permanent education, and the whole body of research that has gone into that in Europe, I suggest to the Minister, should be canvassed, sifted and brought into collaboration with the report before him, a report which has many virtues but which also has many lacks.</P>
    <P>As a practical consideration, I would put forward, too, that at this moment there is redundancy in the secondary school area with regard to the employment of teachers.  Our higher diploma in education is totally geared towards the production of people who can teach students in the secondary schools.  Would it not be an idea if we could get the right kind of personnel who would offer instead of that, as an option or as an extra, a diploma in adult education, so that <Col N="362" /> the kind of person who goes to teach adults knows what the job is about.</P>
    <P>Even in Dublin as it stands at the moment and, I am sure, in the Senator Higgins's city and Senator Quinlan's city most of this work is being done by tired secondary or vocational teachers.  Having done their job they go to teach adults in the evening, a job for which they have no training. I should like the Minister to put his hand on his heart and say how many trained teachers of adults have we in this country at the moment.  If we have not got them, we have to find them quickly.  There is no use in producing a kind of window-dressing response to this report or to the unexpressed demand underneath this report. One has to go radically about this matter and see that this is a need within our society that has to be met and, if we are not going to meet it now, let us not pretend that we are meeting it by any kind of window-dressing exercise.</P>
    <P>That is one suggestion: the suggestion of the higher diploma level and the whole question of teachers for adult education.  Added to that, I would suggest that it would be marvellously effective to look around in society for people who, in their particular jobs at the moment, have an overwhelming desire to come and engage themselves in adult education. These may not be people with even university entrance requirements but I think some means should be open to them if they feel that as a vocation. Many of the people who produce plays and who run dramatic societies all over the country are responding to a charismatic urge to do this sort of thing, and the universities should be asked to respond to this.  Mechanisms should be devised by which they would get through qualifying examinations in order to enter into this.  This is another aspect of it.  The notion of adult education being carried out by sort of moonlighting university teachers, or secondary teachers, or vocational teachers, is totally alien to the whole concept behind this report to which I refer in such flattering and at this stage, rather monotonously regular terms.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make is <Col N="363" /> that, if you want to find a place where there is a fund of goodwill in this area, I would think of the secondary religious schools.  I do not want to knock any other institutions but secondary religious teachers and various orders deserve far better from us than we have ever acknowledged. Many of us would not be here if it were not for their sacrifices.  Why I mention them is because those schools are there and functioning 24 hours a day for the students.  They are inhabited all day.  Unlike other schools, you can see the headmaster or headmistress there in the middle of summer, late at night, any time you wish, the kind of thing you very rarely get in lay schools where the lock is turned on the door at a certain stage and understandably so.  I would suggest that there is an area of goodwill there and also an area where there is a certain ongoing involvement in this kind of adult education.  The Minister has asked these schools to come forward and to make propositions, and he has suggested that funds will be available.  That is an offer that has yet to be tested.  I am sure it is offered in the very best of faith and that it will be honoured.  It seems to me that, if we have to make small beginnings, there would be one of the areas where we might undertake experimentation.</P>
    <P>This report is, within its limitations, a good report.  I find it rather repetitative. I regret the lack of a bibliography. I regret the lack of a proper and firm definition of what adult education is.  I regret the fact that it does not echo the findings of the European equivalence, particularly in this document on permanent education. It certainly is a good starting point.  I would urge the Minister very strongly to look deeply into this and because he is a humane, cultured and sincere man, I would like him to call upon more research and ensure that, when he undertakes a programme of adult education, it will involve what adult education really is, a means of constantly rehumanising man, constantly making education relevant to a situation, constantly developing a <Col N="364" /> situation where the educational process continues from the moment of birth until the moment of death.  That is what permanent education is.</P>
    <P>If we are embarking on that, let us embark on it honestly and strenuously. If we are talking about expenditure and price tags, this has to do with people.  It has to do with humanity.  It has to do with an era in our civilisation when people are subject to extraordinary alienation and loneliness and humiliation because of the rigidity of social structures and, indeed, educational structures. It seems to me to be one of the most profound needs in modern society and it seems to be a need which Ireland, alone probably among the countries of Europe, is in a position to meet, because we are small, we have not an enormous population, nobody is too remote, the structures are already there in voluntary organisations and we still have a good, strong residual Christian humanism upon which we can build a programme of this kind.</P>

      <P>I am grateful that the Minister will comment on this motion after I have spoken.  I am also very grateful to Senators who have spoken on this motion which appeared in my name and that of Senator Horgan.  I should like to assure the House, in view of a point raised when this motion was first taken, that Senator Horgan had my permission to move the motion.  Indeed, more than that, I very strongly urged that the motion be taken as early as possible.  I am very glad that the motion has been debated for a number of reasons.  We have six very fine contributions from Senators Horgan, Robinson, Brosnahan, Dolan, O'Toole and Martin.  The Minister, even though he has a busy schedule, has decided to be present.  He is extremely welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Murphy Report on Adult Education in Ireland is extremely important for a number of reasons. Not alone does it relate to adult education but some of the issues it raises are general to education.  For example, at the outset the report runs into difficulty in defining adult <Col N="365" /> education itself.  It devotes one chapter to the question: What is adult education? Here the issue is extremely clear.  Should education be defined in a utilitarian sense, or should it be defined in a critical sense?  To put it more bluntly, should the purpose of education be a utilitarian one to make individuals useful in society, or should the whole educational endeavour be geared towards developing within the individual sufficient ability critically to relate himself to the forces and constraints on his living and his development in society?  That is the first reason why the report is important. It raises these issues, which as I say, are not specific to adult education but need to be faced in any evaluation of our educational policy at present.</P>
    <P>The report is important in another respect, a rather minor one.  In adult education we have had a number of different agencies operating on several different assumptions and premises. It is necessary to evaluate what they were all at, and to find out if we want to have a policy on adult education.  There are other reasons why I put down this motion, and why I am glad it is being debated.  There is the issue, for example, of the extent of poverty in our society and the role which adult education may play in breaking the extension of the vicious recycling of poverty attitudes in our society.  This is adverted to in the report on pages 123 and 124.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a point so that the House will know why I put down this motion.  I participated in adult education endeavours as a teacher in six counties.  In Sligo, Kilrush, Ennis, Shannon, Claremorris, Ballina, Ballinamore, Carrick-on-Shannon, Roscommon, Strokestown, Galway and Carraroe, they had two-year courses run by University College, Galway, and in which the university participated and in which I myself participated.  I am also a member of the board of extra-mural studies of University College, Galway, and an examiner for these courses.</P>
    <P>To come back to my first point about the necessity of defining what we are at in adult education, my own <Col N="366" /> reaction when participating in adult education is that any paternalistic approach to education is absolutely hopeless.  Where we have succeeded best, that is where people have come back to us and said that the courses have meant something to them in their lives, has been where we have structured the courses according to the second criterion I suggested, that is, of having a critical approach to education, so that a man may be freed from the constraints of his environment, may be able to debunk the dominant mythologies which surround him, may be able to defeat the bureaucracy which gets more complex every day.  Therefore, when I am speaking about adult education, and the motivation which urged me to put forward this motion, I am speaking about education in this critical sense.  I am not speaking, with respect to one of the speakers, about courses which are simply taken out of the universities in minute areas and brought travelling around the country.</P>
    <P>As I said, six Senators have spoken on this report.  I should like to refer to their speeches and it is my pleasure to do so.  The report has been commented on three times at least, to my knowledge, in <i>The Education Times.</i>  The first was on 14th February in an article by Nigel Melville.  Here, in fact, the report was praised.  In that article it was compared with the equivalent report in Britain, the report by Sir Lionel Russell.  Here again, while the report was welcomed as being idealistic and ambitious, it was said that it was not as dull as the Russell Report in the brevity of its recommendations but Melville, in commenting on the report, adverted to the point I made earlier about the paternalism of the report. For example he says here:</P>
    <P>More than that one wonders who will decide what sort of service will be provided.  There are notes of paternalism here and there.  Only once, and in a passing comment at that, is it suggested that the adult student has the insight or the right to shape his own education.</P>
    <P>Yet the same section of the report talks of local community leaders being identified, trained and supported without saying who is going <Col N="367" /> to do this for the local community and, at a later passage, it criticises an older generation of educational planners for not consulting students.  Yet it goes on to limit the students' role today to realising that a gap exists between their present standard of knowledge and skills and what is possible to them.</P>
    <P>What I am worried about in regard to the report is something similar to that.  I do not like the idea of adult education being conceived of, first of all, as a panacea which will rescue us in any sense from the modern industrial age.  It is not.  The Industrial Age requires its own solution.  The problem of the kind of society we have at present needs to be changed at a level quite different and separate from that of education.  It is true that the kind of society in any one time is sustained by the values which are prevalent in society and that these are communicated through the education system. Therefore, if we are to begin, let us realise first of all that anything we do will be limited in its effect, but if it is to have the maximum effect it will be to ensure that the greatest possible number of adults in our society will develop within themselves a critical reaction to what surrounds them.  This is important at present if people are to see the barbaric impact of terror and violence in their society, be it in violence of any kind.  I refer equally and even with greater emphasis to the violence of capital as to the violence of the gun.  We have a disgraceful society because we have ethics which sustain disgrace.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan listed particular questions on which he thought the Minister might like to comment.  He mentioned&mdash;I do not want to be repetitive as people can read the record&mdash;that the report was particularly valuable in highlighting the low rate of participation in education in Ireland.  Here Senator Horgan was quoting liberally from <i>Investment in Education</i> and the Scully Report.  He instanced functional illiteracy and gave the poignant case of a young itinerant woman who could not even read what <Col N="368" /> the packaging said on tins of baby food.  He mentioned also the weakness of the report and I agree with him on this.  He said that there was no scientific charting of the extent of functional illiteracy.  Once again to be consistent with my previous comment, I question this whole usage of the term functional illiteracy.  If we mean by functional illiteracy making working-class people useful by middle-class norms, I say you can have as much of your adult education as you like, but I do not want it.</P>
    <P>Functional illiteracy is a most dangerous and very badly specified and dangerously used piece of sociological jargon.  While I am at it, I might say that this is one of the most serious criticisms of the report.  It is a valuable report and makes many recommendations. Many Senators have referred to its valuable points, but they have also referred to its defects.  One of these is the tortuous language of the report.  The fact that the language is like that is not an accident.  The people who served on the committee did their job very well but they were, to some extent, unwilling to face up to certain basic facts in our society.  There is, for example, a reference in the report to Alvin Toffler and his very popular work <i>Future Shock.</i>  Indeed, it is suggested in the report that what we are suffering from is a state of shock. Individuals nowadays are no longer able to face the future.  Instead of capability being a criteria as in the past, now &ldquo;copability&rdquo; is the challenge.</P>
    <P>With respect, I want to suggest that Alvin Toffler's analysis of society was a very dangerous and tricky attempt to avoid facing up to the basic savage structural features of our society. What he is trying to do in his work, and what the report unfortunately follows, is an attempt to reduce sociological facts to psychological factors. In other words, if you bewilder people by systematically depriving them through structures which create inequality, you suddenly explain the inequality on the basis of their bewilderment. Toffler's work is psychological reductionism at its worst, and it is unfortunate that so much language <Col N="369" /> in the report should be derived from such dubious sociological sources.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson rightly made reference in her speech to the fact that we needed to expand the range of adult education services so that more women would participate in society.  Here I found a dangerous utilitarianism even in Senator Robinson's speech.  She wants women to be useful, to be continually useful all their lives.  Senator Brosnahan rightly pointed out some developments which were taking place of which he was aware at the level of the media, and Senator Dolan in a human fashion made a case for those who had been kept out of the mainstream of third level education.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole made a very interesting remark when he pointed out that the most radical aspect of the report is, in fact, in the consequences of it.  Let us be perfectly clear.  Let us suppose you did what I have suggested as the aim of adult education. Let us suppose that you, for example, created a situation in which thousands of adults who had not participated in the formal levels of education up to now, suddenly became critical in society.  What would happen?  Here again I am indebted to points in <i>The Educational Times</i> to which some of us contributed.  There it was pointed out that if you take on the role of community development, as the report suggests, and you have educated all these people, you cannot imagine that the community consists of one homogenous lump of people.</P>
    <P>There are conservative people in the community.  There are progressive people in the community.  There are people who question it.  You have thousands of critically aware people who may, in fact, question the society.  I think it is right that they should do this to this society which has provided them with their courses. This is why I feel adult education, to some extent, is an extremely important exercise.  It may be at this level of education, where adults have participated in this critical atmosphere, that it may fold back upon the other formal levels of education.  We may <Col N="370" /> see, for example, primary, secondary and third level education as coercive endeavours which tend to coerce expression and channel it rather than to stimulate its free expression.  It may be that, when we speak about radical change and education being used as an agent towards radical change, when we speak about the establishment of egalitarian ethics in our society, of creating a just society, that we really begin at two ends.  We begin by pointing out the barbarity of exploited ethics to the very young and we also expend our resources on adults so as critically to examine their particular situation and, by an interaction of the two, the education creates the basis for the new critical society which comes in the next generation.</P>
    <P>We have to be perfectly clear about this.  First you have to make up your mind, following what I have said, and following what has been said in the debate, and decide whether you want the pussyfooting kind of schemes which pushes towards the people any kind of entertainment masquerading as education, or whether you want to give them the genuine kind of education that I speak of.  If you do, you must be prepared to accept its consequences. Senator O'Toole rightly adverts to this.  We should do the latter and we should not spare the cost, or be afraid to face the consequences.</P>
    <P>There is a singular little omission in the report to which I particularly want to refer, the deprivation of people in the Gaeltacht areas.  For example, it has been pointed out that huge categories of the population have been deprived of education of any kind but the Gaeltacht areas have been particularly badly served.</P>
    <P>People have been very critical of universities.  I now wish to place on record my gratitude to Radio na Gaeltachta for providing a series of lectures two years ago.  These were provided by University College, Galway; people listened to them and heard a full and adequate series of lectures.  It was a good development but generally the Gaeltacht areas are badly served.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> Finally, I should like to refer to these moonlighting lecturers which were mentioned by Senator Martin. I agree with him that when you have finished your day's work you are hardly in your best fettle for another day's work.  Here the Minister will be able to help and this is one of the advantages of my speaking immediately before him.  Earlier, I said that full adult education courses lasting two years&mdash;social action diploma courses&mdash;had been held in Sligo, Clare, Mayo, Leitrim, Roscommon and Galway, on average, in two or three centres.  Every year that exercise took place because people came from the Social Science Research Centre and offered their services to go out at night after they had done their own research.  People within University College, Galway, offered their services.  In no year since we began this work four or five years ago did we know what budget we had. We established the courses with the assistance of the vocational education committees, the CDC committee, and the committee of development officers within the Department of Finance. We had minor contributions from our own university because it receives the lowest grants in terms of its needs. We, therefore, could not strain our internal resources, but in no year could we look forward and say: &ldquo;We can offer courses here, there and everywhere&rdquo;, because we never knew where the money was coming from. This nightmare of uncertainty as regards the funding of adult education courses needs to be cleared up.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Members of the Seanad and the Minister for the opportunity of debating this important subject.  I hope, now that we have made a beginning in debating the structures of adult education, we will go on to discuss our other educational motions.  It is a great tribute to the industry of Senators that they have waited so late in the evening to discuss this important and sensitive subject.</P>
    <P>I have welcomed the Minister here but I wish to congratulate the former Minister for Education, Senator Brian <Col N="372" /> Lenihan, for actually establishing the committee.  As Senator Robinson has already said, we would have benefited from hearing a speech by him on his reactions to the report now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the conclusion of my brief intervention earlier today, I said that I considered the present debate in Seanad Éireann to be particularly opportune because it enabled me, as Minister for Education, to have the views of Senators, particularly as they would have been given in advance of final decisions being made in relation to the drawing up of a future comprehensive programme in this area.</P>
      <P>Adult education obviously is not new in this country.  Many voluntary bodies and agencies have been engaged in it.  Appendix B to the interim report contains a directory of such organisations.  One of the recommendations of the final report is that Aontas should be given the task of publishing an annual directory of adult education services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are however additional considerations associated with the promotion of a greatly expanded programme of adult education in the context of changing circumstances and concepts, and a revised understanding of the place of education in community development.  Attention is drawn to these new features in many parts of the report and in the documents and studies being made available from various educational and cultural bodies and from the international governmental organisations. It is in the circumstances to which I have referred that the views of groups and associations with practical experience in the field or those who may have made a particular study of the requirements related to their own needs that these are of vital importance. There is no question of a Minister sitting at a desk and drawing up a blue-print for an adult education programme.  Formulation of such a programme would involve discussions with various interests: vocational education committees, school authorities, teachers, RTE, voluntary and statutory organisations, universities, <Col N="373" /><i>et cetera.</i>  It would also have to be worked out within the resources which can be provided on a graduated scale in accordance with the provisions of a scheme of programme budgets, and in the context of the facilities which are, or may be made, available, and of the demand for services.</P>
    <P>While I agree with the points made by many Senators, who mentioned large sums, we must be realistic in this matter, realising that the demand for expansion of the social services will, of necessity, given the limitation of the taxpayer's patience, mean that all we would wish in our wildest dreams to have for these purposes will not, unfortunately, be available.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Adult Education took as a launching pad in its investigation a definition of adult education as follows:</P>
    <P>The provision and utilisation of facilities, whereby those who are no longer participants in the fulltime school system, may learn whatever they need to learn at any period of their lives.</P>
    <P>In this definition no distinction is drawn between formal and informal education, and the emphasis is placed on the process of adult education as serving the needs of people in every sphere of human development.  It is also stated in the report that its primary concern was with education as it relates to those who had broken, for one reason or another with fulltime education.  Adult education should clearly be considered within the context of the aim of the policy of educational opportunity for all.  It may be conceded now, I think, that an undue optimism which prevailed during the 1960s as to the extent to which this could be achieved within the span of formal education has given way to a more sober estimate of the difficulties to be overcome. Sober estimates are always better, in my judgment.</P>
    <P>This further reflection on the inherent difficulties of the situation inevitably brings into focus the part which adult education must and should play in the process.  Fundamental <Col N="374" /> considerations in this regard are mentioned in chapters 2 and 3 of the report: Resources and Needs, and the recommendations made merit very careful consideration.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly with Senator Higgins, who concluded, that reference was made to many bright people, like Toffler and others, who have given us their view of society.  I am particularly taken by the pyramid structure here on page 60, based on A. H. Maslow's <i>Motivation and Personality</i>, New York, 1954, page 69, where the needs of society are based on a pyramid rising from physiological or survival needs, through safety needs, care and affection and belongingness needs to esteem needs and then the need for self-fulfilment. Then there is the statement that adult education, both formal and non-formal, can service each level in this hierarchy of needs.  I must confess that I am not too clear where this gets us.</P>
    <P>I would echo the opinion of Senator Higgins, that we should treat many of these outside observers and experts with a sober degree of the critical faculty with which we are advising our adult education dissidents to practice.</P>
    <P>The committee have rightly laid great stress on adult education as an integral part of the general education system within the concept of permanent or recurrent education.  In this regard, the recent Ministers for Education meeting under the auspices of the Council of Europe held in Berne last year, was interesting in that it chose as its subject for the next meeting in 1975 in Sweden the theme of permanent education.  I hope to return to this matter later.  It is stated that a system of permanent or life-long education enables the individual to avail himself of resources for learning and personal development recurrently, though not necessarily at consecutive periods throughout his lifetime.</P>
    <P>The report considers that the launching of the community schools concept offered additional possibilities for the full implementation of all that is meant by permanent education. I welcome this commendation <Col N="375" /> of the role of community school in this regard but I would not wish anyone to read into it the implication that only community schools should be considered as offering the necessary possibilities in this respect.  In this regard I take Senator Martin's point about the secondary schools run by religious orders as offering possibilities. I, too, consider that the traditional secondary schools should be brought more into the picture in this regard than in the past and that the part traditionally played by the secondary schools run by vocational authorities should be further encouraged and expanded.</P>
    <P>If in the past the voluntary secondary schools did not play the part in the general life of the whole community by way of provision of adult education classes and other activities which we may now sometimes feel they should have done, we might ask ourselves why this was so and whether the responsibility for any deficiency in this regard should be placed only at the door of the school authorities in question.  What financial aid was available to them to enable them to undertake such additional functions?  Were they approached officially and suggestions made to them as to how they might place their premises at the disposal of community groups for the purpose of community development programmes?  If local groups sometimes approach the authorities of the schools for facilities of any kind, were any offers made in relation to meeting the additional costs which would arise in respect of heating, maintenance, insurance and so on?</P>
    <P>These are aspects of any future development programme which need to be borne in mind in connection with the use of school premises for purposes not falling within the usual formal education programme.  In mentioning these schools I am not forgetting, too, the primary schools run by our parochial communities in every part of the country.  Already there is evidence in connection with applications being received for school building grants that the authorities of our voluntary secondary schools <Col N="376" /> are planning for adult education programmes as a feature of their future service to the community.</P>
    <P>Adult education can play a major role in bridging what is sometimes referred to as the generation gap between parents and children. Example is always a potent influence. The example of parents still participating in educational activities may exercise a great influence for good in young people.  Senator Martin made the point that the frequency with which people go to our public houses may be simply an expression of their desire to get in touch with other people and to act as a community.  I think he was right.  On the other hand if the parents were to go to education classes rather than going to the other establishments, would there be an influence on the children of that particular family?  If so, would it be different in kind and in result?</P>
    <P>I would emphasise however that courses for adults should be suitably structured for their circumstances and needs.  I agree with the point made in the course of the debate concerning the creative role which the student can play in adult education that he does not want a cultural handout and that he brings his own sensibilities, his own passions and his own politics to any system of adult education.</P>
    <P>This reference to the particular characteristic of the adult student brings me to another point.  In some instances parents may desire to have refresher courses of the formal education programme being pursued in school in order to enable them to understand and be of assistance to children with their homework.  I do not, however, agree with statistical calculations sometimes presented that a certain percentage of the population are in need of further courses in education, on the simplistic basis that they left school some 20 or so years ago without a particular parchment to indicate a certain level of academic attainment.  A great many of these people will subsequently, by way of their experience and development within the context of their work and opportunities, have passed and progressed intellectually far beyond <Col N="377" /> others with supposedly higher certified attainment standards.  The adult education courses to be provided should be suitable, flexible and acceptable. The success of any programme will be the measure of voluntary support for it.</P>
    <P>I am not enamoured of the term &ldquo;education for leisure&rdquo;.  Education and work properly understood are leisure.  Education is for life.  We take advantage of any opportunity available to us to find enjoyment and satisfaction through educational pursuits.  Education in this connection should cater for a wide range of diverse attitudes and future educational planning must take cognisance of such diversity.  I have in mind in this respect such basic structures as library and museum facilities, sport, community centres, village halls, local arts and crafts, music and drama, in the same way adult education provision must form part of all our plans for community development, youth and recreational programmes.</P>
    <P>This is not equivalent to saying that any activity which deserves public financial aid must somehow be brought within a definition of being educational or cultural.  To act in this fashion is merely to create confusion in relation to the use of the words and already the word &ldquo;cultural&rdquo;, in particular, has suffered too much in this respect. There will however almost always be a place for and the requirement of a suitable programme of adult education in connection with any worthwhile programme of community development. In general adult education should contribute to a useful employment of their time for both young and old.</P>
    <P>It may be that the emphasis which it was necessary in the past to place on basic education and fundamental economic needs may give way to a concern to help our young people in particular to find their place in a changing society.  We should seek to have our youth maturing into adulthood in an Ireland which will be technologically advanced while at the same time retaining a high sense of social values.</P>
    <P>I anticipate a growing need and demand for adult education in the <Col N="378" /> years ahead.  Apart from the requirements deriving from changing circumstances generally, and in particular the complexities resulting from technological advance, the demand will grow with the increasing percentage staying on to complete secondary education. The following extract from the report of the committee is relevant in this connection:</P>
    <P>The findings of the committee on the characteristics of those who participate in adult education activities in Ireland generally correspond with the results of research in other countries i.e. that the general characteristics of those who participate are:</P>
    <P>21-45 year age group;</P>
    <P>have at least two years of post-primary education;</P>
    <P>are members of upper socioeconomic groups.</P>
    <P>The following quotation from a report published by the Council of Europe <i>Today and Tomorrow in European Adult Education</i> makes the same point:</P>
    <P>Investigations into the slow growth of popular response to adult education have, over the past 15 years, brought out the fact that this response diminishes sharply among those who have had only the minimum of initial education prescribed by law and who are usually to be found among unskilled and semi-skilled workers in later life.</P>
    <P>It is further stated:</P>
    <P>Generally speaking the recent and continuing trends in adult education are largely concerned with increasing its outreach to a much wider and more responsive proportion of the people, with altering the financial basis and legal framework so that adult education is more centrally situated in national educational systems and has a prestige consistent with the important tasks that lie before it, with making a response to the multiplicity of emerging social and cultural needs, with alterations in the curriculum, particularly to include work which <Col N="379" /> corresponds with the economic needs of students, employers and governments.</P>
    <P>It is in the context of the growing need for an expansion of the programme for adult education that I should desire to refer to the suggestion made during this debate by Senator Horgan originally that adult education should be made totally free for whomsoever it is provided.  The recommendation is in such uncompromising terms that I feel that I should refer specifically to it even at this stage before final decisions have been made in relation to the lines on which the future programmes of adult education will be developed.</P>
    <P>The first observation which I should like to make is that a programme of adult education costs money and that the money has to come from somewhere.  There are expenses in connection with the provision of buildings, equipment, heat, light, maintenance, and so on and teachers have to be paid salaries in respect of their services.  The education is being provided for adults and it is the adult population which in one way or another must provide the financial resources.  I do not see anything wrong in principle in adults paying directly for a service provided for them whether that service is educational, cultural, commercial or something else, provided the charge is reasonable and the person is in a position to meet the charge.</P>
    <P>There are also reasons of a more immediate and practical nature why payment of fees as appropriate in the case of adult education courses may not be dispensed with and that to do so would inevitably result in a contraction and not an expansion of the programme.</P>
    <P>The sources of financial support for the existing programme of adult education&mdash;a reference was made to this by Senator O'Toole and others&mdash;are given at pages 57 to 59 and page 135 of the report of the committee.  They include students, participants and community members' fees.  The committee have also stated that the perception <Col N="380" /> and value of adult education as outlined in chapter 1 of the report necessitates financial resources far beyond the present provision.  In other words, we need to expand and not to contract the possible sources of revenue for future development.  I am of course in full agreement with any proposal that the fees charged should be such as will not hamper the development of suitable courses in adult education for all sections of the community.  In this regard however I include also those groups who can afford to pay the economic cost and for whom courses could not be provided on any other basis because of the limitation of total revenue available.</P>
    <P>What we need to do is to exercise our intelligence and ingenuity in finding additional sources of revenue from all sources to enable us to mount a programme of expansion characterised by its flexibility and adaptable to the varying circumstances and not to interfere with the process of growth by restricting the range of sources of financial support.  The local community should be very fully involved in the provision of the adult education service for the area.  It is the people themselves who know best the type of programme they need and who are in the best position to evaluate the service provided.  The flexibility required in the matter of the provision of services will be facilitated by an appropriate delegation of responsibility and by the promotion of co-operation between voluntary and statutory organisations. The programme brings together parents, teachers, school authorities and administrators in a spirit of enthusiasm and participation in a common endeavour.</P>
    <P>The committee's terms of reference included a request to indicate the type of permanent organisation to be set up in order to serve the needs of the community in the matter of adult education. It sets out its conclusions at chapter 4 of the report.  The committee however recommend <i>inter alia</i> regionalisation of the education system as a means of promoting a programme of adult education.</P>
    <P>Senators are aware that prior to the <Col N="381" /> presentation of the report to me in November, 1973, I had already initiated discussions in October, 1973, with representatives of the recognised educational associations on the proposal for regionalisation.  I am at present giving consideration to the views put before me by the representatives of the associations during the discussions which took place and I am also having the matter examined in the light of the observations made at the annual general meetings of the teachers and managerial associations. I am hopeful that following further discussions it may be found feasible to arrive at agreement on new structures which would be the most appropriate to the needs of future expansion of the educational system and which would enable the best provisions to be made for both formal and informal courses of education.  In this regard I note that Senator Horgan, in opening the debate, came down very strongly on the side of regions, rather than counties.  I quote from him as he is reported in the Official Report at column 114 of volume 78 of the 10th May. 1974, when he said:</P>
    <P>I know that county feeling is a very strong thing in this country and a very valuable thing in many respects but in terms of real decentralisation, in terms of creating regions which are big enough and important enough to stand up against central authority when necessary and to have the financial fire power to enable them to support creative and innovative experiments within their own areas we have to look beyond the county. We should really be thinking more in terms of regions or the counties tied in with them as much as possible. I feel that this heavy insistence on the county committees as the fundamental unit for educational administration is based on a misunderstanding of the whole principle of devolution and the whole principle of regionalisation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the matter of the size of the unit to which devolution of authority can be made from the Department of Education might engage the attention of Senators at some point in the near future so that I <Col N="382" /> might have opinions from them following on that given by Senator Horgan regarding the size of the unit which they might think would be the most suitable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am very grateful, indeed, to the Senators who have spoken here today and on the previous day for raising again for public discussion this matter of the adult education report.  It would be difficult to do justice to the input of each Senator who has spoken and if I refer to some points it is not by way of showing any less regard for the contributions of other Senators. However I would like to say that, when Senators Dolan and O'Toole referred to the desirability of having a university degree for our primary teachers, I was glad to be able to intervene to say that this has now been brought to the point where, all going well, the products of our three-year course starting in September will emerge with a university degree.  This is a matter which gives me personal satisfaction.  I am grateful to all those in various positions of authority who responded so readily to my suggestion made in Wexford in April, 1973, that this was the direction in which our policy should develop.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in Senator Martin's definition of adult education.  He drew a distinction between the formal education of the young, the acceptance of the structure of authority, and what he suggested was the different approach to adult education where the individual would be more appreciative of his own needs and would make with his own teachers a common assessment of his needs and of their fulfilment.  I agree in general terms with this, but I would see a gradual phasing of one into the other.</P>
    <P>One of the points made very strongly at the Conference of European Ministers last June was that the senior cycle from, say, 16 years to 19&mdash;16 to 18 in this country up to now&mdash;would be regarded as the first stage in recurrent or permanent education. This is the trend of the future. It was in this context that I recently suggested a year which might be regarded as the initiation of this first stage of adult education in my suggestion <Col N="383" /> of a certificate of general education.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to this briefly. I suggested that students at age, say, 15½ or 16½ years might be given a year between the completion of the intermediate certificate and the commencement of the senior cycle in which they might undertake personal development in the context of community service.  The subjects which might be included in this year would be religious knowledge&mdash;theoretically studied but also in the context of service to the community&mdash;and an introduction to logic and philosophy. In this connection I should like to suggest to Senators that one should not draw back in fear and dread at the terms &ldquo;logic&rdquo; and &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo;. Suitably structured programmes can be devised to be of benefit to pupils at that age.  There is one quality more than any other which I should like our students to develop and that is the development of the critical faculty, already referred to by Senator Higgins, as an antidote or corrective to the outpouring of propaganda which they will have to face in the future, not only from politicians but from commercial advertisers and all kinds of people.  I think it was Hemmingway who referred to an &ldquo;in-built crap detector&rdquo;.  If we can develop this critical faculty in our pupils, it will save them from many difficulties in future life and might even be a small measure of amelioration of the violent tendencies in our society.</P>
    <P>In this connection I have also suggested that we might have a subject called &ldquo;media criticism&rdquo;.  I was pleased to see yesterday at Westport that the Bishop of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise agreed that this was a desirable subject.  I have in mind here that pupils should be formally taught the problems, objectives and difficulties that beset those whose profession is the media, whether it be radio, television, or newspapers.  I have seen in the Communications Centre classes brought out there and subjected to the task of making a news programme.  It was enlightening to find that they had realised much <Col N="384" /> more clearly after that exercise the difficulties involved in the work of the media.</P>
    <P>I have also suggested that a subject called &ldquo;Appreciation of Art and Music&rdquo; might be included.  I suggest that those who have characterised these proposals as educationally unsound are themselves admitting in public that they do not understand what education is about.  I say this to all those who either rushed in at the beginning to make criticisms before they had seen the full text of my proposals, or those who still continue to suggest that our year for the certificate of general education is not educationally well-founded.  If we want to orient our pupils towards participation and continued education for the rest of their lives, what better way to do it than to start at this age with a flexible programme of personal development and community service which will orient them towards the community on the one hand, and enable them to discover their own persons, feel more clearly their needs and initiate them into adulthood in a year which will be, as I put it when speaking to the TUI, free from the academic and technical treadmill?  I intend to see, with the help of educational advisers, that in those schools &mdash;and some have already opted for this&mdash;who are willing to make what one headmaster called &ldquo;a move towards the most fundamental idea that has yet surfaced in this country in regard to education&rdquo; it will be introduced this year in selected schools on a pilot scheme basis so that perhaps its very success may entice others to follow.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Higgins's statement on adult education.  This particular input will also have a beneficial effect on the intermediate programme and the leaving certificate programme.</P>
    <P>A section of the report deals with needs.  I have already referred to the pyramid here.  Although reference is made to the place of Christianity in this country in regard to education, I should like to put it more strongly than that.  One of the greatest needs in modern society for our people is the Augustinian realisation that there <Col N="385" /> is a need for deep religious conviction and practice.  I see a place for that in any structure of adult education which we may evolve.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the various Senators who have spoken and to express the hope that in the not too distant future we may have the opportunity on a motion of a more general kind to pursue some of the thoughts I have expressed in response to this debate and that we will not regard my contribution here as the final word or as exhausting all the answers which might be given on this important question.  I am glad to have had the opportunity of speaking to the Seanad and would be delighted to come back at any time to pursue this matter further.</P>
    <P>May I again appeal that Senators might either make known to me, through debate or otherwise, what particular type of structure they suggest is most useful when we come to set up a formal structure for adult education?  First of all, is it to be devolved from the Department?  Is it to be a county or a region?  What number of schools?  What number of teachers?  What percentage of population should be involved in this?  I <Col N="386" /> should like to consult with the Seanad on these matters and to receive either private or public recommendations in this important field.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I say to those Senators whose particular points I have not answered that if they wish to raise them privately with me I will be delighted to express my views on any matter I have overlooked.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>In case we should appear to be establishing a precedent, we should regard the situation where the Minister concluded after the penultimate speaker as a tribute to the Minister and as evidence of the desire of the Seanad to hear him fully on this motion.  I think we will agree that it was well worth hearing him and I merely mention this because I would not like from the point of view of the House, that we should be regarded as creating a precedent which should necessarily be followed in the future.</P>
