      <P>It is proposed to take No. 1 only.  There was general agreement in the House last week that the Fourth and remaining Stages of the Bill be taken today.  I hope that will be achieved.  If business is not concluded by then it is proposed to break today from 5 o'clock to 6.30 to facilitate the Members, officers and others who may wish to go to the removal of the remains of Miss Behan.</P>

      <P>Again I rise concerning Motion No. 3 in the name of Senator Lenihan and myself.  This motion would give an opportunity to the Minister to explain the critical situation which exists, or to express thoughts on this critical situation regarding the farmers and the application of those directives.  I would ask the Leader of the House to assure me that this motion will be taken as a matter of urgency.  There are a number of people suffering on account of the situation that exists.</P>

      <P>Could the Leader of the House tell me when it will be possible to take Motion No. 19 in my name and in the name of a number of other Senators?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like if the Leader of the House would give us some information on when the motions referred to can be taken, Motions Nos. 19 and 3.  As far as today's proceedings are concerned, it is agreed that we continue with the Report and Final Stages and finish <Col N="1358" /> both this evening.  I appreciate that it is agreed also that we adjourn from 5 o'clock to 6.30 to allow for attendance at the removal of the late Miss Behan's remains.  I should like some indication about when these important motions are to be taken.  We have often given pious expression here to motions of importance.  Certainly the two that are mentioned are most important and are pertinent. It is indefensible to have motions lying here on the Order Paper until they become irrelevant.  This has often happened before.</P>
      <P>Certainly Motion No. 3 in regard to the EEC modernisation scheme in so far as the development of farming is concerned is all-important and very pertinent particularly to the western, north-western and south-western areas of the country.  Similarly, the discussion document on Local Government reorganisation is also very pertinent.  I would ask the Leader of the House to indicate what priority or preference he proposes to give to have a specific day allocated for what we, on this side of the House, regard as two very pertinent and relevant motions at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to say anything about Motion No. 19 at the moment because the Whip has not had an opportunity of making specific inquiries about it.</P>
      <P>As regards Motion No. 3, I think in fairness to the Minister it should be pointed out that he was standing by on at least two occasions to take the motion when it was ordered and it was not reached.  Ultimately on Holy Thursday Senator Killilea indicated that he was prepared to have it dropped from the Order of Business for that day, and consequently we did not go ahead with it.  The position is that the Minister, as Senators are aware, is away at the moment.  He seems to be doing extremely good work for the farming community here.  He has already indicated his wish to go ahead with this motion and, while I do not want it to be regarded as a definite commitment, because I will not know until the Minister is back to say so himself, we hope to be able to take the motion on Thursday of next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1359" /> I think Senators Killilea and Lenihan will agree that we have made every effort to have this motion brought for discussion to the Seanad.  The Senators, as they are perfectly entitled to do and I am not criticising them for it, did opt to continue discussion on a different topic on occasions when this motion might have been reached.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that urban councillors and urban council candidates of all parties are being selected at the moment and that many of them of all parties are wondering whether it is worthwhile at all standing for election in view of the document issued by the Minister for Local Government, I feel it would be satisfying for public representatives of all parties if an opportunity were given to the Minister to express his views on the subject.  In view of this urgency, would the Leader of the House&mdash;I appreciate that up to now the Minister has been busy&mdash;now that he will have less to do as far as this legislation is concerned try to arrange a date as soon as possible for this motion?</P>

      <P>I accept what the Leader of the House has said concerning next Thursday and I would appreciate it if this motion could be dealt with then.  I should like to clarify one point.  While I agree with him in his statement about next Thursday, I do not agree with him on the reasons why it must be next Thursday.  He was the person who created precedents here in this House by keeping us here until 1 o'clock on Holy Week.  I put it on the record of this House that I felt the staff of <Col N="1360" /> this House&mdash;and I gave my reasons&mdash; were entitled at least to have Holy Thursday or part of that day free from work.  They were denied this due to the ignorance of the Government in their handling of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I just say I accept that Senator's Killilea's reasons for deferring discussion of the motion were entirely proper, but I do regret the fact that he and his colleagues did not take advantage of the extra six hours afforded to them on the Wednesday and Thursday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What the Leader of the House is saying is that we should have asked the staff of the House to continue to work on Holy Thursday after working the previous night until 1 o'clock due to a ridiculous situation created by the Leader of the House, the Government and the Minister, who, I notice, is absent today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is understood. The purpose of this amendment is to copperfasten the point that we were making on the Committee Stage debate when we spoke about the inequity of the arrangement proposed in the Bill.  I went over this ground <Col N="1362" /> on Committee Stage and I think I proved fairly conclusively, in all logic and reason, that the rearrangements between Counties Galway and Clare should be in the form of a five-seat constituency in East Galway, a four-seat constituency in Clare and a three-seat constituency in West Galway.  If the Minister does decide, as apparently he and the Government have decided, to reduce the overall numbers in Clare and Galway by one, which is the net effect of what they have done, they have disenfranchised practically 20,000 people mainly in East Galway, and have reduced the overall representation from Counties Galway and Clare by one. That is the effect of the decision covering those two counties: to reduce the number of Deputies from 12 to 11.</P>
      <P>Our amendments on Committee Stage were designed to preserve the existing elected Members from Counties Clare and Galway by having five Members elected from East Galway, four Members elected from Clare and three Members elected from West Galway.  That means 12 as against the Minister's proposal of four from East Galway and West Galway and three from Clare, making a total of 11.  Due to the decision of the Seanad last Wednesday and Thursday our amendments in that respect were defeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recognition of that fact, we now come down to a basic point of principle. If it is the Government's decision to reduce representation in this part of rural Ireland by one&mdash;from 12 to 11&mdash;we must face up to it that it was decided by vote of this House and by vote of the other House.  What we refuse to face up to on Report Stage &mdash;even taking the Minister on his own arrangement and on his own principle and saying: &ldquo;You have to proceed in accordance with the decision of the Dáil and Seanad&rdquo;&mdash;is why there are not four seats in Clare and three seats in Galway when we have here in our amendments set out precisely how easily that can be done. While preserving the territorial county integrity of Clare, it practically justifies four seats and does justify four seats with the addition of the areas we <Col N="1363" /> have proposed in the rural district of Gort as set out in our amendment; Ardrahan, Cahermore, Castletaylor, Doorus, Killeenavara, Killinny, Kinvara, Skehanagh.</P>
    <P>I do not have to tell the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary, the officials behind him, the Press or anybody present that the areas I have just read out, which are set out in our amendment, are areas that have traditionally been adjusted to Clare. They are very much Clare-Galway constituencies.  In fact they are Clare-Galway townlands.  That part of County Galway is known as Clare-Galway traditionally&mdash;the part of Galway south of Galway city going towards the Clare border, the type of country that lies in Galway between Galway city and Ballyvaughan in Kinvara.  By including these townlands in the rural district Gort in with the county of Clare, we have a natural constituency of four seats in County Clare.</P>
    <P>This follows on from amendments Nos. 2 and 3.  It enables West Galway to be a three-seat constituency, which is its natural situation.  It means that, based on the city of Galway and on Connemara, there are two distinct sub-units within the unit of a three-seat constituency, roughly comprising in each case about half the constituency of West Galway.  In that there is a natural constituency of three seats, and we suggest in our amendment a natural constituency of four seats in Clare.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the merits and demerits in regard to East Galway because I went into those sufficiently on the previous occasion.  What I am going to deal with now is the monstrosity called West Galway now proposed in the Bill.  Anybody who looks at page eight of the Schedule to the Minister's Bill can see what I mean.  There is a four-seat constituency proposed for West Galway. Practically half of the townlands in it come from County Clare and geographically speaking go right down to the rural district of Ennis.  You have one-third of County Clare taken out and added to West Galway giving rise <Col N="1364" /> to a situation where the constituency practically runs from the capital town of County Clare, Ennis, from the rural districts of that town, through all of north-west Clare, to Ennistymon and Lisdoonvarna, into County Galway, around Galway Bay and over to Inishbofin beyond Clifden. That is the new four-seat constituency proposed.</P>
    <P>I want to have this debate conducted at a reasonable level.  I should like to have a logical case made for that division as against the division that we propose.  We have forgotten about the arguments in Committee Stage in regard to East Galway.  We are talking strictly about two constituencies in which the same number of seats are involved.  What the Minister proposes is that a four-seat constituency of West Galway be adopted in which more than one-third of County Clare is added to West Galway and where total violence is done to the geography of that area and West Galway in having them in one constituency, because as the townlands read they are almost like a right-angled triangle based on Galway city, continuing on to the town of Ennis and going across to Ennistymon.  The point of that triangle reaches Galway or Oranmore near Galway and then proceeds from Galway across Galway Bay into another triangle reaching out into Clifden and the greater part of Galway.</P>
    <P>What possible relationship, affinity or association, culturally, historically, geographically or any other way, can there be between the area I have described, that wrenches one-third of County Clare away from that county and adds it into County Galway?  It reduces Clare in poulation by about 20,000 people and adds them to Galway in order to produce an artificial situation of four seats in West Galway instead of three seats which the existing constituency, with minor adjustments, would be entitled to. Instead of having a 60,000 poulation in East Galway with an 80,000 population in Clare, give or take the small adjustments in our first amendments as far as Clare is concerned, the Minister, by his proposed arrangement is flouting every logic in regard <Col N="1365" /> to these two areas.  If the Minister wanted to achieve the purpose of having the present three-seat constituency in West Galway all that is required is the very small townland rearrangement with East Galway&mdash; this is not part of our amendments because we are not talking about East Galway&mdash;and the very small rearrangements with County Clare that we suggest in our amendments here.</P>
    <P>We have the situation where, willy nilly, 20,000 people are being carved out of County Clare, sent artificially into West Galway to make up a four-seat constituency there, Clare being condemned in the process to a three-seat constituency.  I want a logical answer to that.  I am not entitled to speak a second time but I am sure some of my colleagues will&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Senator that he is entitled to conclude the debate on his own amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall certainly conclude the debate, but I am sure that some of my colleagues will also raise this point.  We want to ask specific questions and in concluding a debate one cannot get the answers. Throughout the course of this debate one has noted the inability to answer logical points made from this side of the House.  This has been highly frustrating and prejudicial to the points we have advanced.  The reason why we have committed ourselves to this amendment on Report Stage is that we feel there is total logic and total reason on our side in regard to these three amendments that really incorporate the same principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to hear a logical answer from the Parliamentary Secretary.  I will refrain from commenting but I am certain some of my colleagues will say that this is naked political chicanery, that it is done in the interests of getting a seat in West Galway&mdash;mark you, a seat in West Galway that Fine Gael will not get but a seat in West Galway that Labour hope to get.  In the interest of securing that and in the overall interest of ensuring that Fianna Fáil will get a seat less in East Galway we have this piece of chicanery <Col N="1366" /> that is involved here in page 8 of the Schedule.  It amounts to this quite clearly.  It is a Labour Party conspiracy, through the Minister for Local Government, with two objectives; one is to reduce Fianna Fáil by one seat in East Galway.  That is not involved in the amendments but is a consequential result of the Minister's Bill and the Schedule to it, in that there are 11 seats instead of 12 in the whole area of Galway and Clare. Therefore, Fianna Fáil are deprived of a seat and 20,000 people in East Galway are deprived of representation. The second objective is that, by having three seats in Clare and four seats in West Galway, the seat that is twisted around in the artificial phoney manner that I have mentioned will accrue in some way to Labour as the fourth seat in a West Galway consituency. Fine Gael have no gains out of this situation.  Fianna Fáil have a certain loss in East Galway by being deprived of getting three seats out of five: instead they are getting two seats out of four.  Fine Gael will get one seat out of three in Clare under the Minister's scheme and Fianna Fáil will get two seats.  Labour will hope to get one seat out of four in West Galway.  Be it on Fine Gael's head if they want to see an erosion of one of their citadels, an erosion of the situation where in that part of Ireland generally Labour have not been very strong.  If the Fine Gael Party want to see further erosion of what they believe in in regard to forms of taxation, they can support a situation in West Galway in which one extra seat will almost certainly not go to Fine Gael. The whole purpose of the exercise is to ensure that it goes to Labour.</P>
    <P>The four seats in West Galway will result in two Fianna Fáil, one Fine Gael and one Labour.  That will be the position if it is planned as it is. What we propose&mdash;and in all logic this is as it should be&mdash;are four seats in Clare, two Fianna Fáil and two Fine Gael; three seats in West Galway, two Fianna Fáil and one Fine Gael. Fine Gael are in this case making a very serious political error.  I can see that as the only reason behind it.  It may sound fantastic, but I have to <Col N="1367" /> latch on to something fantastic in order to come to a decision why logic has not been followed.  When logic has not been followed, then I must seek some other reason that is not a logical reason, some other reason that blatantly flouts logic and appears to be in the political interest of one of the two parties concerned here.  If it is on that basis it certainly is not in the political interest of Fine Gael. Indeed, it is totally against the interest of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. The only people who will gain from it are the Labour Party, who for the first time in the Counties of Galway, Roscommon, Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim now appear to be in a situation where they might get a seat. That is the only purpose of wrenching one-third of Clare out of County Clare and putting it in with West Galway.  The Fine Gael members of the Government must have been asleep when this particular Schedule was going through.  There may be a political reason on the part of the Labour Party for what they are doing.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that any independent commission would say that County Clare practically justifies four seats.  There are a few additional townlands in the area of Gort that require to be added to it.  These areas are already named Clare-Galway in local tradition and in local speech. These areas added to Clare would make a four-seat constituency leaving the traditional constituency of East Galway as a three-seat constituency, based on the city of Galway and based on Connemara, thereby observing reason and logic.  When a Bill of this kind is going through the House it is only natural to assume that the Government of the day will not do any harm to themselves but at least they should have some regard to basic logic and basic reason and these factors should not be flouted.  The debate on this Bill convinces me that, whatever Government happen to be in power, these matters should be left to some form of impartial commission or judicial tribunal.</P>
    <P>We have a case here in regard to the <Col N="1368" /> rearrangements of these areas where basic logic and basic reason have been thrown out the window.  There is absolutely no regard to the equity, justice, reason or logic of the position.  County Clare has been raped to the extent of linking East Galway with the town of Ennis and the rural district areas of that town.  The traditional, administrative town of Ennis should have been regarded logically, as the centre of the constituency.  Any of us who is aware of the situation in East Galway knows well that Galway city and its hinterland represent one sub-unit of West Galway and that Connemara represents the other.  There you have a totally logical package.  Any draftsman, instructed by any judicial tribunal to draw up a reasonable scheme would not, in my view, spend any more than five seconds on the arrangements he would make in this particular area.  He would realise that Connemara is entitled to one and a half seats and Galway city and its hinterland to one and a half seats, making a three-seat constituency.  It is logical that County Clare is entitled to four seats, give or take a few townlands.</P>
    <P>The reason for putting down these amendments on Report Stage is the excuse advanced by the Minister that any decisions one might make in regard to particular constituency changes would reverberate and escalate in regard to other constituencies.  In other words, the Minister said on numerous occasions both here and in the other House that there is no point in Deputies and Senators proposing constituency amendments and adjustments because their acceptance would affect other constituencies.</P>
    <P>The Government are looking at this matter in isolation rather than as a whole.  That is precisely the reason why we did not mention East Galway in our amendments although we believe that East Galway is entitled to five seats instead of the four proposed by the Minister.  We tabled an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage.  Of course, we realise that any adjustment in regard to East Galway would affect Roscommon, Mayo and other adjacent counties.  However, the amendments we have put down for Report Stage would not involve <Col N="1369" /> any adjustment for any other constituency. These amendments stand on their own, simply ensuring a readjustment between County Clare and West Galway, a readjustment that would mean four seats in Clare and three seats in East Galway instead of four seats in East Galway and three seats in Clare.</P>
    <P>The minimum of violence would be done to Clare and Galway by removing the townlands we have mentioned in the part of Galway that is known as Clare-Galway in the region of Kinvara and that that part of County Galway be added to Clare to make a natural four-seat constituency and a natural three-seat constituency for East Galway.  We want to know why the Minister does not propose to adopt our amendments.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will adopt them but the Minister was adamant here on Committee Stage that he would reject our amendments.  I made the point that this kind of stance should not be adopted in any parliamentary procedure.</P>
    <P>We accept that we have been beaten in regard to our many amendments on Committee Stage, but here is an amendment that could be accepted by the Minister if the Government are prepared to listen to reason.  I should like to suggest that if the Government want to do themselves a good turn and appear to be reasonable this is exactly the type of amendment they might accept.  I make a final appeal, in the interests of democracy, that they do so.  In this way they would indicate that there exists some reason for the parliamentary process, for spending hours on Committee, Report and Final Stages of Bills.  That is why we confined our amendments on Report Stage to this single principle, which is totally logical and rational.  It does not flout the principle of the Minister's Bill, in that its effect would be to retain the same number of seats in the over-all area.  We suggest to the Minister that our amendment embodies a far more rational division of the area in question than that which he is proposing.</P>

      <P>As Senator Lenihan <Col N="1370" /> said, we cannot see the logic of what the Minister is doing.  We put down logical amendments.  We have not been told that they are other than logical. However, we were outvoted but we come forward again at this late stage to make a further logical amendment. I am sorry that this amendment will be outvoted by the Fine Gael section of the National Coalition Government. Apart from Senator Lenihan's explanation, I diagnose a further reason why Fine Gael may be acting treacherously in regard to themselves, particularly in the constituency that we have avoided mentioning so far&mdash;East Galway&mdash; where it is now commonly known that the wife of the Leader of this House may be in danger of losing here seat.  There could be a loss of a Fine Gael seat in that area because of the new arrangement.</P>
      <P>Taking that with West Galway, where Labour have sold Fine Gael down the political drain in an effort to gerrymander a constituency into a situation where Labour are trying to achieve&mdash;and if it is to be achieved, as Senator Lenihan said, it is Labour who will achieve it&mdash;the election of a Member of this House.  I ask Fine Gael to reconsider the situation.  The Leader of the House knows exactly what I am talking about.  Not alone have Labour tried to gerrymander a constituency for themselves but they have endangered a Fine Gael seat on the East Galway side.  If Fine Gael want to agree, that is their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our amendment No. 1, is very logical because, as Senator Lenihan said, Ardrahan, Cahermore, Castletaylor, Doorus, Killeenavara, Killinny, Kinvara and Skehanagh in the former rural district of Gort are right along the line of County Clare.  It is natural to include those and make Clare a four-seater.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary, who has more sanity than the Minister, whether it is not more logical to put those few little townlands into Clare and make it a four-seater than to put Inishbofin with Lahinch in a four-seater?  The village of Inagh in County Clare, where the polling booth is situated is split in two in order to create a gerrymander in West Galway.  I defy contradiction when I say that it is far more logical <Col N="1371" /> that the townlands mentioned by us in our amendment be included rather than putting Inagh with Clifden in a four-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>I ask Fine Gael to accept this amendment.  I do not think the proposed arrangement will be tolerated in the west.  If the Parliamentary Secretary has a logical answer, I am most willing to hear it.  Adding those eight little townlands in Galway along the Clare border to Clare is more logical than putting Lahinch and Inagh with Clifden and Inishbofin in another constituency, as is proposed in the Bill.  If the Fine Gael section of the Coalition would agree to this it would be a natural progression to take the second amendment.</P>
    <P>Connemara and Galway city have something in common.  It is natural to think of Oranmore as having something in common with Galway city. The width of the constituency at Oranmore is about 800 yards.  In the Minister's proposal it spreads to the town of Loughrea and down into Gort, across over the mountains into Inagh and out to Hag's head at Lahinch.  That is a most illogical drawing of any constituency.  Can the Minister say that we are not correct in saying that there is common ground between Galway and Connemara? The people have a similar attitude, a common culture.  Anyone who has ever been to Galway knows that.  On one hand there is the city of Galway and on the other, Connemara, and as sure as day follows night any person coming to Galway from any part of the world progresses naturally to Connemara.</P>
    <P>We earnestly ask if we are not logical in our amendment, that we be given an explanation as to why we are not logical.  Would the Government give us their explanation for the logic of the way in which they have sliced this constituency?  Perhaps we should have included the East Galway situation.  Along the area by the town of Loughrea, which is split, Fine Gael have been in danger. Senator Lenihan was right in saying that Fine Gael must have been asleep when the Minister for Local Government <Col N="1372" /> produced this document and succeeded in having it sanctioned by the Government.  They must have been just as much asleep then as they were when the Labour section of the Government implemented those taxes to which certain members of the Fine Gael Government objected last week. Now I see an awakening on the Fine Gael side that they are falling down in this Government.  It certainly happened in this instance.  At this late stage I appeal to the good sense of the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Leader of the House, who I am sure sees the logic of my statement.</P>
    <P>He understands that the particular TD on the East Galway side who is in danger of losing her seat has a right to be a TD.  She has been a wonderful representative in the area.  The Minister, who has done the greatest ever &ldquo;Securicor&rdquo; job in Meath in order to maintain himself as a TD in this House for as long as he lives, is endeavouring also to put a Labour man in Dáil Éireann from the East Galway constituency.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael should at this stage consider our amendments and then come back here and say that they are prepared to agree to those amendments put down by Senators Lenihan, Yeats, Ryan and myself, amendments that are correct and logical.  With the interests of their own people at heart and with their own party in danger, should they not say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; at this final stage to the Fianna Fáil amendment? Let us not have a gerrymander by Labour at the expense of Fine Gael.  This would be the worst insult that could be given to Fine Gael in this Coalition Government.</P>

      <P>I heartily support Senator Lenihan in all he has said on these three amendments.  The ground has been fully covered in recent weeks in this House.  We have had bad calculations by the Minister for Local Government, as was pointed out to him the last day when he thought he could use the threat of the existence of certain documents.  A man with only limited national school <Col N="1373" /> education would be able to multiply three by four and understand what the former Minister for Local Government was endeavouring to do.  I am not casting a slur on the Minister's education but I thought he made a very bad mathematical slip.  A man who would make a slip of that nature and yet hold it as a threat on this House and this party, saying that the former Minister had done something terrible, displayed the worst ignorance and the most unethical type of political hogwash that has ever been witnessed in this House.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary is here.  No doubt he understands the logic we are putting to him in our final amendments.  I am quite aware that the Leader of the House understands fully what we are talking about and that he has been made aware of the situation over the weekend by numerous members of the Fine Gael Party in East Galway who have 'phoned his house to ask him, even at this late stage, to let Fine Gael wake up in Government and not endanger further the dicey situation for that party in the west.  If they pay heed to their constituents at home they will back us on this amendment. They will ask the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to agree to these final amendments, which make an effort to straighten things out in this horrible Bill.</P>
      <P>I commend the amendments to the House.  If, however, they should not be accepted, we can only hope that, at least, we will be given a logical reason as to why we are wrong in what we propose.</P>

      <P>I wonder how Senator Killilea would have managed to make a speech if the word &ldquo;logical&rdquo; had never appeared in the dictionary or if it had not been used by Senator Lenihan.  It seems to me that Senator Killilea grasped at the word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not delay the House but I should like to give an assurance to Senator Killilea that I had no weekend telephone calls with regard to these amendments or to the constituency in question.  I am fully confident that each of the Fine Gael <Col N="1374" /> candidates in the constituencies we are discussing will succeed in winning their nominations at conventions and that they will not need to do any midnight rides in order to intercept the Leader of their party for the purpose of securing nominations at the next election in four years' time.  I hope that on the next occasion Senator Killilea will find himself in the same confident situation and that he will not require the intervention of the Leader of his party in order to bring his name once more before the electorate of one of Galway's constituencies.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Lenihan's plea, I think&mdash;and I say this quite sincerely, although I do not go along with his arguments&mdash;he has endeavoured to play a constructive rôle in the discussion on this Bill.  A certain amount of thought and consideration had obviously been given by him and his colleagues to the pattern of the amendments which were put down.</P>
    <P>There was one thing that struck me in relation to Senator Lenihan's contribution today.  It was his invoking of the image of an independent tribunal or judicial commission to set the constituency boundaries.  There may be something in that idea.  The Minister has made clear what his attitude in relation to it is and the degree of support from the Fianna Fáil Party which would be required in order to have such a commission in the future.  If Members of the party opposite speak with different voices on the topic it is not very likely that it is going to be achieved.  However the Minister has made clear his views on that.  What struck me as remarkable was the particular type of independent body or tribunal which was envisaged by Senator Lenihan and invoked by him in relation to this amendment and several others in the past.  It always seemed to come up with the same answer as Senator Lenihan was giving to the House. This may be purely coincidental, but it did strike me as rather extraordinary. If I were asked to support the concept of an independent tribunal or commission which would always give the same answer as was suggested by <Col N="1375" /> Senator Lenihan perhaps I would view the whole idea with a little scepticism.</P>
    <P>While I concede that a constructive effort has been made by Senator Lenihan, and some of his colleagues in this House, they have not yet grasped the fact that for the first time for more than half a century it does not fall to the Fianna Fáil Party to deal with the re-distribution of seats in the constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand why Senator Lenihan feels that the amendments which he is recommending to the Minister are ones which should be made and why they are, from his point of view and that of his colleagues, the best solution. There are other points of view to be taken into account.  I am not impressed by Fianna Fáil hearts bleeding for the Fine Gael Party.  It is possible that the outcome of the Minister's proposals relating to these constituencies will result in the gaining of a seat by the Labour Party. That may not be so, but there is no reason why they should not gain a seat if the people want them to have representation in County Galway.  It is nothing to be ashamed of that a particular fall-out of constituencies may favour either a particular individual or a particular party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are concerned with is that on the general pattern of the re-distribution which is taking place the Minister has regard to the constitutional position which faces him, that he has regard to the decision of the people in connection with the tolerance issue and the decision of the courts in that regard.  No one can deny, in relation to the Minister's proposals, that all those considerations are taken into account.  It is not possible to foresee if the ultimate result of the proposed changes will be the loss of a seat for Fianna Fáil or the gaining of one for Labour.  Irrespective of any Government <Col N="1376" /> decision the final decision lies with the general public.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the view that people do not change their political affiliations.  If Fianna Fáil have sufficient appeal and attraction and have sufficient confidence in themselves, they may succeed in redeeming the seat which they fear they will lose as a result of these proposals.  On the other hand if the Government go ahead with the same confidence and flair as they have been showing so far, then the Fianna Fáil pessimism in relation to these constituencies may well be justified. It seems likely in those conditions that Fianna Fáil will forfeit the seat they are now hoping to save by these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins has stated that, irrespective of how constituencies are carved up, the electorate will ultimately decide how the seats will be divided.  I agree with this.  However, no matter how they vote in the next general election, they cannot change the position which will exist following the passing of this Bill, that is, we will now have 28 seats instead of the customary 30 in the west of Ireland.  This has resulted because the tolerance has been used in a way which is disadvantageous to the rural areas. As was pointed out on the Committee Stage debate and other Stages, there are instances where it has taken 21,123 persons in rural areas to return a Deputy to Dáil Éireann, whereas in the urban areas it is possible to return a Deputy with 19,122 votes.  This is an undisputable fact which cannot be changed when this Bill becomes law irrespective of how the people vote.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why the Minister was adamant in making a four-seat constituency in County Louth and a four-seater in County Meath.  The population of Louth is 74,951 and the population of Meath is 71,729.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that; I am merely making a comparison.  This is where the sting comes in.  If the Minister was justified in this action along the eastern seaboard why has the Minister seen fit in County Clare, with a population of 75,008, to cut it down to a three-seat constituency?  We are all familiar with the profile of County Clare.  We know that most of it is a natural division cut out by the Almighty and the Atlantic Ocean with well defined boundaries.  Thanks to the efforts of Fianna Fáil by creating industries in the Shannon area the population has reached 75,008.  The then Opposition stated that the rabbits would be running around Shannon Airport but there is now a great industrial centre there. If Louth is made a four-seater with a population of 74,951 and Meath with a population of 71,000, there is an unanswerable case for making Clare, with a population of 75,008, a four-seater.</P>
      <P>As Senator Lenihan aptly stated, it would have taken only a small number of persons from Galway to top Clare up to a four-seat constituency. Clare will now be a three-seater with part of East Galway going down to Ennis and part of West Galway. Looking at a map one sees the distance from the islands off the west coast&mdash;Inismean, Inismore, Inishere and Inisbofin&mdash;to the rural district of Ennis.  Does anyone think that is a natural division or that the constituency has been put together as a solid block with fairly well defined boundaries?  Does anyone think that there is the community spirit necessary to blend in together or that the people are within easy reach of their representatives?  There is no logic in such a division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not been consistent so far as this is concerned.  He has blatantly disregarded the idea of making Clare a four-seater, yet when it suited him he did so in County Meath, his own constituency.  I am not against the Labour Party advancing their interests in any area if they are able to do it.  That is their own business.  But anybody who gerrymanders any part of this country to <Col N="1378" /> create a ready made safe seat will not be successful.</P>
    <P>This is a wrong approach.  When we were dividing these constituencies we were not worried who got the seats. What has worried me as a rural Senator and what is still annoying me, is that rural Ireland is being deprived of just constitutional representation. The gain is being made along the eastern coast and, in particular, in the city.  The Minister should tell us why Clare has not been made a four-seater just as Louth and Meath have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some things we all agree on with regard to the preparation of a Bill of this kind.  We agree with what the Minister said in introducing the Bill in this House and he said the same thing when introducing this Bill in the other House. The Minister said:</P>
      <P>I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to avoid breaching existing administrative boundaries and tried to ensure that natural communities were not split unnecessarily between different constituencies.</P>
      <P>Of course, we have been pointing out that that is precisely what the Minister has not done in this Bill.  In particular that is not what the Minister has done with regard to the constituencies of West Galway and Clare. However, I think we can agree&mdash;and from his remarks it is clear that Senator O'Higgins agrees&mdash;that any Minister bringing in a Bill of this kind should, as far as possible, try to preserve existing county boundaries and to preserve existing natural communities so that they are contained in a single constituency and not spread over several.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We pointed out on the Committee Stage that what had been done by the Minister with respect to Clare and West Galway was to create out of West Galway a large unwieldy constituency ranging almost from the town of Ennis to the furthest reaches of Connemara, Clifden and into the Atlantic Ocean to the island of Inisbofin. The two ends of this constituency have really nothing in common. We have had the situation where the rules as set out by the Minister were <Col N="1379" /> broken.  The Minister did not in this case avoid breaching existing administrative boundaries.  He took 12,277 people out of County Clare and pushed them into West Galway.  In other words he took a large piece out of County Clare.  That was quite unnecessary.</P>
    <P>The population of County Clare, as has been pointed out by Senator Dolan, is 75,008.  The minimum number required for a four-seat constituency under the narrow tolerance with which we have been working is little more than this; about 1,400 more.  Therefore, county Clare by itself was nearly up to the level required under the Constitution for a four-seat constituency.  The Minister set out during the Committee Stage his views on what comprised a four-seat constituency when he referred to County Louth.  He said that the population of County Louth was such that, while not sufficient for four seats, it was so near as to warrant the giving of four seats to the county&mdash;that it would be unjust, unreasonable and unfair to do anything else but give four seats to County Louth.</P>
    <P>It is worth referring to that statement of the Minister's as an earnest of the viewpoint he held in this respect.  It is a viewpoint we all hold. Where you have a county with, perhaps 1,500 or 2,000 population below the minimum required by the Constitution, if at all possible, the sensible, reasonable and just thing to do is to give that county four seats.</P>
    <P>County Clare has, in fact, a higher population than County Louth.  Yet for reasons which have never been divulged, instead of making County Clare a four-seater, which would have been the sensible thing to do, the Minister cut out a large chunk of it and left three seats.  Our amendment seeks to undo this unfair and unjust division of the Minister's and to establish a position where, instead of 12,277 Clare people being brought into Galway, a smaller number of Galway people&mdash;2,786&mdash;are being brought into Clare.</P>
    <P>Galway people, as Senator Killilea <Col N="1380" /> has pointed out, living along the Clare border in an area known as Clare-Galway have a great deal in common with the people of Clare. Under our amendment we seek to make it a coherent, reasonably sized, compact Clare constituency with four seats almost contained within the traditional and legal boundaries of County Clare.  What the Minister has done is contrary to his expressed policy.  It is a totally unnecessary breach in existing administrative boundaries.  That is the first thing.</P>
    <P>The second thing he has done is to split up natural communities in Clare and Galway, contrary to what he has declared to be his policy.  We all know &mdash;it has been pointed out several times in these debates&mdash;that as between the city of Galway and Connemara there is a very close, traditional bond.  The people of Connemara, as a matter of course, go to Galway to do their business.  Galway is, in every respect, the principal town of Connemara. However, the people of Clare who have been brought in&mdash;almost down to the town of Ennis&mdash;have nothing whatever in common with those living in the city of Galway or the people of Connemara.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his glib way, said on several occasions during the Committee Stage debate, that they were all Irish.  Of course we are all Irishmen. It is not I who used this phrase &ldquo;natural communities&rdquo;, it was the Minister in his opening speech.  He said natural communities should not be unnecessarily split.  There is clearly a natural community in the Connemara-Galway city area just as there is a natural community in Clare and the areas immediately adjoining Clare known as Clare-Galway.  These have been split in a totally unnecessary way.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, concluding his opening speech, he felt that impartial observers would agree that he had done a good job on this Bill and had achieved his objectives.  I know of no impartial observer who would say this. I would be willing to dispense with the impartial observers and to suggest that Fine Gael Senators&mdash;I am not suggesting that they are impartial <Col N="1381" /> observers&mdash;give their views as to whether in respect of the constituencies of Clare and West Galway the Minister has succeeded in his aim of avoiding unnecessary breaches in existing county boundaries and of avoiding unnecessary divisions in natural communities.</P>
    <P>We had a speech from Senator O'Higgins and it would not be unfair to suggest that, if his speech meant anything, it meant that in his personal and candid view this was a good amendment.  The only thing he found ultimately to say was that after all this was the first time in 50 years that it was not a Fianna Fáil Government who made the division of constituencies and that there were reasons&mdash;reasons which he was wise enough not to specify&mdash;why the two constituencies had been divided in this way.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go into questions of who will get what seat.  I have no doubt whatever that in these two constituencies, even as contained in the Bill, Fianna Fáil will get a majority of the seats concerned.  That is not the point.  The point I would put to Fine Gael Senators opposite is: do they in their heart of hearts feel that the division of these two constituencies contained in this Bill is a reasonable or a fair one?  Should we have a four-seat constituency in a county which is almost big enough to enable it, by itself, without any additions, to have four seats; or should it be cut down to a three-seater?  Is it more reasonable to take 2,000 people from Galway into Clare or, as in this Bill, to take over 12,000 people from Clare into Galway? Is it reasonable to divide the natural, traditional communities of Clare and Clare-Galway and lump them into an area co-existing with furthest Connemara&mdash;people with whom they have nothing in common?  Would one Fine Gael Senator say some simple, coherent and reasonable thing in favour of this division?</P>
    <P>Our amendment does not tend to deal with the point that we made&mdash;a good point, and one which we were entitled to make&mdash;that Galway and Clare and the west in general were being deprived of seats which were their right.  We are not dealing with <Col N="1382" /> this matter.  We are dealing now, as Senator Lenihan has pointed out, with a very limited matter&mdash;a simple issue between the two constituencies of Clare and West Galway.  We are not in any way trying to affect the number of seats involved.  There are seven seats between the two.  It is a simple matter of division. Will there be three in West-Galway and four in Clare or three in Clare and four in West Galway?</P>
    <P>Our amendment seeks to make this division in a way which best enables us to avoid unnecessary breaches in county boundaries and to avoid unnecessary divisions in communities. Questions of party advantage simply do not come into it.  We are not interested in whether the Minister is enabled by this means to elect an additional Labour Deputy.  I could not care less about that.  I am not interested in that topic, although it seems to interest the Minister.  As far as our party are concerned, we have no fears one way or the other.  On general principles a division of this kind should be fair and should be seen to be fair.  Above all else, we should bear in mind the Minister's statement in his opening speech that one should try and avoid breaching existing administrative boundaries or splitting natural communities.  In order to achieve this I feel that this amendment is a good one and a necessary one.</P>
    <P>I suggest to Senators opposite that they should not just sit there silently and, ultimately, come to vote against our amendment.  If they wish to vote against our amendment they should have the courage to stand up and give simple, coherent reasons&mdash;not based in any way on who is going to get the seats or anything of that kind but based on natural justice&mdash;why our amendment should not be accepted.</P>

      <P>Like my colleagues I should like to make a final appeal to the Minister and to the Government to accept, at this the eleventh hour, our amendment in the national interest and in the interest of fair play and democracy.  In our proposal the Minister and the Government have a golden opportunity to do a service to democracy and to restore the confidence <Col N="1383" /> of the people in the Constitution, in the Coalition Government, and some faith in Deputy Tully as a Minister, as a member of the Cabinet, as a politician and as a would-be statesman. This is an opportunity they should not fail to avail themselves of.</P>
      <P>During the course of the long debate on this Bill here, and in the other House&mdash;and, indeed, in the media&mdash; the Minister was accused of many abuses and malpractices.  He was accused of gerrymandering, discrimination, of breaching parish boundaries, county boundaries, administrative and electoral boundaries. He was accused, and rightly so, of operating the tolerance against the west and against the rural parts of the country.  He was accused of dividing and splitting communities and of ignoring all the traditional, cultural, commercial and other affinities and common denominators which areas have with each other.</P>
      <P>All this criticism was justified.  In the constituency of Clare and East Galway the Minister has deliberately engaged in rigging and juggling figures in order to provide&mdash;&ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; would be a better term&mdash;a seat for a colleague, a member of his own party and to boost and bolster the position of his own party in Galway.</P>
      <P>When we were debating the situation in Cork city I made the same allegation against the Minister.  I asked him for a reasonable, logical explanation why Cork City and Mid-Cork should be made five-seaters.  I suggested that he did this in order to consolidate the position of a colleague of his in Mid-Cork and to give another colleague of his some opportunity of gaining a seat in the city of Cork.  I asked him, if that were not so, to offer us any excuse or reasonable, logical explanation.  He failed to do so.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to keep on repeating in this House, as he did in the other House, that if we do not like it we can lump it&mdash;that we had years of opportunity to introduce this legislation ourselves.</P>

    <P>As Senator O'Higgins said a moment ago, no arranging of constituencies <Col N="1384" /> can ensure political permanence for any party.  The Senator qualified that statement by saying that, ultimately, the people will decide.  But, as was pointed out by Senator Dolan, the people cannot possibly decide in the next election or for many elections to come.  They cannot make any decision in the case of Clare or East Galway if the Minister's proposals are accepted and if he refuses to accept our amendment.</P>
    <P>These constituencies of Clare and East Galway as proposed by the Minister provide a glaring example of all the abuses the Minister has been accused in this House.  On the other hand, I submit that our amendment shows what the Minister should have done.</P>
    <P>Other Senators were more knowledgeable about the constituency of Clare and set out in detail their objections to the Minister's proposal. They detailed the various geographical, commercial and cultural aspects of the county which, we submit, the Minister should have taken into account.  The size of the proposed new constituency of West Galway, the difficult terrain and the number of islands in that constituency should have been considered.  I do not propose to deal any further with that except to demand again from the Minister an explanation why he offers this grotesque distortion of a constituency to the people of Clare.</P>
    <P>Again I submit that, taking everything into account, our proposal is a blueprint for a perfect constituency.  It has regard to all the principles and the guidelines which the Minister has repeatedly said should be taken into account and which he stated he has taken into account in dealing with all these constituencies.  I want to repeat that the present proposal of the Minister is the most glaring example of his failure to take these principles and guidelines into account in dealing with the constituency of Clare as well as the constituency of Cork City and Mid-Cork.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, to the Government and to the Parliamentary <Col N="1385" /> Secretary&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary certainly does not benefit by this proposed legislation either, for the obvious reason that the Labour machine is working effectively in his constituency &mdash;to make the generous and gracious gesture of accepting our amendment here and now.  If the Minister will do this, he will remove some of the stigma and bitterness felt by many people because of this Bill.  There is bitterness against the Minister and against the Government.  Last week I told the Minister that the fame, or the infamy, of this Bill has gone abroad.  It is regarded as unjust legislation.  I told that to the Minister already and I am sorry he is not here now to hear me say it again.  It was described as such at a meeting which was dealing mainly with fundamental rights and electoral rights.  The Minister tried to make out that the present Act was at fault; but this Bill is the worst piece of gerrymandering at present in Europe.  I was told that I had no right to talk or to complain about discrimination or gerrymandering of any kind in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Again I appeal to the Minister and the Government&mdash;especially to the Fine Gael element of the Government&mdash;to accept this proposal and to undo some of the gross injustices which have been done in many parts of the country but particularly in County Clare and in the proposed constituencies of Mid-Cork and Cork City.  If the Minister were to do this he would be seen to be fair and logical.  He would have awakened his conscience to some sense of justice and fair play.  By accepting this proposal the Minister would set a headline that could be followed by his successors in office in the future when they come to deal with similar legislation.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with my colleagues on this side of the House in supporting this amendment. When the Leader of the House spoke here today he did not say what we on this side of the House have been waiting for over the past few weeks.  We have been waiting for some answer from the Government benches in regard to the gerrymandering in the counties of Clare and Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> I, coming from a midland county, consider myself in a position of being able to look at Counties Clare and Galway in an unbiased way.  To me, the logical thing, considering that the population of Clare has increased significantly, would be to make County Clare a four-seat constituency.  Its population almost entitles Clare to four seats.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the House said that Senator Killilea seemed to have borrowed the words &ldquo;logic&rdquo; and &ldquo;logical&rdquo; from Senator Lenihan.  I think he said that because he knew our amendment was the only logical solution to the situation.  The alternative to using logic in regard to arranging constituencies is to gerrymander. I feel certain that the Leader of the House knows that the Minister and the Government have carried out a great feat of gerrymandering in regard to the counties of Clare and Galway.</P>
    <P>I can look at this in an unbiased manner.  Something in the region of 13,000 voters are taken out of Clare and put in with West Galway.  I cannot understand how any Minister for Local Government, irrespective of his political party, could come to the conclusion that the people of Clare would be satisfied with such an arrangement. I doubt it very much.  If 13,000 voters from Offaly were asked to vote in Westmeath, Tipperary or some neighbouring county, they would not tolerate that situation.  The Minister and the Government have an opportunity, even at this stage, of remedying the position in Clare, so that the electorate of County Clare can have a natural boundary.</P>
    <P>In our amendment we have asked the Minister to take in various townlands all along the border of County Clare.  There is nothing unnatural about making County Clare a four-seater. As I pointed out earlier we are still waiting for the Minister to tell us the logic of gerrymandering those two counties.  During the debate here in the Seanad we have pinpointed why we feel that those two constituencies have been gerrymandered. We have given reasons for saying that our amendment should be accepted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1387" /> The only reason given for the Government not accepting our amendment is that this is the first opportunity any Government other than a Fianna Fáil Government have had of rearranging the constituencies.  This is not logical.  Just because the Coalition are now in Government and now have the power of rearranging the constituencies, they should not do it any way they like.  That is what is happening.  We have asked for some Member from the Government benches to get up and give us a logical reason why they have carved County Clare in such a manner.  I doubt very much if we will get an explanation at this late stage.  We cannot get any valid reason why this is so.  The Minister and the Government should accept the amendment we have put before them.</P>
    <P>I have not much more to say. There has been much repetition in <Col N="1388" /> this debate.  All the points have been put before the Minister and the Government on the earlier Stages.  In conclusion, I sincerely request the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to consider our amendment in regard to the constituencies of Clare and West Galway.</P>

      <P>This amendment would make County Clare, with the addition of 2,786 persons from the Kinvara area of Galway, a four-seat constituency. The constituency of East Galway would be exactly the same as proposed in the Bill and would also be a four-seater.  The West Galway constituency would consist of the area of existing West Galway constituency with the addition of 2,837 persons from the Clarenbridge area and would have three seats.  Particulars of the proposed constituencies are as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The proposed constituencies would meet the constitutional requirement about equality of representation.</P>
    <P>Last week on Committee Stage the Minister dealt pretty fully with this area and put the facts on the record of the House.  Last week Senators opposite were pressing for 12 seats in these two counties, were taking the line that the area was being robbed of a seat and that all sorts of dire consequences would result from this. The Minister pointed out that the combined population of the two counties justified 11 seats only and that it would not be possible to allocate 12 seats unless a sizeable part of some other county were to be added. It is nice to see that the Opposition have now come around to accepting that the proper representation for the area is 11 seats and that this is the maximum which could be given within the accepted tolerance range.</P>
    <P>It might be helpful to summarise the facts again.  County Clare has a population of 75,008, which is too high for three seats and too low for four seats.  It cannot be a constituency on its own.  County Galway has a poulation of 149,223, which is too high for seven seats and too low for eight seats.  County Galway cannot, therefore, stand on its own.  The combined population of the two counties is 224,231, which is within the range for 11 seats.</P>
    <P>The obvious thing is to give 11 seats, and this is what the Bill proposes to do.  Even the Opposition now accept that this is the proper thing to do.  There are a number of ways in which 11 seats can be distributed, but in practical terms the choice is between two three-seaters and a five-seater or two four-seaters and a three-seater.  The Opposition now agree that it should be two four-seaters <Col N="1389" /> and one three-seater.  The question then is: should Clare get three or four seats?  Should people be transferred from Clare to Galway or from Galway to Clare?  The Government had to have regard to the existing situation, which is that Clare is a three-seater and that people are at present transferred from Clare to Galway, not the other way around. This was the decision reached by the previous Government in almost identical circumstances in 1969.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

      <P>Senator Lenihan complained that a large number of people were being transferred from Clare to Galway.  Under the constituencies drawn up in 1969, 14,287 people were transferred from Clare to Galway. Under this Bill the number of people transferred is 12,277.  More than 1,000 people fewer are being transferred.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out in his Second Reading speech that no matter who arranged the constituencies each one would draw them up on different lines.  The point is that somebody had to do it.  The Minister had to come down on one side and he has made a very fair job of it.</P>
      <P>Senator Yeats said that the arrangement in Clare and Galway does not live up to the stated aim of the Minister and that administrative boundaries should be preserved as far as possible.  The position is that neither Clare nor Galway can stand on its own for constituency purposes.  There must be a boundary between them and therefore there must be a breaching of constituency boundaries.  It would not be logical to have 11-seat constituencies.  Senator Yeats implies that when a county boundary is breached the smallest possible number of people should be transferred.</P>

      <P>I am only saying what the previous Administration did.  It is difficult to understand why Senators opposite should now be so strongly against an arrangement which they strongly favoured five years ago.  The only part of the situation that has changed since then is that we have a different Government.  It is interesting to note that this is the third proposal put down by the Opposition in relation to this area.  Their present proposal is for two four-seaters and a three-seater.  On Committee Stage they suggested one five-seater, one four-seater and one three-seater and in the Dáil they suggested four three-seaters.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been debated for over 50 hours in the Seanad.  The Government feel that, if the Opposition had adopted a more constructive approach and had come up with suggestions for marginal changes such as they are now recommending at an earlier stage, they would have found the Minister very reasonable about suggestions of this kind.  But they cannot have it both ways.  If they are as obstructive as possible they cannot really expect a Minister to go out of his way to please them.</P>

      <P>In view of what has just been said at the end of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, perhaps between now and when we resume, there might be some amendment from the Government to meet us on our amendment on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>It is flouting the whole tradition of this House, and indeed it flouts the whole notion of having any sort of parliamentary tradition in this country, when one gets an admission by the Parliamentary Secretary in a prepared statement, which has obviously been approved by the Minister that this amendment is a constructive one and an amendment which should be adopted.  It has been conclusively proved that the least violence would be done to the traditional natural area of East Galway and the traditional administrative area of Clare by adopting our amendment.  Our amendment does not in any way imply an admission of agreement in regard to constituency sizes elsewhere.  Whoever prepared that brief was totally wrong. We merely adopted the parliamentary procedure of, having been beaten on Committee Stage, bringing forward a Report Stage amendment which did not conflict with the amendments on which we were beaten.  Bringing forward this Report Stage amendment in regard to West Galway and Clare in no way takes from our very profound opposition to what has been done in East Galway and indeed done in many other constituencies, including the whole Cork region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say, following on the argument I was pursuing before we adjourned, that this amendment or group of amendments we have put forward here on this specific issue were designed on the basis that they represented a constructive approach, if I might say so, an incontrovertible approach from <Col N="1392" /> the point of view of logic and reason. This admission has already been made by the Parliamentary Secretary in his reply when he stated that the amendments did represent a constructive approach in this matter but that the Minister and the Government felt that because of our attitude on earlier stages of this discussion in the Dáil he did not feel disposed to accepting the proposals at this stage.</P>
      <P>That represents to me an extraordinary attitude of mind.  If you follow that attitude of mind to its logical conclusion we should have no second House here at all; once minds are fixed at a certain stage, then minds are fixed and closed absolutely to any logic or any reason that is advanced thereafter.  That line of argument I candidly find very disturbing. If we have proved our point on this Report Stage amendment, flowing from a group of Committee Stage amendments which were on the same line of logic as regards to these two counties, surely in any deliberative parliamentary assembly there should be acknowledgement of that fact from the Government?  The acknowledgment is quite simple, defer the Report Stage for a week, a day or even an hour or for whatever length of time the Minister or Government would think appropriate so that an amendment could be adopted or adapted to meet the amendment which we have put down.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the official side in the Department of Local Government and the Parliamentary Secretary have acknowledged in the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary that what we now advance is a constructive amendment, that they would have adopted it if it was advanced at an earlier stage.  That is the purport of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said.  It is an infantile argument&mdash; and I am surprised that it should appear in a prepared statement&mdash;that because it did not appear at an earlier stage and because Fianna Fáil did not advance this argument which is now being advanced by us on Report Stage, it is not valid to accept it at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That runs counter to the purpose of <Col N="1393" /> the Seanad and having various Stages for Bills.  The purpose of having two Houses of the Oireachtas is that at a stage such as the Report Stage, if whoever represents the Government of the day sees a reasonable and constructive amendment being put forward he is given a chance to mend his hand.  The purpose of our sitting here on a Report Stage of a Bill is to get from the Government of the day the admission that if there is something constructive in what is offered to them by the Seanad it will be adopted by the Minister.  We have had occasions during the present Oireachtas when the Leader of the House and the Minister have met views advanced by the Opposition and they have been incorporated into subsequent amendments. This has taken place during the introduction of several pieces of legislation over the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>What I have already stated in proposing this group of amendments on the Report Stage is accentuated and emphasised and made more reasonable and constructive in the light of what the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary, and the officials who backed them up with advice and expert knowledge, have now given to the Seanad in the form of a prepared statement read out here by the Parliamentary Secretary.  This is obviously distilled advice coming from all those sources, and from this distilled advice it is clear the view taken by the Administration and the Government that this is a highly reasonable group of amendments and that there should be four seats in County Clare and three seats in West Galway.</P>
    <P>This applies to all of us here, not just to Fianna Fáil Senators: are we going to play out a charade of hypocrisy in which there cannot be accepted by the Government of the <Col N="1394" /> day a responsible and legitimate amendment?  Are we all here participating like puppets on a string in a charade which means nothing?  If we do put forward an amendment which is constructive and reasonable and would have been put forward at an earlier stage, surely that is the purpose of having a Report Stage.  The purpose of having two Houses of the Oireachtas is, firstly, to have the Seanad examine what has been passed by the Dáil, proposing constructive amendments and improvements.  If on Report Stage it is stated by the Minister from his brief and read by him, not by the Parliamentary Secretary, that the Report Stage group of amendments represent a reasonable and constructive approach to this Bill, which would have been adopted if we put them forward earlier, this is the most ludicrous argument ever advanced.  It suggests that if the Opposition, which is the Fianna Fáil Party at present, neglect or omit or do not put forward a particular point of view at an earlier stage we are to be debarred from putting forward that point of view on Report Stage. This argument does not stand up at all.  The purpose of having a Report Stage amendment in any House of Parliament is to consider in detail in a constructive light matter which may have been omitted by either the Government or the Opposition.  On the Parliamentary Secretary's own admission this is an omission that needs to be rectified, and I appeal to the Government to recognise that there has been constructive opposition here from this side of the House.  We would like to take up the Parliamentary Secretary on the last two paragraphs of the statement read out by him.</P>

      <P>I propose to be very brief on this.  It is not usual to oppose a normal legislation on the Final Stage.  We are doing so here because we regard this as an abnormal legislation. It is legislation that is being introduced in a blatent attempt to gerrymander the country in the interest of perpetuation of power by two groups of people who now form the Government.</P>
      <P>It is easy enough for people on the other side of the House to say in the 1969 Electoral Act the same process was carried out.  It was not.  The difference is very real in this instance.  The basic difference here is that the plan has been a total plan designed to ensure in Dublin city and county a three-seat situation, where Labour and Fine Gael will obtain two seats out of three as against Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>First of all, I want to issue a warning to the Government that that is not going to work.  The coming local elections and the general mood of public opinion against them will ensure that that does not work.  I am only giving it as an example of the attitude of mind.  I, as a practical politician, and most of my colleagues are in the same category in the group here in the Seanad, would go along with that on the basis that we can take on in Dublin city and county this artificial grouping and beat them in the next general election.  I am talking about the attitude of mind behind the thinking which drafted this Bill.  It is shown to an even meaner extent when we consider some of the rural constituencies. At least in the Dublin city and county constituencies, although the objective is quite clear, there is a gamble element in it.  They are willing to take us on on the basis that Fine Gael and Labour can each of them secure two seats out of three.  We will take them on on that and beat them.</P>
      <P>The attitude of mind involved in drafting this legislation is seen at its meanest when one comes down to consider the rest of the country.  In Cork city, in an urban area exactly equivalent to the urban areas in Dublin, they were not willing to take the chance of having two three-seat constituencies and decided instead to have an artificial situation of a four-seat constituency.  There is a large slice carved out of Cork city and moved into the totally rural area of Mid-Cork in order to create an artificial five-seat constituency.  That is where the attitude of mind was made quite plain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude of mind was further made plain in regard to the whole rearrangement of the west of Ireland&mdash; by that I mean west of the Shannon from Clare to Donegal.  The rearrangement <Col N="1397" /> there was designed for the purpose of reducing the natural representation that the people in rural Ireland had and to which they were entitled, and they reduced it overall by two seats.  In particular and most blatantly they reduced the areas of Clare and County Galway by one seat, again in the interest of depriving people entitled to their representation in the Dáil of a seat&mdash;two seats overall.</P>
    <P>We have discussed this for long enough on Committee Stage already. The Seanad knows our point of view on Report Stage.  If the Government wanted to have a really interesting political debate and interesting issues to present to the people in the next general election, so that people could make a clear choice between the Government and Opposition, they had a chance to make the whole country three-seat constituencies.  If they were willing to take the gamble of being beaten in Dublin city and county, equally they could have taken that gamble throughout the whole country and said: &ldquo;Right, if we want a clean decision by the people, if we want a Fine Gael-Labour Coalition in Government to parade themselves throughout the country for what they are, we will take Fianna Fáil on in three-seat constituencies throughout Ireland as well as in Dublin city and county&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Chair would be glad if the Senator would not dwell on that point.  The alternatives which the Government did not take are not open to discussion on the Fifth Stage.  We are concerned only with the Bill and its contents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Government did on the Bill&mdash;and this is what I am going to devote my time to now &mdash;was to run away from the situation completely by creating a dishonest position: in Dublin city and county, they created three-seat constituencies on the basis that by Fine Gael and Labour transferring votes to each other they would get two seats out of three.  But they refused to face up to that challenge in the country as a <Col N="1398" /> whole.  Instead this Bill contains a scheme of subterfuge designed to squelch Labour forever as a national party and to ensure that, with an exception here and there, Fine Gael would dominate the situation.</P>
      <P>We discussed today one of the areas in which they thought they might sneak a seat for Labour and give Labour a bonus apart from Dublin city and county.  One way they thought they could give Labour a bonus was by deforming County Clare so as to allow a Labour candidate here in the Seanad with Galway connections to go forward for them.</P>
      <P>Similarly, in relation to Limerick city and county, the Labour Party within the Government had their way, apparently.  The logic of the situation in an urban area like Limerick city is to do what was done in Dublin city but what was not done in Cork city, that is, to have a three-seat constituency in Limerick city.  A four-seat constituency in the administrative county of Limerick outside Limerick city could have been created and a three-seat constituency in Limerick city could have been created, as has been done in Dublin city.  But, again, that would not have suited the particular Labour Party representative in Limerick city.</P>
      <P>There is a total absence of consistency. It is on the basis of lack of principle and constituency that I want to attack this Bill on Fifth Stage.  We put down here a series of amendments Indeed, the Leader of the House, Senator O'Higgins, acknowledged today that there was a consistent pattern in our amendments.  They followed a distinct pattern of principle and in every one of them we were following a definite line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee was suggested nine three-seat constituencies for Dublin city and four and five-seat constituencies in County Dublin.  We did this because of our consistency in adhering to principle, a quality that is absent in the Government proposals.  If there are Government proposals incorporated in the Bill to have three-seat constituencies in Dublin, as an urban area, then logically there should be three-seat constituencies in Cork and <Col N="1399" /> a three-seat constituency in Limerick. The same applies to Waterford.  This, again, is lack of thinking.  Here, again, no judicial tribunal would hold with the attitude being adopted by the Government in this Bill.</P>
    <P>However, previous legislative measures of this kind may be criticised, in no Electoral Bill since the formation of the State has there been such a drastic and draconian rearrangement of the country without any regard to principle.  I do not mind a rearrangement if there is a basic point of principle in it.  As I suggested, if the Government wanted three-seat constituencies in Dublin why not have them across the board in all urban areas?  Why not have a system of principle involved?  In the 1969 Electoral Bill, which was severely criticised, there was a scheme of four-seat constituencies in Dublin and three-seat constituencies in rural Ireland.  By and large that was the scheme of things.</P>
    <P>Here there is a lack of consistency all the way.  There are three-seat constituencies in Dublin, a four- and a five-seat constituency in Cork and Mid-Cork, a four-seat constituency in a city area and a three-seat constituency in a rural area as far as Limerick is concerned.  As far as Clare and Galway are concerned there is a total lack of consistency in having two artificial four-seat constituencies and a three-seat constituency in a rural area.  Where is the consistency there? There is a three-seat constituency in the rural area of West Limerick; a four-seat constituency in the urban area of Limerick City and a small bit of rural East Limerick attached to it; a five-seat constituency enclosing a third of the city of Cork and rural Cork, with which it has nothing to approximate; a four-seat constituency in the rest of Cork city; and three-seat constituencies in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>To have a logical pattern is the only approach that can be defended as being reasonably fair.  We strike at the basis of democracy in this country when we bring in a Bill such as this, which is totally unprincipled and for which nobody in this or in the other <Col N="1400" /> House has advanced any basis of principle.  Obviously, the measure has been designed strictly on the basis, to use a crude expression, of screwing down Fianna Fáil.  That will not work but it is a petty, mean attitude of mind.  That attitude of mind is exemplified by the fact that when, even at this late stage, we bring forward here in the Seanad a totally reasonable amendment on Report Stage, we find that that is not adopted.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to repeat what I have already said on Report Stage: there is no purpose in having legislation put through this House and having me or any other Member of the Seanad devoting our time and our energies to trying to improve a Bill here and have reasonable debate on it if in seeking to achieve that we meet nothing but hectoring and rhetoric and nothing of a constructive or logical nature to answer constructive points put forward by us.  We believe on this side of the House in the importance of having legislation openly and frankly debated here.  We would like to see in the preparation of that legislation and in the passage of it through the House a reasonable degree of attention and regard paid to it by the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>I think we on this side of the House have shown up the fact that there was no intention by the Government, good, bad or indifferent, to pay any heed to us.  From that point of view it has been an enormous waste of time. I am very sad at this stage to have participated in it because the Government might just have easily introduced the guillotine within one day of having a meeting of Seanad Éireann. It would have been a more honest approach.  It would have been a more honest indication to the public of what they intend if there was a guillotine motion introduced here within 24 hours of everybody coming here.  Instead we have had a very constructive Second Stage debate, a very constructive Committee Stage debate, a Report Stage debate and now a Final Stage debate.  We have gone through the whole legislative process here and have advanced reasoned arguments on <Col N="1401" /> every Stage.  On the admission of the Leader of the House and the Minister this has been the case; but, as far as achievement is concerned, we have nothing to show.  Even the Parliamentary Secretary on Report Stage acknowledged that our amendment is constructive and reasonable.</P>
    <P>If that is the case then the Government had better do something about abolishing the Seanad and, indeed, abolishing the Dáil and simply introduce some very practical guillotine measure.  They had had assemblies of this kind in Portugal and Spain over the years where all you have in the appropriate totalitarian parliaments are a group of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; men.  We are supposed to be here in a democratic parliament where we debate measures of legislation, where there is an enormous amount of time and expense, not just on the part of Members of the Dáil and the Seanad but enormous amount of time and expense to provide the official back-up for the preparation of Bills and so on. There is the Parliamentary staff associated with this group of buildings. All these people are involved in pursuing the democratic forces.  Are the democratic forces to be debased in this manner, with not one single comma of an amendment over a whole sheet of amendments offered to this House?  In effect the Minister for Local Government told us here last week that he was going to chop everything anyway.  If that is to be the purpose of our Assembly there is not much point in any of us being here. The whole purpose of the exercise might have been better served by a guillotine within 24 hours of a sitting in line with the guillotine applied in the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>We must all agree with what Senator Lenihan has said in that, while there is no consistency at all in the way in which the constituencies have been arranged, nonetheless there is a very strong vein of what one might describe as political consistency running through the Bill and running behind all the changes and arrangements made in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very easy to impute political <Col N="1402" /> motives to others, to suggest that in making a particular provision the Minister had party political aims in view.  It is not necessary to impute or suggest motives in regard to this Bill. The Bill speaks with the utmost candour. No matter where you look in the country, no matter which part of the Schedule to this Bill you examine, no matter how you assess the methods used to organise the 42 constituencies laid out in the Schedule to this Bill, you find there is a strong vein of sheer opportunism involved.</P>
    <P>Starting off, for example, in our own city of Dublin we have in all of this area just one four-seat constituency. All the other are three-seaters. There are and will be until the next general election eight four-seat constituencies in the city and county of Dublin but only one is to remain.  We find of course, that of those eight the one chosen was the only one that could not be changed without either gaining Fianna Fáil a seat or losing the present Government a seat.  In the present constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown there are three Coalition supporters and one Fianna Fáil.  To reduce it to three would lose a Coalition seat.  To increase it to five would add a Fianna Fáil seat.  Therefore, from the Minister's own partisan viewpoint, it had to be left alone. Even accepting his own view that 43 seats was the correct number for the Dublin area and that therefore this involved one four-seat constituency, even accepting this any one of the eight constituencies could have been chosen.  But we find that the only one of the original eight that remains is the one best suited to the Minister's own narrow party purpose.</P>
    <P>Looking further afield we find that of the 42 constituencies at present in existence there were 21 which, taken by themselves, could have been left unchanged.  We all know that although a constituency may in itself be within the constitutional limitations, it could be affected by adjoining constituencies.  We accept this.  It would be unreasonable therefore to expect that all 21 of these constituencies, even though they were within the correct constitutional population <Col N="1403" /> ratio, would be left unchanged.  We find that the Minister has changed nine of these completely and left 12 as they were.  It is no surprise at all to find out when we examine the nine that, as mentioned already in the debate on this Bill, in not one of these nine constituencies, which from the Minister's viewpoint were unsatisfactory, is there a Coalition majority. Nor were we surprised to find that of the 12 that were left unchanged, eight had Coalition majorities and were, therefore, satisfactory from the point of view of the Minister.</P>
    <P>In Clare and Galway, where the population has increased during the past five years, seats are being taken away.  In areas of the west where the population has declined rapidly, such as a decline of 6,000 in Mayo and of 6,000 in the adjoining counties of Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon, the number of seats was left unchanged. It is no surprise to find this because, as we know, the areas of Clare and Galway where Fianna Fáil were strong but where the population was increasing are those in which the Minister chose to take off seats.  The other areas where the population is decreasing and the Minister has maintained representation are those in which his own party or his own Coalition partners of Fine Gael are strong.</P>
    <P>You have this pattern consistently right through this Bill.  But perhaps the most grotesque instance of where the Minister failed to fulfil his proper constitutional duty in this Bill, which was not that of adapting constituencies for pure narrow party purposes, is the county of Cork.  If one examines the constituencies set out in this Bill for the county of Cork one finds that, taking the boundaries as a whole, no change is made on the previous redistribution.  There has been a great deal of criticism of the former redistribution by Mr. Kevin Boland, allegations not in any way justified by facts.  I do not know whether there was any gerrymander in the county of Cork on the previous occasion, certainly no such allegations have been made.  In any event, the Minister in framing the borders of <Col N="1404" /> Cork North-East, Cork South-West and Mid-Cork, left the boundaries exactly as they were.  Every little townland that was included five years ago is included again, the reason being of course that no changes were needed.</P>
    <P>The population of the constituencies of Cork city and county had remained almost unchanged.  The only thing that was required was a switch of perhaps 2 per cent of the population of Cork city into adjoining constituencies, because the population of the city had risen and therefore it was slightly outside the constitutional limits.  Instead of doing this the Minister, having left all the other boundaries unchanged, took an enormouse section right in the centre of Cork city and put it into Mid-Cork for the sole purpose, as far as one can see, of trying to establish a possible quota for a Labour candidate in Cork city.  Of all the changes made in this Bill this was the most outrageous. There has been no effort made either by the Minister or by any Senator opposite to justify this, or indeed to justify any of the sections in this Bill or any of the entries in the Schedule. One of the most remarkable things about the debate in this House on this Bill is that we on this side have put up reasoned arguments and amendments. We have discussed this Bill, section by section, line by line, entry by entry. Senators opposite, with a few exceptions, have remained silent.  It seems quite clear from their attitude that, while they hope to gain something politically from this Bill, they feel that it is utterly impossible to defend it as an instrument of justice.  They know as well as we do that the Minister in this Bill has not fulfilled his constitutional duty.  The Minister has not in any way acted as he should act, in a quasi-judicial rôle.  His duty in regard to a Bill of this kind is to fulfill the constitutional requirements and to make whatever changes may be required.  Above all, they know as well as we do, that the Minister has not in any sense fulfilled the task he claims to have set himself.  In his opening speech in both this House and the other House the Minister said he had done his best to avoid breaching <Col N="1405" /> the boundaries of counties and city boroughs and to avoid splitting communities of people.  Every section of this Bill shows that he has not done that and the long continued silence of Senators opposite shows more conclusively than anything I can say that they think the same.</P>

      <P>When this Bill passes&mdash;and it looks as if it will pass without any recognition whatsoever having been given to the most reasoned arguments put forward&mdash;I should like to suggest that the Minister sends copies of this Bill to all the political parties in the North of Ireland.  They are watching with interest what is happening to this piece of legislation here.  It is of special interest to them.  They have had to live in the North with gerrymandering and discrimination for the past 50 years.  I know that they regard this piece of legislation, and the manner in which it is being pushed through, as a backward step.  The Minister has turned back the clock 50 years.  He will not get off by saying that the Fianna Fáil Government did the same when they revised the constituencies.</P>
      <P>This Government, when they came to power, put themselves forward as the masters of fair play and as the talent and brains of the country.  They promised to open a new era in Irish politics.  Certainly, as one who lives quite close to the Border, I know that the root cause of all of the trouble there has been either gerrymandering or discrimination.  If those two causes were removed from the North then the whole northern problem would be solved automatically overnight.  At a time when people are desperately trying to bring about a solution and repair the damage that has been done by discrimination and gerrymandering, here we are adopting legislation that is a disgrace to anybody who would claim to be part of a democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, no matter what the speakers opposite say or what the political commentators say, will be seen as a measure which those involved in politics in the Six Counties would not touch with a 40-foot pole.  The Minister <Col N="1406" /> has put up the barriers, turned back the clock and made it politically impossible for reasonably-minded people in the North of Ireland to come in and join with the South.  The Minister has demonstrated that this is the most selfish legislation any government in the world, except perhaps a dictatorship, could put forward.  No Opposition amendment can be considered. The Minister and the Government will regret the day that they bulldozed this legislation through the House.  It will be thrown at them by those with whom they will be anxious to compromise and unite.  These people are not foolish enough politically to join with a party that would stand for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in regard to rural Ireland. I should like the people of rural Ireland to know that this Government have, by their manipulation of these constituencies, county boundaries and so on deprived the people of the western seaboard of representation, counties which, because of their numerical strength, would have had sufficient people to ensure that 30 Deputies could be elected, and yet by this manipulation the number has been cut down to 28.  There is a loss of two Deputies in that part of Ireland, a part of Ireland that needs representation in both Houses of the Oireachtas and needs, if anything, excessive representation.</P>
      <P>In Roscommon it takes 21,000 to elect a Deputy but in Dublin city it only takes 19,000.  I want to register a protest in this regard.  I should also like to register a protest regarding the fact that we in the province of Ulster are losing two seats in this transaction. The Minister has made no attempt whatever to justify in any way why he did not make Cavan a three-seat constituency and Monaghan a three-seat constituency.  The Minister has refused point blank to accept any of the amendments we have put forward.  He has also carved up County Clare which, with the addition of 2,000 voters, could have been a four-seater; but the Minister has made it a three-seater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not been consistent <Col N="1407" /> in any of his arguments.  He has treated shabbily and with scorn all our amendments.  Indeed, he said at one stage of the debate that he was not prepared to alter one syllable. That is the type of treatment we have received.  We are not worried about it politically.  We, as a party, will take them on in the next election.  What we are worried about is the fact that, because of the manner in which the constituencies are now divided, the people of rural Ireland will be losing representation irrespective of whether they are for Fine Gael, Labour or Fianna Fáil.  We do not like to see the rural areas of Ireland losing representation in the national Parliament.</P>

      <P>If an independent commission is introduced in the near future, as has been promised by the Minister, this will be the last Electoral Bill of this type to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  To that extent the Minister will have a place in history as having introduced the last Electoral Bill.  It seems to me a great pity that, if that is the case, his image should be such a poor one when this Bill is looked back on.  It will probably be believed in years to come that a commission was set up because of the inequities and distortions in this Bill.  If that is the case, certainly the Minister's image will not be a very good one.  When I talk about a commission, of course, I am merely relying on what the Minister has said.  As I mentioned earlier the gap between what the present Government say they will do and what they do gets wider and wider as every month passes.</P>
      <P>It is a pity this Bill does such injustice to the sparsely populated rural areas.  This is a point that has been made again and again but it cannot be made too many times.  The Bill merely increases the difficulties of communication which exist between Deputies and their constituents.  An opportunity was there to do otherwise and in spite of all the arguments which were put forward advantage was not taken of that opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a shame that such a gross injustice <Col N="1408" /> should have been done to Clare.  It has not been done for any good reason but merely to help a lame political dog over the stile.  It is deplorable that Cork should have been carved up in the crude and completely unnecessary way in which it was done.  Again, this is an example of something which appears to have no justification and which was quite unnecessary.  It is one thing where some change has to be made and one does not agree with the particular change that was made, but in this case it was a question of a change being made where no change at all was necessary.  For that reason it is particularly deplorable.</P>
    <P>It is quite extraordinary and inconsistent, lacking any principle or policy or pattern, that whereas in Dublin three-seaters seem to be imperative and all the arguments were in favour of them, in the second largest city in the country where the same arguments should have applied, apparently three-seaters were all wrong and the three-seaters that were there were removed.  It is impossible to justify that, to explain it or to stand over it. The explanation of it is a sordid one to which the Minister could not admit.</P>
    <P>There was an opportunity in this Bill to allow proportional representation work in a fuller way than it has in the past in certain areas.  Although I was not an enthusiast for PR, those who were enthusiasts, and that includes the two parties forming the present Government, and the Minister who brought in this Bill, did not avail of this opportunity.  This could have been done in Dublin by having bigger constituencies.  Instead, the exact opposite has been done.  We have three-seaters in Dublin, the one place where the essence of PR, that is a situation of having large constituencies and letting smaller sections of the community have representation, was not availed of for reasons which have not been explained to the satisfaction of any &ldquo;impartial observer&rdquo;&mdash;to use a phrase the Minister introduced.</P>
    <P>There is no use going over all these things again except to deplore the injustices and inconsistencies which run <Col N="1409" /> right through this Bill.  In the long run what has been done in having three-seaters all over Dublin is something to which I do not object because I do not enthuse about PR and it will have a very healthy effect on the political system in this country. When the tide of reaction against the Government which is already running reaches a flood, there is no doubt that in almost every constituency in Dublin Fianna Fáil will get two out of three seats.  Political commentators in the future will wonder what a Labour Minister of the day was doing in having three-seaters in Dublin.  By then it will be too late.</P>

      <P>Having failed to persuade the Minister and the Government to accept our Fourth Stage amendment, and having heard what the Minister, through his Parliamentary Secretary, said and admitted today, it appears to be a waste of time, my time, and the time of all the Members of this House to say much more. It now transpires, in the opinion of the Minister and of the Leader of this House, that our proposal relating to Clare was a reasonable, reasoned and constructive one, as also were some of the other amendments proposed by us.  Indeed the Parliamentary Secretary, reading from what was obviously a prepared brief, admitted that the Minister would have considered them if these amendments were put forward at an earlier stage.  I do not know what he meant by an earlier stage&mdash; whether he meant in the other House or at an earlier stage in this House. He stated that it was now too late to consider them.  As Senator Lenihan very eloquently and correctly pointed out, this is an appalling reflection on this House.  I endorse every word Senator Lenihan said about the Minister's admission.  What the Parliamentary Secretary said, on behalf of the Minister, was an insult to this House and to every Member on every side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister agreed that he would have considered amendments which only involved marginal changes, as in the case of our amendment today.  I should like to ask, as I have asked already, why in that case the Minister did not accept our amendments in <Col N="1410" /> relation to the city of Cork, where, without any breach whatsoever of the borough boundary, he could have retained the two three-seater constituencies in Cork city.</P>

      <P>The same argument would apply to Mid-Cork.  The same argument applies even more cogently to the amendment which was debated here today.  I am the only Senator from that area who has dealt with this matter in the Seanad.  We have a Senator from the city of Cork, Senator Quinlan, and I should like to hear his view on the making of a five-seater in the city of Cork.  I am sure he will not disagree with what I have said and with what many other people, including Members of the Oireachtas, have said.  I asked the Minister repeatedly last week to offer a reasonable explanation for what he did in Cork, and in replying he did not offer me or anybody else any explanation, even an unreasonable one.  He refused completely to address himself to the topic.  He made reference to Deputy Molloy when he was Minister, but he refused to deal with the specific questions I put to him.</P>
      <P>I am now asking the Minister if there is any explanation for the way in which he arranged these three constituencies other than to provide a seat for a member of his own party and to try to consolidate the position of his own party in those three constituencies. The general public and the people of the constituencies involved are entitled to some kind of an answer and explanation.</P>

      <P>When this Bill is passed tonight no doubt toasts will be drunk in the Fine Gael and Labour rooms of this House and in Glengall Street, Belfast.  Fine Gael and Labour, and the supporters of Glengall Street, have a common interest in this legislation. It is the most disgraceful legislation introduced since the foundation of the State.  It has been introduced by a week, inept, undemocratic Government, whose only purpose in putting this legislation before this <Col N="1411" /> House is to provide the means by which their weakness can be overlooked by the electorate and by which they can be re-elected in time to come.</P>
      <P>This legislation was put before us by a Government which could be described as a Labour tail wagging a Fine Gael dog.  One has only to study the legislation to realise that in Dublin city and Dún Laoghaire, the Labour tail wagged effectively but that in rural Ireland it gave way to the Fine Gael Dog.  In Dublin city and county the Minister has taken the precaution of ensuring a strong bonus for Labour but in rural Ireland he has given the bonus&mdash;he thinks&mdash;to Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>Before the Fine Gael Members of the Oireachtas drink too many toasts tonight I should like to ask them to study very carefully what this legislation could mean to them.  The wealthy element in the Fine Gael&mdash;and there are many&mdash;only want to be associated with Labour until such time as it becomes unnecessary.  As far as they are concerned, the shorter the term the more suitable it would be.  The Minister for Local Government in this legislation is attempting to ensure that never again in the history of this State will Fianna Fáil get an overall majority.  But the Minister is shrewd enough to realise that Fine Gael only agreed to an alliance with Labour as a very last resort; and if they had any possible chance of securing an overall majority on their own they would not touch the Labour Party with a 40-foot pole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party know this, the Minister for Local Government knows this.  So we find in this legislation that he has taken steps to ensure that not along will Fianna Fáil find it difficult to secure an overall majority in the future but that Fine Gael will never get such a majority.  Labour have written into this legislation a charter guaranteeing that if there ever is a Government other than Fianna Fáil elected in this country they must be part of it.  I would say that despite this legislation, despite the gerrymandering that has occurred, Fianna Fáil will face the electorate with confidence in the future and with confidence that the <Col N="1412" /> people of this county will give their true and just answer to the Government for this misdeed and their other misdeeds during the last 12 months.  I also would say with confidence that as a result of this legislation Fine Gael will never be elected as a single party Government.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that in the year 1974 any Government in this country should consider it necessary to put before the Houses of the Oireachtas undemocratic legislation such as we have before us tonight.  I believe that not alone is it undermocratic but that it is unconstitutional.  In his speech on the Second Stage the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The population of each constituency shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from studying the explanatory memorandum issued to us that that is not the case, that the population of the constituencies vary drastically.  The Minister also stated:</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that these provisions mean that it is not sufficient to have equality of representation at the time of the 12 yearly review.  This equality must, as far as practicable, exist at all times.</P>
    <P>I submit that that equality of representation which may have existed when the census was taken in 1971, does not exist today as a result of the growth in population in certain centres, particularly in the Sligo town area and in County Donegal.  It is not stated anywhere in the High Court ruling of 1971 that that equality must exist only at times when the census is taken.  That ruling clearly states that that equality must exist at all times.</P>
    <P>If this case was tested in the High Court it could be proved beyond doubt that in the Sligo-Leitrim constituency, for example, the population has risen to such an extent that the ratio per Member is in excess of the 21,123 persons laid down by an earlier High Court ruling.  In Sligo-Leitrim the population ratio per Member is 21,010, which is only 113 people fewer than the maximum allowed by the High Court.  This means that if the population of Sligo town increased by more than 300 people since 1971 <Col N="1413" /> the ratio per Member today has gone beyond the maximum.  When one considers the growth of Sligo town, the industrialisation of that town in 1971, 1972 and 1973 and the number of new factories provided there, it would not be difficult to achieve an increase in population in that area of more than 300 people.  I am convinced that if the numbers were counted now it could easily be established that the population of the Sligo-Leitrim constituency has increased by at least 1,000 people in three years.</P>
    <P>The same situation applies in County Donegal where for years, since the Famine, our greatest curse was that of emigration.  During the last three of four years there has been a marked changed of pattern.  This has taken place for two reasons.  First, the availability of more jobs and the desire of more people to remain at home.  Secondly, the economic situation across the water and the lack of employment there has discouraged people from emigrating.  If we look at the figure of the population ratio per Member for the Donegal constituency we will notice that the Minister has laid down that it takes 21,102 people to elect a Deputy.  That is only 21 people fewer per Deputy than the maximum laid down by the High Court rulling.</P>
    <P>This means that there has been a population increase of more than 105 in County Donegal, that the population ratio per Member exceeds that provided by the High Court and that this legislation, so far as County Donegal is concerned, is unconstitutional.  Since this census was taken in 1971 there has been a population explosion in County Donegal.  It is difficult to assess this from the register of electors because of the availability of the vote for 18 years olds.</P>
    <P>Even taking this into account it is clear that the population of this constituency has increased from 500 to 1,000 people, approximately, since this census was taken.  If that is so I suggest that the legislation before us tonight is unconstitutional.  I mentioned this point during the Committee Stage of this Bill but I failed to get a comment on it.  I <Col N="1414" /> should like to hear what the Minister has to say about it.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that legislation such as this should be considered necessary by any Irish Government in 1974.  I hope, no matter what Government is in office in future, that this is the last time such legislation will ever be put before us.  It is a definite attempt by the Government to gerrymander the constituencies in a most ruthless, arrogant and undemocratic way.  The only purpose was to ensure better representation for themselves in the future.</P>
    <P>I feel that the excuses made by supporters of this Government are simply not acceptable.  It is categorically and emphatically wrong to say that this legislation is necessary because of the Constitutional requirements of this country and because of the High Court decision in 1961.  It is true to say that legislation of some kind or another is necessary.  It is very wrong to attempt to confuse the people of this island by saying that the Constitution of the land laid down that two seats should be taken from the Western seaboard of this land and given to Dublin city.  The only reason two seats have been given to Dublin city is because the Minister and the Labour Party believe that those two seats will go to Labour.  The only reason why Dublin city has been turned into 14 three-seat constituencies is because the Minister, the Labour Party and their allies in Fine Gael are convinced that this Government in the future will win two out of three seats in each constituency.  If they had been left as four-seat constituencies the result in most cases would have been two seats for Fianna Fáil and two seats for the Government. This would have been a democratic result and would indeed have reflected the wishes of the Dublin city electorate.  The voting pattern or percentages between Fianna Fáil and the parties comprising the Government would have very little between them.</P>
    <P>For Fianna Fáil to win two seats out of four would have been a fair and democratic result.  This Government, in order to maintain themselves in office and in order to ensure reelection <Col N="1415" /> on the next outing, obviously were not interested in democracy. They were interested only in getting in Dublin city a two-to-one result, which is completely out of proportion with the voting patterns.</P>
    <P>Once again I make a strong and emphatic protest at the reduction in value of the country man's votes in comparison with those of the people living in Dublin.  In order to secure this gerrymander and to give three seats to Dublin South-East the Minister was fit to adopt a population ratio per Member which is practically the minimum allowed by the High Court ruling.  We find in the three-seat constituency of Dublin South-East that the Minister and the Government are satisfied to have 19,292 people electing a Deputy in that constituency.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of County Donegal it will take 21,102 people to elect a Deputy.  It will take almost 2,000 people more in County Donegal to elect a single Deputy than in the constituency of Dublin South-East. This, to my mind, suggests that in County Donegal almost 10,000 people have been disenfranchised by this Government.  The Minister has previously denied that this is so, but the explanatory memorandum is there, the figures are there and the population ratio per Member for each constituency is there for all to see. Anyone with an sense of fair play and justice must acknowledge that it is painfully obvious in the city of Dublin, in many constituencies, it takes 2,000 people fewer to elect a Deputy than in the north-western portion of this country.</P>
    <P>That has been done for one reason and one reason only.  It was done to give this Government a two-to-one majority in this city.  The Minister has stated that the electorate judge a Government on their record and that if they approved a good Government they would be elected again. The Minister said that if the people believed they were a bad Government they would be defeated.  The Minister is in public life much longer than I am.  He knows, and I know, <Col N="1416" /> that in this country the family voting pattern remains the same.  While there are signs that this is changing in regard to the younger generation the facts are that throughout the length and breadth of this country many people still vote the way their fathers and mothers voted.  Many people still vote the way their grandfathers and grandmothers voted.  The Minister must know that in his own constituency in County Meath there are people who would vote for Labour and vote for him no matter how bad this present Government prove to be.</P>
    <P>While I say that there is definite evidence that the pattern is changing in regard to the younger generation, it will take another decade in this country for any dramatic changes in this field.  I believe the Minister knows that as well as I do.  The Minister knows perfectly well that in the city of Dublin the voting patterns will not change all that dramatically, although I would say that they will change more quickly here than in the rest of the country.  For that reason the Minister is smug and happy to have a situation where the constituencies, particularly in Dublin city, are so devised and divided in three-seat constituencies that they ensure a two-to-one majority for his Government.</P>
    <P>Objections to the proposal to have Dún Laoghaire a four-seater constituency have been raised many times during the course of this debate.  The excuse given at all times has been that 43 cannot be divided by three evenly.  Forty-two could have been divided by three.  While I realise it would not be in order for me to discuss anything that is not in this legislation at this state&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and while I realise I cannot develop the point I would like to make, nevertheless I am entitled to lodge a strong protest because the constituency of Dún Laoghaire has been made a four-seat constituency.  It has been left a four-seat constituency because the Minister <Col N="1417" /> and his Government realised that if they were to follow the pattern in the rest of the city of Dublin a definite loss for either Fine Gael or Labour would have been recorded.  They knew, in their wisdom, that Fianna Fáil could not possibly have lost in this constituency and that the loss would have been a definite one for either Fine Gael or Labour.</P>
      <P>It was not one of the Minister's priorities in drawing up the constituencies to devise them in such a way as to prove a loss for either Fine Gael or Labour.  His list of priorities were clear and simple.  Only constituencies which would mean a loss to Fianna Fáil were to be tolerated.  Only constituencies which would result in a Fianna Fáil Deputy losing his seat were to be drawn up.  If a situation were to arise where there was the remotest chance of either a Fine Gael Deputy or a Labour Deputy losing his seat, then that situation was not to be tolerated.  We find that the constituency of Dún Laoghaire&mdash;the Minister at some stage reminded me that he had gerrymandered Rathdown&mdash;has been left a four-seater.</P>
      <P>The constituency of County Donegal now becomes a five-seater.  I am sure it will be a source of great joy to our Unionist friends in Derry, Tyrone, Fermanagh and Belfast to be in a position in the future to point out to those who would accuse them of undemocratic practices during the last 50 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that the truth hurts.  I realise that some of these people on my right deep down in their hearts feel guilty that these undemocratic principles are being flouted in this country, and that deep in their hearts it is a source of pain to them.  It will be a source of great joy to the Unionists in Northern Ireland to say that there is a Government in Dublin, and a Minister for Local Government who introduced legislation in Dáil Éireann, depriving the people of County Donegal of a necessary voice in Dáil Éireann.  We now have a situation where a Deputy residing in Inishowen has to travel 120 miles through the county of Donegal to meet his constituents.  When one considers that that is as far as the distance from the city of Dublin to the city of Limerick, and as far as the distance from the city of Dublin to the boundaries of County Galway, I do not think that we can be blamed for protesting very strongly to the Minister.</P>
      <P>In any legislation it is the people of the country who should be given consideration. In any legislation it it the people who should really matter. While the new constituency of County Donegal will be a burden on the five representatives in the future it will be a much greater burden on the 105,000 electors.  Many of these people live in the coastal areas of that county and on the islands off the coast, such as Tory Island, Inisbofin and Aranmore, right down to Donegal Bay.  It will be a physical impossibility to give those 105,000 people the representation to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should realise that 100,000 Donegal people are entitled to at least the same representation as the people in the city of Dublin, in the county of Louth or in the county of Meath.  In order to satisfy the desires of his Government, the Minister is denying the people of Donegal the representation to which they are justly entitled. He has gone about it in a most undemocratic manner.  During the discussion on the Bill the Minister tried <Col N="1419" /> to tell us that in the future a person in County Donegal would be represented by five Deputies instead of three as in the past and that this was an improvement.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's job to defend his legislation to the best of his ability.  I must say that he did just that.  He fought his corner and fought it well. He came in to do a rough and tough job and he did it.  That Fianna Fáil believe it was an unjust and undemocratic job did not appear to worry him in the slightest.</P>
    <P>To suggest that the people of Donegal are better represented or will be better represented in the future than comical for words.  If the Minister mical for words.  If the Minister really believed that, he could have grouped Louth and Meath together and made them a seven- or eight-seat constituency.  He must realise that at this moment County Donegal is represented by six Deputies in Dáil Éireann.  As a result of his knife, as a result of his gerrymandering, only five Donegal men will be in Dáil Éireann comical for words.  If the Minister believes that that is an improvement for Donegal, all I can say is that he is obviously anticipating the defeat of one of the Fine Gael Deputies.  The boundary was drawn in County Donegal in the most dramatic manner&mdash;I find myself back in the town of Ballintra. While it may be repetition, I would invite the Members of this House to study carefully the map of the Donegal constituency and the boundary line between that and Sligo-Leitrim.  I certainly will get a photostat copy of that boundary line.  I believe that in south Donegal and in Sligo-Leitrim it could be used very effectively in the forthcoming local elections as a master example of the Minister's gerrymandering.</P>
    <P>As I said before, if there was such a thing as an Oscar for gerrymandering then the Minister for Local Government should win it on the Ballyshannon-Ballintra road.  Here we have his best performance in any constituency. One can leave the town of Ballyshannon while going into Donegal, drive for three or four miles <Col N="1420" /> in the Donegal constituency and then find oneself in Sligo-Leitrim for another three or four miles, and then return to Donegal constituency again. When one arrives in the town of Ballintra one finds that once again one is only 100 yards from Sligo-Leitrim. That beats all.  I am sure the people in Belfast responsible for the gerrymandering in Newry, Derry, Armagh and other places must consider our Minister for Local Government an absolute genius at gerrymandering, because he has taught them a lesson in this art.</P>
    <P>The Minister did this for one reason only: to ensure that the Fine Gael Deputy living in the town of Ballyshannon will be retained in the Donegal constituency.  As I said on the Second Stage, this, in all fairness to the Minister, was not his original intention.  The Minister did not intend driving through the Ballintra road and crossing it several times.  He intended drawing a straight line in the town of Ballintra and putting the town of Ballintra and the southern portion of Donegal, including Ballyshannon and Bundoran, into Sligo-Leitrim.  This would have meant that the lower part of Leitrim would have gone into Roscommon-Leitrim.</P>
    <P>Here again the Minister had problems.  If you study the explanatory memorandum, you will see that these three constituencies have the highest population ratio per Member in this country.  They are very close to the constitutional requirements of the 1971 census.  The Minister could not afford to give any more to the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim or Roscommon-Leitrim. The population ratio for Roscommon-Leitrim is 21,119, only four less than the maximum allowed.  If the Minister has devised Roscommon-Leitrim in such a way that there would have been ten extra people per Member, then not alone would we suspect that the legislation would be unconstitutional, we would know and even the Minister would know that it was.</P>
    <P>The Minister's initial plan was to cut off Ballintra and the most southern portions of Donegal and put them <Col N="1421" /> in with Sligo-Leitrim.  I do not intend weighing in great depth the reasons why he was forced to change his mind except to say that Deputy White of Ballyshannon in no uncertain terms told the Minister that it simply was not on.  The Minister suitably obliged, because Deputy White was not having any of it.  We find that instead the Minister is crossing the Ballyshannon-Ballintra road very often, and his excuse during the Second Reading debate was that this was a district electoral division established over 100 years ago and it was necessary for him to do what he did.  Naturally I did not expect the Minister to stand up here and admit that he had to change this area, that he had to ravage this road in the manner in which he has done, to satisfy the whims of one of the Fine Gael Deputies. We have the most unusual road in this entire country.</P>
    <P>There have been plans in the Department for some years to carry out major reconstruction works on the national primary road from Ballyshannon to Donegal town.  It would be interesting, if it became necessary in the future, to have questions asked in the Dáil about this particular portion of that national primary road.  We could have a situation where the five Deputies from Donegal would ask questions about two-thirds of it and the three Deputies from Sligo-Leitrim would ask questions about the remainder.</P>

      <P>No.  I just said I am in the mood to be repetitious, and that covers a multitude.  I could deal with aspects of this Bill for every constituency without being guilty of repetition, but what is the point?  It is quite clear that the legislation before us, because of the majority the Government <Col N="1423" /> have, is going to go through and that the Minister is not prepared to change one iota of it.  We on this side of the House could speak for a week on the subject.  No matter what appeals we made, it was glaringly obvious that they would not be accepted by the Minister or by the Government, because this legislation is a package deal.  It is quite clear that when it received its blessing in the Fine Gael and Labour rooms the message was a simple one: not another change.  The Minister got his instructions that, no matter what the case might be, no matter what suggestions would be made, they were not to be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity, because as a result of this legislation there will be one Donegal man fewer in Dáil Éireann and there will be one Cavan or Monaghan man fewer in Dáil Éireann. That is probably the greatest mistake of all, that this tiny little portion of the province of Ulster, consisting of the counties of Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, should be deprived of two Deputies.  No matter what the Minister might say, the facts are that at this moment Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan are represented by 12 Ulstermen and that, as a result of this legislation, in the future Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan will be represented by ten.  This takes place so near the other portion of Ulster, where for so long the politicians were accused of practices similar to those which the Minister has introduced in this Bill, that it is obviously a source of tremendous consolation to them.  In the future when they have to attempt to justify themselves they have not to point to Galway, to Cork or to Dublin.  They need only point to County Donegal, County Cavan and County Monaghan and say, without fear of contradiction from anyone prepared to tell the truth, that there is a Minister for Local Government in Dublin and a National Coalition Government in Dublin who gerrymandered these three counties in such a way that two seats have been taken from them.  They will give the clear and emphatic reasons why this was done.  I said earlier, and I am not sure <Col N="1424" /> if the Minister was here when I said it, that a photostat copy of this map should be of tremendous political advantage to Fianna Fáil in the coming local elections.</P>

      <P>This disgraceful legislation is the work of a Government whose members claim to be just and talented.  To me it is quite clear that the talent must be very scarce because injustices of this kind will not be tolerated forever.  The electorate in due course will realise the seriousness of the legislation before us.  The day is not too far distant when many members of Fine Gael and Labour will realise that this legislation was their greatest mistake.  History will record that the fortunes of the National Coalition Government began noticeably to wane following the passing of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill of 1973.  If it should become apparent that this legislation is responsible or will prove responsible for the downfall of this Government, then I would advise the Minister to keep looking behind him.  Those who cheer him on might attempt to have him dealt with at a later stage.</P>

      <P>They will have a say in it, too.  The Minister is a political animal and self-preservation comes first.  He has seen to it that there is a nice constituency in County Meath.  I would not object if the Minister when arranging the constituencies along the eastern seaboard had given the same type of representation as he has done in the west.  This is one of the most unjust results of this Bill.  It is obvious that the eastern seaboard has been given an unfair and an unjust bias solely because it is politically beneficial to the Coalition Government.  We are coming to the last run-in.  We have described this Bill as the most undemocratic ever introduced in this State.</P>

    <P>I consider it to be unjust, unfair and despicable.  It has been rammed down the throats of the Houses of the Oireachtas and rammed down the throats of the people by an obviously weak, inept and undemocratic Government. In due course the people will realise this and when that happens they will give their answer in no uncertain terms.  It would be wrong for the supporters of the Government to think that because they have this legislation on the Statute Book they are in office for all time.  The reaction among Fianna Fáil supporters is that this legislation has given us a desire to fight this Government even harder.  We will carry that fight not <Col N="1428" /> alone through the local elections but also into the next general election. When that election comes, despite the gerrymandering efforts of the Minister and his Government Fianna Fáil will return to office.</P>

We did not get a logical answer to our logical questions.  The records of the House will show that we tried earnestly to make a constructive contribution <Col N="1429" /> on this Bill.  Most Senators on this side of the House were disappointed that we were not told by Members of the Opposition whether what we were saying was right or wrong.</P>
      <P>There are five-seat constituencies in Donegal County and Cork city.  But the principle of having three-seat constituencies applied in Dublin was not applied in Cork city because a major portion of that city was taken out and put in with the county of Cork.  We have had two pages of amendments concerning the situation in Clare-Galway.  The Minister is aware that our amendments on Report Stage today are again constructive amendments.  I am sure he is aware, too, that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Leader of the House agreed they were constructive amendments. Yet no effort was made to meet us in any way on any of those amendments.</P>
      <P>Of course I can grasp why one section of the National Coalition in this House today said that the amendments were reasonable and logical.

      <P>I live 16 miles from Salthill and in the West Galway constituency. I am being relevant.  Senator Boland is not.  If Senator Boland has travelled to Salthill and knows where it is, he understands exactly why we have tried to make West Galway a three-seat constituency: because Connemara and Galway city are a unit known throughout the length and breadth of this country and indeed throughout the world.  The Minister for Local Government saw fit in this Bill to change that.</P>
      <P>If Senator Boland has viewed the beauties of Salthill and not commented on them, that is his loss.  When we see beauty in Salthill we comment on it.  If there are irregularities in Salthill or in any other part of this country we comment also.  As public representatives, duly elected by the people, we are entitled to comment on irregularities as well as on beauty.  If Senator Boland, when he comes to Salthill, cannot recognise the beauty there, then he has nothing to do but phone me and I shall take him to Salthill and show him the beauty there in every sphere.  If he is jealous of the beauty in Salthill, he should be ashamed of himself.  He has rested his oars on the east coast all his life and he is not used to the beauty to be found at Salthill.  We would welcome Senator Boland and other critics and particularly the Minister for Local Government to come to Salthill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this abnormality between the west coast and the east coast.  The Minister begged pardon when he was dealing with the suggestions regarding the west of Ireland: he said he did not know much about the west of Ireland.  He asked permission of the House to use his brief a little more than he would in regard to other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious to me that Senator Boland is not used to coming to the west.  Maybe he could hitch a lift with <Col N="1432" /> the Minister for Local Government and I would show them what they have missed in the application of this Bill.  They have separated a people who have their own culture and who are known throughout the world as having that culture.  They have put them in with people for whom I am sorry also&mdash;the Clare people.  He has put them in with people with a different type of culture.</P>
    <P>Senator Boland made only a limited contribution to this debate.  The same applies to every other Senator opposite who spoke.  If they want to make a contribution to the debate rather than a contradiction of what I am pointing out, they should rise after me and do so.  Even at this late stage they may have some influence on the Minister for Local Government.  In particular the Fine Gael people in the National Coalition may have some influence at this late stage considering that the whole of Connacht, and particularly Galway, have seen the Minister's gerrymander in favour of Labour and against Fine Gael.  That I believe is an undeniable fact.</P>
    <P>When the Leader of the House rose today to try to defend the Minister his defence was by one means only&mdash;attack.  He attacked me about something that he claimed was correct. I am not going to inform the Leader of the House what was the correct situation in that case.</P>
    <P>There was in our party, as I am sure there is in every other Party, a little leniency too in such cases.  The eastern part of this country is now the place to be, rather than the western area.</P>

      <P>We had the situation in Mayo where we had a little more Fine Gael pressure than we normally would have expected when, to the detriment of Senator O'Toole, the senior, respected member of Fine Gael, Deputy Kenny, put pressure on the Government, and I am sure on the Minister for Local Government in particular to rearrange Mayo so that it would be arranged in his favour.  Of course, we know that is why Senator O'Toole has a little sore thumb in this House and, in fact, turns a little purple on occasions here when the plain facts are presented to him.  Even after the nice gentlemanly way he has received his seat in this House I am afraid it will be his last trip to this House and, in fact, his last chance of a trip to the other House, too, because Deputy Kenny, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, certainly saw to the ending of Senator O'Toole despite the fact that last weekend Senator O'Toole, in his efforts in Mayo, heard the deathknell&mdash;and I am sure played a major part in this of a local councillor who played a major part in the Fine Gael organisation but who has been extricated and eliminated from the county council election so that Senator O'Toole has the ground much clearer for himself in order to put forward a false idea that he may be elected at some distant date to this House.  That may happen but I can assure him it will not be in the next election which cannot be too far away when one listens to the statements of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who blames the world situation for our difficulties, while the Minister for Defence blames the civil servants for the present state of affairs. Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins will blame the &ldquo;Tullymander&rdquo; for her difficulties. If we have a general election in the near future it will be fought bitterly although it will be much harder for Fianna Fáil to gain a victory because of this absolute gerrymander that has been completed by the Minister for Local Government.</P>

I do not know if his loves are the same but his love for gerrymander is unequalled. His absolute execution of gerrymander will go down in history.  He may not be known throughout the world as as famous a man as was Napoleon but he will be known as a gerrymanderer supreme in common with all those great Northern people who have gerrymandered all their lives, who have been accused of it and who have not denied it.

      <P>The previous Minister was giving three-seat constituencies to West Galway and North-East Galway, to Clare and to Clare-Galway. That was a total of 12 seats. The Minister has admitted that he is only giving 11.  Therefore, he has made an utter fool of himself by bringing this alleged terrible evidence of the former Minister for Local Government to light and he has turned the muddy water on himself and made a very ludicrous situation out of the whole affair.  We will no longer have these threats made across either this House or the other House. The former Minister for Local Government gave an example to the present one.  If he so desires he may follow that example and, consequently, will be an honourable man leaving office in the near future. When statements have to be made daily about the Minister for Defence, and by the Minister for Finance, and through the Minister for Labour, we are truly in the muddled waters of the National Coalition Government.  They will not survive much longer.  This gerrymander is, I think, complete. The Minister will go down in history books as the man who executed the greatest gerrymander in the history of Irish politics.</P>

      <P>Thank you very much for reminding me.  Senator Killilea wanted one thing above all others in <Col N="1436" /> this Bill.  He said that he had no objection to my making an eight, 11 or a 13-seater for East Galway.  I do not think it would do him much good even if I made a 13-seater out of it. He seems to forget that the amendment which was discussed today and which was not included in the Bill suggested 11 seats for Galway and for Clare, not 12.</P>

      <P>On a point of correction, the Minister was not here and I should like to keep the record right. Parliamentary procedure dictates that you cannot move an amendment on Report Stage when it has been defeated on Committee Stage.  We were circumscribed on Report Stage on what to move as an amendment so we decided that the rational thing to do would be to concentrate on a simple rearrangement between the four-seater in West Galway and the three-seater in Clare as proposed by the Minister. We suggesed a four-seater in Clare and a three-seater in West Galway as being more appropriate to the territorial, administrative and natural regions involved.  This did not imply or mean any reflection whatever.  The Minister gets my point.</P>

      <P>In fact, as Senator Yeats so well knows, the reason I was not here was because I was engaged in the other House on very important legislation and I could not be in two places at the one time.  Three times a reference was made to the fact that I was not here.  However, I assure the Senators that I have a very good Parliamentary Secretary and officials who kept excellent notes.  I know everything that was said here although there was not very much said anyway.</P>
      <P>The debate already has taken over 60 hours in the Dáil and over 50 here. All sorts of points have been raised including a number of points of order.  Some of the points raised were good, some were bad and some were indifferent.  A revision of constituencies touches us all.  We are, as somebody said this evening, political animals.  Whether we are sitting Deputies or prospective candidates it affects us all and it is inevitable that there should be a certain amount of heat in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Bill has been criticised on a number of grounds, the first being that there was no provision in it for a constituency commission.  I <Col N="1438" /> explained the position about this on a number of occasions.  When I took office a revision of constituencies was overdue.  In fact, the preparations were being made to prepare such a revision and certain work had been done.  There was an obligation on this Government to get that revision under way and in the shortest possible time I did that.  I wanted to get it through the two Houses so that it would not be cluttering up and holding up other important legislation.</P>
    <P>I stated clearly in the debate here and in the other House that I am in favour of a commission for future revisions.  I am prepared to have discussion with the Opposition on this matter but I want to make it clear that the Opposition are not going to have it both ways.  They cannot do as they did before, be entirely opposed to it until it suits them and then they come out in favour of it. If they want it I am prepared to discuss it with them and if they do not want it let them say so.  I felt it was essential that we should put the place in order and now that we have a reasonable division of constituencies we can offer it to a commission.  It was said by one of the Fianna Fáil speakers on this debate that the Bill should not have been changed because the commission would have decided that the way it was, possibly, was the right way to leave it.  If one reads back in the debate one will see where that peculiar argument or not so peculiar argument was made.</P>
    <P>The Bill was criticised because some county boundaries continue to be breached for constituency purposes. I have explained the tolerance which is regarded as being permissible. We all agree that 1,000 one way or the other is pretty small and that the only way we could avoid breaching county boundaries was by creating constituencies of eight, 11 or 13 Deputies.  Senator Killilea wanted 13 but I do not think even that would do him much good.  It is clear that few, if any of us, would want 13, apart from him.  Even eight would be a bit big.  We decided that five was the maximum we should have.  Therefore that is the way it is.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1439" /> The Bill treats county boundaries much better than the 1969 Bill.  I want to make this very clear.  I also want to make it clear that Cork City which we have heard so much about, has reverted to what it was before the 1969 Bill and to what it was all down through the years.  Waterford, Louth, Meath and Westmeath are all being restored as counties.  Roscommon and Leitrim are faring better than they did previously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>But not Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not the Coalition who broke the boundaries and put Clare a three-seater, it was Fianna Fáil.  They deliberately made it a three-seater and the only time they found that they would like to have it a four-seater was after they had gone out of office because in the proposals which had been made it was a three-seater. Senator Killilea may be assured that the proposals which were there were for another three-seater for Clare.  For goodness sake do not let us have any more childishness about this.  Fianna Fáil wanted a three-seater, the only reason they want a change is because they are out of office.</P>
      <P>Like a good many other things when Fianna Fáil went out of office they found that it was a good idea to have something different, but as long as they were able to do it themselves they did not want it.  As I pointed out before, what happened about the commission is that one minute after Fianna Fáil had conceded the general election Deputy Jack Lynch was prepared to agree that a commission was a good thing.  For goodness sake let us not hear any more about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been alleged that the Bill is favouring Dublin as against the rural areas.  I pointed out that the balance is, if anything, slightly in favour of the country.  In Dublin each Deputy will represent 20,142 people while in the whole country the ratio will be 20,116.  It is not my fault if any Senator cannot subtract one from the other and know the difference.  Those are the facts and, as I said before, Senator Killilea was not really good on figures unless they had bikinis on <Col N="1440" /> them and then he put a motion down at the county council to have them chased out of the county.</P>

We are told we should have three-seaters where we have five-seaters and <i>vice versa.</i>  Some said we deliberately put three-seaters where Fianna Fáil would have won if there were four- or five-seaters, and then, when we put in five-seaters we were told we did that to damage Fianna Fáil.

      <P>We had, of course, charges of gerrymandering.  This kind of charge could be made about any revision.  I should like to mention something which Senator McGlinchey said.  This Senator is not, apparently, aware of the fact that there has been a change in the North because, he talked about the Unionists in the North taking example and that they would, in future, be able to refer across the Border.  The Unionists in the North, as he should know, are no longer fixing the constituencies no more than Fianna Fáil are fixing them here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last time the constituencies were revised they were revised by the then Minister for Local Government, former Deputy Kevin Boland.  He deliberately stated, as we all know, the reason he did it.  The idea of saying that this is a gerrymander and <Col N="1442" /> that the Simon Pures of Irish politics who are sitting in the Fianna Fáil benches would not do anything like that at all is all wrong.  They have been doing it all their lives and now when somebody else is trying to make a good job of it they are afraid of their lives.</P>
    <P>The charges of gerrymander will always remain about any revision.  I have said it is an emotional subject and that some people may feel they have been badly treated by the changes, but some Fianna Fáil Deputies said I treated them better than their own man.  I assure them that I had no intention of fixing them.  One Senator did say he was very grateful for the change that was made, but he must have been courtmarshalled that night because he attacked me viciously the next day.</P>

      <P>In cooler and less emotional moments we will have to admit that under our system of PR and with the very tight rules about parity of representation, gerrymander, as it is normally understood, is to all intents and purposes impossible. When we were in Opposition we said to Fianna Fáil that it was a gerrymander.  Gerrymander, I believe cannot be used under proportional representation and to those who say, as some of the Senators here pointed out, that we would need five-seaters all over the country or upwards in order to work proportional representation properly, I say that it is only a half truth.  It is not a truth.  With a three-seater, as long as there is a transferrable vote, proportional representation of a kind works.  The Irish system of proportional representation has worked.  There is no point in people trying to make out that there is something peculiar about all this.</P>
