      <P>I wish to be very brief, because I think I covered most of the field yesterday.  When the House adjourned I was discussing the question of the new measure in connection with taxation of farms.  Generally, listening to speakers on this Bill, one gets the impression that all the economic ills of this country, all the economic problems the we have before us in the everyday life of every citizen, are influenced entirely by the measures that the Minister for Finance introduces.  In fact, I have often heard it said that politics only influences or takes over what the financiers leave after them.  I believe there is a very large element of truth in this.  Naturally enough in modern democracy the Government and politicians are moving more towards greater control over the destinies of a country.  Still in connection with the whole agricultural problem I would like to point out that I notice in the report from the Central Bank that the Associated Banks contributed to Irish agriculture in 1974 a figure of £130 million.  This was only a small increase of £18 million on borrowings, in February, 1973.  At the same time, their lending to personal borrowers <Col N="1420" /> amounted to a figure of £158.3 million.  In the last year they increased that by £24 million, whereas lending to agriculture by the Associated Banks in the same period was increased by only £18 million.</P>
      <P>I say this to make the point that while the Minister for Finance can with his different legislation make readjustments on our economy and redirect it, I think that the banks and people in their position have a much greater influence on the trend of our economy than, perhaps, we realise. The agricultural sector in the most recent past has not been treated with the consideration that it deserves from banking interests in this country.  Unfortunately we have our banks which pay much lip service to the cause of agricultural expansion and, indeed, industrial expansion.  Particularly in agriculture, I find the average bank manager when approached by a farmer is much more influenced by what is commonly said in the circles of gossip, in the newspaper columns from day to day by individual reporters, who very often do not have all the facts, than by sound economic considerations and by detailed examination of what the problem is.  I have seen bank managers turn down farmers for loans because of what some columnist said in the paper a few days before.</P>
      <P>Banks, dealing on a national scale with an agricultural industry that is so important, employ a very small number of agricultural advisers, men whose sole job is to put up some sort of a window show for the agricultural industry; men who will go around to functions and be employed as public relations officers.  They are not in such numbers that they can study the agricultural problem of the individual farmer, not to mind being in a position to advise the bank on the broader national policy.  I feel that the sooner our banking institutions take the agricultural industry seriously the better it will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers have a grievance with the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  If they feel they have been wronged and that they have not got what they were entitled to, they can go to their <Col N="1421" /> public representative or to the local representative of the ACC.  They can have their case clarified and find out the reason for refusal.  They can meet the people who make the decision. Farmers in the past year have been severely pressured by banks.  They have found themselves in a most difficult position and have no recourse to anybody.  As always, the decisions were made by the faceless people who are completely out of the reach of the farmer or the farmer's representative.</P>
    <P>I think this is an important point and, regardless of what our Minister for Finance may do, these people in banking institutions have so much control that it is imperative that much more notice be taken of what exactly they are doing, and that there should be much more liaison and, if necessary, control over their workings, especially in times of crisis such as we have experienced in the past year.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that this whole question of taxation on farmers is a new measure.  It must be regarded only as a temporary measure.  It is only the introduction of an idea.  Before taxation on the farming community becomes the sort of reality that it must become in the future, future Ministers will have to take a new look at the subject.  They will have to look at the whole question of rating taxation on agricultural land. They will have to take into consideration the special problem of the agricultural community in times of crisis and fluctuation of prices.  The Minister has introduced a new idea.  I do not think that what he has done will reduce the capacity of the agricultural industry to progress and expand.  The amount of money which will be taken out of circulation will be minimal as a result of this legislation.</P>
    <P>No doubt as a result of the experience gained by the Department of Finance over the next few years in dealing with the agricultural community in relation to this legislation, new measures will be introduced.  This must be done in consultation with the agricultural community.  Some farm spokesmen have said that this legislation <Col N="1422" /> is a stab in the back to the farming community which is experiencing difficulties at present.  These people, like politicians, are seeking to make the headlines in order to enhance their own public image as guardians of justice for the agricultural community. They are not being very realistic in their outlook on this particular subject as to what the true situation will be as a result of this legislation.  It is understandable that at such a time they would seek to enhance their own reputations.  The vast majority of farmers will not find anything obnoxious about the legislation which has been introduced.</P>

      <P>Last night I listened to Senator McCartin refer to the moaning and groaning which was going on on this side of the House on this Bill.  A moment ago he referred to it again.  I sat on the other side of this House for 12 years and listened to many debates on this Bill.  I would recommend, that for his spiritual reading, Senator McCartin should go to the Library and read the speeches made over the years by the then Senator Gerry L'Estrange and in latters years, the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and the then Senator John Kelly.  If I were to take the trouble of reading Senator L'Estrange's speeches on the Finance Bill I would be provided with ample material with which to speak on this subject this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now 17 months since the Irish people, for reasons which many of them will never understand, elected this Coalition Government.  In studying the Finance Bill, 1974, we are given a golden opportunity of studying the record of this Government in the past and their plans for the future, whether that be short or long. We were led to believe that this was a Government interested in a just society.  On numerous occasions we were told they were a Government of tremendous talent.  If this Government had the talent they claim to have, then the Bill before this House would be very much better than it is. It is now becoming very clear to many people that while members of this Government may be talented in their <Col N="1423" /> own particular spheres, they have not yet mastered the art of governing.</P>
    <P>A plasterer or a painter does not learn his trade by reading books.  He must have a natural gift, very often handed down from father to son or from another member of the trade. The same could be said about politics. When one studies the state of this nation today and considers what has happened in this country in the last few months and what might happen in the next few, one must realise that while the Cabinet may consist of sound academics, good solicitors, good teachers, they simply have not got, and would appear not to be in a position to get, the knowledge of how to govern this country.</P>
    <P>Never since the foundation of the State has this House taken part in a debate on a Finance Bill at a time when the outlook in this country was more bleak than it is today.  Yet, the public relations exercise is such that many people have been given the impression that it was never so good in this land.  If we examine Department after Department, we find that they are in a state of chaos.  The Minister, in the course of his speech, tried to give the impression that the oil problem was responsible for all our ills.  I remember 1957 when the then Coalition Government fell, they blamed the Suez Canal, and in 1951 when the first Coalition Government fell they blamed the mother-and-child scheme. Listening to Senator McCartin and others it would appear that Members opposite are prepared to blame everything and everybody except themselves. It is true to say that oil and other outside sources are responsible for 50 per cent of the inflationary increases in this country in the last 12 months, but it is also true to say that this Government, through their own incompetence are responsible for the other 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Housing is probably the greatest example of this incompetence and inefficiency. I know that the Minister is quoted as having stated that sometime today he will make an announcement and, according to yesterday's <i>Evening Herald</i>, he promised good news for <Col N="1424" /> house purchasers and bad news for Fianna Fáil.  If the Minister really used these words I would like to know what he means by bad news for Fianna Fáil, because if the Minister makes an announcement that will ease this situation, that will improve the lot of people trying to purchase their own homes, that will retain at least some of the building workers in their jobs, then the Fianna Fáil Party, as a responsible Opposition, will naturally welcome it. If the Minister really wants to give good news to the housing industry at this stage, he must inject no less than £40 million into that industry.  I do not think that he or his Government should have waited until today, should have waited until the building industry was at its last gasp before making such an announcement.</P>
    <P>I read where the Minister said that there was no gold in Merrion Square. There was no gold in Merrion Square when Fianna Fáil were in office, but we never had such a problem in the building industry since the spring of 1957, when the last Coalition Government were in office.  I remember being told by people in the building industry 17 months ago, when this Government took office, that the first major crisis would be a housing one because the National Coalition Government simply did not know how to handle the housing situation in this land. When one reads yesterday's <i>Evening Herald</i> one understands how serious and how critical the situation is.  I should like to read a short extract from yesterday's <i>Evening Herald.</i>  It states that:</P>
    <P>Hundreds of building workers throughout the country will be laid off next week as the biggest recession ever felt in the home building trade begins to bite.  It is feared that it may be the start of a situation warned of by the Construction Industry Federation which forecast as many as 5,000 redundancies.  The men are being laid off by the giant Gallagher and McInerney companies as part of a running-down operation ordered after a dramatic sales slump in new homes.  They will receive their last wage packets as they go on holidays on Friday week <Col N="1425" /> and will be told that they will not be needed again until the industry picks up.  The Gallagher Group are laying off 500 men on sites in Galway, Waterford and Dublin. For the past six weeks there have been minor lay-offs but last week sales chiefs in the Gallagher Group ordered a big redundancy after studying new homes sales.  On the Templeogue site, run by the Gallagher Group, about 150 workers have already been laid off and a further 100 will be made redundant on Friday.  The sales staff of the group has been drastically cut and after the official holidays the six Gallagher sites in Dublin will operate&mdash;on skeleton staff only. Official spokesmen for the building trades are blaming the Minister for Local Government, Mr. Tully, for the forced lay-offs.  They say that if the Minister raised the level of local authority loans, they could get business moving again.  They point to sales figures of new houses during the last four months to back up their arguments.</P>
    <P>On one estate of 150 houses a home has not been sold since 1st April.  The houses, almost completed, are lying idle as hopeful buyers cannot raise the full price. In another area deposits for 150 houses were taken but only 50 people got their homes.  A spokesman for the building group involved said today that they were being crippled by the Minister's refusal to raise the amount of the SDA Loan.</P>
    <P>It is possible that the Minister later today may announce an increase in the SDA loan and if he does we will naturally welcome it.  However the question that we would ask is: &ldquo;Why, why, why wait until now?&rdquo; Why wait until the building industry is experiencing one of the greatest crises or the greatest crisis since the last National Coalition Government took office?</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Minister for Local Government has been boasting that in 1973 there was a record number <Col N="1426" /> of houses built.  That is quite true. There was a record number of houses built in 1973-74.  Apparently this Government believe that if they repeat this statement often enough the people will not take into consideration that Fianna Fáil were in office until 14th March, 1973, and that the plans and the money for most of these houses must have been provided when the Fianna Fáil Government were still there.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Minister, one would get the impression that on 15th March last he waved the magic wand and that suddenly 5,000 or 6,000 houses appeared throughout this country.  It is natural that in 1973-74 there should have been a record number of houses built as a result of good planning by the last Government. Halfway through that year it was obvious that plans for 1974-75 would be delayed.  We now have a very serious housing crisis.  In this Bill the Minister should have injected at least a further £40 million into the housing industry.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil the Minister refused to accept an amendment from Fianna Fáil to help the building societies to provide tax-free interest, up to a maximum of £5,000, to encourage people to invest.  This would have provided a tremendous incentive to people to put their money in the building industry. However the have-nots who are supporters of the Coalition&mdash;and particularly in the Labour Party&mdash;would not allow anyone to make money. The whole policy of this Government as enshrined in this Bill is that this should be a nation of poor people. Five years ago when the building industry was thriving, we continuously listened to the builders being lambasted by Fine Gael and Labour.  They were called Fianna Fáil hacks.  Everywhere we went we listened to charges about Taca and we were told that all the builders in the country were Tacamen. It was quite obvious that supporters of the present Government deeply resented the fact that there were builders in Ireland who made money.  We should never allow ourselves to forget that when builders are making money there is employment <Col N="1427" /> being provided for our people, and that the money these builders are making is ploughed back into Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I always got the impression, listening to members of the Fine Gael and Labour parties speaking on this subject, that they would have been far more content if the builders of Ireland were not making money. Apparently their wish is now being granted, whether by design or through the incompetence and ineptitude of the Government.  It would appear that for at least this year builders will not make money, and so we have reached the situation of a certain 5,000 redundancies and hundreds of houses lying unsold.  If the building industry collapses it is the duty and responsibility of the Government to put it on a firm footing again because this industry is one of the most important we have.  At the moment the maximum SDA loan is £4,500. Only a few years ago it was £1,600. At that time, in rural Ireland at any rate, houses cost from £2,000 to £2,500.  The borrower had only to find from £400 to £900.  Today houses are costing anything from £7,000 to £10,000.  It should be obvious to everyone that it is virtually impossible for most people to raise on their own initiative from £3,000 to £4,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance must realise there is no money available in this city at the present time.  I do not believe that even the Minister for Finance himself, if he wanted £5,000 to build a home, could get it in this city this morning.  Assuming that the Government decide to increase the SDA loans to a maximum of £7,000, we face another major problem as far as the borrower is concerned.  A borrower must pay £8.50 per month on every £1,000 borrowed over 30 years at 9½ per cent interest.  That was the last interest rate that money was lent at, in Donegal at any rate.  If a person were able to borrow £7,000 through an SDA loan, it would cost him £59.50 a month, or around £15 per week.  This is an astronomical sum for the average borrower to pay.</P>
    <P>We must remember that many of the people in rural Ireland who avail <Col N="1428" /> of these loans could wait and insist on being housed by the housing authority. Instead many of them use their own initiative and house themselves with the help of these loans.  I feel that more people would use their own initiative if they were given the proper encouragement by way of grants and loans.  It is not enough to say the loan should be subsidised, and heavily subsidised, by the State.  A man whose income is such that he qualifies for an SDA loan should be charged more than 3 per cent for that loan.  If that man does not build his own home and waits for the local authority to house him it will cost the State a lot more than 3 per cent to provide him with a home.  We are reaching the stage when it will be impossible for young married men in particular to repay these loans. Many of these men will decide that it is the responsibility of the State to house them; but if the Government were to subsidise this loan in the same way as they subsidise housing in general, it would be an incentive to these young men to provide their own homes.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand what I read in speeches from Government Deputies and their supporters and Senators about the great work that this Government have done in the field of housing.  I can only conclude that they believe that if you say a thing often enough some people might believe it.  In this field in particular the Government have failed dramatically in the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>The agricultural industry is also going through a major crisis.  Senator McCartin summed it up well when he stated that the level of farm incomes was so low that farmers have nothing to worry about so far as the tax proposals are concerned.  I remember meeting a few farmers a month or so ago and I reminded them of the march to Dublin when Fianna Fáil were in office.  I reminded them of the long hot days when they lay in Merrion Street.  I asked them why were they not doing this now.  They told me they could not afford to do so, that they have not the money to come to Dublin now and that they realise that under Fianna Fáil they were well off and well treated.  Now they realise that when problems arise <Col N="1429" /> in the agricultural industry we have a Government with little or no interest in one of our most important industries.  A study of the membership of the Cabinet reveals clearly that the Taoiseach did not know that there were any farmers in Ireland when he was picking his team.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Parliamentary Secretary who is present, he must have thought that the west was asleep. I have no doubt that the Parliamentary Secretary will keep the west awake.  I cannot understand that in the year when farming is at its lowest ebb, when the farmers are losing money hand over fist, when farmers are dejected and discouraged, that is the year the Government decide to tax them.  While we are told that it is only the big farmers who are being taxed it should be obvious to everyone that this is the thin end of the wedge.  Once this proposal is carried it will be very easy for the Minister to reduce the valuation limits as each year goes on.  Indeed, I feel that Senator McCartin was feeling the same when he was advocating a new look at the rates question before there is an advancement in any wider sense than what is in this Bill.  The only wider sense, as far as taxing the farmers is concerned, would be to reduce the valuation limits.</P>
    <P>I would not disagree with taxing farmers provided this whole question of valuations was revised.  Rates are a major problem for many farmers despite improvements brought in by Fianna Fáil.  In Donegal the land along the River Swilly is very heavily rated in comparison with land further away from it and I presume similar situations obtain throughout the country.  I think there is some historical reason for this.  Nevertheless this situation exists.</P>
    <P>Up to now, farmers had to pay this demand on their lands whether they were making money or not.  Naturally it is disturbing for them to realise that they may now be faced with a demand for income tax on top of these excessive rates demands.  I strongly disagree with the proposal in this Bill to impose tax on one year's working and not being able to carry losses in a <Col N="1430" /> particular year over to the next year. It is natural and understandable that the farmers caught in a tax net should justly claim that they should be taxed over a three-year period.  If investments they make in this financial year do not show a loss until two years' time, it is possible they would have great difficulty with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I presume that in order to tax the farmers their holdings, stock and machinery, would have to be valued, or at least that their valuations would have to be checked.  Who will carry out these checks?  Will it be a civil servant born and reared in Foxrock or Rathgar, who would not know the difference between a heifer and a bullock?  Or will it be someone qualified in this field?  I raise this matter because of some experience I have had of the health boards' assessments of farmers' incomes.  As Senator McCartin may recall, I tried to change the procedure at one stage under which this assessment is made. When I rang officials of the health board concerned for an explanation why a small farmer with ten or 12 cattle was refused a medical card, I was stunned to discover that the official concerned did not seem to realise that these cattle had to be bought and fed and indeed to be sold at a loss.  These officials simply looked at the newspaper and got the valuations of these cattle and decided that a small farmer on 40 acres of Donegal land with ten or 12 bullocks was so wealthy that he did not need or deserve a medical card.  If the same small farmer was in full-time employment he could earn for the number of children he had up to £28 per week and qualify for this card.  I got the impression that officials of the health board did not understand how to assess the incomes of small farmers and that is why I am wondering how the Revenue Commissioners will tackle this problem.  Perhaps the IFA should encourage more sons of farmers to go into the Civil Service, particularly the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Since this Government were elected we have been reminded of our interest <Col N="1431" /> in the poorer sections of this community. Indeed, reading some of the speeches on this very Bill in the Dáil one would think that Fianna Fáil did absolutely nothing for the poorer sections of this community.  I submit to this House that this Bill is not doing enough.  When one considers the inflationary increases, this Bill has left the pensioners worse-off than they were 12 months ago.  The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary can produce statistics, percentages and figures of one kind or another to suggest that this Government were the only Government to tackle the problem of social welfare recipients in a just manner but the pensioners have been treated most unjustly and many of them can barely exist on what they are being paid today.</P>
    <P>We have been told that in this Bill there is a 19 per cent increase in pensions.  The contributory old age pensioner, for example, has had his pension raised from £7.30 to £8.50 a week, an increase of 19 per cent.  The average inflationary increase has been estimated at 16.2 per cent.  Bread has increased by 20 per cent and biscuits have increased by 40 per cent.  Bread is the basic foodstuff most commonly used by the pensioner.  In the last 18 months the price of meat has leapfrogged time and again.  Does the Minister really believe that a pensioner living in a rented house could possibly exist on the princely sum of £8.50 per week?</P>
    <P>There is no point in his replying that that pension has been increased in this Bill by £1.20 and that under Fianna Fáil it was increased by 50p. Indeed, it did increase by £1 in one year.  As a result of the price increases the old age pensioner would have required an increase of at least £2.50 per week to compensate for the alarming increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>When I spoke to pensioners living in local authority houses, particularly during the local elections, I realised that the greatest social contribution made to the lot of pensioners was that which was made by Fianna Fáil when they introduced the rates exemption scheme.  As a result of that <Col N="1432" /> scheme many pensioners were saved over £1 per week in rates.  Not only were Fianna Fáil able to provide a scheme which saved the pensioners the £1 per week, but at the same time they increased their pensions from 50p to £1.  Therefore we could justly describe this incease as a miserable pittance. When I listen to some supporters of the present Government boasting about their great achievement in this field I think they are very much out of touch with the poor sections of this community.</P>
    <P>If one took the figure of £8.50 per week and priced the essential commodities required by the old age pensioner, one would realise that in 1974 a pension of £8.50 per week is an insult to those people who served this country well in days gone by.  The figures for poverty are alarming.  It is not enough for the Government to say that their increase in any one year is a record.  When Fianna Fáil were in office they introduced tremendous benefits for these people&mdash;free travel, free television licences, free electricity, the rates exemption scheme, the pay related scheme, improved health services and so forth. This was in addition to their pensions and increases.</P>
    <P>The only thing this Government are good at is public relations, selling their product, no matter how it is packed. If they can in any one year have a figure higher than Fianna Fáil, they hope the people will forget all the very useful schemes introduced by us when in office.  Considering Fianna Fáil's record in the social field, this Government of the Just Society and the so-called talents have failed miserably in this Finance Bill to stand by the pensioners, the recipients of disability allowances and so on.  At the same time they continue to shout loud and clear what they have done. This Government must accept responsibility for at least 50 per cent of the price increases which have taken place.  They have demonstrated clearly in this Bill that their intention in the future is to make the rich poor.  The economy would be in a much stronger position if this was not the policy of the Government.  It is bad enough <Col N="1433" /> to make the rich poor but worse when it is also the obvious policy of this Government to make the poor poorer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnan" hpid="Mr. Brosnan Mr. Brosnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I promise to be very brief and to confine myself solely to the provisions of section 59, the section which seeks to give powers to the Revenue Commissioners to obtain certain information about certain matters by compelling solicitors to disclose information they receive about their clients' affairs in the course of their professional duties.  As a layman, I regard this proposal as objectionable and, as a lawyer, I regard it as obnoxious because it is a blatant attempt to undermine one of the most basic fundamental principles of our law.  The Minister&mdash;who, unfortunately, is not with us at present&mdash;is well aware of the principle to which I am referring.  It is a principle which has been long-established and time-honoured and one which recognises the uniquely confidential relationship that exists between a solicitor and his client. The principle has been established over the centuries and it has been accepted, respected and practised by the members of the Minister's own profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this proposal the Minister attempts to breach this basic principle which goes to the roots of the practice and procedure of law in this country.  All communications between a solicitor and his client are privileged and protected by this unique relationship.  Never, except on very, very rare occasions, if any&mdash;I am open to correction in this&mdash;is a solicitor entitled, without his client's permission, to disclose any matter which he came by in the course of his professional dealings with his client.  There may be one exception that I can visualise and that is in the case of a solicitor acting for two parties in an action where the subject matter of the dispute was applicable to both the plaintiff and defendant. Perhaps, in a case like that, the solicitor could be compelled to disclose information received by him in relation to the particular dispute.  The Minister, through his advisers, or my <Col N="1434" /> colleagues Senator Robinson or Senator Eoin Ryan, may be able to assist me in that.  This relationship is sacred, much more so than even the relationship between husband and wife, between a doctor and his client and even between a priest and a penitent, because in all these cases, so far as I am aware, one party in many instances is compellable and competent to give evidence without the permission of the other party in a court of law.  That applies in the case of a doctor.  So far as I know, a doctor can be compelled to disclose matters relative to his patients.  In the case of a priest, if not in this country certainly in England, a priest can be compelled by law to disclose matters and information which he received in the confessional.  Only in the case of a solicitor in relation to his client is this very, very vital and important principle completely privileged and protected.</P>
    <P>I hope I am reading the part of the section I am concerned about correctly. At subsection (3) of the relevant section the word &ldquo;compellable&rdquo; is used&mdash;I do not want to read the whole section because I am concerned only about the word &ldquo;compellable&rdquo;&mdash;and I wonder if it is being used in the strictly legal sense because, if it is, it means that a solicitor can be compelled in law&mdash;he can be brought before the courts by way of <i>subpoena</i>&mdash;to give evidence in any of the matters mentioned in this section in relation to revenue prosecutions. Perhaps the Minister would inform me whether or not I am correct in construing the word &ldquo;compellable&rdquo; in that sense.  Having regard to that, it is not surprising that this proposal has caused such alarm, not alone in legal circles but among the general public.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the opposition of the Incorporated Law Society, of which he was a member, to this proposal and of their expressed determination to resist the implementation of this proposal.</P>
    <P>Another point which occurs to me about this section is the fact that there is no penalty provided for the failure of a solicitor or banker to comply with the provisions of this section.  I should <Col N="1435" /> like to know from the Minister how he proposes to deal with a solicitor who refuses to make these disclosures to the Revenue Commissioners.  I am sure there will be many who will refuse to make disclosures.  How does he intend to deal with them?  Does he intend to compel them by <i>subpoena</i> to attend the court and put them into the witness box to answer questions?  If they refuse to answer questions, how will they be treated?  Will they be treated as hostile witnesses or will they be committed to prison for contempt?</P>
    <P>These are matters about which I and many others, including the legal profession and members of the public, would like to hear more.  It is because the Minister knows well that this provision is frowned upon that has failed to provide any penalty or any sanctions for failure to comply with this provision? Is he afraid that the courts would be reluctant or incapable of implementing the provisions?</P>
    <P>In his budget speech, in his introductory speech on this Bill and on many other occasions, the Minister has promised fair and equitable tax reform.  The proposal in this section is neither fair nor equitable.  It is certainly not a reform.  It is a retrograde step and a very, very dangerous precedent.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this.  Members on this side of the House will put down amendments to the section.</P>

      <P>The provisions in this Bill are of the utmost importance to the country and to the community as a whole.  For the first time in our history, legislation is endeavouring to make income the criterion and the yardstick by which direct taxation should be measured.  It was regrettable to hear Senator after Senator and Members of the other House saying we should continue to keep a privileged class of wealthy farmers out of the tax net.  Let us be clear without any semblance of ambiguity what this Finance Bill says in relation to farmer and agricultural community taxation.  It clearly and unmistakably specifies farmers whose valuation is in excess of £100.  It is quite reasonable <Col N="1436" /> to assume that such people have, with some exceptions, a profit income in the main substantially in excess of vast numbers who have been subjected, and continue to be subjected, to income tax.  It is only realistic and it is elementary justice for any responsible Minister for Finance, or any responsible Government to close such escape loopholes in our tax legislation.</P>
      <P>The speakers in both Houses have clearly and unmistakably said that, in their opinion, these people should continue to remain outside the tax net.  They are entitled to argue in that fashion; it is their right.  But let there be no mistake about it: in our opinion it would be unjust and quite wrong to continue committing the ordinary wage- and salary-earner to carrying the main burden of income taxation, while people with incomes very substantially above these are continued in a privileged class.  The Minister and the Government have a responsibility to see that not only is justice done in this very important field of national taxation but that it is clearly seen to be done by ensuring that the yardstick is applied equally to all citizens.</P>
      <P>I have a good knowledge of the difficulties and problems of farmers. I come from a farming area and I have a farming background.  I know there are many thousands of farmers who will, because of income limitations, never come within the tax net but that is no reason why those who have the income and are within the range should continue exempt from their elementary duty to contribute to the national Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on this simplification of the tax code. Clear-cut figures are set out in respect of single people, married people, children, the housekeeper and the handicapped.  Up to this it required all the energies and intelligence of a legal man to decipher the taxation laws.  The change is to be commended. It was essential that every citizen should know clearly what the allowances were and what their rights were under the income tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGlinchey, while attacking <Col N="1437" /> the method of collection in so far as it rambled into the wealthy farmer situation, said that there should be a revaluation of land.  I wonder how enthusiastic are the small farmers in the west about revaluation of their holdings.  Through hard work and persistent effort over the years much land has been won from bog and mountain, but the valuation has not been changed.  I can assure Senator McGlinchey that, if there were an effort now or at any time to carry out a revaluation of this land, it would be very seriously and vigourously resented.</P>
    <P>Senator McGlinchey went on to complain of the inadequacies of the social services.  Nobody in the present Government has said that the social services are as adequate as they would like them to be but, at least, let us accept that within their short period of office, the Government have made a genuine effort to reform completely the inadequate social services, which had resulted in a situation in which a substantial number of people, mainly those in the social welfare recipient classes, were living below the poverty line.  Not only have the allowances now been increased but there has been a relatively wide expansion in the categories of people for whom provision is now made.</P>
    <P>Senator McGlinchey also said that the new pension rate of £8.50 for a non-contributor was entirely inadequate, but he failed to mention that that £8.50 has been, under this Bill increased by a further £3.80 where the wife of the pensioner is less than 68 years of age.  This is an important improvement in our social services. Furthermore that £8.50 is now available at the age of 68 years whereas under the Fianna Fáil Government the recipient would have had to attain the age of 70 in order to qualify.</P>
    <P>During the period of the Fianna Fáil Government many efforts were made to have the 70 years qualifying age reduced and we were repeatedly told that this could not be done. Within a year-and-a-half of the present Administration the 70 years <Col N="1438" /> has been reduced by two years to the immense benefit of a number coming within that category.</P>
    <P>The deserted wives, heretofore committed to the unfortunate principle of home assistance, and the unmarried mothers are now legitimately accepted as people in need and have the dignity and independence of receiving proper and reasonably improved social welfare benefits.  The parents of handicapped children have been brought into the social welfare code with an allowance of £25 per month in respect of each child.  These expansions and improvements are but a start in social reform, a social reform requiring substantial additional moneys from taxation.  It is against that background, this expansion and this development, that we have had speaker after speaker in this House, and in the other House, advocating that the wealthier farmers in excess of £100 valuation should still remain a privileged class by being exempt from the normal direct taxation that the farm labourers have had to meet down through the years.  Any situation where the labourer is committed to a taxation system while his employer is exempt is indefensible in 1974.  I congratulate the Minister for the start he has made in this Finance Bill in broadening the scope of the tax code and simultaneously amplifying it.</P>

      <P>The annual Finance Bill is the framework in which we decide each year the size of the national cake, where the ingredients come from and how it will be divided. In doing this we must examine the Bill in the light of the overall economic context.  I do not propose to echo the extravagant style of that eloquent profit of doom&mdash;Senator McGlinchey&mdash; but I think that all of us must realise that the various indications are gloomy. They call for a responsibility both on the side of the Government and among the Members of the Oireachtas to come to grips with the economic situation and to try to put forward proposals and reforms of the taxation code as part of the overall strategy necessary to <Col N="1439" /> resolve the problems which will face this country over the next few years.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in introducing the Bill pointed to the fact that his budget this year had been based on an expansionary strategy.  He then went on to say:</P>
      <P>The further disimprovement in the interval in the external situation, the unfavourable developments in the agricultural sector and the reduction in domestic purchasing power attributable to the increases in the price of oil and oil-based products will make the achievement of the target growth rate of 4¾ per cent then set for the economy in this calendar year difficult to attain and will make the somewhat lower growth rate&mdash; of the order of 4 per cent&mdash; more probable.</P>
      <P>In fact, I think that this is an optimistic forecast of our growth rate over the next year but it is somewhat at odds with other assessments.  For example, the June commentary of the Economic and Social Research Institute report opens, first of all, on a very gloomy note by saying:</P>
      <P>The picture emerging in relation to developments in the economy in 1974 now appear to be quite unfavourable. The year is likely to experience a low rate of growth of real output, a very high balance of payments of deficit and a high rate of price inflation.  These have been accompanied by little increase in non-agricultural employment and a rising level of unemployment.  It is important that this position be acknowledged so that expectations out of touch with reality are not generated which would considerably worsen the situation.</P>
      <P>Then the report goes on to assess the predictable growth rate:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent trends in consumer prices indicate that inflation in 1974 will be of the order of 16 per cent.  Increases in prices in the beginning of the year were probably largely due to the very rapid rise in import prices.  The concentration of wage and salary increases under the National Pay Agreement in the <Col N="1440" /> second half of the year suggests that prices will continue to rise substantially throughout the next six months of the year.  The one consoling feature of the present inflation is that our price rises are by no means exceptional by international standards so that the loss of external competitiveness is not likely to be great.  However, it does have its own internal implications.  The need to reduce the present rate of inflation is just as great as ever. Terms of trade movement are also likely to be adverse in 1974.  Export prices are forecast to rise by 11¾ per cent with import prices rising by 30 per cent.  The relatively small increase in export prices is mainly due to the climbing cattle prices. Thus, though the volume of real output produced in the economy might rise by 2¾ per cent, real living standards seem likely to fall.  The trading loss this year will be equivalent to nearly 6 per cent GNP in 1973 so that adjusted GNP in 1974 will probably fall by 3¼ per cent. Probably the most serious developments have been those in relation to external transactions.  Exports of goods and services are forecast to grow by 25½ per cent while imports of goods and services should grow by 40 per cent.  The results of these developments is that the balance of payments deficit on current account is likely to be of the order of £250 to £300 million.</P>
    <P>The major problems facing us now are the staggering rate of inflation and the crisis posed by the sharp rise in oil prices, aggravating the already existing balance of payments deficit calling into question the ability of a democratic country such as ours to respond with sufficient urgency and imagination to such problems.</P>
    <P>The first matter which must be resolved is where the responsibility lies for the dramatic rise in inflation.  The Government have tended to point too much to external factors and to try to explain the sharp rise in prices here by pointing to world inflation, the energy crisis and the consequent sharp rise in oil prices.  It was salutary to see the Central Bank putting the responsibility <Col N="1441" /> back on the Government in saying that the inflation is not due entirely to external factors but that we also have sharp domestic inflation caused within our own island by factors which could be under our control. I quote from the Central Bank report at page 7:</P>
    <P>It is a fallacy, even for the open Irish economy, that inflation is due more to external than to internal causes and that it is beyond our power to curb or control it.  If this were true, and the only armoury a country had against a mainly imported inflation was price control, the situation would be a sorry one. Price control, as is obvious, can prevent only &ldquo;unjustifiable&rdquo; price increases: those justified by increased costs of imports or of home products and services it can do nothing about.</P>
    <P>The fact is, however, that even during 1973, when basic commodity and energy prices soared spectacularly, and food prices continued to rise, imported inflation accounted directly for no more than half the rise in Irish retail prices.  Domestic causes, not beyond the community's capacity to influence, remained important.  The most powerful of these, as for many years past, was the much faster rate of increase in money incomes than in national productivity.  In its Spring Bulletin the Central Bank analysed this domestic source of inflation, emphasised the need to curb it relative to EEC trends if full employment is to be a realistic national aim, and suggested a broad approach to this difficult problem.  The moderation required is of <i>monetary</i> rather than <i>real</i> standards, since improvements in living standards are finally determined by the community's productive effort and not by illusory increases in money incomes.</P>
    <P>This is the economic context in which we must examine the provisions of this Finance Bill.  There are difficult problems to be resolved and the decisions which the Government will have to make will be hard decisions.  As we know from recent documentation and reporting, the distribution of wealth in <Col N="1442" /> this country is not as fair or as equitable as it should be.  We know the horrifying statistic that 25 per cent of the population are below the poverty belt.  We know there has been and continues to be a good deal of tax evasion by those in a position to contribute more to the national welfare.</P>
    <P>There remains the question of the capacity and determination of the Government to insist upon a more equitable tax system and to have the courage to bring in and enforce the tax provisions which will result in a fairer distribution of wealth and national income.  I welcome the provisions of this Bill which rationalise the personal income tax provisions; secondly, I support the introduction of taxation for farmers who are at a level to support such taxation.  I will come back to this point later.  I should like to reinforce the Minister, to encourage him, in his intention to bring in a wealth tax at a later stage and to ask him not to water down these provisions: not to back down in the face of what is a very interesting collection of forces trying to persuade the Government and the Minister in particular not to bring in the tax proposals which he has promised.  It is an interesting indication that there are more financial barons in Ireland than we had anticipated.  This should encourage the Minister to go ahead with the necessary, fair and equitable proposals which will introduce a fundamental morality which is a much broader concept than the way in which we usually talk about morality &mdash;when we confine it to the narrowness of sexual morality.  It will introduce a morality which is based on the dignity of citizens and gives them the prospect of a decent life and a decent old age, and a pension when they become ill or fall on hard times.</P>
    <P>There is a real responsibility on the Government to grasp the significance of the economic indicators I have referred to.  The Coalition Government have been in office for 18 months. They have got used to being in office and have got over the period of being able to either blame the previous Administration or claim it is too soon to implement their own particular <Col N="1443" /> policies.  They are now long enough in office to be responsible for the management of the economy and for the running of the country.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the Coalition Government are probably at their strongest point at this stage.  The Constituencies Bill, which was introduced by the Minister for Local Government to suit the Government in office and not as a result of a report by a boundary commission where the redrawing of constituencies would have been seen to be fairer and more equitable has ensured the likelihood, unless there is a very significant change in the overall political situation, of a return to office of the present Administration for a further term.</P>
    <P>Consequently, the Government are in a strong position to implement unpopular economic reforms and to take the economic decisions which must be taken if we are not to see further aggravated the very serious factors undermining the standard of living of our people, particularly the more vulnerable sections of the community. There is a serious responsibility on the Government to decide on their priorities; to act as a coherent and collective authority in coping with them and to have the courage to be honest with the people about the situation facing us.  They must be open and positive about the steps necessary to resolve these problems.</P>
    <P>I should now like to consider the question of the tax provisions in this Bill affecting farmers, as this has been the subject of much discussion.  I believe it is not the particular provisions in the Bill itself&mdash;which affects farmers who are in what most people would regard as the wealthy bracket, with farms of £100 valuation or more &mdash;that are in dispute.  Rather, the outcry is an indication of the unease and lack of confidence in the farming community generally at present.  I think the particular provisions of this Bill were conceived and worked out in a different context to that which is facing the farming community at this period.  It is particularly unfortunate that at a time of such deep <Col N="1444" /> crisis and lack of confidence in the whole sector they find themselves for the first time included in the general tax net.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, it is fair in an over all context that the more wealthy farmers should be included on the basis of their ability to pay.  However, I believe the Government must and ought to show much more positive concern for the general farming community and a much greater flexibility and awareness of the real need for support and backup during this particularly difficult period.  Farmers need help in planning to cope with the particular cycles whether it be a beef mountain or whatever, and the individual small farmer who depends on cash flow must be assisted to cope with his particular financial problems at the moment.  This type of concern has not been evident at Government level.  As a result, I believe the attempt to bring the wealthier farmers within the tax net has evoked very sharp and bitter resentment.  This is a focus for a much broader and deeper bitterness resulting from lack of confidence generated by new types of problems for which the farming community have not been prepared or equipped to cope.</P>
    <P>Looking at the general situation in relation to agricultural incomes it is relevant to quote from the June commentary of the Economic and Social Research Institute, at page 18:</P>
    <P>The prospects for agricultural incomes in 1974 are now considerably less bright than at the time of writing the March commentary.  The main causes for these diminished prospects are (i) the continued depressed state of the market for cattle and beef and (ii) the dramatic upsurge in the number of cows being slaughtered which will reduce the level of cattle output in 1974.</P>
    <P>... An interesting feature of the current situation in regard to cattle prices is the failure of the EEC intervention system to maintain actual cattle prices at or above the intervention price.</P>
    <P>This is an area where there has not <Col N="1445" /> been evidence of a responsible Government attitude.  To say the least of it, the Government have been either half-hearted or uncertain as to what exactly our approach should be at the European Community level in meetings of the Council of Ministers on questions of agriculture.  The impression is given that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is saying things at the meeting of the Council of Ministers intended for domestic consumption back here in Ireland, which he knows will not be acceptable and which he may not even wish to be acceptable.  There is a good deal of window-dressing which is not really trying to redress the fundamental problems facing the farming community at the moment.  A much more concerted attempt to re-examine the whole intervention price system and if necessary, the whole framework of the common agricultural policy itself would be more productive.</P>
    <P>At the time when the Treaty of Accession was being negotiated, this particular matter of intervention prices was not argued or examined very extensively because the problems did not exist at that time.  There was no prediction of the particular beef crisis which faces us in 1974.  Therefore, these particular problems were not worked out, and there were no detailed provision drawn up as there were in relation to dairy produce.  The Government should be examining the extent to which it might be possible to change and improve the intervention system in order for it to be of more real assistance to the farming community during what is regarded as a cyclical period; a period where the farmers are in danger of doing the worst possible thing by disposing of cattle for uneconomic prices because they need to have ready cash available.</P>
    <P>There would have been much less resentment of the legitimate attempt to bring wealthier farmers within the tax net if the Government were discharging an overall responsibility in relation to the farming community.  If their critical problems were better understood, and if there was better <Col N="1446" /> information available to individual farmers to enable them to cope with the immediate problems they would accept the present provisions without protest.  There is far too much panic in the farming community that this is a long-term trend rather than a cyclical matter, and they are not being sufficiently helped or advised in coping with it.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the position of those receiving social benefits.  In his introductory speech, the Minister, with some justification, pointed to the Government record in this area where he said:</P>
    <P>In the period since this Government took office Exchequer expenditure on social welfare has all but doubled.  Further, the work will continue of extending the scope of the social welfare services and generally improving them by, for example, easing means tests and lowering qualifying ages.</P>
    <P>We have at last realised our responsibility towards the more vulnerable sections of the community which is evidenced by our greater awareness of the need for improving our social welfare benefits.  Commendable measures have been taken in the last 18 months to introduce the necessary reforms. However, to a very large extent the real significance of these social benefits is being completely eroded, at the moment, by the high cost of energy and by inflation.  People who are in receipt of what look like better social benefits find that they cannot meet the quite staggering increases in electricity, gas, and the cost of the basic commodities, and particularly food.  Some are worse off than they were a couple of years ago.</P>
    <P>This prompts me to develop the idea of the necessity for flexibility by the Government in relation to the problem of higher energy costs and increases in the price of basic commodities such as food.  We must be more imaginative in devising ways of preventing these price increases from hitting the weaker sections of the community as substantially as they hit the general community.  We must devise ways of <Col N="1447" /> ensuring that the real standard of living of the people in receipt of social welfare benefits continues to rise, and that wherever the cost is met it is met by other sectors of the public.  This is an important social problem which must be faced with a good deal more imagination and flexibility by the Government.</P>
    <P>In emphasing the very serious economic situation facing this country the June Report of the Economic and Social Research Institute concludes in the summary of its provisions:</P>
    <P>In the short-term problems of inflation, current account balance of payments deficit, and possible unemployment, are acute.  It is thus necessary to convince the public that total real income will be lower than last year.  In the medium term things could be very much different. It is unlikely that the developed world will allow a period of prolonged deflation and a reversal of present policies can be expected. The long term outlook for cattle remains favourable despite the apparent difficulties.  Industrial and mining potential continues to grow. Above all there is the probability of significant offshore oil and gas. Knowledge, it is precise knowledge that is lacking, that in five to ten years Ireland could perhaps be a net exporter of oil and gas, would reduce the necessity for short-term action to protect the balance of payments and allow a period of very rapid growth in the future.</P>
    <P>I think that this is a key passage in the report.  At the moment we are in a rather unpredictable period.  In the short term all the economic indications are gloomy and the resultant problems are very real.  There will be a hard time ahead in an economic sense, and that means a hard time politically.  It is not easy for any democratic government to take hard decisions.  In appreciating this, I shall repeat the point that if ever the Coalition Government were in a position to give leadership it is now when they are long enough in office to know what government is about <Col N="1448" /> and when they have the likelihood of a second term ahead of them so that they ought to face up to their real responsibilities in the matter.</P>
    <P>There must be a great deal more study of and information about the longer term potential in this country; and much more evidence of coherent long term planning.  We could well be mistaken in taking certain steps now with a short term perspective in an attempt to meet particular political problems, without having a longer term framework.  We could even create unnecessary difficulties, or prevent the possibility of reaping the full advantage to be gained if and when the resources of oil, gas and mineral wealth are fully known.  We must be prepared to take more initiative ourselves in encouraging the necessary research and exploitation of our natural resources within a time scale which would allow us to plan over the next few years in the knowledge that the particular balance of payments problem will be resolved in time by the use that can be made of our latest natural resources.</P>
    <P>Although we are a small country with quite substantial economic problems and with a very harsh inflation rate, we must realise that in a world context we are one of the developed countries in that we are a member of the European Community which is one of the wealthy power blocks in the world.  At this time the world itself faces one of the most serious periods of real crisis, in human terms, with the possibility of mass starvation on an enormous scale particularly in the developing countries which have no natural resources&mdash; what are now called the fourth world countries to distinguish them from the OPEC and mineral producing countries.</P>
    <P>We must not allow our own internal problems to prevent us both from assuming our own share of the moral responsibility for a redistribution of world income and of world capacity.  We should speak with a strong and clear voice in encouraging the other members of the European Community, and the countries of the western world in general, to act with <Col N="1449" /> much more urgency and endeavour both in the immediate terms called for by the World Bank in its attempt to establish an emergency fund for concessionary grants to these developing countries and also in evolving new structures in international co-operation which will eliminate the totally immoral, unjustifiable and unsupportable situation where you have mass starvation in some countries of the world and over production in others.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I conclude by reminding us that this particular Finance Bill is about the distribution of the wealth of the country in a domestic framework. However, it must be examined not only in relation to short-term domestic economic problems, but to our long term potential and also bearing in mind our capacity to meet our international obligations.  I would like to see more evidence that the economic situation is first on the order of priorities of the Government at the moment.  Coping with inflation should be their real priority, and not discussion on other matters where there is no political will to bring about a solution.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether in view of the very serious economic situation he is prepared to set about achieving a consensus&mdash;or a social contract&mdash;for the introduction of a prices and incomes policy?  This is something which he should try to achieve over the next few months as a crucial part of the essential framework within which we can continue to have a reasonable society and continue to have a community which accept without friction the necessary drop in real income and real standards of living over the next few years.</P>

      <P>The Finance Bill gives the House an opportunity of discussing the state of the economy.  From my point of view, I am particularly interested in sections 13 to 25.  These, as Senators are aware, deal in the main with methods which will be employed to ensure that the farmers will pay income tax.  Let me say at the outset that I would be one of the first to concede that all citizens should in equity and in fairness pay their just share of <Col N="1450" /> taxation.  I am well aware that if a large number escape the income tax net it will leave a greater amount to be paid by other people.  Certainly it will mean that many people who are already carrying heavy weights and doing it voluntarily in so far as social services and so on are concerned, are also being forced to carry the extra burden of income tax for people who are well able to pay it and who for many years, through various devices of their own, have been able to elude it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment I adverted to the fact that any individual who was able to pay tax should not be allowed to evade the income tax net because those who evade tax make the burden heavier for people who must pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that in certain cases, such as large absentee farmers, the Government would be right in considering whether they should pay income tax.  I should like to differentiate between that type of farmer and those in some of the Northern counties, the midlands and the west.  The number of larger well-to-do farmers there is very limited.  This year in particular is the wrong time for the Minister for Finance to introduce this kind of legislation.  We have just entered the EEC.  There has been grave disappointment about our position at present.  Farmers thought it would be a boom time.  We know now that because, I suggest, of mishandling in Brussels, our agricultural prices on the home and export markets have become depressed to such an extent that many farmers are almost bankrupt. <Col N="1451" /> This is a time when farmers would expect to receive substantial credit because any profits they make they plough back into farm development.</P>
    <P>Agricultural methods have changed more in the last ten years than in the previous 2,000 years.  New types of machinery and so on have come on the market.  For that reason it is wrong for the Government to tax farmers especially in a year such as 1974.  We are told in available statistics that farm incomes have dropped 10 per cent from those of 1973.  The number of farmers has increased since 1973.  If a farmer employs a man and the latter must pay tax it is only right that the farmer should pay tax also. Very few farmers are at present able to employ farmhands.  It has happened in my area that the farmer who employed a man became the employee the following year.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have a second look at the matter of tax on valuations. The Griffith Valuation Act was drawn up about 1851.  There were many criteria included such as suitability of the land and the easy access to lakes and rivers for the growing of flax.  That applied to a large area in Ulster.  Much of the land there was valued because it was able to grow flax.  Flax growing has now vanished completely, yet those valuations still remain.  There is another problem in relation to valuations.  No examination was taken of the soil.  We know that a large area in the north-west is composed of drumlin soil&mdash;soil that is very clammy and damp&mdash;on which cattle cannot graze except for a few months of the year.  This is a drastic situation and one which would eat into any profits which a farmer might try to eke out of the small farms from which the majority of my constituents come.</P>
    <P>We as Members of the Oireachtas should be very concerned about the economic state of the small farmers. They are the hardest working people. They have a seven-day week all year round.  People may ask why they remain on the farms.  It is their way of life.  They wish to remain and they should be encouraged to do as far as <Col N="1452" /> possible and I would not agree with any measures which might give the impression that farmers were unwanted members of our community or that they should not make efforts to modernise their farms.  This year the legislation only applies to farmers with £100 valuation, also farmers with £50 valuation who are also engaged in other occupations.  It is the latter group of farmers about whom I would be most concerned.  There had been a policy in the previous Government and the Fianna Fáil Party that where farmers had small or uneconomic holdings they should have other employment so as to augment farm incomes.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, if a man is skilled in any way and takes on extra work he will be caught in the income tax net.  This is very discouraging to many of our people in the west and north who emigrated to England in the bad years, accumulated a little wealth and returned home to work in the local factories.  This was what we wanted to happen.  When such a person returns home he will find that because he works, say, in the local factory and earns a few pounds he will pay tax on it along with paying tax on his farm income.  I think that is very unfair.  By coming back to his house, that was probably built with State grants, he is occupying a house that would eventually become vacant. There are too many vacant houses at present in the western and northern counties.  We want those vacant houses filled with people who will be employed locally in some type of industry and who will live on a little mountain farm or a small farm.  I do not think this type of taxation is any improvement at all.  It reminds me of the old valuation laws we had in Ireland long ago when, if a man put in an extra window or added an extra chimney to his house, his tax was increased.  We should get away from that type of thinking once and for all.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that concerns me and that is the markets for our agricultural produce.  It is my firm belief and the belief of many people that the record of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries <Col N="1453" /> abroad&mdash;he may be a decent man and I have no reason for saying that he is not&mdash;on behalf of the Irish farmer is one that I would not envy. From the very beginning neither he nor the staff he has taken out to Brussels with him have exercised the authority and the dynamic force that they had by virtue of Ireland being one of the nine members of the EEC. I think it was a disastrous policy of a Minister to sit back, while he had a veto, and allow cattle from Russia and other non-member countries to come into the EEC and depress the price of cattle.  It is a tragic state of affairs to find that there are small farmers who have no other livelihood losing £20 or £30 per head on cattle that they must sell this year to meet their commitments.</P>
    <P>Regarding this taxation gimmick, the idea of expecting a farmer in rural Ireland who has to sink his own pump if he needs water because the water schemes have not been pursued vigorously enough, and who has to instal his own sewerage system and so forth &mdash;he may get small grants but they are minimal&mdash;to pay rates and at the same time pay income tax is utterly ridiculous. A farmer engages in the hardest occupation in this country.  As I said on other occasions in this House, but for the small farmer there would be no need for any rural national schools, school buses, colleges, hospitals or any of those services because we could wipe out whole areas of the country if we pursue legislation such as this which will eventually tend to enforce the Mansholt Plan under another name and drive the small farmer completely out of existence.  The Forestry Division would probably then move in on his heels to take over and plant that vast area of the country so that tourists from abroad can come along to admire the beautiful plantations.</P>
    <P>There is very little employment content in forestry so far as I know.  It would be disastrous if the situation were allowed to develop where we would have huge forests and no population. I should much prefer to see the small farmer and his wife and family living in that area in reasonably comfortable conditions without any great weight or threat of taxation hanging <Col N="1454" /> over him.  I can assure you that he is paying his share of taxation so far as food prices and household commodities are concerned at present.  His back is bent low enough already without trying to grind him completely into the green earth from which he sprang.  We should be very slow to decide to saddle the majority of our farmers with any type of taxation such as this.  It is a well known fact that when you insert the thin end of the wedge it is very easy for other people to follow on.  I should not like a situation such as that to emerge.</P>
    <P>I do not want unduly to delay anybody in this House.  I know the time is limited and because of that I will cut very short a few of the observations I wish to make.  At a time like this one would be expected to take some note of what has been happening so far as the Government are concerned since they came into office. Many of our people believed that a change of Government was a good thing.  In some instances they said that a change would be the ideal thing to happen.  A new generation has grown up since 1957 when we had the previous Coalition Government. I do not wish to be unfair to any member of the Government or any of the Senators or Deputies who comprise that Government, but I believe and I think the majority of our people believe, that the news media and others put across the new Cabinet as the greatest thing that ever hit western Europe.  Individual members of the Government appeared so often on television that you would get them mixed up with the television personalities themselves.  Many of them are academics, the people who know it all.</P>
    <P>Many people in rural Ireland&mdash; without casting any reflection on the Cabinet&mdash;are very sceptical of the ability of academics in general to tackle the ordinary down-to-earth problems which an ordinary farmer or individual would encounter.  It reminds me of a man who on one occasion asked advice and he was told: &ldquo;You get the advice of the economist. It will be good sound advice but if you do the very opposite to it you cannot go very far wrong.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1455" /> It may not be as bad as that so far as the Government are concerned but I believe there is something in that phrase.  Individual Ministers have tried to put themselves across on radio and television not collectively as a Government but as individuals, great opportunists, the people who had all the answers.  Many of the people are annoyed because of their lack of ability to make decisions.  We spent months here on the Constituencies Bill.  It had only one aim in mind and it succeeded in depriving us in Ulster of two seats and allowing 19,000 people in Dublin to elect a Member and 21,000 in our area.  We have scare headlines in the newspapers regarding housing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I have not any desire to prolong the proceedings by making a long-winded speech.  I will conclude by saying that the 14-point plan that was put across to the people at the last general election was pie in the sky.  As I said already with regard to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  I feel he is not measuring up to what we thought he would do in so far as our markets abroad and our entry into the EEC are concerned.  I do not know who actually speaks for Foreign Affairs at present because there are so many pronouncements on it that it is difficult for an ordinary individual to decide which of them is representing the country as Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1456" /> I remember the time when there was tremendous criticism regarding Mr. Aiken, who was our Foreign Affairs representative then, when he advocated in America that Red China should be admitted to the United Nations.  He was almost blackmailed out of existence by the Opposition then but at the same time he succeeded. It is so well accepted now that we even have a Russian Embassy in this city.  I am glad to see it. Eventually they have come around to the ways of thinking of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I should like to touch briefly on the matters of inflation and prices.  I submit that the Government are doing nothing whatever so far as price control is concerned.  The real reason is put down to the oil crisis.  That has been played out.  This oil business is nonsense.  To put the people in good humour they say: &ldquo;Now we have discovered oil in Cork.  Mair, a chapaill, agus gheobhair féar&mdash;live horse and you will get grass and everything will be all right.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That day-to-day attitude is not the right one for a Government.  A Government should be able to make decisions and the present Government do not appear to be able to make important decisions.  So far as education is concerned, I know of a few important decisions that had to be made.  The Minister for Education divided two schools under different management in the same schoolyard. Decisions such as this should have been faced up to and were not. Government should be in control. It may be difficult for the Coalition Government because they are composed of people with different outlooks and may be poles apart in various matters.  It must be difficult for them to muster a united front. There was an example of this recently in the Dáil.  The Cabinet did not know nor did the Taoiseach appear to know or indicate to the other members of his Cabinet what was happening.  They were all in disarray as far as that simple vote was concerned.</P>
    <P>If that happens with regard to other important matters, it would be a disastrous thing for the country.  I <Col N="1457" /> am not clamouring for the Coalition Government to break up or fall apart but from past experience and from what is happening at present, it looks as if they are on the downhill&mdash;the danger signs show this.  It would be better if there was stability.  The main thing that kept this Government in office is that people in general have said: &ldquo;At least, we know there is a united Fianna Fáil Opposition ready to take office.  As bad as things are, the same thing happened in 1951 and in 1957.  We know that Fianna Fáil will eventually return to office and that they will get the ship back on an even keel again&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Cathaoirleach has said that I should not refer to matters outside financial policy.  I will spare the Parliamentary Secretary any reference I was going to make to the River Erne or the River Shannon.  However, he will probably get the hint.</P>
    <P>Government finances are rolling in because of VAT.  In other words, the Coalition Government have taken office at a very opportune time.  They received extra money from the EEC as a grant for social services last year, and now they have VAT ticking over.  In that way, for the time being at least, they are not very concerned.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer to the many people who are on fixed incomes and on pensions.  It is very difficult for them to eke out an existence and to survive at present.  We, in Fianna Fáil, have been proud of our efforts so far as social services are concerned and we welcome any advance that will be made by the Coalition Government in that line.  We would all bend over backwards to help those who are in need.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer also to a matter of great concern, particularly in the north-western area, that is, the matter of insurance.  People have to pay very high prices for insurance on heavy motor lorries, and, indeed for private cars.  We have no railways in our area. Many hauliers have been faced with staggering insurance increases and this will cause an even higher increase in the cost of provisions.  The Government should make a decision on this.  They should be firm and ensure that insurance <Col N="1458" /> companies will not put the hauliers and others out of business by charging exorbitant premiums.  They are the substitutes we have for a railway. Many of our roads are winding, and we do not want this extra burden that could put our industries out of existence altogether.  If these lorries are forced off the roads through increased insurance premiums, people are likely to lose employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as conscious as any other Senator rising to speak of the fact that the Minister only got a rest last night after 48 hours.  He came to the Seanad yesterday, after 23 hours continuous discussion in the Dáil on this measure before us.  There is hardly any argument that he has not heard before on the items contained in this Bill.  I do not claim to be original and for that reason, I shall concentrate on the economic background to the budget, which obviously must have influenced the Minister's and the Government's thinking in framing it and which has dominated this debate from the beginning.  The detailed examination of the Bill can remain until the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I should like to look at the economic background for two reasons. Firstly, because of the extraordinary introduction to the Opposition's case by Senator Lenihan, which I shall deal with later.  Secondly, because I want to direct some critical remarks towards the Central Bank and, in particular, to its annual report for 1973-74.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter which side of the House we belong to, we must accept&mdash;and I am sure the Opposition must accept the point in private, if they will not admit to it in public&mdash;that since the Second World War there has not been a more difficult international economic situation.  This has been caused by two totally different yet converging tendencies.  In the first place there has been inflation caused by world food shortages and an exploding demand for commodities; in the second place by the more recent upheaval in oil and energy prices.  It is true that one preceded the other by a period of about two years.  There <Col N="1459" /> is hardly a commodity or a food in which the world trades for which prices are not now about 200 per cent to 300 per cent higher than they were in the corresponding period last year.  These have had their impact on the domestic prices within every single economy throughout the world.  As <i>The Economist</i> remarked during the past few weeks, inflation within many economies literally depends upon a very ancient aspect in the affairs of man, namely, whether or not there will be a good or a bad harvest this year.  One can almost share Mr. Breznev's anxiety that there should be a good Russian harvest.  If there is not, that is going to have its impact here in Ireland in terms of imported inflation such is the degree of interdependence of world economy today.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the question of the sudden and sharp reversal in terms of trade between ourselves and the oil-producing countries and this represents a significant shift in the balance of advantage towards them.  It not only reflects a transfer of resources from us to them, but it also means a deterioration in the balance of payments situation of every economy which depends on the importation of oil as a source of energy.  In addition to the detrimental effect of the balance of payments it, of course, had its own impact on the inflationary spiral because oil is not only to be regarded as a source of energy.  As a source of energy it finds its way into the costs of production of practically every manufacturing industry, whether that industry uses electricity or oil.  It is also a raw material in the sense that it is used as the base product for fertilisers which, therefore, affects food prices, and it also affects the plastics industry for which it is a basic raw material.</P>
    <P>There is no point in laying at the Government's feet responsibility for a feeling of instability.  There is instability everywhere in the world today. The thing to do in this situation is to keep one's head.  It is the task of governments, particularly in the western economies, to maintain a sense <Col N="1460" /> of proportion, to recognise the problem for what it is, not to panic and to carry their peoples through a very difficult time.  We must give an opportunity to the world economy to settle back into a more stable system of trading relations.  They are not going to be the same trading relations as existed 18 months ago; they will be different.  They will lie more in terms of advantage of the Third and the developing countries.</P>
    <P>In some ways that is not a bad thing but we have to pay the price of this change and the price we have to pay is a certain lowering in our own standard of living and the continuation of inflation for some time.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we must permit world trading relationships to settle into a new pattern.  In my view that will take about four or five years.  For that reason I would argue most vehemently against any course of action that would seek to redress, in too short a period, the undoubted shock we have received in terms of trade and the impact that has had on our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>I take the point of the Central Bank that it would be imprudent to ignore in the long run this deterioration in the terms of trade, and of its impact upon the balance of payments. But I would equally argue that it would be totally imprudent to try to remedy the situation within 12 months or 18 months.  The shock that would be administered to the domestic economy would be too severe and too sudden.  It would be fatal if the monetary policy and the budgetary policy, of this country, and of other developed economies, were all employed together at the one time in an attempt to deal with inflation, and, if at the same time, they were also trying to deal with balance of payments deficits by cut backs in public and private expenditures.  If that happens then they will most assuredly export to each other, not products or services, but unemployment.  The Central Bank makes the point in their report that if one single major economy were to take upon itself the task of countering the inflationary spiral then, perhaps, the smaller dependent secondary <Col N="1461" /> economies such as ourselves might have a more rosy economic future.  They mentioned the case of the United States as perhaps being the leader.  That is a good argument but it should not apply, even by implication, to us.</P>
    <P>One is also conscious of the fact that we are part of the European Community and within that Community the major economy, Germany, even though it is governed by a party with which we have fraternal associations, is at the moment pursuing, in my view, the wrong economic policy even internally, and certainly for the rest of Europe.  Our degree of interdependence with the EEC means that the rate of economic progress in the UK, France, Italy, and, particularly, in Germany will determine our own rate of economic progress.  The Germans have, for the reason of maintaining, as they see it, inflation at an acceptable level which to them is about 7½ per cent, deflated their own economy and this is having a detrimental effect on the rest of us.  This fact bears out the warning I have just given against panic deflation of the world's governments.</P>
    <P>The current temptation is to resort to demand control as an instrument of monetary policy in the belief that demand control can effect inflation.  I do not think that policy is valid at the moment.  I do not think there is any economist as I said before, in relation to the budget and other economic matters, who can adequately explain at the moment what is causing inflation. Reference to the current issue of the world's theoretically premier economic journal, would show that there is an exchange of notes in the <i>Economic Journal</i> between leading economists as to the nature of hyper-inflation and great evidence of confusion amongst them as to what constitutes its basis. For that reason it would be wrong to resort to what were previously prescribed as classical remedies for inflation, in particular, demand control and the use of the budget as a means of regulating aggregate demand.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank criticises the budget of last year, and the previous <Col N="1462" /> year, for deficit spending and, by implication, they are admonishing a warning by advising the Government against the repetition of such a policy next year in the belief that keeping a budget in surplus or in equilibrium will have a counter inflationary effect.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the chief economic adviser to the Treasury in Britain is arguing the opposite before the House of Commons Estimate Committee and saying that in his view they do not know for certain what is happening.  He has said that it may be, perhaps, that the Phillips Curve, upon which much economic policy has been based, has not only gone out of operation but has reversed itself into mirror image and that therefore, Government policy, based upon it, may be doing the opposite to what the policy makers intend it to do.  That is why there is a danger of using old prescriptions for what is a new problem.</P>
    <P>Apart from inflation we have also to deal with the question of the balance of payments because the budget plays an important role in adding to aggregate demand which, in our case, adds to the balance of payments deficit because of our high propensity to import.  Hence the Central Bank's aversion to Budget deficits.  We have to make the distinction, which is now being made, but which was not made by Senator Lenihan, between the oil deficit and the non-oil deficit.  We cannot look at the total deficit in the balance of payments and say that because last year it was £60 million or £70 million for a particular country and because this year it is £200 million therefore that country is going on the financial rocks, if in the meantime, the oil bill for that country has gone up by £120 million or £130 million.</P>
    <P>There is no developed economy that has not suffered this particular trend in its balance of payments.  What we, and the western economies have to do is to try to recycle the amount of extra money we are now expending on the same volume of oil imports, through deals with the Arabs, if they are willing to play that game and if they are willing to recognise that their own <Col N="1463" /> self-interest lies in that direction.  It is assuredly not in their self-interest to permit the western economies to come tumbling down because of monetary constraints imposed by their unilateral price increase for oil and energy products.</P>
    <P>It was wrong for Senator Lenihan, the Fianna Fáil Party, and the economic commentators who agree with them, to try to develop a sense of panic because of the increase in the balance of payments which is primarily brought about by the increase in the price of energy and which is also brought about by the increase in industrial products which are also consequential upon the increase in energy.  If for this year we are to have from £250 million to £300 million deficit we are doing well when one considers that of that deficit the oil deficit could account for approximately £100 million to £150 million.</P>
    <P>That money represents a shift in resources to the oil producing nations, particularly the Arabs and it is money out of our pockets.  In my view we must do two things to offset this loss of demand.  We must not pursue a policy of panic in relation to the balance of payments deficit, and, secondly, we must in the short run insist that that money is replaced in the domestic economy so as to maintain our own living standards.  I know that it is impossible in the long run to ignore the fact that this shift in resources has occurred and will persist. But until such time as the public becomes conscious and aware of this particular fact any government and any democracy runs the danger of imposing, too quickly, the effects of this shift in the trade of oil and energy.  If we do not ease gradually into this new situation our standard of living will fall too precipitately with serious political side effects.  That £100 million to £150 million can only be replaced by external borrowing and it must be replaced otherwise internal aggregate demand will fall and what is of more importance to me, jobs will disappear.</P>
    <P>I disagree therefore with the Central Bank in their criticism of the <Col N="1464" /> Government's policy on foreign borrowing. What is the alternative to foreign borrowing at the moment except a diminution in demand and an increase in unemployment?  An increase in unemployment for whom? For the economists of the Central Bank or for the other exponents of orthodox conservative economic thinking who usually hold secure jobs; or unemployment for people who work in manufacturing and service industries, the working class people? That is for whom the unemployment is prescribed as a remedy when one talks about these logical categories of &ldquo;inflation&rdquo;, &ldquo;balance of payments deficits&rdquo;, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>The prescription is contained in page 9 of the Central Bank Report. It is an interesting one.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Those interests who, in an unqualified way,</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;It is an interesting shaft at one's opponent that he speaks in an unqualified way&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>advocate expansion of public expenditure, foreign borrowing and bank credit in the immediate interests of economic growth and employment would do well to keep in mind that an expansionary policy can lead only to disaster if it is pursued to the point of accelerating the relative increase in domestic costs and prices&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Central Bank have a responsibility to spell out for us what they mean by disaster and to quantify it and to place the parameters upon Government policy in terms of inflation and balance of payments deficit, and to balance that off in an equation with increase in unemployment. The Central Bank stated that inflation can be tackled in a certain way and it is always interesting that inflation is to be tackled in a way which leads to unemployment.  But the first priority of economic policy, and the budget and this Bill, which is a means of giving expression to that policy, must be to protect and sustain employment. It is that priority which is expressed in the Government's 14-points, a programme upon which this Government is founded.  At the <Col N="1465" /> moment the choice is between inflation and employment, and inflation and unemployment.</P>
    <P>This is a stark choice.  It is madness to think that we, as a small open economy, can control inflation by an incomes policy, demand restriction and unemployment because no matter what we do as an economy we will have imported inflation which will be unacceptable in terms of what went before in terms of price increases.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank advert to the fact that 50 per cent of our inflation last year was caused by domestic factors. The bank have traditionally attacked, and, because of what they represent will continue to attack, incomes as a main cause for inflation. We should remember, that we in this House, and in the other House, were brought in by the Minister for Labour to give effect to a Bill with limited income increases in the banking industry last year, and that the Minister has had to refer to the Labour Court an agreement recently made by the banking industry with their own employees as possibly being outside the scope of the national wage agreement. Could I suggest to the Central Bank, as the people who see themselves as controlling the banking industry, that they would put their own house in order before they direct their critical shafts elsewhere?</P>
    <P>It is argued by them that external inflation counts for only 50 per cent of total inflation and that we are responsible for 50 per cent of domestic inflation.  Yet the Central Bank do make the point, and do not appear to follow it through logically, that there is at the moment in our wage demands an anticipation of inflation that is about to happen.  In other words if one begins to import inflation then wage and salary earners anticipate that this will continue to happen and they will add that element into their own wage demands.  Therefore, while it eventually works its way into the economy as a domestic element of inflation, it is in the first place triggered off and caused by external inflation.  It is madness to think that workers and salary earners <Col N="1466" /> are not going to behave in this fashion.</P>
    <P>One recipe of the Central Bank for controlling inflation is given on page 10 of their report, and they use a model built by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in Britain.  It runs as follows:</P>
    <P>... if import prices were to increase from now on by 10 per cent per annum, and productivity by 4 per cent, but wages and salaries, after the expiry of the current National Pay Agreement, were to rise only at the same rate each quarter as prices had risen in the previous quarter, the rate of price inflation in Ireland could be reduced to less than 7 per cent for 1976.</P>
    <P>That is a very attractive formula.  I heard it before when Fianna Fáil were in Government and we were in Opposition.  What does it mean precisely? It means a standstill in the living standards of wage and salary earners since prices are to pace wage increases.  It means that the 4 per cent productivity increase is to be used by other sectors of the economy and there is to be no increase in the real incomes for the working class people.</P>
    <P>What about profits, dividends, professional fees and other earnings? There is to be no limitation on them. This, of course, is the old problem of dealing with an incomes policy, which inevitably degenerates into a wage and salaries policy, in other words control of people who can be dealt with because their incomes are known and therefore controllable.</P>
    <P>What the Central Bank are saying here is that the benefits of productivity are not to be shared equally throughout the economy and so there will be a shift in the distribution of wealth within the domestic economy to the disadvantage of salary and wage earners.  This is not acceptable.  I do not believe it would be acceptable to the Labour movement and it is not on politically and it would be an unwise adventure, an unwise excursion for any Government into the realms of statutory incomes policy along the lines therein indicated.  We have just <Col N="1467" /> seen what has happened in the UK and of the fate of a Government who attempted a statutory policy and the fate of the economy where the attempt was carried out.</P>
    <P>Inflation is indeed a major political as well as an economic problem. I take the point of the Central Bank that in certain respects it is a threat even to democracy because it upsets the balance of aspirations and of what is achievable.  It sets up social stress and strains.  It is a danger and the Government do not need to be reminded of its seriousness.  It is fair to state that for example the Government's policy of price control is having an effect, and that since the Government took office, we have reached a position of some improvement in the international league tables.</P>
    <P>I am quoting from OECD sources using the OECD Main Economic Indicators for June, 1972, 1973 and 1974 and the Central Statistics Office. By reference to the international rate of price increases we were the fourth highest out of 22 in 1972 and for the last year of Fianna Fáil Government we were the third highest out of 23. For our first full year in office we were eighth out of 23.  These are the independent sources given by OECD and the CSO.  I admit this is not an acceptable rate compared to what one had before, but at least Government policy is having this discernible effect on the rate of price inflation and is an indication of their determination to ameliorate its worst effects.</P>
    <P>In view of what Senator Dolan stated about the use by the Government of the impact of oil upon the economy as a source of inflation and that we were using it as an excuse for inaction, it is instructive to turn to the table on page 18 of the Central Bank report, to which he had the same access as I had.  There one can read the analysis of the consumer price index and compare the second quarter of 1973 with the second quarter of 1974.  One can take the elements of the consumer price index that are directly referrable to increased energy costs.  In the first case fuel and light, and in the second case, transport.  Both <Col N="1468" /> of those elements accounted for only 8 per cent of the CPI in the second quarter of 1973 but they had gone up to a combined 31 per cent in the second quarter of 1974, an increase of 400 per cent in their contribution to the total price rise.  In the same period, food had dropped from 55 per cent of the total price increase down to 22 per cent.  This is a startling indication of the impact, quantified here by the Central Bank, which increased energy costs have had upon domestic prices; so startling, in fact, that the Central Bank have referred to it, not only by way of table but also by way of commentary in the section dealing with the national economy, beginning on page 17.  The fact is that the increased cost of oil is fuelling inflation at an alarming rate.  Public life and public debate on the issue of inflation would be well served if we all used fact rather than fantasy as is the wont of the Fianna Fáil Opposition.</P>
    <P>Budgetary policy, in relation to the economy this year, was correct. Growth, which means increased employment, was the correct objective. Growth that can be directly translated into employment must be paramount but we have to take account of the unique world economic situation at the moment.  I recognise in the Opposition party men who at least had the honesty to recognise this danger in private, if not the courage to admit to it publicly.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the OECD Economic Outlook, July, 1974, published on the 24th of this month, which will put the situation into some perspective, particularly in the light of Senator Lenihan's extraordinary contribution, at the beginning of this debate.  According to the OECD.  I am quoting from tables on pages 9 and 10 of their report, the United States economy is expected in the present year not to show a positive growth rate, not even a modest 1 or 2 per cent, not even a standstill but is expected to decline by a ½ per cent.</P>
    <P>The economy which has been the centrepiece, and the cause of much admiration amongst economists and policy makers, that of Japan, having shown a growth rate last year of over <Col N="1469" /> 10 per cent, is expected, in the current year, to show a decline of 1½ per cent.  More ominously still, the economy upon which so much of our own growth depends, the United Kingdom, shows a forecasted decrease of 2 per cent.  The whole of the OECD is expected to grow by no more than 1 per cent.  This is a particularly gloomy economic outlook for the western world, the developed economies of the world.  If one takes out of that the component of the EEC economies, one finds that for them there is an expected total growth rate of 2½ per cent.  That places in proper perspective the expectations for the Irish economy under the budgetary policy of this Government.  I am not quoting from the Minister or any domestic source but from the OECD. They give here the expected growth rate of 3½ per cent for the Irish economy&mdash;one of the highest in the western world.</P>
    <P>It is that forecast for this present year, which I might concede is even a little too high which was ignored by the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was published on the 24th July, 1974.  It could not be any more recent than that.  The Senator had the same access to it as I had.  Of course, the Senator did not want to use it; that is the difference. I am saying that it is an irresponsible attitude, at a time where there are grave world economic trends, to suggest that this economy is going into the sort of self-induced decline as was suggested by Senator Lenihan, at a time when developed economies of the world are showing negative growth rates.  The situation is very serious for the world economy but in sustaining our position we are all doing well and better than most.  That is the result of Government policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have been attempting to say through these interruptions, the world economy is showing a very dangerous downward trend at the moment.  OECD countries have a projected 1 per cent growth; the EEC have a projected 2½ per cent growth and our own economy has 3½ per cent.  In the circumstances, we must continue to have the maintenance of growth and the sustenance and defence of employment as our primary economic objectives.  Therefore we need continued budget deficiting and, if necessary, foreign borrowing.</P>
      <P>It was an extraordinary analysis of the economy by Senator Lenihan that in having referred to the Central Bank report he completely misunderstood the nature of the Central Bank's statement on monetary policy, on page 14, and quoted it as a forecast for the balance of payments when, in fact, it was a statement of what the bank saw as the economic objectives of Government policy.  He confused the two.  Using that statement as part of his prophesy of doom for the economy he laid at the Minister the charge that there was a fall-off in capital inflow, in sharp and distinct contradiction to the massive inflows when he was in office.  Yet, on the very page from which he was quoting in the last three lines, there was a contraction of what he was saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Capital inflows are expected to <Col N="1471" /> strengthen the growth in the resources of the banking system over the coming months&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>But of course, the Irish economy is in difficulty because it is a small peripheral open economy.  To a very great extent it is dependent on what is happening in the outside world. What is happening in the outside world, at the moment, is unique since the War in terms of its seriousness, which, as I indicated at the beginning, is caused by two different but now converging sets of factors, the incredible rise in commodity and food prices and the deterioration in terms of trade <i>vis-a-vis</i> the western world because of the increased energy costs. It is these facts we must keep in mind when evaluating the performance of our national economy and on the basis of any impartial analysis we are doing well, despite the difficulties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the taxation on farmers, contained in this Bill.  I have no hesitation in saying it is time farmers of sufficient means were taxed.  There is never an opportune time to introduce a new form of taxation.  As the Minister said recently, nobody likes paying tax.  Of course, farmers' incomes are cyclical, because to a great extent they are dependent upon factors which are not even in the control of man but in the hands of God, such as the weather.  To meet their special and unique case I believe that income averaging might be a desirable and effective method of administering tax on their incomes.  I would give support to the concept of the rolling average of three, four or five years, as a means of equitably assessing their incomes because otherwise in the year of high profitability their profits would fall into the higher brackets for taxation, and in the year of lower income they would be taxed at the lower rates.  This would lead to too much fluctuation in their liquidity situation and impose strains on their working capital.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the measures in the Bill to eliminate tax evasion and avoidance.  I know this to be one of the hallmarks of the Minister's approach to tax equity and I welcome <Col N="1472" /> it very much because it is extraordinary the amount of brains and expertise that is devoted in this country to assisting people who can afford to pay experts to avoid paying tax. One thinks of the hundreds of thousands of ordinary taxpayers who have no means of avoiding the tax burden, pensioners on contributory old age pensions, and so on, who have got to pay their just tax.  At the same time, we have people who should know better, who hold responsible positions, behaving in an anti-social way, using people who, very often, have just left the Government service and their experience of the Administration to try to avoid something that is their social obligation.</P>
    <P>I make the last point simply because it was raised by Senator Dolan. I want to console him and other Fianna Fáil Senators that they need have no fear about this Government, or about our respective determination to see to it that it will continue.  They had better get quite used to the seats opposite because they are going to be in them for quite a long time.  We have no plans whatsoever to depart from the 14-point programme upon which we were elected; neither do we have any imagination of repeating previous happenings.  I can assure the gentlemen on the opposite benches, who have only now begun to realise where they are, that they had better sit down, and study, and get very accustomed to being over there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>That last statement of Senator Halligan is somewhat surprising because, no more than ourselves, the Government parties themselves do not know what their Taoiseach is going to do.  Last week they did not know what he was going to do.  This week they do not know what he is going to do and he might do something during the summer recess that they will not know until the thing has been done.  In fact, judging by this Bill, one can see from the delay in bringing the Bill that the Minister is obviously very lazy.  I do not believe that he is.  In fact, I would assume quite the opposite.  That being so, there must be other reasons why <Col N="1473" /> this Bill was not brought in much sooner.</P>
      <P>We all know that many people had to be satisfied before this Bill was brought before either House.  There were the soldiers and the sailors, the racehorse owners and the very large farmers, the 2 or 3 per cent of the wealth of this country, who had to be satisfied before this Bill could be introduced in its present form.</P>
      <P>I have not got any great knowledge of high finance.  I was not either lucky, or unlucky, enough to know a great deal about it, but I know a great deal about the ordinary facts of living and the way of life in this country.  For Senator Halligan to stand up and pronounce to this House a forecast of how we will be at the end of this year, or next year, is a very slick way of trying to slip out of a noose that is steadily tightening on the necks of this Government.  Indeed, the trap has been sprung and the pressure is on.  That is very obvious. During the council elections I read a statement by a former Member of this House who was very able in the use of words.  I quote from a great character, a great politician in his own way, the one and only Senator Joe Lenihan.  He said&mdash;I thought it wisely worded and very appropriate&mdash; in 12 months of his being out of politics he had seen a thriving nation growing to poverty; he had seen a situation where a suit of clothes was costing £50 and a suck calf £2.  He saw a situation where 8,000 pigs and sows in young were being killed each week in the slaughter houses.  Yet, in the supermarkets, prime bacon was being sold at the abnormal price of 52p per lb.  That summed up the situation. It still sums it up.  We can blame lots of things for it.  Senator Halligan tried to blame circumstances outside the control of the Government. He blamed oil and food shortages. It was only in 1973 that the Government allowed a draft statement to be made from the EEC in which it stated to the agricultural community that the price of beef in 1974 would be greater than it was in 1973.  It stated that there would be a scarcity of beef.  It was not, as we now know, outside our control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> It is quite true to say that the oil situation played a major part.  But what have the democracies of Europe done about oil?  Can any nation as big as America, or as small as Ireland, claim they are independent when, in fact, tomorrow morning for the ordinary functions of this small nation, or the functions of a nation as great as America, they are dependent on Saudi Arabia, Egypt and all the Arab countries who supply oil?  Is this independence in the true sense?  Have the European democracies tried to do anything about the oil situation?  Is there an alternative?  If there is not an alternative, then we have no real independence and, if we really want to be independent in the real sense of that word, we must now try to find an alternative to oil as a source of energy and power so that, in time, we will be totally independent The Government must take action now and an investment must be made immediately to find an alternative to oil.  In this year of 1974 it should not be beyond the ability and ingenuity of man to find an alternative.</P>
    <P>I do not declare myself out of order in talking about oil because it is the big whip being used by the members of the Government to defend this desperate piece of legislation.  First of all, I should like the Minister to answer to this House.  He has an obligation to do so.  He must tell us precisely and exactly why this Bill has been so long delayed in coming before the House.  Who was responsible for the delay?  The poor law valuation is to stand.  Is that honest?  Is it fair?  There is nothing more frustrating than the system used in diagnosing poor law valuation.  Even in the last two years the poor law valuation on new houses has varied immensely.  The poor law valuation on agricultural land is so diverse that it is hard to fathom it.  I could give instances of the unfairness of the PLV system which would be as thick as the book the Minister has in front of him.  I know a man who has 16 acres of non-arable land and a PLV of £28.72.  I know another man who has 188 acres of the finest arable land and he has a PLV of only £11.50. Those are two instances to show the <Col N="1475" /> extremes.  I know a widow who has a valuation of £22.  She has a thriving little business in farmhouse accommodation. The Minister now sees fit to tax it.</P>
    <P>We speak of investment in social welfare.  The investment over the last 16 months has been contributed solely and entirely by the agricultural community; £30 million pounds saved on agriculture last year has been injected into social welfare.  That is a fact.  The people who will suffer are those who are trying to rear families on farms of 20 and 25 acres, particularly in my county.  They will now, according to this Bill, be eligible for income tax. There are in my county people living on small farms with a PLV of over £20 who could not rear children on those farms.  They have to go to work in Galway city to jobs willingly provided by the previous Fianna Fáil Government.  Not only will they pay tax but they will lose half as much again on their new assessment because their poor law valuation is over £20. I am stating facts.  The Government regret this.  In circumstances in which the poor law valuation system was inequitable, they have used it as a means of assessing tax.</P>
    <P>The Government will rue the day &mdash;maybe not too far hence&mdash;when they deprived those men who willingly went out to work and played their part in rearing families.  They are being cruelly abused by this Government. Any man working in the city of Galway, with a valuation of over £20 will, when this Bill is passed, have his assessment cut in two.  He will be paying an assessment on an assessment as provided for in some sections of the Bill.  He will now pay more tax because he was not able to derive a living from his land and had to go out to work.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why a man with 1,000 acres in the Curragh, who trains the most highly bred racehorses in Europe, can get away scot free.</P>

They are, in the opinion of the people, getting off scot free.  That is the opinion of the people and, if they are wrong, the Minister must tell them so.  The Minister must also tell them that the man living on the Curragh will get as fair a crack of the whip under the income tax code as the man, his wife and four children who live near me, the man who works in Galway, with a valuation of £20 and 16 acres of land.  This man did not want to stand outside the labour exchange so he went out to work; he will now have to pay income tax while the racehorse owner on the Curragh is allowed, under this Bill, to evade the payment of income tax.</P>

    <P>What investment have this Government put into agriculture since <Col N="1477" /> they took office?  There has been no investment in agriculture by this Government. Instead, they have deprived agriculture and given to social welfare every single copper they could find. Now we have reached the stage where they are going to draw more money. From where?  The Government have not got the courage to admit that we are now committed Europeans.  But how can Europe judge us when we cannot judge ourselves?  We must admit we are committed Europeans and, if we are to make progress in Europe, we must be trusted.  If we are not trusted, we cannot make progress. It should be made clear by every Minister that we are totally committed to Europe for progress.  We have Ministers who seem to hold every portfolio but their own.  We even have a Minister who seems to do the job of the Taoiseach, and who speaks for every Department except his own.</P>

We have no longer total dependence <Col N="1478" /> on Britain and we should make that known.  Because it is not sufficiently publicised our economy is seemingly going astray.  I do not think the situation, as I said before, is entirely due to the oil situation.  It might be an oily situation, but it is not the oil situation that is solely responsible.</P>
      <P>There are other aspects to which I should like to refer but we are limited in time and there are other speakers who wish to contribute to the debate.

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>From the beginning of time governments which have levied new taxes have brought upon themselves the displeasure engendered by the distaste for such taxes.  Taxation is necessary; it is if you like, a necessary evil.  It is designed to protect and aid the elderly, the poor and the lessable members of a community and to uphold community institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the public ever object to taxation so long as it is seen to be equitable.  As unfortunate as the timing of taxation upon certain farmers may be, certain sections, especially those who pay tax under the PAYE system, have felt for many years that they were expected to carry an unjust burden.  It is unfortunate that this new taxation coincides with probably the worst year in farming since the Economic War.  I do not believe farmers in the category of the well-to-do really object to paying taxation but, unfortunately, things have never been worse, The price of young cattle and calves is extremely low.  The cost of feedingstuffs and fertilisers was never so high and, all in all, it has been a very bad year, so bad that I imagine a great many people with a valuation of £100 will not have to pay any tax because they have not made any profit.  In fact, some of them <Col N="1479" /> have suffered grave losses, especially those who invested last year in young cattle and calves.</P>
    <P>I reject the allegation made by some Opposition Members that these adverse circumstances are due to mishandling on the part of the Government.  The factors involved are external and people like our Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Clinton, have made a tremendous effort to resolve the difficulties that have arisen.  There is grave misrepresentation as to who will pay tax and the Opposition must be held responsible for deliberately trying to mislead the public.  They say that this year it is farmers with £100 PLV, next year it will be farmers of £90 PLV and, the year after it will be farmers with a PLV of £80.  This is mischevious.  It is misleading.  It is wrong.  There is no indication whatsoever that there will be any future change downwards.</P>
    <P>Some farmers feel aggrieved because they will have to continue paying rates on their land in conjunction with the new form of taxation. I would suggest that farmers who are hardworking and progressive might get some relief in terms of their rates on a sliding scale.  It seems unfair to tax a progressive farmer and also ask him to pay rates.  The Minister might make some concession in this field.  I would like to compliment the Minister and the Taoiseach for the prompt manner in which they met the farming representatives earlier this week to discuss the matter with them.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the outdated rating system where land is concerned.  The system has not been changed to any degree since the 1850s when the Griffith Valuation Act was passed.  It is peculiar that the Opposition should object to the fact that the system has not been changed because a commission which reported on this seven years ago stated that a revision of land valuation was long overdue, and that it should be carried out immediately. That was seven years ago, under the previous Government.  As yet, nothing has been done.  I would ask the Minister for Finance, if he could, to set <Col N="1480" /> something in motion to have these valuations revised.  I believe that it will take 11 years to revise the valuations throughout the whole country. If the job had been started seven years ago we would be finished within another four years.  The negligence there does not lie with the present Government; it lies with the previous Government.</P>
    <P>The valuations are unfair, especially in maritime countries, because when they were levied credit was given for the fact that farmers could use materials from the seashore such as sand, gravel and seaweed as fertilisers and for other purposes.  Those reasons are no longer valid.  Along the coast there is, in many cases, a prohibition on the removal of sand and gravel. Therefore, coastal farmers no longer have these benefits.  The high valution on this type of land is grossly unjust and needs to be revised.  Some land was valued on its merit for the growing of grain.  Again, that is outdated and does not have any great significance in this day and age.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to initiate a programme whereby the land valuations would be revised.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I should like to advocate a tax to raise money for use in a form which is highly desirable.  Items such as drink and cigarettes should be taxed for specific purposes.  Even only one penny on certain types of drink, especially spirits, would give a good return.  The revenue from that should go specifically towards the erection of recreational centres for the young and perhaps the not-so-young.  There is a grave problem at the moment, that is, the problem of heavy drinking among the younger generation.  Nobody has really tackled this problem. If there was a specific tax put on items such as this, to finance projects such as that, it would be a very wise long-term move.  This would not be just for the good of the younger generation themselves.  Drinking must have a detrimental effect in the long term on the performance by people at their work.  The problem of alcoholism is great and it surely will affect our economy more and more as it increases, and it is increasing.  The <Col N="1481" /> amount of money spent on the treatment of these people must be considerable. It is desirable that a certain type of taxation be designated to combat this grave problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is, in many respects, ill-conceived.  Certainly in regard to the taxation of agricultural profits, it is very badly timed.  The principal criticism that one could make of it is that it is entirely inappropriate and inadequate to meet the needs of our economy at present. It has been pushed through the Dáil in very, very quick time; rushed through for reasons that have never been clearly explained.  The result of this has been that only approximately half the amendments put down were reached before the vote was taken.  In almost every single case of these amendments the Minister refused to consider them.  I think that in every case the amendments were rejected by the Minister.  He indulged himself by introducing numerous amendments but did not accept those put before him.  If some of these amendments had been accepted, a very poor Bill might have been somewhat improved. We will endeavour to improve it in this way in this House.</P>
      <P>Section 9 imposes a limit of £1,000 on life assurance taken out after 3rd April.  The actual provision itself is not one with which I am going to quarrel, but I certainly must quarrel with the fact that the date has been fixed at 3rd April.  Having regard to the Minister's budget speech, in which he encouraged people to take out life assurance, and now introduces a date three months back, this is really an iniquitous provision.  People were encouraged to take out life assurance and people did so, and they now find themselves in difficulties as a result of the Minister putting the date back to 3rd April.  It is not unfair or unreasonable to say this is, in effect, a gross breach of faith on the part of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chapter II deals with the tax on farm profits.  It would be difficult to envisage a worse time to introduce this tax.  I will not argue in regard to the fact that at present agriculture is in a very difficult state.  This is quite <Col N="1482" /> clear and has been mentioned by many speakers before me.  I would like to comment on the assertion that the Minister and the Government are in no way responsible for the extremely difficult position of the agricultural community at present.  It is, of course, true that to a very large extent, circumstances outside the control of the Government are responsible for the present position.  Nevertheless, there were certain measures which the Government could have taken, or could have attempted to introduce, which would have been of considerable help in the present situation. One of these suggestions which has been mentioned and which was not taken up by the Government was the introduction of the Green £.  Under the EEC CAP regulations, agricultural prices are fixed by a unit of account, the unit of account being 2.164 to the £.  Because of the depreciation of sterling since the time we entered the European Community, and because it was alleged that in view of this depreciation, Irish agricultural exports would become unduly competitive with agricultural goods in other countries, it was considered unfair not to make some change.  As a result of this allegation, monetary compensatory amounts were introduced. This, in effect, meant that there was a tax on the exports of our goods to all EEC countries except the UK, and there was a subsidy on the import of these agricultural goods to these countries.  The goods in question included nearly all the agricultural exports of importance to us&mdash; cattle, wheat, butter, barley and sugar.  At present, the tax amounts to something in the region of 15 per cent of the value of these goods.  The monetary compensatory amounts were introduced because it was alleged this was necessary to maintain fair trade. In fact, it has, of course, put Ireland very much at a disadvantage and it means that the value of Irish exports of the goods which I have mentioned is unfair to Ireland because the value of these goods is about six times greater than the value of our imports of these products from other countries. Consequently, our export taxes <Col N="1483" /> far exceed our import subsidies. Secondly, it is unfair to us because raw material imports such as fertiliser, fuel and machinery for use in agricultural production are not covered by the CAP and do not receive monetary subsidies.</P>

      <P>I will finish in a moment.  While I agree the situation in which we find ourselves is not entirely due to the Government by any means, nevertheless, the introduction of the green pound was one way in which our agricultural community could have been considerably helped, and apparently the Government made no effort whatsoever to introduce this.  It would have been worth something like 30 million cattle exports and the Government failed even to do this in the very difficult situation in which we find ourselves.</P>

      <P>The effort has been made by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to whom several tributes were paid from both sides of the House during the course of this debate and, indeed, in the other House.  It is unique to have tributes paid to a Minister from people on the other side of the House.  They have recognised that in Deputy Mark Clinton, Ireland has a Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who fights and fights hard consistently in the interests of Irish farmers.  The fact that one is a fighter and is an able person does not necessarily mean that there will always be victory.  If victory has not yet come his way in regard to that, it is certainly no fault of his.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to say that it is idle to <Col N="1484" /> assume that the introduction of the green pound would, of itself, not create problems.  It would create problems, including the increase in the cost of living here.  We accept that the agricultural community is in considerable difficulty at the present time. On that account we would certainly consider that it would be appropriate that sacrifices should be made by the rest of the community, if necessary, in order to assist the agricultural sector which is suffering very considerable difficulties.</P>
    <P>I do not think I will be able to cover all of the points that were raised in this debate but I will do my best. On the general issue of the economy, Senator Lenihan was prepared to challenge me for not giving an adequate picture of the economy at the present time and what the Government propose to do about it. On the last occasion on which I did this in the Seanad Senator Lenihan told me I should not have done it, that I used the occasion for the purpose of giving a picture of the economy when I ought to have confined myself to the Bill.  I do not mind doing my best to please Senator Lenihan even if his tastes and demands change from time to time.</P>
    <P>It is true that the economic situation at home and abroad has changed considerably since the budget, but it has confirmed the correctness of the decisions which we took on this year's budget.  The latest statistics show that at the time of the budget the economy was suffering from a greater depression than was then considered to exist.  So the very stimulus which we gave to the economy in the budget of this year has been fully justified.  Since then, the statistics not only show that we were correct but we were more correct than either ourselves or any other commentators at the time.</P>
    <P>A number of adverse developments have modified our expectations this year.  It will be recalled that in the budget I set as a target to increase the growth rate by 1 to 1½ per cent to bring it up to 4¾ per cent.  Unfortunately, that target situation has dis-improved. The foreign economies with which we trade have not recovered as <Col N="1485" /> fast as we had hoped in the first half of the year, but this gives reason to believe that the trading picture may improve substantially in the second half, because there are now signs of improvements in other countries.</P>
    <P>We must also take into account unprecedented rises in world commodity prices and critical oil shortages, which affected production and created uncertainties in supplies.  In these countries with which we have trading relationships these caused a considerable shock to business confidence, with the result that they have not advanced as fast as we would have thought they would.  The prospects, however, are tempered by the tendency which a number of major countries have recently shown to seek to overcome their difficulties by deflationary action.  This deflationary action in other countries has, of course, a damaging effect upon our own export trade.  In other words, these other countries are indulging in the very practice which they themselves condemned. Last December, January and February, they condemned the beggar-my-neighbour policies.  They condemned them at home in their own countries; they condemned them at international organisations at which many Ministers of the Government, including myself were present, because all intelligent people recognised that if efforts were made to correct the economic difficulties of the western world on beggar-my-neighbour policies the situation would be worsened considerably.</P>
    <P>Domestically, also, we had a number of harmful effects such as the nine week Dublin bus strike.  This has depressed output and spending.  We still have the continuing senseless bombing campaign of the enemies of all the Irish people.  This bombing campaign cannot but add to our difficulties because it affects investment, trade and tourism, apart altogether from the disastrous non-economic effects which it is having.  These mad bombers are robbers of our people because they are depriving our people of living standards which could be achieved if only the criminal bombing would stop.  As the mad bombers have <Col N="1486" /> stubbornly refused to avail of the many political opportunities which have been presented over the last five years, including the Sunningdale unique possibilities, they can no longer be regarded, if they ever had the right to be regarded, as persons with any political objectives.  It becomes more evident daily that irrespective of the colours they wear or claim to wear, be they green or orange, their true colours are the yellow of despicable cowards.  They are no better than the evil Mafia of another European island.  Their real objective is to intimidate whole communities in order that they themselves can fill their pockets with money robbed from banks, with personal profits which they take from subscriptions received from people who are naïve enough to believe that they are patriots, or money which they take from people sufficiently fearful to pay them protection money to avoid their premises being blown up or their lives or the lives of their loved ones being forfeited.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned before the appalling economic cost of this insanity. If it were involuntary insanity it could be forgiven but it is not; it is an evil and deliberately arranged campaign of violence against the people by people who can only get for themselves personal profit as there is no other objective which the bombing campaign can possibly achieve.</P>
    <P>We must accept it while it lasts and we also must accept economic forces over which we have no control.  There is no need to be despondent.  We hope to achieve this year a growth rate close to 4 per cent which, as Senator Halligan and others pointed out, is quite a remarkable achievement in the European context this year&mdash;indeed, in the world context.  This rate is the best that will be achieved in any of the member states of the EEC, with the exception of France.  It is important to remember again that we would not be achieving this growth if we had not got the economic stimulus of this year's budget coupled with the impetus which was also given to our economy by last year's budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> Even though the Central Bank and other people, for monetary reasons, may draw attention to the danger of over-stimulation, the fact has to be acknowledged that we would not now be in the position of growth in which we are and would not have achieved the plateau of comparative improvement which we now have, if we did not have this growth over the last two years.</P>
    <P>There are a few difficult areas to which I should like to draw attention because they are definite and disturbing. I refer to prices and the balance of payments.  The trends in these two areas are, of course, closely related. The higher import prices for oil and other essential commodities have had a substantial impact on the trade balance and on home prices.  During the first six months of 1974 the import excess worsened by £138 million or almost 90 per cent.  This was as a result primarily of higher oil and other commodity prices and, unfortunately, a disappointingly slow growth in agricultural exports.  Even if there were to be no further disimprovement in the trade balance for the remainder of the year, the deficit in the balance of payments on current account could reach £200 million.  Because of the time which will elapse before the fall in world commodity prices reaches our shores through import prices, a further unfortunate disimprovement could take place.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, our external reserves are high.  They are virtually as high as they were this time last year, reflecting international and domestic confidence in our economy, and reflecting also&mdash; and it is important to emphasise this because of the great success this country has had in getting loans on an international market which is hard and difficult at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is because we have a very good track record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The tremendous success we had is without precedent. This year other sovereign countries, including countries which are much more wealthy than ours failed where we have succeeded significantly.  We <Col N="1488" /> achieved on the world market the best loan which any sovereign State obtained this year.  It is clear that the balance of payments problem which had receded from us is menacing us once again but this will be carefully monitored in coming months.</P>
      <P>The trend of prices is also worrying. The inevitable delay which I mentioned before the fall in world commodity prices reaches us means that imported inflation will continue to force up domestic prices for some months to come.  As a result, we are unlikely to see the annual increase for 1974 showing much, if any, improvement on the rise of 16 per cent which we had to endure between May, 1973 and May, 1974.</P>
      <P>Because of the experience of the last 18 months or so there is a danger that we may delude ourselves into believing that all our economic ills and particularly the virus of inflation are of external origin and consequently there is little we can do but wait until the fever abates.  We never pretended in Government that they were entirely of external origin; we never failed to recognise that they were partly attributable to domestic forces.  But the reality has to be faced &mdash;and this is one which, with all due respect, the Central Bank did not give enough attention to in the recent report&mdash;that over half of the inflation suffered by this country at present comes from abroad.  If we had not imported any inflation last year, the rate of inflation at home would have been 8 per cent, which would have been low by any standards.</P>
      <P>Cost inflation has been the bugbear of the Irish economy for a long time past, and before we took up office we had the worst record of all Europe in the inflation stakes.  That situation has changed.  We are not the worst; we are now half way down the league table in the OECD statistics.</P>

      <P>No, we are not the worst in the EEC, but listening to some Fianna Fáil speakers it would appear they would like us to become the worst because they have been demanding further and further expenditure, <Col N="1489" /> and they have also been demanding, as, indeed, we want, higher prices for our agricultural produce, but higher prices for our agricultural produce, because we are an agricultural exporting nation, would mean a higher rate of inflation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 16.2 per cent in the last 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for our current inflation is the price of oil. Fianna Fáil policy would be to cut off the supply of oil and reduce inflation as a consequence.  Inflation is undesirable and should be avoided, but it is important to remember that there are aspects of inflation which are a reflection of things over which we have no control, and they are also an indication that incomes in Ireland can be rising.  Where the agricultural sector of our economy improves their income it has an immediate impact on our rate of inflation.  You can look at one side of the argument and consider that all is evil, but it is also important to remember that there are benefits accruing to this country as well.</P>
      <P>We must not overlook that excessive increases in income&mdash;and that means not merely wages but incomes of all kinds, including dividends, professional earnings, the profits of speculation, <i>et cetera</i>&mdash;have an undesirable impact on our economy.  Between the years 1970 and 1973 domestic incomes rose by almost 66 per cent, whereas the real growth in GNP was only 15 per cent.  The divergence between these figures was mainly responsible for the rise in prices in that period.  That was before we had to suffer the disadvantage of imported inflation at the rate at which it is now operating.  It is clear that unless we can exercise restraint in our own demands for increased remuneration we can face a vicious circle of unprecedented inflation.  We want to avoid this and the Government's energies will be directed towards doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the ending of the oil supplies shortage was economically beneficial in the short run, it might <Col N="1490" /> have been better psychologically for the country if the shortage was still with us.  If the people still had to queue in their cars for petrol, if they still had to suffer a little coolness in their homes because of shortage of oil for central heating, if industrialists and all users of oil were rationed, then the country as a whole would be conscious of the fact that the oil crisis is still with us.</P>
    <P>The oil crisis has two aspects.  One is shortage, that is the smaller aspect; the other one, which is even more dangerous, is the strain it puts on our economy and financial resources because of the high cost of fuel.  The growing deficits in our balance of payments attributable in the main to oil and to other essential commodity prices such as fertilisers and timber. It has one positive aspect, that is, that there has been a very substantial increase this year of 40 per cent in the importation of goods for capital investment, showing tremendous and unprecedented confidence in our society and economy.</P>
    <P>Unfavourable factors are the downturn in agricultural exports and recession in the economies of our trading partners.  These difficulties, combined with inflation, both imported and domestically generated, called for a moderation in the rate of economic expansion.  I emphasise it is moderation in the rate of economic expansion and it is not a question, and we must not allow it to become a question, of having a depression.  The blunt fact is that it will cost us more in future to stand still, because our first claim upon our recources must be payment of the bills for energy and other essential commodities.  We can mark time without risk.  If we were to attempt to increase our rate of expansion to a level which would be impossible to maintain in the remainder of 1974 and throughout 1975, we could put at risk the progress already made.  We can avoid deflation or a recession in the future if we have sufficient patience and wisdom to be satisfied for a little while with our current standards.</P>
    <P>It is not by any means a time for depression, still less for despair certainly <Col N="1491" /> not for alarm, but it is a time for realism and certainly a time for cutting the national cloth according to our measure.  As Senator Halligan says, there is grave instability everywhere in the world.  We cannot expect world trading relationships to operate as they did in the past.</P>
    <P>Our approach to current problems and the way in which we overcome present and future difficulties must be influenced not so much by what are regarded as the orthodox policies of the past, many of which are now, in any event, irrelevant.  We must face facts and overcome them by using modern techniques.  The task of maintaining and improving our international competitiveness at the present time must be a priority.  It is something which has to be tackled. It cannot be tackled by the Government alone.  If a Government do it without co-operation the end result is far from being what we want, and that is a united and contented community working in co-operation.</P>
    <P>To close the gap in our balance of trade and at the same time maintain our living standards, we must expand exports at a faster rate than anything we previously achieved or even contemplated. This makes the poor performance in our agricultural exports all the more frustrating and disappointing. While the prices of industrial raw materials have shot up, so too have our labour costs.  Last year, despite the near record growth in productivity, unit wage costs in manufacturing industry rose by 11 per cent. It is pertinent to point out to everybody, including our friends in the Central Bank, who also criticised the rise in our unit wage costs, that they would have risen by much more last year if productivity had not risen by 7 per cent and productivity would not have risen by 7 per cent if this country did not follow the budgetary policies of the National Coalition.  It is no harm to emphasise that at this stage when I see there are some wise commentators and hurlers on the ditch suggesting that the Government have no economic policy.  It is our economic policies that have been this <Col N="1492" /> country's salvation in a very difficult time.  If we had not maintained this productivity and growth and achieved what we set out to achieve, then we would have at the present time what apparently the Fianna Fáil Party would have achieved.  This would not be their intention but they strongly criticised the budget of 1973 and 1974&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They said it was too expansionary and too inflationary. Again, I would point out that while some people selected certain passages from the Report of the Central Bank, they did not refer to that section of the Central Bank Report which pointed out that the budget this year did not add to inflation because it did not increase prices and that that in itself was beneficial.</P>
      <P>I have drawn attention on a number of occasions to the basic economic fact that increases in money incomes in excess of the growth of national production are self-defeating.  The price increases which are an inevitable consequence always swallow up the illusory income improvements.  No system of price control, however stringent, can be devised which will prevent such increases if the money supply is too great.  The mere maintenance of living standards for all can be achieved only through economic growth and proper management of the national resources.  This will remain a prime objective of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time the Taoiseach is speaking in another place and is emphasising that the Government regard housing as a top priority.  In 1972-73 before we achieved power, the Exchequer housing allocations were £52 million.  Last year they were £80 million and the corresponding figures for the current year are £105 million.  The Government will continue to ensure that the life-breath of housing&mdash;mortgage finance &mdash;is made available.  This is no easy task at any time, but particularly at a time when we are building more houses than ever before and when the cost of building those houses is about <Col N="1493" /> 30 per cent higher than it was a year ago.  It is higher for a variety of reasons, including the higher costs of materials and labour.  The world scarcity of money which was unprecedented since the 1930's, and the increased demand on that money caused by global inflation and the demand for increased credit to purchase oil and other essential commodities, have made it very difficult to acquire and maintain the necessary flow of mortgage finance.  The worldwide un-precedentedly high interest rates, in other words the price of money, adds to this burden.  As it is a priority, we will continue to ensure that it gets priority attention.</P>
    <P>These difficulties are compounded domestically by the additional money required by traders and importers and by industry in general to purchase essential imports, all of which or most of which are still at prices higher than last year.  Extra money is also needed to pay increases in wages following on the national wage agreement and to pay for the essential and publicly demanded expansion in the public capital programme for agriculture, industry, construction of houses, schools, hospitals, roadways, telephones and the whole infrastructure of our State, which must be vastly improved if we are to absorb the improvements in our economy which are so essential.</P>
    <P>I think the source of money for housing matters little.  Whether building societies, banks, trustee savings banks or commercial banks are the source it does not matter.  What is important is that the money is made available.  Our building societies have been very successful in the past in supplying part of the money which is required for essential housing purposes and the Government's intention is to maintain building societies as a very significant element in the provision of money for housing. Money supplies increased by 23.3 per cent in the 12 months to May, 1974. In the same period the resources of the Associated Banks rose by 21 per cent.  The non-associated banks rose by 44 per cent and the building societies by 19 per cent.  How then, did <Col N="1494" /> any difficulty arise in respect of the supply of mortgage finance with a rise in 19 per cent in building society funds?  It was, of course, primarily because under this Government more houses were being built, which required more money and unfortunately the cost of the houses was also rising.</P>
    <P>The good news which I have for the people and for those interested in buying houses and the bad news I have for those whose only objective in life is to obstruct their political opponents is that the Government have succeeded in negotiating with the Associated Banks a further loan of £5 million for the building societies. This money the sniggerers regard as not of any importance but it is, in addition to the £6 million which was obtained last year, a massive injection from the banks into the building societies which would not have been achieved without direct Government intervention and without the subsidy which the Government are providing in the interest rates which would be charged by the banks.</P>
    <P>The principal reason why growth in building societies' resources, while significant because it is 19 per cent higher than it was last year, has not kept pace with growth in other deposits, has been that the societies lost the interest rate advantage that they formerly had over the banks, an interest rate advantage which was as much as 3½ to 4 per cent not so long ago.  This development has occurred because while the banks have to increase their rates as a consequence of the decline in world rates, the societies did not raise their rates to the same extent&mdash;thus the differential in favour of the building societies disappeared. At certain levels the deposit rate offered by other institutions exceeded those offered by the building societies.</P>
    <P>The Government fully appreciate that money flows to the most attractive interest rates available.  The Government, observing the international money market and recognising that high interest rates are likely to remain with us for a long time&mdash;much as we would wish them to go away they will <Col N="1495" /> not go away because we are living in a world of inflation at present&mdash;pro-pose to enter into immediate discussions with the building societies to consider what steps should be taken to improve on a more permanent basis the flow of money into building societies.  If the choice is between high interest rates on one hand and the availability of money for housing on the other I think there is no choice but to ensure the provision of money for housing.  The State is already giving considerable subsidies to people who are purchasing houses through building societies.  The State would be prepared to continue to play its part while interest rates remain at a very high level.  But the facts of life, unpleasant though they may be, will have to be faced by everybody, not merely by Government but by the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not expect Senator Lenihan to say &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; for £50 million.  There were several questions of detail which perhaps could be best taken up on Committee Stage next week.  In the time that is left there are a few that I should like to deal with.</P>
      <P>Senator Killilea, for instance, suggested that there was something unfair about this year's Finance Bill.  He said that a man with 1,000 acres in the Curragh, with a stud farm and training racehorses, would not pay income tax while a married man with four children with a job in Galway and a farm of 16 acres of a valuation of £20 would pay income tax on both his farm and on his wage in a factory. Seeing that he was not aware that farm guesthouses were being specifically exempted from involvement in the tax net I can only assume that he has not read the Bill. I thought first of all that it was a question of it being beyond his understanding but when he cannot even see a simple exclusion at section 16 I am not surprised that he made this other allegation.</P>
      <P>Stud farming as such is taxable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> The only item in relation to stud farming which will not be taxable are the fees earned from stallions that are standing in this country.  The reason for that is because stallions are owned internationally.  In fact, the majority of stallions in this country are owned by foreigners and by syndicates.  The tax exemption here ensures that these animals remain in this country and operates to the benefit of the whole horse breeding industry in this country.  There was talk about pressures from a small section of the community who wanted a particular advantage for themselves.  What struck me was that the plea for the continuing exemption in respect of stallions came from the small people with brood mares and from the large number of employees of the stud farms.  This is an industry that can be switched from one end of the world to the other simply by hiring planes and putting the stallions aboard them.  That is the only reason why that activity has been exempted.  The farming of the 1,000 acres in Kildare that Senator Killilea mentioned will be fully taxable but what will not be taxable at all is the profits on a farm of a £20 rateable valuation.</P>
    <P>What we are endeavouring to do in respect of a person who has income outside the farm is to deal with the anomaly, indeed the scandal, that can arise, whereby the wife of a well-to-do farmer can be working at a job outside the farm, and because she is working at that job she is able to set off against her non-farm income all the allowances&mdash;the married allowance and the children's allowances&mdash; against her salary because the farm income is exempt from farm tax.  The end result is that the fortunate lady and her husband pay no tax at all. Working side by side with that lady in the same hospital ward or the same factory bench could be the wife of a labourer.  She would earn the same income as the wife of the farmer.  The labourer could have an income that would be only a fraction of that of the farmer, yet both the labourer and the labourer's wife would be obliged to pay tax at the full rate.  That is an intolerable situation and one that has <Col N="1497" /> been the cause of great scandal and great annoyance.  That is the situation which we are bringing to an end&mdash; not in any harsh way.  We are providing a sliding scale so that a person could have a rateable valuation of up to £30 and still have income outside the farm without being seriously caught in any way.  Our objective in Government is to achieve a code of taxation which will ensure that people with comparable incomes pay a comparable amount of tax.</P>
    <P>While there has been very strong criticism from the Fianna Fáil benches of many provisions in our Finance Bill, no one has said the courage to stand up and say he challenges the principle which we assert. In fact, in disagreeing with our proposals they are in practice challenging the very principle of a fair tax code in which we believe.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan asked me to give clarifications in respect of sections 16 and 28.  Section 16 is designed to prevent a person who has a farm and is also carrying on a trade or profession from escaping tax by attributing to his farm profits, profits which had derived from other occupations. I have quoted in another <Col N="1498" /> place a case which illustrates what we are out to combat.  A vet claimed he was earning something less than £1,500 from his veterinary practice and yet claimed to be earning £46,000 profit from a comparatively small farm.  If that is a typical farm, then I have been extremely foolish in applying a multiplier of only 40 to every £1 of rateable valuation of farm land.</P>
    <P>One either tolerates these scandals or one attempts to stop them.  I am not surprised at the amount of criticism to which we have been subjected for bringing in anti-avoidance measures of this nature.  There is not one of us who if we were enjoying a tax haven of that kind would not wish it to continue and would not be particularly nasty in the epithets we applied to those who tried to correct it.  The very vehemence of the Opposition, as Senator Robinson mentioned, is an indication that we are going on the right lines and that we are on the way to economic salvation and fiscal reform.  I look forward next week to having a very useful debate and exchange with the Seanad on the individual items in the Finance Bill.</P>
