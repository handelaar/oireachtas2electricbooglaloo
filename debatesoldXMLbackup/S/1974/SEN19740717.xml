      <P>I had intended to ask the Leader of the House if it was proposed to sit tomorrow but since I have now ascertained that it is, I propose to amend the Order of Business by adding No. 7 on today's Order Paper to the list of Bills to be considered today.</P>

      <P>I realise that there is always the argument at this time of the <Col N="1066" /> year that there is already enough business for us.  However, it is my belief that the important social problem dealt with in this Bill is far more significant than the convenience of Members of this House and, furthermore, that it is the other side of the whole adoption question and embraces the legislation which we are passing.  I do not think that we are justified in passing an Adoption Bill on the lines of the Bill put forward by the Government without facing up to the situation of the single mother and removing the discrimination against illegitimate children in this country. Therefore, I formally move an amendment to the Order of Business that item No. 7 be taken and that a Second Reading be given to this Bill before the House rises for the summer.  The Illegitimate Children (Maintenance and Succession) Bill is closely linked with the subject matter before us today.  It raised a very important social issue and unless we change the discrimination against the illegitimate child and improve the position of the single mother in our society we cannot, in conscience, allow an Adoption Bill to be passed along the lines proposed.</P>

      <P>This appears to me to be an eminently reasonable request on the part of Senator Robinson.  Perhaps it could be included in tomorrow's business which is rather light.  We only have the Agricultural (Amendment) Bill and possibly a motion, I take it on which we are all agreed, in regard to the pension scheme of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  So perhaps we could take Senator Robinson's Bill tomorrow.  I would certainly agree with that course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the Senator herself and for the House but the case she has been making for the amendment is that the House could not in conscience pass the Adoption Bill which is ordered for today unless at the same time they take No. 7. It does not seem that her attitude would be quite consistent to withdraw her amendment today and put it down tomorrow when the Adoption Bill, hopefully, will have passed.  However, it is a matter entirely for the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I could only withdraw the proposed amendment on the understanding that it would be taken tomorrow.  I would do that to prevent the House voting unnecessarily.  If there is no such understanding then I would have to press the amendment to the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Royal Hospital for Incurables, Dublin (Charter Amendment) Order, 1974,</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. R. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>As explained in the explanatory memorandum which accompanied the draft order circulated to Senators, the Management Committee of the Royal Hospital for Incurables, Dublin, applied for an order to be made substituting the Royal Hospital, Donnybrook as the name of the hospital instead of the Royal Hospital for Incurables, Dublin. This hospital is more than 200 years in existence and discharges well an important function in the health field.  It caters for 244 patients at any one time.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay a tribute to all associated with the hospital for their compassionate and charitable endeavours. The change which basically omits the word &ldquo;incurables&rdquo; from the title is one which I think needs no public justification other than to mention it.</P>
      <P>The draft order which is now before the House will provide for the legal change in the name of the hospital and, accordingly, I would ask the House for approval.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>Before section 2 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In any matter, application or proceedings before the Board of any court relating to the arrangements for or the making of an adoption order, the Board or the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am moving this amendment in the very momentary absence of Senator Robinson who has gone to fetch a copy of the Official Report of our last sitting day which contains the winding-up speech of the Minister for Justice.  She and other Senators have, perhaps, been slightly discommoded if they were not here on that occasion by not having had copies of the debate until today.  I have her authorisation to proceed with the amendment, if that is in order.</P>
      <P>This is basically a very simple amendment.  It states a principle and while in general the idea of inserting principles into an Act as opposed to fairly detailed legal procedures seems to me to be unnecessary, in a matter as important as adoption, dealing with such sensitive and delicate matters, it is in order to write a principle like this into legislation.  The welfare of the child is the first and paramount consideration that should be in an Adoption Bill and I would be interested to hear the views of the Minister for Justice on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for not <Col N="1070" /> being here to move the amendment and I thank Senator Horgan for having done so.</P>
      <P>This section is modelled on section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, and it is introduced here for very similar reasons.  In legislation of this sort it is necessary that the legislative intent be clear and the legislative intent in the Guardianship of Infants Act made it clear that the welfare of the child must be paramount.  That is a good section and it has been interpreted positively by the courts; it has been useful to the courts and it has been referred to in many custody cases.  I have been present in court when applications were made for custody and I have heard the judge refer to that section and interpret that it is the welfare of the child that is the most important consideration.</P>
      <P>In a sense, in relation to the Guardianship of Infants Act there was a neutral situation, whereas in adoption we have to go from a bias of quite a different sort.  One of the main criticisms that has been made down through the years about our adoption legislation is that it has been mother-centred.  That phrase is subject to misunderstanding and it could be a hurtful phrase because the way in which it has been used suggests that it is the intention of the Legislature to take away all the rights of the unmarried mother who places her child for adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it might help to indicate that I would be prepared to accept this amendment.  I agree that the tenor and the whole emphasis of these Acts should be in favour of the child, that they should be child-centred.  I have always felt that was the proper approach to them.  It was a misunderstanding that caused them to be considered as mother-centred.  The legalities involved in adoption procedure have to involve the mother.  She is the person who is there on the scene and this has led to these misunderstandings, but the whole emphasis behind all the Acts in the beginning has been in the direction of the child.  It is good that it now be spelled out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank <Col N="1071" /> the Minister for accepting this amendment. I agree with him that the paramount consideration ought to be the welfare of the child.  The criticism that legislation is mother-centred has resulted from a very real underlying problem which related to the consent procedure.  The climate of opinion at the time of the introduction of the Adoption Act, 1952, and the way in which it was debated at that time did not proclaim in the way we are now prepared to proclaim in a clause such as this that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration.  A similar phrase has been useful to the courts in the Guardianship of Infants Act.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has accepted the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>2.  In page 2 before section 2 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>2. (1)  In any case where a person has applied for an adoption order relating to a child and any person whose consent to the making of an adoption order relating to the child is necessary and who has agreed to the placing of the child for adoption either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)  fails, neglects or refuses to give his consent, or</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)  withdraws a consent already given,</P>
      <P>the applicant for the adoption order may apply to the High Court for an order under this section.</P>
      <P>(2)  The High Court, if it is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the child so to do, may make an order under this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)  giving custody of the child to the applicant for such period as the Court may determine, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)  authorising the Board to dispense with the consent of the other person referred to in subsection (1) of this section to the <Col N="1072" /> making of an adoption order in favour of the applicant during the period aforesaid.</P>
    <P>(3)  The consent of a ward of court shall not be dispensed with by virtue of a High Court Order under this section except with the sanction of the Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill proposes that the consent of the child's mother or guardian or any person having charge or control over the child, should not be necessary in the making of an adoption order where custody of the child has been awarded to any person by the High Court.  Section 14 (3) of the Principal Act provides that the consent of a ward of court shall not be dispensed with except with the sanction of the court.  This is in respect of those cases where consent, under the law as it stands, may be dispensed with where the person whose consent would otherwise be necessary is of unsound mind or cannot be found.  The proposal in the Bill is that even in cases where the High Court has awarded custody of the child to the prospective adopters the consent of a ward of court may not be dispensed with, save by leave of the court.  If the person whose consent was necessary was other than a ward of court then the consent could be dispensed with without the leave of the court but if that person is a ward of court the consent is still necessary.  This is a drafting amendment and it is put down for the purpose of clarification. I am advised that the section as it stands may not enable adoptive parents to have access to the High Court.  It was drafted originally on the assumption that this right would be implicit in the provisions of the section but I am advised that that is not necessarily so and the amendment is to cure that possible defect.  The amendment makes it clear that they have this right of access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Custody of a child is never awarded indefinitely.  Consequently it is necessary to provide in the section that if the board wish to make an adoption order without being obliged to have the consent of the mother they must do so within the time specified by the court in the custody order.  Therefore, the <Col N="1073" /> purpose of this amendment is to clarify the position in the case of a mother who unduly delays giving her consent or withdraws her consent and leaves the matter hanging indefinitely.  It is to clarify the right of the adoptive parents to go to the court and to confirm that they have in fact this right of access to the High Court and to provide that the custody order must be for a definite period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one question to ask the Minister in relation to the second subsection of the new section 2, paragraph (<i>a</i>) where the High Court may give custody of the child to the applicant for such period as the court may determine.  What sort of situation does he envisage where such an order is made for a determinate period&mdash;what happens to the child at the end of that determinate period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If at the end of that period the adoption order is not made, which would be a most unlikely event, the whole point of the court procedure is to enable the adoptive parents to get this order, armed with which they can go to the Adoption Board.  So I do not think there would be many cases where the adoption order would not be made and the child left in Limbo, so to speak. The informal custody would continue in such cases and the child would be liable to be taken by the mother who had refused or failed to give her consent up to that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment. It is an improvement of the original section 2 as drafted.  One of the problems that might have arisen in relation to section 2 as drafted was, in my view, where we permit in section 6 a final consent to be made by the single mother after six weeks rather than six months as has hitherto been the rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like some clarification of section 2 (1) (b).  If the single mother should withdraw her consent before the adoption order has been finalised is the Minister satisfied she would be protected?  It is a very short period in which to give her final consent.  When the six weeks have elapsed, I take it if she wishes to withdraw her consent, <Col N="1074" /> the adoptive parents would apply to the court for custody under this procedure.  It seems to me to be a situation in which the single mother would not be adequately aware of her rights or her position.  Perhaps the Minister would care to comment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a matter for the court.  The rights of the child would have to be of paramount importance.  It would be up to the court to decide whether to make an order for custody.  It would seem to be most unlikely, in the situation suggested by the Senator, that the court would make an order for custody, if the mother, after such a short period, wanted to withdraw her consent.  What we want to deal with is the long unreasonable periods of delay in giving consent and also where an unreasonable length of time occurs between withdrawal of consent and action taken by the mother to take back her baby.  In the situation described by the Senator I think the court would not have any choice but to refuse an application for custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for that clarification. It may not be a satisfactory procedure for single mothers to have to defend custody proceedings in the High Court. I am not sure if the situation can be met through legislation, but it could be helped by having a system of free legal aid.  We are creating a position in which the single mother would not be either alerted or able to make her views known to the court in these proceedings unless she were assisted more than we appear to be assisting her in this particular section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a question of legal aid I hope legal aid will be available and overcome any difficulties there may be in that regard.  The obligation on the mother of having to go to court to defend her position is unavoidable once we decide the court is the tribunal that is to be used to decide the custody of the child.  This is unavoidable.  It is a handicap implicit in the right of any citizen to have the court's litigation to solve his or her dispute with a neighbour. That is what the courts are for. <Col N="1075" /> It is an inherent part of our system, one that we cannot change but we can ease it by providing legal aid.</P>
      <P>The situation which this section is meant to cure is one in which the mother will not be available to take part in the proceedings.  In a case where the mother has failed or refused to sign a consent, and her whereabouts are unknown, the court proceedings will take place in default of an appearance by the mother but the court will have to satisfy itself that proper efforts were made to ascertain her whereabouts and to serve notice of the proceedings.  If the mother is available, and her address is known, she will be served with notice of the proceedings and will have the option, like any citizen of appearing.  I do not think we can go further than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one matter; it flows from what Senator Robinson has said.  I am totally in favour of the Minister's amendment.  I think it improves the section.  There is one matter I raised on Second Stage about which I feel very strongly and in relation to which I agreed to an amendment in this House on the Succession Bill.  Disputes involving family relationships should be heard in chambers or in committee. This leads on to something the Minister referred to in his Second Stage speech&mdash; some kind of family court to deal with this whole area of family relationships, be it in the adoption area, succession area or the matrimonial area.  I do not think that this whole area of dispute is one for open court procedures.  I should like to hear the Minister comment on that.  I believe much of what Senator Robinson has just said in regard to the mother in that situation would be met if we had a more easy, informal type of court procedure rather than the conflict system of open litigation, which is ideal in matters not so subjective or personalised as this area is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with Senator Lenihan's point; much of the litigation that arises from family disputes should be heard in chambers.  I think the High Court will have an overriding right to decide that these applications may be held in chambers without <Col N="1076" /> any need for us to give them that power specifically in this section.  I shall check on that.  If I find that such power would have to be given specifically I will consider the position between now and the next Stage.  I shall also have it considered from the point of view of its general desirability.  I can see the absolute desirability of it in a case of desertion, maintenance proceedings, or separation proceedings where intimate matters relating to an existing marriage will be discussed and where children could be affected by the publicity.  It might not necessarily be as vital in a situation such as this, but I mention it as another point of view that would have to be considered between now and the next Stages.  It would arise from the case Senator Robinson has made of the need to inform the parties and to make sure that the mother is represented and present in court.  We want to avoid any suggestion that the adoptive parents, because they may be stronger financially and psychologically, would have an advantage by reason of proceedings in private.  I do not think they would but it is just another point of view.  I will certainly have a look at it between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two points to make.  I would like the Minister to tell us if he is satisfied that this very necessary change in the law will meet the needs of married couples of mixed religion in the matter of adoption. The huge majority of adoptions are made by adoption societies with fairly rigid denominational affiliations.  I have been looking at the list in the last report of the Adoption Board.  There are only three registered adoption societies who do not have a specific religious denotation.  They are the Dairdeas Adoption Society, which only arranged five adoptions last year; the National Maternity Hospital Adoption <Col N="1077" /> Society which arranged two adoptions last year and the Rotunda Girls Aid Society which arranged 45 adoptions last year.  Apart from those three&mdash;I suspect the Rotunda Girls Aid Society may be to some extent Protestant oriented&mdash;there are only the adoptions which are arranged by the health authorities or those arranged by third parties; these came to a total of 100.</P>
      <P>We are, in this Bill, trying to dispose of third party adoption completely. We have a situation in which it is very unlikely, for very strong conscientious reasons, that any of these religiously affiliated adoption societies will want to place a child belonging to their denomination with parents of mixed religions or, indeed, with parents of no particular religion at all.  I am just wondering whether the Minister has had any indication from societies like this that they are prepared to treat married couples of mixed religions or of no religion if you like, as fairly and squarely married couples of their own particular denomination.  Otherwise, the only access people in this position have to children for adoption is through the health board or, perhaps, through one or two of these other very very small societies which do not appear to do a great deal of adoption work at all.  I am just wondering about that and, in my Second Stage speech, I asked for information, which I now find in the report of the Adoption Board, about the extent to which adoptions are arranged through religious agencies and the extent to which they are arranged through non-religious agencies.  It seems to me that the figures in this report would point to the advisability of extending local authority adoption services through the health boards or, perhaps, in some other way.  I am not quite sure how this could be arranged.  It seems to me, if something is not done, we could find ourselves in a situation in which it is legally possible for people in this situation to adopt children but, <i>de facto</i>, they will find many doors are closed in their faces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other point I want to make on this section is a very minor drafting point.  It relates to the second line where we read the phrase &ldquo;the child and his parents, or, if the child is illegitimate, <Col N="1078" /> his mother...&rdquo;.  To my mind, this phrase &ldquo;the child and his parents&rdquo; in a context in which it is contrasted with illegitimacy, gives the very distinct impression of the child with married parents, a legally born child with married parents living, which, I am quite sure, is not the Minister's intention. I am just wondering whether, for the purpose of clarification, he might consider on Report Stage bringing in an amendment to meet what I think is the situation he is covering here, the situation of a child who is an orphan. There could certainly be the situation in which the child of a mixed marriage was an orphan and that might create problems.  It seems to me that, if what you mean in this phrase &ldquo;the child and his parents&rdquo; is that the child is an orphan, then this should be clearly written into the section.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister two questions.  First, if, when mothers are placing their children for adoption, they have any objection to placing their child in a mixed marriage and, secondly, do they specify the religion they wish that child to be brought up in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator Ahern's query, the question would only be put to the mother if, in the case of the proposed adoptive parents, they were of different religions from the mother or if either one of them was of a different religion from that of the mother.  It is provided in the section that, if they are not both of the same religion, then the mother must be informed of this and it is in that context that the question of information would arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Horgan's point is in ease not of children but of adoptive parents because it is well known that there are more adoptive parents than there are children for adoption.  To suggest making a case here for adoptive parents of mixed religions&mdash;I sympathise with their predicament&mdash;is not in any way in ease of the child.  No child is being deprived of adoption because the parents proposing to adopt are of differing religions. I do not know what the practice in adoption societies is with regard to whether they prefer a mixed marriage to people of the one religion, but I am <Col N="1079" /> sure it is a factor that is taken into account and, if societies are oriented to the churches, as they are, I have no doubt that that fact is taken into account.  Of course, it is incidental.  The important thing is the suitability of the parents as adoptive parents.  This is the main consideration of adoption societies. There is no way that I know, of ensuring, so to speak, that a certain proportion of children are made available to people of mixed marriages. People of mixed marriages will just have to hope, like any other parents applying for a child, that they will be able to get a child to be adopted by them.</P>
    <P>As I say, the emphasis in this legislation is in favour of the child and, if we were to attempt to do anything in this section to meet the point put forward by Senator Horgan, we would be departing from that principle.  One must naturally sympathise with parents in a mixed marriage; they will, undoubtedly, have more difficulty, because of the religious affiliation of societies, in getting children for adoption.  The recent High Court case showed the demand for such adoptions.  As far as the children are concerned that law, as it stands, is in their interest and does not in any way prejudice any child from being placed for adoption.</P>

      <P>Was it?  In any case, it is to do with the adoptive parents being of different religions.  Without necessarily losing our faith, I hope we will <Col N="1080" /> soon be able to move away from categorising people by their religious faith or their differing religious faiths. I was given an illustration of this recently by the sort of problem experienced by a very distinguished father working in Nigeria&mdash;an Irishman married to an Irish girl of a different religion who wishes to have his children educated in an Irish school.  He filled in the application forms and, when the school saw the forms, they rejected the children because the religious denomination of the children was put down as &ldquo;Christian&rdquo;.  The father would not specify further because he wished to bring them up as Christians and he was not prepared to specify whether they were Protestants, Catholics or what-have-you.  If you look at the religious base for these divisions, the father was in the right, but the school, which happened to be a Protestant school, rejected the children and said they could not accept them unless they were put down either as Protestant, with the Protestant domination specified, or Roman Catholic.  In that case they would be prepared to consider the application but &ldquo;Christians&rdquo; were out. I hope we can move towards the day when &ldquo;Christians&rdquo; will be in and denominations will be out.</P>
      <P>I am not so sure that the problems are solved by the decision of the High Court, because I think that perfectly good adoptive parents of differing religions will find it extremely difficult to adopt children, not because they are not legally suitable or because they are not sociologically suitable but just because our adoption societies are all attached to one or other Church.  I know that there are other methods of adopting where one does not necessarily have to go through a society but I believe the great majority of adoptions are carried out through adoption societies.  I think that the problem will still arise because of our complex about denominations. I hope that the day will soon come when we talk about people being Christians, when that will be the category in which we are interested and not whether someone is a Roman Catholic or a Presbyterian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicated in his last part of the speech that the obstacles <Col N="1081" /> had been removed.  He gave me the impression that there had already been a successful adoption as a result of the High Court decision.  Maybe I am putting words into his mouth, but does he know?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>The case in question! Just because they have brought the action and the case has been adjudicated in their favour does not mean they will be able to go ahead and adopt.  People have been to see me recently about this and said that the adoption societies were not interested.  Could the Minister for Justice say something about the procedure for people who do not go through adoption societies?  There is a perfectly legal channel for people who do not go through adoption societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, might I say that we cannot, in legislation, provide that a certain percentage of children must be made available to people of differing religions.  This cannot be provided for in legislation.  Even if we did make the provision in legislation, it could not be enforced because who has the right to say to a mother that her child should not be placed with parents of differing religions, and that the child should be placed in a home where both parents are of the same religion as herself?  The mother has this right and she must continue to have this right.  It would be futile for us to say that a certain number of children must be available for people of differing religions.  There is nothing we can do legislatively.  We can indicate that we would like to see people of differing religions being able to adopt children</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adoption in this country happens, by and large, to be organised around the Churches.  It is a fair assumption that the Churches will ensure that children will be placed with parents who both belong to their particular denomination.  Not all societies are attached to the Churches.  The health boards are successors to the public assistance authorities.  They are adoption societies.  They can place children and the same considerations will <Col N="1082" /> possibly not apply there.  That might be the most hopeful area for a couple of a mixed marriage.  We certainly cannot cure the position in legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I really wanted to make&mdash;the Minister has, in a way, agreed with me on it&mdash;is that we cannot write into legislation a section which says that &ldquo;X&rdquo; number of children have to be reserved for a certain type of married couple.  In answer to my first point he said, effectively, that he accepts, when it comes to adoption, that mixed marriage couples are less favourably off than couples of the same religion.  I think I am right in interpreting the Minister as regretting the situation which arises, partly because of the large numbers of religiously related adoption societies and partly because of the surplus of would-be adopters over children available for adoption.  I would appeal to him to use whatever influence he has with the health boards to extend their services because it seems to me that this is, as he said, virtually the only way in which these people would have a chance of adopting a child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ahern asked what questions were asked by the registered adoption societies and the Minister said he did not know.  Very few of us know very much about adoption societies.  That includes the Minister too.  There is a particular difficulty here because the Minister is not the Minister responsible. I would have been glad for some information about the procedures adopted by the health authorities with specific relevance to this question of adoption by people of mixed religions or no religion.  While we accept the section I think it is important to get this on the record.  The situation is still <Col N="1083" /> not the way we would really like it to be when it comes to an adopted child in a mixed marriage situation.  We find it impossible to do anything about this in legislation and we express our regret that it should be so.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P>In page 2, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>4. (1)  Notwithstanding anything contained in section 11 of the Principal Act (as amended by section 5 of the Act of 1964), in any case where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a child is in the care of a married couple who have made an application for an adoption order in relation to that child, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the wife dies before the making of the adoption order, the Board may make an adoption order relating to that child on the application of the widower: Provided that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the widower has, at the date of his application another child in his custody, and</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(ii)  every person, whose consent to the making of the adoption order is required by section 14 of the Principal Act or by section 2 of the Act of 1964, knows, when he gives his consent, that the applicant is a widower.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is designed to introduce a new principle into adoption in that it permits a widower to adopt in certain limited circumstances.  It provides for the adoption of a child by a widower where an application for an adoption order had been made by a man and his wife but the order had not actually been <Col N="1084" /> made at the time of the wife's death. One can see that as a tragic situation. A child has been placed with a couple and the wife dies; the child, under the law as it stands, would have to be removed from that household, notwithstanding that there might already be an adopted child in that household. This could cause considerable personal tragedy to the child already in the household and to the widower.  The proviso here is that there should be another child in his custody, either a natural child or an adopted child.</P>
      <P>The section does not propose any further restriction on the discretion of the board, though the board no doubt, will have to approach any such application with great caution having regard to the interests of the child.  There are strong arguments against allowing a widower to adopt.  The section provides that the widower must again apply for an order in the sense that the order previously applied for by himself and his wife has fallen and, if he wants to retain the child, he must apply again. The mother, or any other person, whose consent to the adoption is required must then know that the applicant is a widower.  It is designed to deal with a very narrow type of possibility but I think it is a desirable amendment.  I do know of one specific case of hardship that it will ease.</P>

      <P>I would like to support this amendment but I wonder whether it is, in fact, too restrictive.  I note in section 11 of the Principal Act that among the categories of those who may adopt at present it is provided &ldquo;If <Col N="1085" /> the applicant is a widow.&rdquo;  I can see certain circumstances where it would not be desirable to allow an application made by a widower to succeed, but surely the proper course would be to leave discretion to the board in the circumstances to look at the position? I wonder whether in writing in the type of restrictions which are in this amendment we are going to create possible hardship because the widower concerned does not fit into exactly this sort of relationship.  For example, they might not have made a formal application before the wife died even though they intended to.  I would welcome the simple extension of the category of those who may adopt to include widowers.  I would prefer to leave it to the discretion of the board whether they would consent to making an adoption order in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer to start from a narrow base and in the light of experience, perhaps, widen it rather than to give a total discretion in this area.  That is not to say that I do not have the greatest confidence in the board&mdash;I do&mdash;but it is well-settled adoption practice that in general, widowers should not adopt children. Normally the single man is not as domesticated as a woman.  He might not be capable of providing the necessary care that a small baby would require.  There is the other difficulty that if the child in question is a female, one has to bear in mind that there might not be such a tremendous age gap between the widower and the child and that could result in problems in later years.  One has to bear in mind that they would not be blood relations and there could be a difficult situation in that particular household.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an area where there are difficulties of that type which do not arise in the case of adoption by a widow.  For these reasons we have to approach it very circumspectly indeed.  I would prefer to leave the section as it is and see how it operates in practice and see if there is a demand for widening it.  It may be justified at a later date to widen it.  It is not my belief, as I said on Second Stage that the law on this subject is immutable or that it should have to wait a decade before being amended.  If there is a need <Col N="1086" /> for amendment at an earlier date this can be proposed to the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>This is the section of the Bill which seems to be the doing away with third party placements.  This was something that I had intended to refer to on Second Stage but I failed to do so.  However, that gap was more than adequately filled by Senator Alexis FitzGerald who asked the Minister whether he was really satisfied that such a thing was necessary.  The number of third party placements last year according to the Adoption Board Report was 21.  I myself have no evidence that any of these adoptions were carried out with any greater degree of risk to the welfare of the child than adoptions carried out in any other way.  For that reason I am not basically in favour of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another reason I am not in favour of the section is because I think&mdash;again coming back to the discussion we had on the earlier section&mdash;third party placements are at the moment, but will cease to be after the passing of this Bill if it includes this section, one of the few <Col N="1087" /> ways by which couples of mixed religion or of none will possibly have access to children capable of being adopted other than through registered adoption societies which are related to religious denominations.  There seems to be a certain anomaly in the fact that while third party placement is to disappear, direct placement by the mother herself is to remain.  It has been argued very forcibly to me by somebody with very widespread experience in the work of adoption that it can be dangerous and perhaps a threat to the welfare of the child if the natural mother of the child is personally aware of the identities of the adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>I would think that if you were to set the two things against each other&mdash; third party placement and direct placement by the mother&mdash;it could be argued very strongly that the degree of risk involved in third party placement is much less than the degree of risk involved in direct placement by the mother with people whose identity she actually knows.  This section, to my mind, should if anything be the other way round to ensure that the actual identity of the adoptive parents is not known by the natural mother of the child and to allow third party placement to go on in the very small way that it has been going on up to now.  Is the Minister in possession of any actual evidence about the risks or failures of third party adoptions which lead him to introduce this section of the Bill or did he simply introduce it because he was asked to do so by the registered adoption societies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Ahern has a point when she says that it would be freelancing and it would.  It is well accepted and is basic to adoption that there be full investigation at pre-placement and post-placement stages. Indeed, there is an amendment in <Col N="1088" /> Senator Robinson's name which is directed to try to ensure this.  The emphasis all the time is on improving the standards being applied by the adoption societies in their work in the placement of children.  It would be contrary to this and would cut right across the basic principles of adoption if one were to permit private placements, because they imply no scientific or professional research into the suitability of the new home or the compatibility of that new home with the child in question.  It is not something that I am introducing because I have been asked to do so by the adoption societies; I am introducing it because this has been one of the demands for change by all adoption workers in their criticism of the old Acts.  This demand on the part of adoption workers to prohibit private placements is because potentially they are very dangerous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to quarrel too much with the Minister but is he not being inconsistent here? He is talking about the need for a most rigorous investigation of the circumstances of the adoptive parents in order to ensure the welfare of the child.  Yet this section has a subsection which entitles the mother to place a child for adoption other than through an adoption society.  Who is to say that the mother, especially if she is in a state of considerable anxiety and tension, perhaps even distress, is capable of carrying out the kind of detailed investigation into the background of the adoptive parents and into all the other matters which the adoption societies and indeed the Minister consider to be relevant?  It would appear to me to be consistent that we should legislate to say that no child should be given for adoption other than through some statutory agency.  We have already agreed to an amendment stating that the whole purpose of adoption is child-centred.  Subsection (4), it would seem to me, could work&mdash;I am not saying it always will or, perhaps, very often will but it certainly could work in favour, in a very legalistic sense, of maternal rights and against, in a very human sense, the welfare of a child. I am asking the Minister if he would not accept that he is being inconsistent, <Col N="1089" /> if he is stressing the need for standards and excluding one person, because she is the mother of the child, from the whole inquiry into standards?</P>

Subsection (1) says that it shall not be lawful for any body of persons to make or to attempt to make any arrangements for the adoption of a child and so on.  Subsection (2) states that if any person takes any part in the management or control of a body of persons he shall be guilty of an offence and so on.  Then in subsection (3) it is provided that in any proceedings under subsection (1) of this section, proof of things done or words written, spoken or published by any person taking part in the management or control of a body of persons and so on shall be admissible as evidence of the purpose for which that body exists.  I should like to ask the Minister why only subsection (1) is referred to in the first line of subsection (3) and not subsections (1) and (2) because the reference in subsection (3) is almost entirely to words already existing in subsection (2).  I should have thought that the correct version would be subsections (1) and (2).  Why is subsection (2) omitted there?</P>

      <P>I should like to support this section, which amends the parent Act, for the reasons given by the Minister because I think it is necessary to exclude the third party placement under which it would be impossible to provide for the same standards and the same control.  I just want a clarification of the wording of subsection (4) where there is provision for the exception which I would favour: that the single mother may place the child in adoption herself, or if the person who intends to adopt the child is a relative or the <Col N="1090" /> spouse is a relative of the child.  I note that the wording is that if the first-mentioned person, that is the person placing the child, &ldquo;is a parent...&rdquo; and I wonder whether this includes the natural father?</P>

      <P>On the point raised by Senator Yeats is it not the position that subsection (1) here sets out what particular circumstances shall be unlawful whereas subsection (2) simply states that a particular activity shall be an offence and sets out the penalties which the offence may attract? It would seem to me that proceedings which are visualised under subsection (3) would, in fact, relate to proceedings under subsection (1).  I do not know whether that is the whole answer or not but offhand that seems to me to be the situation.</P>

      <P>I am a bit dubious about that proposition because I think that many activities could be counted as taking part in the management or control of a body.  You could just be a girl keeping the minutes, for example.  You might never see a child let alone actually take part in trying to get one adopted and yet you would be caught under subsection (2) and liable to prosecution. As subsection (3) stands in such proceedings simply because you are in some indirect way involved in the management or control, the words spoken and so on would not be captured, if one can use that word, under subsection (3).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 5, as I understand it the proposal under the section is to create the position of deputy chairman who may take the chair in the absence of the chairman, and that such deputy chairman would have to have the same qualifications as would make him eligible for being chairman.  In other words, as provided in section 8 of the Principal Act, he would have to be either a judge of the Supreme Court, the High Court, the Circuit Court or a justice of the District Court or a barrister or solicitor of at least ten years standing. As I understand section 5 this would mean that two of the six members of the board would have this legal qualification. Although I do not have any particular objection to that it would be opportune to look at the qualifications of the other members of the board in the light of the functions of the Adoption Board, and to assess the extent to which an attempt is being made to ensure that the board is representative of the medical and social interest and dimension of adoption. Would the Minister comment on the criteria which he would have in mind for general appointments to the Adoption Board apart from the specific appointment with which we are concerned here, of a deputy chairman?  It does not necessarily arise under this section but it would be a welcome change in policy if in appointing people to the Adoption Board the Minister would look for a broader range of expertise and knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also welcome an indication <Col N="1092" /> from the Minister as to what extent he would be prepared to consult outside interests in making appointments to the Adoption Board?  I considered the possibility of putting down an amendment in relation to the appointments to the Adoption Board but it is rather difficult to frame in legislation the type of criteria which I feel ought to operate in making appointments.  It would also be desirable to exclude the possibility of somebody being appointed for a third term to the Adoption Board.  A term lasts five years which, if renewed, means that a person would be on the adoption board for ten years.  There are several reasons why it would be desirable to have a turnover of personnel after that period.</P>
    <P>My first point is that it would now appear that out of the six appointees, wo will have to have a legal qualification, either as judge of the Supreme Court, the High Court or a district justice, or a barrister or a solicitor of a certain seniority; that leaves four other members of the Adoption Board, and the question is whether the Minister will look for other particular expertise among them?  It is extremely important in considering the dimension of adoption that there be a knowledge of child psychiatry.  There is also the necessity for an awareness of the problems of adaptation by adoptive parents and the very real social issues which arise in relation to the decision as to whether the adoptive home is the best place for the child in the circumstances?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>First regarding the point that two out of the seven are legal people, this arises from the principle which was adopted when originally framing the Act.  It is a good principle because it recognises that the decisions are quasi-judicial and that the chairman of the board should have some legal experience to enable him to implement that principle and observe the judicial standards in the proceedings of the Adoption Board and the making of adoption orders.  At the moment, two out of the seven are people with legal qualifications.  The chairman is a district justice and the person who has been acting as deputy chairman is a retired district justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for this amendment was <Col N="1093" /> to solve the difficulty that when the chairman was not available, a Government order appointing a deputy chairman had to be made every time.  Sometimes if the chairman were taken ill suddenly, there might not be a Government meeting and the board might not be able to sit.  This actually happened.  I want to obviate this by appointing a deputy chairman who is there all the time and available to act.  It is a good principle that these two people should have legal qualifications and legal experience&mdash;not so much the qualifications as the legal experience, either in a judicial capacity or in a capacity of practice, where they had practice and at the Bar where they observed judicial procedure in operation.</P>
    <P>On the general question of qualification of members of the Adoption Board I would be inclined to disagree with the Senator that the members should represent specific disciplines in the field of child care.  The knowledge they could provide should be available to the board in the general report on each case and from the experts which the board employ in the assessment of the case. Professional assessments should come that way to the board.  If the board were to be representative of particular disciplines there could be certain vested interests&mdash;I do not say that in any pejorative sense&mdash;developing in the board and there could be a conflict between the professional opinion of a member of the board and the professional opinion of the officer of the board who had investigated a particular case.  That would not be desirable.  The work of the board indicates to me that they have the qualifications I would like to see&mdash;a lot of common sense, a wide experience of life and an ability to assess what comes before them and make a sound, common sense judgment on each case.  I am satisfied that this is the type of board we have at present and this is the type of board we should aim for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>On the point made by the Senator I think it would be fair to say that it is something that could be alleged in respect of any court in the land that justice could be better done if the court constantly sat with professional assessors. It is only in a very rare case that <Col N="1094" /> this happens.  The procedure is that the professional evidence is presented to a person of broad general experience with the intellectual capacity to assimilate it and assess it.  This is the type of person we look for to serve on the Adoption Board and we have been fortunate in having this type of person to sit on that board.</P>
    <P>The nature of the work of the Adoption Board, in the sense that it sits several times per week, can be called on to go at short notice to a venue other than Dublin, and that six of the members are part-time, limits its availability. They have to be people who are retired or semi-retired or of independent means. Nevertheless, within that category we have been fortunate to get people who are dedicated and are able to give the type of service I have indicated and who have the necessary qualifications.  I do not think there is a need to have them representative of the particular disciplines of child-care, sociology and so on: that could lead to an undesirable situation. What we have at the moment is the best position.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his reply on this point. There is just one further question I would like to ask.  Mention was made of the concept of &ldquo;vested interests&rdquo;; does the Minister consider that it is desirable to have nominees of adoption societies on the Adoption Board, given the board has possible disciplinary functions in relation to adoption societies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it could lead to a conflict of interests but happily it never has because while there may sometimes be nomination, the convention and the tradition of independent operation by the board are so strong and so well accepted that this prevents any conflict.  It is a risk but I think it is desirable to take it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4.</P>
      <P>Before section 6 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained <Col N="1095" /> in subsection (3) of section 11 of the Principal Act an adoption order may be made on the application of the mother or the natural father if the applicant has attained the age of eighteen years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not altogether sure this amendment means what I want it to mean but that is nobody's fault but my own.  Perhaps I could explain what I would like it to convey and get the Minister's views on the matter.</P>
    <P>Basically it is an attempt to amend section 11 of the original Act the third section of which deals mainly with age. I believe that section 3 (a) was already amended in 1964 to reduce the age for adoptions by married couples from 30 years to 21 years.  My amendment is intended to enable married couples of under 21 legally to adopt a child in cases in which either the husband or the wife is the natural father or natural mother of the child.  I do not propose&mdash; and I am afraid my amendment may&mdash; that there should be a blanket right to adopt children for married couples between 18 and 21.</P>
    <P>In the case of natural parents of an illegitimate child who marry, the problem does not exist because it is covered by the legitimation legislation so that if the natural parents of a child subsequently marry the child then becomes legitimised.  I am concerned about the situation in which a young girl has an illegitimate child and dies subsequently. This would be rather unusual but in such circumstances the illegitimate child could be brought up by the natural father of the child.  However, if the father should marry at, say, 18 years of age, it is possible that he and his wife would wish to adopt the child but it would seem to me that they would have to wait until both were 21 until they, as a married couple, could adopt a child. The same would apply in the case of the natural mother of a child marrying somebody who was not the child's father while they were both under 21. I am suggesting that this wait is undesirable because of the uncertainty with which it would invest the whole situation and, also, because of the ways in which it might prejudice some <Col N="1096" /> of the rights of the child, in particular the property rights.  For example, the mother of an illegitimate child aged 18 might adopt that child in her own right, and subsequently marry somebody who was not the father of the child, but if between the age of 18 and 21 the mother dies, the child would be worse off from the point of view of property rights than he would have been if he had been a fully adopted child of both parents.</P>
    <P>I want my amendment to deal with a situation in which a marriage has taken place between a parent of a child and somebody who is not the parent of a child, while both parties are under 21. They should not have to wait for three years in order to adopt the child as their child, and not just a child of one of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Horgan's general argument.  I have not looked at the section of the Principal Act to which he refers so I am not sure what the total effect exactly is. There is a strong case for arguing as he has done for allowing a couple to adopt at 18 in a situation in which one party is the natural parent of a child.</P>
      <P>I would imagine that the parents of illegitimate children are usually quite young but I do not know if there are any figures available to support this.  I wonder if it would be better if when one of the parents of an illegitimate child marries, the couple should be allowed adopt under 21 years.  We would want to consider this argument carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that if the mother marries and is under 21 and her husband is 21 then they are allowed adopt.  In the infrequent case of the father wanting to adopt his illegitimate child, both spouses have to be at least 21.  There is an inconsistency there against the father.  I have no strong views on it but I think the present proviso is reasonable.  The legal age of majority is 21 with the exception of voting, in respect of which the majority age was reduced from 21 to 18.  If one were to say that couples should be allowed adopt at 18 it would be logical to go on and say that they could adopt at 15 and 16 years; even 15-year-olds <Col N="1097" /> have illegitimate babies so that the same difficulties could arise there.  I do not know if there would be difficulties in succession rights in the event of the death taking place in the three-year gap Senator Horgan adverted to because that would raise the question of what property rights the 18-year-old father would have.  If it was substantial property it is unlikely that he would have succeeded to it in his own right prior to attaining majority.  There are a lot of considerations which would arise in changing the age from 21 to 18.  The present position where the mother can adopt under the age of 21 when she marries someone who is over 21 meets the vast majority of cases.  The odd case where the father subsequently marries and is under 21 and wants to adopt his own child is so rare as not to justify changing what has been a satisfactory situation, and which has given rise to no difficulty whatever in practice.  I do not think we should change it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to press my amendment in the form in which it appears now.  I would point out that we have to accept assurances such as that given by the Minister that there is no difficulty in practice without any real evidence that this should be the case. The fact that it is not legally possible to adopt a child until the age of 21 is reached in most cases means that no applications are made in respect of any adoptive parents in the 18-21 age group. We do not know if there is a need; we do not know if we are discriminating against people or if we are creating uncertainty for people which could be resolved in the small number of cases that would arise.  We get very little information in the Adoption Board's report about the nature of applications which would help us to make up our minds on this.  There may be a need but it may be concealed by the fact that because of the existing legislation, people are dissuaded from doing anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally I have had no representations on the matter from anybody. It just struck me as a possible unfairness which we might remedy at this stage. I would like now to withdraw the amendment and reserve my right to put one down at Report Stage if <Col N="1098" /> having considered what the Minister said about the actual situation on the ground, I still believe there is a need for change.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5.</P>
      <P>Before section 7 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 16 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion before &lsquo;(c)&rsquo; in subsection (1) of &lsquo;(bb) the natural father of the child&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I mentioned this matter on Second Stage.  Indeed, I was not the only person to mention it on Second Stage. The Minister referred to it in his summing up speech at column 960 of the Official Report of 9th July, 1974. If I might quote what he said on that occasion and relate it to my amendment and, indeed, the amendment which Senator Ryan and I share, it could be argued that what the Minister said on that occasion does not meet the amendment which we now have down. The Minister said:</P>
      <P>The existing law is probably adequate as it does not exclude the father: it permits him to be heard if the Adoption Board so decide.  I do not know if it would be a good thing that he be entitled as of right to be heard.  In stating this I am conscious of the natural reaction: &ldquo;Surely the father has rights?&rdquo; Let us not forget that the mother, because of the illegitimacy of the child, must have the rights and if we were to put the father in the same position and allow him to be heard as of right we would be cutting down her position in relation to that child in this adoption situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is questionable if the natural father is entitled to be placed exactly <Col N="1099" /> on a par with the natural mother in that situation.  It would be difficult to differentiate between worthy and unworthy fathers.  One could begin by stating that all such fathers are unworthy, but this might not necessarily be the case.  Who would argue that the father of a child who was the result of a casual commercial union should be entitled to have the same rights as the natural mother? The Act as it stands is adequate.  The father is not excluded and the board can hear him if the board in their discretion wish to have the full picture in relation to that particular adoption before them if they so decide.</P>
    <P>The purpose of our amendment is to give the natural father some existence and status in the adoption law.  I would stress and could not stress strongly enough that it does not go anywhere near giving the natural father identical rights to that of the mother as the Minister seemed to imply.  All we are asking is that the board should consult the natural father if it is possible for them to do so before making an adoption order&mdash;as the Minister pointed out on Second Stage, they are not in the least precluded from consulting him&mdash;but it is very important that consultation should, at some stage, be written in, not just in terms of the rights of the father, although I think these could, perhaps, be important in a small number of cases, but in terms of (<i>a</i>) the knowledge the father might have about the mother which might be relevant to the making of an adoption order and (<i>b</i>) the knowledge the board might gain from an interview with the father about the child of that union which would again help them in the making of an adoption order.  I am not going so far as to say that the Adoption Board, by looking at the natural father of any child, could conclude that he was not right in the head and that the child was likely to be mentally deficient.  I would think it unlikely that the Adoption Board in their attempt to get the whole picture concerning a child would be successful without seeing the father.  My desire to put <Col N="1100" /> this in stems from two points of view&mdash; partly, but only partly, in view of the rights of the father and partly also in view of the whole principle of the adoption order we are talking about, that is, the welfare of the child.  It seems to me that the welfare of the child is best served by ensuring that the Adoption Board are not allowed to exclude a person who may be extremely relevant to their decision in relation to an adoption order.</P>
    <P>Again, I would stress that we are not, in this amendment, giving the father the same rights as the mother.  There are a whole area of rights that the mother of an illegitimate child has that nobody else has and that I would be very slow to transfer, as of right, to the natural father.  We are making a very small recognition of the existence of and of the rights of the natural father and are urging the advisability of consulting the natural father for reasons related solely to the welfare of the child.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  The amendment proposed here is the very minimum right which the natural father should have in this situation.  When I was speaking on Second Stage I referred to section 14 and said that I might put down an amendment to the section as well to say that in certain circumstances not only the consent of the mother would be necessary before an adoption order was made but also that the consent of the natural father should be necessary.  That is probably going a little too far and from the practical point of view would lead to a great many difficulties.  It definitely seems to me that the very minimum right the natural father should have is that he should be heard if he wants to be heard. There are a long list of people who may be heard by the board and it seems to me indefensible not to hear the father if he wants to be heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to be a rather Victorian attitude that accepts that the natural father is a person having no merits, a person who normally does not even admit to being the father of the child and, who, apparently never has any interest in the welfare of the child and consequently does not merit even having his point of view heard.  The Minister said in his reply that of course the <Col N="1101" /> board could hear the father under the subsection, the paragraph which says: &ldquo;any other person whom the board, in its discretion, decides to hear&rdquo;.  The section starts by saying: &ldquo;the following persons and no other persons shall be entitled to be heard on an application for an adoption order&rdquo;.  That not merely sets out people who may be heard but says: &ldquo;and no other person&rdquo; and that, I think, has been interpreted by the board and is likely to be interpreted by the board as being an extremely restrictive and severe limitation of the people who may be heard.  In the case which I gave to back up my views during the Second Stage debate the father wished to be heard but the board in their discretion refused point blankly to hear him so that one cannot rely on the board to decide that their discretion should be exercised to hear a father.  I think this is the very minimum right that should be given to a father.  He is, admittedly, an unusual person in wanting to be heard, in wanting to give his view, in wanting to take an interest in the future of the child, but if he is the kind of person who goes to the extent of applying to be heard, one must assume that he has something of importance to say and, after all, if he has nothing of importance to say and if his views are not of any merit the board have no obligation other than taking up what he has to say and to ignore it if they do not feel that it is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>I can see that all the arguments are in favour of a natural father being heard.  I find it difficult to understand an argument that he should not at least be heard and consequently I think that nothing would be lost, and possibly quite a lot would be gained, now and again, in cases where a father would have strong views and important and useful views to put to the board.  As the three amendments are being taken together I am merely referring to amendments Nos. 11 and 12 which are, not exactly, consequential amendments but they make an effort to take the father out of the category which the Act has put him into of being a person who has no merits and should not be given any consideration in adoption matters.  Section 3 of the original Act says that the parent does <Col N="1102" /> not include the natural father of an illegitimate child.  My purpose in amendment No. 11 is to remove that provision. The definition in section 3 again says that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;relative&rdquo; means grandparent, brother, sister, uncle or aunt, whether of the whole blood, or of the half-blood or by affinity, relationship to an illegitimate child being traced through the mother only.</P>
    <P>My purpose is to remove that last sentence so that relationship to the child would be traced through both parents.  However, that is merely to remove the stigma on natural fathers which is characteristic of the original Act.</P>

      <P>This is the reality of the situation.  No complaint has ever been made to me or to my predecessors that where the natural father sought audience with the board he was refused it.  It is not a question of refusing the natural father the right to be heard in this case, it is a question of whether we give a positive right to the exclusion at the board's discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of my Second Stage speech when I was dealing with this point, I expressed the opinion that it would be wrong to equate the mother and the father in this situation, that the mother would have to be given preference and precedence and that this would have to be statutorily recognised. This is not to say that the natural father is to be excluded; it is to say that his admission into the arena of the proceedings is to be controlled and left to the discretion of the board.  Esseniitally, that is a fair statement of what I think is the equity of the position. It may sound slightly Victorian but it is supported by the Supreme Court in the Nicolaou case where they talk about the rights of the natural father. An extract from that judgment said that it had not been shown to the <Col N="1103" /> satisfaction of the court that the father of an illegitimate child had any natural right as distinct from legal rights to either the custody or society of that child and that the court had not been satisfied that any such right had ever been recognised as part of the natural law.  If an illegitimate child had a natural right to look to his father for support that would impose a duty on the father but would not, of itself, confer any right upon the father.  So there is no natural right according to the judicial lead that we have in this area and we are entitled to look to the courts for indication of what the law is in this and in other areas too.</P>

      <P>In this area the Supreme Court has indicated that the father of an illegitimate child has no natural right.  He may be given a legal duty by the law which imposes a legal right on the illegitimate child to look to him but there is no finding of a natural right as between the two of them.</P>
      <P>The view I expressed on Second Stage and which I have repeated here today is the correct view.  Having heard the arguments from Senators Horgan and Ryan I cannot see any adverse consequences to accepting the three amendments with the possible exception of the last of the three-amendment No. 12&mdash;which would extend the private placement arrangements to include the natural father: he would now be able to place a child privately for adoption. Again, as Senator Ahern realistically points out 99.9 per cent of the fathers do not want to know anything further about the case at all.  I cannot imagine many cases where there would be one who admits his paternity and at the same time wishes to place the baby for adoption.  There may be consequential effects and I would like to think about the problem a little more and perhaps if the Senators agreed we could take it again on Report Stage in order to debate it.  I would like to tease out the whole consequences of the three amendments. The existing law is adequate and just but the Senators are keen on these amendments and we must not allow the debate to be obstinate or blind.</P>

      <P>I thought when we put down this amendment that it was as minimal as anything that one could hope for but I have not consulted Senator Ryan on the variation of it which I would certainly be prepared to put down on Report Stage which might meet all the situations fairly clearly and that is that any natural father who desires audience of the board shall not be refused audience by the board, or words to that effect.  The Minister said that he knows of no situation which when the natural father sought audience with the board that audience was refused.  It might not be a bad thing to write this even more minimal thing in that where the 0.1 per cent did seek audience with the board prior to the making of an adoption order, that there should be a statutory responsibility on the board to admit the right of that person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where the Board declines to make an adoption order it shall ensure that the child is returned by the applicants to the person or body which placed the child for adoption.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is proposed to cover the situation where the board decline for good reason to make an adoption order.  The problem is that we do not have any detailed research on what happens in those circumstances, but my information is that what can happen&mdash;and what has happened&mdash;is that where the board decline for whatever reasons, to make a final adoption order so that the conclusion is that the particular home is not suitable for the child very often the child remains on <Col N="1105" /> in the surroundings despite the fact that no final adoption order has been made.</P>
    <P>Looking at the reports of the Adoption Board for the year ending 31st December, 1973, it is clear that more applications are received than adoption orders made.  This has been so since the first year adoption orders were made in 1953.  Of course this can be explained on several grounds, one being that there is no guarantee that an application will be processed within the same year. There is often this problem in examining statistics.  On the breakdown of figures for the year 1973 it is stated in the report at page 3:</P>
    <P>The following statistical summary covers the year 1973:</P>
    <P>(1)  Number of meetings held... 94.</P>
    <P>(2)  Number of applications for Adoption Orders submitted to the Board...1,501.</P>
    <P>(3)  Number of Adoption Orders made...1,402.</P>
    <P>Almost 100 fewer orders made as against applications.</P>
    <P>(4)  Number of applications for Adoption Orders withdrawn or not proceeded with...17.</P>
    <P>(5)  Number of applications for Adoption Orders rejected...10.</P>
    <P>What we are concerned about here is where the Adoption Board reject the application and do not make the order.  My information is that there is a danger.  It has happened that the child remains on in the particular home with the applicants who have been rejected as adoptive parents.  This is not a deliberate policy but rather an unfortunate consequence.  It happens in default of any responsibility placed on any one at present to take any steps in these circumstances.  As the present adoption procedure operates there is no duty on the board to take positive steps in the circumstances.  The single mother who placed the child for adoption may no longer be in the country or she may not be contactable.  She may be in a position to take steps to recover custody of her child or she may not want to. What this amendment would try to do is to place a responsibility on the board <Col N="1106" /> so that, where the board decline to make an adoption order, they shall ensure that the child is returned by the applicant to the person or body that placed the child for adoption.</P>
    <P>There may be some criticism of the precise wording of this as to whether or not it would be workable.  There ought to be a responsibility on the board to take some steps to see that the child is not, in fact, left in those particular surroundings but is returned to the applicant or to the person or body who placed the child for adoption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether this amendment does not go too far.  In general, I agree with what Senator Robinson is saying.  There may be cases where the board are not quite convinced that the situation is ideal for adoption but might have at the back of ther minds that a further application in a short time might be acceptable.  The board might feel there were certain circumstances not just right at that time but these circumstances might change in such a way as to make an adoption order later applicable or acceptable.  To say that the board shall ensure that the child is returned by the applicant in all circumstances where they decline to make an order could be going too far in certain circumstances.  If the wording of the amendment were altered to say that the board would have power, if they thought fit, to ensure that the child was returned to the person or body who placed the child for adoption there would be a great deal to be said for this amendment.  I would not however, make it an absolute duty in all cases where the board declined to make an adoption order that the child must be returned to the person or body who placed the child for adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, with respect to the Senators, this amendment implies a misunderstanding of the nature of adoption.  As I indicated when I was speaking on Second Stage, adoption in this country is a voluntary arrangement which is legalised by the Adoption Board.  The parties come together and place the child for adoption.  It is a voluntary arrangement between them. The Adoption Board then make a legal order which legalises that particular <Col N="1107" /> act.  It changes the legal relationship of the child to the other parties.  The board have no function with regard to the question of custody.  This is an extraneous legal question which has nothing to do with the adoption process.  If this amendment were to be accepted it would inevitably involve the board in disputes as to custody.  The determination of who should have custody was never a matter for the Adoption Board. Their role is much narrower than that.</P>
      <P>That is not to say the position is not catered for in law; it is catered for because the law gives a direction to the board as to what to do in such a case. Where the board refuse to make an adoption order in the case of an illegitimate child&mdash;99.99 per cent of children coming before the board are in that category&mdash;the board are obliged under section 10 of the Adoption Act of 1964 to notify the health board within 14 days of the date of their refusal of the fact that they have refused to make an order.  The health board then, under section 2 of the Children's Act of 1908, as amended by section 4 of the Children's Act 1934, may have the home visited to satisfy themselves that the child is being properly maintained. Section 5 of the Children's Act, 1908, as amended by section 7 of the Children's Act, 1934, provides that the health board can take steps to remove infants in certain circumstances.  There is a legal procedure to be followed by the board which ensures that the health authority intervene to see that the child's welfare is attended to.</P>
      <P>This is as far as the board can go because it would be undesirable for the board to become involved in questions of custody since, sooner or later, this would lead to litigation and the board then could possibly be put in an un-favourable light <i>vis-á-vis</i> the natural mother and the whole field of adoption could be affected.  While I sympathise with the sentiment, the wish and the motives behind the amendment, I do think that the present position is satisfactory.  To attempt to change it, as the amendment suggests, would be to disimprove it.</P>

      <P>As I say, we suffer <Col N="1108" /> from the handicap of not having sufficiently detailed research to show the extent to which the case that I was making could be a problem.  Certainly it has been brought to my attention that there have been cases where children have been left in undesirable surroundings with applicants who have been refused an adoption order and have therefore been rejected by the board as suitable adoptive parents. Although the Minister has pointed to the duty on the board to notify the health authority, I think it would be legitimate to go further and to place some responsibility on the board, but not&mdash;I would agree with the Minister here&mdash;to become involved in the question of the custody of the child in the far-reaching sense in which he was saying it.  I would say that it would be legitimate, nevertheless, to place a responsibility, even if it is only the responsibility of drawing the attention of the original persons who placed the child for adoption, to the situation so that they could then take positive steps, be it the single mother or the adoption society which placed the child for adoption.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>Before section 10 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 39 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of &lsquo;or public assistance authority&rsquo; after &lsquo;registered adoption society&rsquo; in subsection (1), and after &lsquo;the society&rsquo; in subsection (1) and in subsection (2)&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would extend the provisions of section 39 to cover what is, in rather strange terminology, public assistance authorities.  The Minister explained in connection with an earlier amendment that these are now the health boards in their capacity as bodies concerned in adoption.  I would be happy to change the terminology to &lsquo;health boards&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;public assistance authorities&rdquo;.  I think it is desirable that the controls and the provisions in section 39 should extend to health boards.  It may very well be that it is the practice of health boards to give similar information to the single mother.  When we are bringing in an amending Bill and trying to create a <Col N="1112" /> rounded legislative framework we ought, as a Legislature, to require all bodies concerned with adoption, particularly as we have excluded third party placements, to comply with the same standards.  Section 39 of the 1952 Act provides that an explanation must be given to the mother or guardian of the child to be placed in adoption as to the effect of adoption.  It provides that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the mother or guardian of a child proposes to place the child at the disposal of a registered adoption society for adoption under this Act the society shall, before accepting the child&mdash;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There, I would like to include the health boards, or whatever they may be called</P>
    <P>&mdash;and require them, before accepting the child&mdash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)  furnish that person with a statement in writing in the prescribed form explaining clearly&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the effect of an adoption order upon the rights of a mother or guardian, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the provisions of this Act relating to consent for the making of the adoption order; and</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)  ensure that the person understands the statement and that he signs a document to that effect.</P>
    <P>(2)  In the case of failure to comply with any of the requirements under subsection (1) of the society&mdash;</P>
    <P>and here I would insert the public assistance authority, meaning the health board&mdash;</P>
    <P>every person who takes part in the management or control and every person concerned in the acceptance of the child on behalf of the society shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds.</P>
    <P>This would be a way of bringing health boards within the framework of control in the same way as adoption societies by requiring them under statute to <Col N="1113" /> provide this information and explanation to the single mother or other person placing the child with them for adoption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not inclined to agree with the Senator.  There is, of course, already provision under subsection (3) of section 15 of the Principal Act which provides that the board must satisfy itself that every person whose consent is necessary has given consent and understands the nature and effect of the consent and of the adoption order.  There is a protection there if you like, an overriding or backstop protection, to ensure that what the Senator is apprehensive about will not arise. The position of the health board is not on all-fours with the normal adoption society because, when they come into the adoption field, they do not come initially as placement societies in the same sense as adoption societies.  They normally come in where there has been a boarded out child, a child at fosterage, and it is only subsequently that the question of adoption may arise.  I think the Senator can take it that the health authorities are very conscious of their obligations in this regard.  It would not be desirable to include them in the provisions of section 39 for the reason I have stated.  Protection is already there by virtue of section 15 (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite follow the reason given as to why, if section 15 (3) is the way in which the board ensure that the person has given a valid consent, the Minister will not accept this amendment.  The amendment places the responsibility where it ought to be placed, namely, on any body concerned with a child for the purpose of having it adopted.  While I accept the Minister's statement that health boards very often come into the adoption procedure in a different way from placement agencies, I am not so sure that this may necessarily continue to be so to the same extent when third party placements have been excluded.  I am not sure that it is always the case.  I would prefer to have what I regard as a better guarantee that the health boards do comply with the same statutory requirement as is placed on adoption societies. They also come into the net under <Col N="1114" /> section 15 (3).  The health boards should have a statutory obligation to provide the necessary information and explanation to the single mother or person placing the child in adoption and subsequently that the board would still ensure that a valid and informed consent was given.</P>
      <P>I would prefer, if we could do it by way of this amendment, to include health boards in the provisions of section 39 and place them under the same obligation as adoption societies.  I do not quite follow the Minister's reasoning that it would not be appropriate or necessary to include health boards in this.  I would be prepared to accept that in practice they carry out a somewhat similar exercise in furnishing the person who places the child in adoption with a statement to the effect &ldquo;that, <i>et cetera</i>&rdquo; and I would prefer to see this guaranteed through legislation by placing an obligation on them to do that.</P>

      <P>Where a mother or guardian proposes to place a child at the disposal of a registered adoption society for adoption, the society shall before accepting the child...</P>
      <P>The point I am making is that in most cases where the health board come into the picture the child is already with them and possibly has been under their care for a good few years, possibly in fosterage.  We might get a situation where the health authority might appear to be in breach of the Act, because adoption is not directly the purpose of the placement as in the case of a society, but is usually as a consequence of a child being at fosterage, at care or boarded out.  The amendment would impose the obligation of giving the information before accepting the child. At what stage is the child accepted?  Is it when the parents decide to look for adoption or when the child is first placed in a foster home?  There is a real practical difficulty here.  For that reason, I do not think it is desirable to include health boards within section 39.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Section 36 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the addition of a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(4)  The Board shall draw up regulations for the proper administration of registered adoption societies.  In particular, these regulations shall lay down minimum standards concerning the placing of children by such societies with prospective adopters, the supervision of such placements and related matters.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment would confer on the board a statutory duty to make regulations for the proper control of registered adoption societies.  These regulations would deal with minimum standards relating to the placing of children by such societies with respect to adopters, particularly the supervision of pre- and post-placements.  I emphasised this point on the Second Stage and put forward various arguments why I consider it necessary to have this statutory power to make regulations. I pointed to the situation in Northern Ireland, where very detailed statutory regulations imposing standards have been brought in.  Furthermore, I referred to a number of case histories to show the lack of overall standards and a lack of what I would regard as a minimum basic standard in relation to all adoption societies.</P>
      <P>In his reply to the Second Stage debate on this Bill, the Minister referred to these case histories.  At column 953, volume 78 of the Official Report he said:</P>
      <P>I have no way of knowing how old these case histories were.</P>
      <P>I can assure him that they were within the last five years.  I have not given specific dates and neither have I named the parties involved because I believe they have a right to privacy, a right not to be identified with the possibility of having their situation speculated about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> These were recent examples that have come to my attention through those involved in adoption, of bad problems, of a lack of proper preplacement supervision and proper assessment of the adoptive parents and a proper scrutiny of the machinery of adoption.  Continuing in the same column the Minister says:</P>
    <P>I am well satisfied from discussions I had within the adoption world that the procedures which are being implemented nowadays are satisfactory to ensure a uniformly high standard of adoption procedures.  This is secured in two ways: the adoption societies and the Adoption Board have certain procedures and the board have to be satisfied that these procedures are followed.  Should there be any fall from this level the board have the sanction of withdrawing registration to the society in question.  The threat of this sanction being present in the background is adequate&mdash;it has not been necessary in a serious way&mdash;to ensure that procedures are followed. There is also a new sanction available to me: subventions are now being paid by the Department to societies. I have indicated that I would like to see these subventions spent on the employment of social workers so that a high standard of protection and expertise will be available in adoption procedures.  This is something that can be monitored.  Should I be of the opinion at any time that the money is not being spent in the way I believe it should be spent there is thus an implicit sanction available to me.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly satisfied that for these reasons there is no need to have statutory regulations to ensure proper procedures.</P>
    <P>I would much prefer to see statutory regulations rather than a hidden threat by the Minister to withdraw grants from adoption societies.  It would be very hard for the Members of this House to know in what way the Minister was exercising his power and whether the adoption societies were fulfilling their important and responsible functions.  I do not like the thought of the Minister operating in this way <Col N="1117" /> because it is less satisfactory than having the Adoption Board as the body which lay down the standards to be observed through exercising statutory power to make regulations and then enforcing these regulations by having the ultimate sanction of being able to withdraw the registration of an adoption society.</P>
    <P>I went into some detail on Second Reading and put on the record of the House particular case histories which illustrated the problems which have arisen in our adoption procedure.  I cannot share the Minister's complacency when he says there are &ldquo;uniformly high standards&rdquo; operating in these adoption societies.</P>
    <P>If we needed any further proof that all is not as well as it might be in relation to the way in which adoption societies work in the field I shall refer to the Darling Report&mdash;I do not want to be thought to imply that there are no good adoption societies, but the standard is not uniform.  We have not created the proper statutory mechanism to ensure the existence of minimum standards which all adoption societies must observe.  Fortunately we have the benefit of some limited research on this aspect from the private report on adoption in Ireland brought out by Miss Vivienne Darling, a survey to which the Minister referred in his reply.  I accept his statement that as private research it is necessarily narrow in its scope, but it does illustrate one thing extraordinarily clearly: it illustrates that standards in adoption practice are not uniform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that in fairness we should read what Miss Darling herself says&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I accept that, but even given the possible criticism of the scope of the research and the time span over which the report operated, there is ample evidence that the standards between the adoption societies are not, in fact, uniform.  In some ways they fall below what one would regard as a minimum standard in relation to the placement and supervision of the prospective adopters to see whether they are suitable themselves to be adoptive parents and also to examine <Col N="1118" /> the environment into which they wish to bring the child.  I am not convinced that the present position is satisfactory nor do I accept that the demand to have this statutory power exercised by the adoption board is coming from a small fringe group.  It was one of the recommendations made by the adoption board itself in 1970; and it was the first recommendation put forward by the joint committee of Women's Societies who claim to represent 70,000 women. It is high on the list of proposals of anybody to whom I have spoken who is deeply involved in and concerned about adoption procedure in this country.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to certain parts of Miss Darling's report to illustrate the point I am making, that adoption standards are not uniform and are not adequate throughout the country and then I shall refer to the conclusions made by Miss Darling in this area.  On page 12 of the report under the heading of &ldquo;Adoption Societies&rdquo; she refers to the different ways in which they operate and she says:</P>
      <P>In Ireland, the adoption societies can be classified as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  those which, in addition to adoption arrangements, provide a complete casework service for unmarried mothers;</P>
      <P>(2)  those which only deal with mothers in connection with the adoption arrangements after the decision to place for adoption has been taken.  These in some instances will provide nursery care for the babies pending placement;</P>
      <P>(3)  those which are never involved in care for the mother. These will receive the applications on behalf of the mothers from other agencies but have no direct contact;</P>
      <P>(4)  those which provide partial but not total care for the mother, for instance, mother and baby homes which look after the mothers while resident, place the babies with adopters, but are not necessarily responsible for aftercare once the mothers have left the homes;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" /> (5)  local authorities which have registered as adoption societies and arrange adoptions as part of a total child care service.</P>
    <P>Then, having shown the different ways in which adoption societies may operate she looks at the question of staffing and here I think the Minister would say that this will be improved by the provision of grants, by giving money to adoption societies to recruit staff, but it is worth looking at page 15 of the report under the heading &ldquo;Qualifications of Staff&rdquo;.  It says:</P>
    <P>Eight societies between them employ four full-time and seven part-time professionally-trained social workers (i.e. these have taken postgraduate courses in social work). Nine societies, including five of those who employ professionally qualified workers, employ one or more full-time or part-time basic grade social workers (those who have a degree or diploma in Social Science).  Four societies have no trained social worker at all and these were responsible for 13% of adoptions arranged by registered societies in 1970.</P>
    <P>Again, I accept that this is a situation which may be improving but more critically on this point of the need for statutory regulations creating standards, is the reference to Case Committees at page 17 of this report where it states:</P>
    <P>In two of the 16 societies which returned the questionnaire the responsibility for making placement rests with an individual rather than a committee.  Where there are case committees these usually consisted of three or more persons including the social workers concerned.</P>
    <P>Then she says:</P>
    <P>Other members are drawn from the following, chaplains, doctors, nurses, children's officers, priests, housewives, lawyers, paediatricians, teachers, marriage counsellors, matrons of mothers and baby homes, health board officials.  Depending on the number of cases, the committees <Col N="1120" /> meet weekly, fortnightly, monthly, bi-monthly.</P>
    <P>There is no uniform practice of having case committees.  There is no guarantee that these case committees will consist of the sort of expertise that is thought to be desirable.  These are the sort of provisions that could be required as a minimum standard by giving the Adoption Board the power and the duty to make statutory regulations to that effect.  Until there are statutory regulations required for case committees I do not believe that you would have uniform standards and adoption societies will not bring in what is regarded on all sides as the necessary provision of a case committee.</P>
    <P>On the Second Stage I referred to the chapter of the report on the counselling service to adopters, the help they get in coming to a decision to adopt.  On page 20 of the report it states:</P>
    <P>It transpired that 48.3% of all adopters had received advice, many from more than one source but 49% had received no advice.</P>
    <P>Is this a uniformly high standard in relation to adoption, if 49 per cent of those interviewed did not receive any detailed advice on it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Forty-nine per cent of those interviewed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; we have already agreed that this sample is a private survey and that it is limited.  In the absence of what we ought to have&mdash;a comprehensive Government survey&mdash; we must go by the limited evidence that we have.  I cannot accept that the Minister can state blandly on the record of the House that we have a uniformly high standard if even a small sample can show that over 50 per cent were not receiving proper guidance in this matter.  This is the theme throughout this report.  On page 24, in relation to selection procedures, the procedure about office interviews differs very much in the adoption societies and&mdash; most serious of all&mdash;varies dramatically in various parts of the country.  We do not have a uniform standard either in relation to pre-placement and post-placement <Col N="1121" /> supervision as such or in relation to rural areas.  In some parts of the country I believe the adoption procedure is substantially inferior to other parts.  On page 26 of the report, under the heading &ldquo;Pre-placement. Visits to Homes&rdquo; it states:</P>
      <P>It was disturbing to note that 21.7% of my samples alleged that there had been no home visit prior to placement, the percentage varying from 11.8% in Dublin to 28% in Cork.  This is hard to understand in the light of the claim made by all adoption societies that at least one and possibly two home visits are made in each case.</P>
      <P>There, I accept what the Minister contends, that you cannot enforce standards by regulation but I believe that you can create them by giving the statutory power to make regulations and if the board have that statutory function it makes it more likely that standards once set out in statutory regulations will be enforced because there is always the possibility of making the type of complaint which can lead ultimately to having the registered adoption society de-registered or struck off the list.  I maintain that almost every aspect of adoption procedure, as illustrated by this report, shows the need for the creation of better standards.</P>
      <P>On page 34 of the report it states:</P>
      <P>There is a wide divergence in the waiting time (i.e. that between the first application and placement) cited by various couples.  Some in my sample (46.9%) were offered a baby within 3 months of application and placement was for some of these was in fact made in less than a week.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting there should be uniform time but that adoption as a legal extension of our social service, of our family law, does not operate equally around the country.  A married couple in the west who want to adopt are at a serious disadvantage compared with the couple living in either Dublin or Cork.  There ought to be more of an attempt to have a balance in the way adoption societies work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to placement and notice that a baby is available, arrangements <Col N="1122" /> for receiving the baby <i>et cetera</i>, the adoption societies practice varies very much.  Over half the adoptive parents got between two and seven days notice that a baby was available; 15.4 per cent received under 24 hours notice; 7.7 per cent between 24 and 48 hours.  There has been no real attempt at uniform standards setting out the proper period of notice in order that the adoptive parents may make the appropriate arrangements to receive the baby, presumably on probation to see whether they are suitable parents for the child.</P>
    <P>I come now to the conclusions.  On page 48 of the report it states:</P>
    <P>Although this study has been on a limited scale I feel there are enough indications to suggest that the standard of adoption practice in some agencies leaves much to be desired in certain respects, <i>viz.</i></P>
    <P>(1)  Counselling services for applicant adopters seems to be rather limited at all stages of the process before the decision is taken, in preparation for adoptive parenthood and in post-placement supervision.</P>
    <P>(2)  The assessment procedure leading to selection in too many instances does not appear to be more than superficial.</P>
    <P>(3)  In some cases there is little to suggest that much thought has been given to the actual placement and indeed it sometimes appears as if there is a most casual approach to the arrangement for handing over of the baby to his parents.</P>
    <P>(4)  The best possible use is not being made of the present six month probationary and supervisory period.  It seems as if supervision is often regarded merely as an opportunity for checking nothing is amiss and social workers do not see it as their role to use this period in the more positive way of helping the adopters to integrate the baby into their family.</P>
    <P>Miss Darling makes a number of suggestions which &ldquo;might contribute to improving the rather poor quality <Col N="1123" /> adoption practice I have observed.&rdquo; She goes on:</P>
    <P>(1)  There is a shortage of adequately trained staff...</P>
    <P>(2)  In many cases adoption work is only a secondary function of some other organisation, e.g. local authority adoption societies...</P>
    <P>(3)  There is a lack of appreciation by adoption workers of the need for improved adoption practice and an apparent disregard in many cases for modern theories in adoption work...</P>
    <P>(4)  An Bord Uchtala seems to adopt negative attitude to any suggestions for improvement in the standard of practice.  The Board contents itself with the actual making of adoption orders...</P>
    <P>Then she goes on to quote from the previous debate in this House.  Her final conclusion is one which we have heard on Second Reading and one which I supported before now.  She says:</P>
    <P>I would recommend in conclusion that a full scale government enquiry into the adoption of children such as those carried out by the Hurst and Houghton Committees in Britain in 1954 and 1972 respectively, should be undertaken in this country before we congratulate ourselves any further on our supposedly satisfactory adoption system.</P>
    <P>I have quoted at some length from this report because it is the only scientific survey that we have.  It admits its own limitations, but it supplies evidence to support this amendment because it shows that adoption is not carried out in a uniformly satisfactory manner.  I am not convinced that &ldquo;uniformly high standards&rdquo; operate in relation to all the existing registered adoption societies. I am sure that the board could, by drawing up statutory regulations, imposing these standards improve substantially the pre-placement and post-placement supervision of adoption societies.  Furthermore, I find it difficult to understand why the board apparently do not wish to have this power partirularly as in 1970 the recommendations <Col N="1124" /> of the Adoption Board then were strongly in favour of the board having this statutory power.  It was because the Department at that time were not willing to accept the recommendations of the Adoption Board that certain members of the Adoption Board resigned. This seems to show that there has not always been unanimity throughout among the members of the board as to whether it would be desirable or not to have the statutory power to make regulations.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I urge the Minister to have an open mind on this question and to reflect on what has been said, on the evidence that is there: both the case histories and the recommendations of this private report&mdash;to see whether the case has been made for giving the board full statutory power to make regulations governing adoption societies. It seems extraordinary that there could be any possible doubt about the pre-placement and post-placement supervision in relation to any of the adoption societies.  It seems incredible that we do not take this basic measure to ensure the creation and maintenance of standards in adoption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>What we all want to do is ensure proper standards.  The proper standards depend on the personal efficiency of the people in the field.  This cannot be prescribed by statutory regulation.  That is the nub of the question.  Normally, a duty to make regulations is imposed on a body which has failed to make them voluntarily. That is not the case with the Adoption Board.  They have made regulations for the conduct by adoption societies of their work.  To suggest legislatively that they should do what they have already done is, I think, pointless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson indicated that they could apply the ultimate sanction as to withdrawal of registration.  This sanction is already available and can be applied in any case where the societies fail to conform to the regulations which have been made by the board.  Miss Darling's research is very valuable because&mdash;I indicated this in my Second Reading speech&mdash;it is the first research that has been done in that area.  I have deprecated the lack of research in this <Col N="1125" /> field and congratulated her on her initiative.</P>
    <P>She, herself, takes pains to indicate that her sample is narrow, that she failed to get co-operation from the people she sought co-operation from, and that some of her conclusions may be distorted by reason of the narrow sample and this lack of co-operation. It was not possible, therefore, for her to impose the controls which are so necessary to have a valid scientific study and research.  I am not saying this in a spirit of carping criticism: I am merely repeating what Miss Darling said herself in regard to her own study.  Nevertheless, it shows things that would be disturbing and I would like anyone who had information of malpractice by any society to draw the attention of the board to it, so that the threat of the sanction could be invoked to rectify the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not think there can be any gain by imposing an obligation to make statutory regulations when the obligation is already being discharged voluntarily. The sanctions that could be given by the statutory regulations are already there.  I sympathise with Senator Robinson's desire to see standards raised.  We all share that desire.  The raising of standards will not depend on whether the regulations are made on foot of a statutory provision or whether they are made voluntarily.  They will come from the observance of these regulations and from the personal efficiency of the workers in this field. The regulations are there, the sanction is there to enforce them and I am providing money to raise the expertise of the workers in this field and presumably thereby also the efficiency of these workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The power to cancel the registration of adoption societies is obviously a very serious move, and the Adoption Board, presumably, would be slow to do this because it would mean that the particular adoption society could no longer function as such. Reading the statutory provision which governs this, section 37 of the parent Act, the Adoption Act of 1952, I am not satisfied that the Adoption Board could exercise that power at present in relation to their non-statutory regulations, <Col N="1126" /> the so-called &ldquo;guidelines&rdquo;.  Section 37 as it stands at the moment provides:</P>
      <P>The Board may cancel the registration of a registered adoption society on any ground which will require or entitle the Board to refuse an application for the registration of the society or if it appears to the Board that the requirements of this Act are not being adequately complied with by the society or if an offence under this Act is committed by the society or by any person acting on its behalf.</P>
      <P>It does not say that the board could cancel the registration of an adoption society for its failure to comply with the guidelines and I do not think that you can apply that in this way.  For failure to comply with the Act, yes and for an offence under the Act and on any ground which will require or entitle the board to refuse an application.  What I would say is that I do not think the board would see that they have clear power for breach of the guidelines, for failure to meet recommended standards at present, to decide that would be the ground for tampering with the registration of an adoption society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see the relevance of the reference.  Subsection (2) (b) to which the Minister refers says that the board shall not register any body of persons unless the board is satisfied that the body is competent to discharge the obligations imposed upon registered adoption societies under this Act but there is no statutory authority for the board's guidelines and the board, as a statutory body, must operate within the limits of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I see as the basic difference between accepting an amendment such as that proposed is that this would create the possibility that the board could cancel registration for failure to meet the standard provided for in such statutory regulations and that this would be a proper ground for cancelling registration.  I do not find it surprising that no adoption society has had its registration cancelled.  This, in any case, would be a regrettable step and I am not suggesting for a moment that there <Col N="1127" /> is any adoption society which ought to be de-registered but I would say that the Adoption Board, has no existing authority to cancel the registration of any society even if it utterly ignores the present guidelines.</P>

    <Title>Prosecution of Offences Bill, 1974: Second Stage</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: That the Bill be read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan</i>): Two considerations prompted the introduction of this Bill.  The first was to remove any possibility which might exist for any member of the public to think that political or other irrelevant considerations could <Col N="1128" /> influence the administration of the criminal law.  The Government do not accept that any such considerations have, in practice, influenced the administration of the criminal law.  Nevertheless, the Government regard it as a matter of importance that even the danger of any such suspicion being harboured by members of the public be eliminated, and that the administration of the criminal law be not alone impartial and free from outside influence but be manifestly so.</P>
      <P>The second consideration arises from the vast increase in the burden placed on the Attorney General in discharging his primary function under Article 30 of the Constitution of advising the Government on matters of law and legal opinion.  The area of governmental activity, both in domestic and international affairs, has widened very considerably in recent years and requires the speedy furnishing of legal advice on matters which are frequently of great complexity.  One example alone, our accession to the EEC, has added a completely new dimension to the work of the Attorney General, as many of the governmental activities which resulted from that accession have a very substantial and important legal content. Other developments in recent years have added greatly to the burden of work placed upon the Attorney General in his advisory capacity, and it is no longer possible for an Attorney General to discharge as effectively as he would wish both his functions of legal adviser to the Government and public prosecutor. Accordingly, the second aim of the Bill is to relieve the Attorney General of his responsibilities in the latter area and to enable him to devote his attention to his primary function of legal adviser to the Government which, as Senators will appreciate, frequently requires the furnishing of advice as a matter of very considerable urgency.</P>
      <P>The Bill accordingly proposes the creation of the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions and the conferring on the director of the powers, duties and functions at present exercised by the Attorney General in relation to criminal and certain other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In achieving in the Bill the first aim set out above, the independence of the <Col N="1129" /> director in the exercise of his functions is obviously of the greatest importance. This is expressly provided for in subsection (5) of section 2.  The same section provides for the establishment of a committee to select candidates for appointment to the office of director. The Government can only appoint a person selected or amongst those selected by this committee which will consist of the Chief Justice, the chairman of the General Council of the Bar of Ireland, the president of the Incorporated Law Society, the secretary to the Government and the senior legal assistant in the office of the Attorney General.  Senators will, I think, agree that this is an eminently qualified committee to undertake the task of selecting candidates for the important office being created by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government wish to give the committee as wide a range of choice as possible.  Accordingly both practising barristers and practising solicitors of at least ten years' standing will be eligible for appointment as Director of Public Prosecutions.  In addition, barristers and solicitors working in positions in the Civil Service for which practice as a barrister or solicitor was a necessary qualification will also be eligible.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (4) of section 2, the director will be a civil servant in the Civil Service of the State.  He can only be removed from office by the Government after they have considered a report from a committee consisting of the Chief Justice, a judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice and the Attorney General.  This provision which is contained in subsection (9) of section 2 will further strengthen the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Furthermore, the director will not be accountable to, or in any way subject to, the direction of the Attorney General in relation to the performance of his functions.  In neighbouring jurisdictions, the situation is different&mdash;the director is under the superintendence of or responsible to the Attorney General for the performance of his functions.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) of section 2 merely provides for periodic consultation between the Attorney General and the director.  While it is anticipated that such <Col N="1130" /> consultation will occur on a regular basis it is clear that it will not in any way affect the complete independence of the director.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that the director will perform all the functions at present capable of being performed by the Attorney General in relation to criminal matters and election and referendum petitions.  The section also contains certain transitional arrangements to facilitate the director continuing proceedings which may have been initiated by the Attorney General in criminal matters, election petitions or referendum petitions.  Under subsection 3, the Attorney General will retain his function in relation to any question as to the validity of any law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution. The Attorney General will therefore continue to be a necessary party in proceedings in which the constitutional validity of any Act of the Oireachtas may be in question.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 29 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, will apply in such a way that both the Attorney General and the director will have power to certify that a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal involves a point of law of exceptional public importance and that it is desirable in the public interest that an appeal should be taken to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 34 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, are being similarly treated by the Bill. Thus, in relation to courts, other than the Court of Criminal Appeal, both the Attorney General and the director will have power when, on a question of law a verdict in favour of an accused person is found by direction of the trial judge, to refer the question of law to the Supreme Court for determination, without prejudice to the verdict in avour of the accused.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in subsection (5) of section 3 of the Bill whereby the consent of the Attorney General will be required for the continuation of a prosecution after a person is charged in respect of offences under the enactments referred to in the subsection.  This is a very restricted provision referring to just three enactments.  Because of their nature&mdash;involving as they do matters of <Col N="1131" /> national policy, security and the public interest&mdash;Senators will understand the reason why the Attorney General should continue to exercise some responsibility for them.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in section 5 for the performance by the Attorney General in certain circumstances and in relation to specified kinds of criminal matters, of functions conferred by the Bill on the director.  The Government are empowered under this provision to make an order specifying such matters when they are of the opinion that the interests of national security so require.  Any such order that is made will be subject to review by the Oireachtas under section 12 of the Bill.  Again I think it will be clear to Senators that national security must be the concern of the Government and that they must have the ultimate responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>As the Government may have access to information not available to the director, and as they might arrive at an appreciation of security matters different from that of the director, it is clearly necessary that the Attorney General be empowered to act in the way envisaged. Once an order is made under the section, the director will no longer be empowered to act in relation to the functions specified in the order.  The Government would hope that the exceptional circumstances in which they would be required to make such an order would not arise but, nevertheless, this enabling provision is necessary for the reasons I have stated.  It is also to be noted that the operation of this section would not interfere in any way with the independence of the director, or the Attorney General, in the exercise by him of his function in criminal matters.</P>
    <P>Section 6 contains another important plovision which will contribute to the impartial administration of the criminal raw.  Here it is proposed to make it unlawful for anybody, other than those persons specifically mentioned in subsection 2, to communicate with those involved in the administration of the criminal law, including members of the Garda Síochána, so as to influence decisions to withdraw or not to initiate criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> The concern of the Government in incorporating such a provision was to bring home to the public at large, the reality of the situation regarding the practice of making representations in such cases.  At this stage, it is not proposed to create a punishable offence for breaches of the provision.  The Government are confident that the unlawfulness of such practice will become quickly known and accepted.  Should this not happen, the Government would, of course, consider the introduction of amending legislation creating a punishable offence for breaches of the section.</P>
    <P>However, I think it very unlikely that such a step will prove necessary. Senators will note that the section provides for certain exceptions.  Thus, an accused person or persons who believe themselves likely to be defendants in criminal proceedings, as well as a person involved in a criminal case as a witness or as legal or medical adviser, or as a social worker or a member of the family of a person involved in the matter, will not be prohibited from making communications to the prosecuting authorities.  It will be appreciated that information made available by such persons can be of considerable assistance in the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill deals with the question of the distribution by the Attorney General and the director of State briefs to barristers.  I do not propose to go into the allegations that have been made from time to time about the lack of impartiality exercised in this matter.  Suffice it to say that such allegations will have no basis whatever when this Bill becomes law.  It will remove any lack of confidence which may have existed in the administration of our legal system as a result of such suggestions.</P>
    <P>The section provides that both the Attorney General and the director will distribute State briefs in a fair and equitable manner.  There is provision for consultation with the Bar Council in relation to the administration and implementation of the section.  In addition, there is provision in subsection (4) for the establishment of a complaints procedure to investigate <Col N="1133" /> allegations by barristers that the section is not being operated properly.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides, in section 4, that functions which the director or the Attorney General may perform by statute or otherwise can, by his direction, be performed on his behalf by a professional officer in his office in accordance with particular or general instructions. Section 8 makes provision for the proof in court of documents issued by the Attorney General or the director or by a professional officer of the Attorney General or of the director.  These sections will assist in the more efficient administration of justice without in any way derogating from the rights of accused persons.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections contain provisions ancillary to the main purposes of the Bill including the appointment of a temporary director or an acting director in the event of the office of director becoming vacant or in the event of the director becoming incapacitated due to illness.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is, in general terms, acceptable to this side of the House.  It has a number of worthwhile features.  Although there are certain points which I will be criticising and possibly putting down amendments to, I would like to make it clear that the Bill, in principle, is acceptable and one which we welcome.  The method of appointing the Director of Public Prosecutions is in general terms a good one.</P>
      <P>First, I will deal with sections 2 and 3 which deal with the necessary qualifications of an applicant.  Subsection 3 (<i>a</i>) reads:</P>
      <P>A person shall not be appointed to be the Director unless at the date of his appointment he is a practising barrister or a practising solicitor and has practised as a barrister or as a solicitor for at least ten years.</P>
      <P>Subsection (b) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of this subsection, service for any period in a position in the Civil Service for appointment to which practice as a barrister or a solicitor was a necessary qualification <Col N="1134" /> shall be deemed to be practice as a barrister or a solicitor, as the case may be, for that period and a person, while holding such a position shall be deemed to be a practising barrister or a practising solicitor, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>Up to a point I do not disagree with this provision.  I certainly do not think that merely because a person is not a practising barrister or solicitor or is in a Civil Service position, he should be excluded from consideration for this appointment.  It is important that the person selected should, in fact, have had a considerable number of years in practice as a barrister or a solicitor. Consequently it would have been preferable, while allowing a civil servant to be appointed, that this section should have been drafted in such a way that a minimum period of practice approaching ten years should be necessary before a person could qualify for appointment to this position.</P>
    <P>It would be possible under this section as it stands for a man after a very short time in practice to be in a Civil Service position for quite a long time&mdash;and his practice would have been almost forgotten&mdash;which was not very relevant to the duties of Director of Public Prosecutions.  For that reason this section, although acceptable, might be amended to some extent in the way in which I suggest.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (6) states:</P>
    <P>The Attorney General and the Director shall consult together from time to time in relation to matters pertaining to the functions of the Director.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear what the purpose of this subsection is.  Perhaps the Minister in replying would comment on it.  It seems to be both unnecessary and futile.  Is there a technical reason for it? It is almost inconceivable that the Attorney General and the director would fail to consult together from time to time.</P>
    <P>If some kind of personality clash is envisaged or feared, fact that there is a subsection here which tells them that they must consult together will not achieve anything.  Perhaps the Minister <Col N="1135" /> would comment on the reason for this subsection.</P>
    <P>In my view the appointment committee is a very good way of making recommendations for this appointment. The one omission from the list is the President of the High Court.  He would be an even more relevant person for inclusion in this committee than the Chief Justice, because the President is the person who administers the higher courts dealing with crime.  He must have a very wide knowledge of the prosecution of crime and administration of the criminal courts.  I would be inclined to include him in this committee if for any particular reason the committee should be expanded.</P>
    <P>The committee to be set up under this section will make recommendations to the Government.  The Government will select somebody from the names forwarded by the committee.  It is disturbing to find that the Government can, in fact, refuse to accept the recommendations of this committee.  As I have said, this is a very distinguished committee which could be and should be depended upon to select the people, who would be eminently suitable for the job.  Nevertheless in this Bill the Government reserves the right to refuse to accept the recommendations put before it by the committee.  Subsection 7 (c) (2) provides that the Government would ask the committee to think again and put forward some further names. I think this is a very likely development. One could not blame the committee, having put forward a number of names and gone to a great deal of trouble to pick what they considered to be suitable people, if they were told the Government did not like any of the candidates and were asked to select some more.  It would be understandable if they were less than enthusiastic the next time.  This is likely to lead to considerable difficulty and annoyance on the part of the committee.  Consequently this might be treated in a slightly different way.</P>
    <P>If the committee sent forward one or possibly two people, the Government for quite good reasons, particularly if they had only one name before <Col N="1136" /> them, might decide that they did not have much confidence in that person for one reason or another.  This section should provide that at least three names should be put forward by the committee. This would allow the Government a choice because they would not be faced with just one name.  It would be reasonable that the Government should have to take their pick from amongst the names which were put before it.</P>
    <P>The definition of a &ldquo;law officer&rdquo; is put at the end of section 4 and not with the definitions at the beginning of the Bill.  I appreciate that it says in this section that law officer means the Attorney General or the Director or the Acting Director.  There may be some reason why the definition should be restricted to the particular section but even allowing for the fact that there is some difficulty in expanding that definition to the entire Bill, there is no reason why the definition should not be in section 1 while at the same time specifically referring to section 4. When one is in some doubt as to what exactly a &ldquo;law officer&rdquo; means, the natural thing to do is to look at the definition section at the beginning of the Bill.  It is very annoying and misleading when, after a lot of trouble, one finds that that section does not include a particular definition of a law officer. Life is difficult enough without introducing these kind of idiosyncrasies. I suggest to the Minister, and I will put down an amendment to that effect, that that particular definition be put in the definitions section.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the prohibition of certain communications in relation to criminal proceedings.  This in my view is a ridiculous section. The best that can be said about it is that it is window-dressing.  Indeed it is a bit of pious humbug.  It will not achieve anything.  It will not stop anything.  It is simply not necessary.  It is undermining the public service by suggesting that representations will undermine the integrity of the Attorney-General's office or the Director of Public Prosecutions' office.  It was suggested that this has happened in the past and is likely to happen in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a lot of words I could use.  To make the matter even more ludicrous, the section says that it shall not be lawful to communicate with the Attorney General and so on. But it is not an offence and there is no sanction against doing it.  It is a prime fundamental of the law that we should not have an offence unless there is a penalty.  It is meaningless.  If one wants to philosophise about it, this merely encourages people to do something which is not lawful even though no offence which can be punished is committed.  If there is no penalty attached a great opportunity is provided to do something which is not lawful and still avoid any penalty.  It merely reinforces what I said about this section.  It is a section which is ridiculous. It is window-dressing and pious humbug. It means nothing.  It will not achieve anything.</P>
      <P>I do not want to impose on the House to look at this section for very long because it is not worthy of such attention, but it defines what a member of the family is.  It gives a long list of people who are members of the family and who can, because they are members of their family, make representations. This long, long list goes on.  Inevitably with a long list of people who are members of a family, one will leave out some people.  I have no reason at all to believe that if I was ever in serious trouble with the law that, for instance, my mother-in-law might not be the person who would be most anxious to make representations on my behalf. According to this section, it will be unlawful for her to do so.  She will not be in very much trouble but if she is a conscientious person she will be appalled at having done something which is unlawful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole idea behind this section and ridiculous aspects of it immediately present themselves when one thinks about it.  It says nobody except the people who are so carefully defined here may make representations.  It is quite conceivable that a member of the public who is not within any of the definitions here, but who may <i>bona fide</i><Col N="1138" /> have some information or very good reason to believe that a particular prosecution should not be taken is precluded from making representations and getting in touch with the Attorney General's office and saying he has reason to believe, for one reason or another, that this prosecution should not go on.  Unless he is within the list of people he is doing something which is unlawful.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to take this section seriously or to understand why it was included in the Bill.  It is a foolish section for the simple reason that it will not stop representations being made. People who are not aware of section 6 and who do not understand, know or believe that there is anything wrong with putting forward their point of view will make representations.  Of course it would be the duty of the Attorney General or the director of Public Prosecutions not to entertain these representations but they should not have to be told so in this section. Representations have been made in the past and will be made in the future. I do not think they were entertained or acted upon in the past, and I am sure they will not be acted on in the future. This section is not going to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>It is the duty&mdash;as everybody knows&mdash; not only of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions, but of every person in public life and in high office to repudiate and reject undue influence on them as to how they should do their jobs.  This is not a new or complicated concept but merely a matter of integrity.  Everybody in public office should have integrity.  If it is not present already it will not be created by a section of a Bill as is attempted in this case.  The Minister should drop this section quietly and proceed with the other sections, most of which are worthwhile, make sense and will improve the administration of the criminal law.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the system of briefing barristers in criminal prosecutions. The position up to now has been that by and large, those members of the Bar who were supporters of the Government of the day got most of the briefs. That, of course, was something which <Col N="1139" /> was disapproved of by many people. It was patronage and was undesirable. It should be made clear that there were always more than sufficient competent members of the Bar to do the work available, within the limitations of the system.  Although it can be criticised in some ways, it did not interfere in any way or prevent the work that had to be done being done competently and adequately.  It did mean that certain sections of the Bar got nearly all the work while others did not.  The system which is now proposed is a better one. Consequently, the change which is proposed is a good one and one which I welcome.  I think it certainly will lead to less criticism and a more even distribution of work in the Bar in future.</P>
    <P>This is a change which should have been made some time ago.  The Minister who introduced this Bill deserves credit for the fact that he finally got around to doing so even though it is something which had been proposed for some time past.  These are the only points I wish to make on this Bill.  It is a Bill which has a number of good features and one which we, on this side of the House, have no hesitation in accepting in principle.  We will be putting down a number of amendments on the points which I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points which I would like to make in relation to this Bill.  I can understand the point of view expressed by Senator Ryan, with regard to section 6 of the Bill but he did not give sufficient account to the words of the Minister in his opening speech with regard to this section.  The Minister made it quite clear that what was involved here was an effort on the part of the Government to bring home to the general public the undesirability of representations and approaches being made to&mdash; under this Bill&mdash;the Director of Public Prosecutions, in an effort to stop proceedings being initiated.  That effort on the part of the Government should be commended.  It may be that this section, which is a novel section, is open to the type of criticism which is being directed against it by Senator Ryan but the effort is worth making.  Most of us who have been in public life for a period, <Col N="1140" /> will appreciate the type of representations that are made to public representatives and the frequent embarrassment of a public representative who is asked to make representations regarding prosecutions which are either pending or in process.  Personally, even if it were to do nothing else, I would regard this section as worthwhile from the point of view of the public representative who is able to show the person who approaches him or her the contents of this section which preclude him from making representations.  That is important.</P>
      <P>The most important aspect of this is what the Minister referred to in his introductory speech when he stated that the concern of the Government in incorporating such a provision was to bring home to the public at large the reality of the situation regarding the practice of making representations in such cases.  It may be that the inclusion of this section in the Bill will not achieve the stated and desired hope of the Government in the matter.  If that is so the Minister has spelt out quite clearly that the Government are prepared to go further and that they have deliberately omitted from the section, at present, any question of penalties, in the hope that the inclusion of the section, in the Bill as I understand it, will have the desired result.  The Minister has spelt out that if it does not have the desired result the Government are quite prepared to consider amending legislation which will provide for penalties where representations of this sort are made by people who have no interest or are not entitled under the Bill to make representations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is roughly my viewpoint with regard to this section but there is one matter, possibly of a technical nature, that I would like to raise with the Minister.  It may be that it is not necessary to do anything about this, that the wording of the Bill as it stands is sufficient.  It is quite clear that what the Government have in mind is the making of representations designed improperly to influence the decision of the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions, as the case may be.  It is not stated in the section that what are <Col N="1141" /> in mind are representations designed improperly to influence, and I would just have a fear that the kind of case that was referred to by Senator Eoin Ryan might arise; that a person who does not come within the category of accepted persons under this section&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A social worker, for instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>A social worker would be included under the exceptions but it could be that someone who does not come within the category of exceptions might for one reason or another have acquired knowledge which would be relevant for consideration as to whether a prosecution should be taken or if proceedings have been commenced, whether they should be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>The section as it stands would mean that one would have to adopt a very cumbersome method for communicating that knowledge to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It could be done but the procedure would be cumbersome. If the person who has the knowledge, even though it be relevant, even though it be perfectly <i>bona fide</i> and in the interests of justice should be communicated to the Public Prosecutor, does not come within the category of accepted persons, he or she cannot communicate that knowledge.</P>
      <P>If they communicated the knowledge, the Director of Public Prosecutions is obliged by statute to disregard it.  Any lawyer will point the way to get around that.  For instance, a person with the knowledge will go to one of the accepted persons, a member of the family or someone else, and get the knowledge conveyed in that way.  It seems to me that that is unnecessarily cumbersome and it might be worth having a look at it again to see if there is any real danger of this situation arising whereby knowledge which would be relevant and which would serve the interests of justice is precluded from reaching the ears of the Director of Public Prosecutions by reason of section 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point on section 6 which I would ask the Minister to consider is the point I referred to earlier as to whether the word &ldquo;improperly&rdquo; should not be included in subsection (1) (a) <Col N="1142" />&mdash;for the purpose of improperly influencing the making of a decision. There are points which should at least be considered.  Possibly they have been considered and if so I am sure the Minister will be able to satisfy the House when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Let me come back to the basic point here which I think is of the utmost importance.  What is in question here, and this has been made clear by the Minister, is really an effort to educate, if you like, members of the public as regards their responsibilities in connection with the making of representations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one other section on which I should like to comment&mdash;section 7.  This section has received a welcome from Senator Ryan and I, too, welcome it. The aims which the Government have enshrined in this section are very commendable and very laudable but here again there possibly are dangers that the section, if it is not properly received by the Bar generally&mdash;I imagine it will&mdash;is the kind of section that contains within itself the danger of making it unworkable.  The whole idea is that State briefs should be distributed in a fair and equitable manner both by the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  There are certain guidelines laid down by the section as to what should be taken into account by these two law officers in coming to decisions on that question. There is the suitability of the barrister in question, the public interest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and putting it bluntly, the amount of briefs he may already have got, either in that year or in other years.  It seems to me that if you have a fractious Bar at any particular time, trouble could be created under this section.  There are a number of qualified barristers.  It is only possible to brief a certain number of them in any period of a year or two years. Those who do not get briefs would, it appears under this section, be entitled <Col N="1143" /> to create a fuss about the matter.  I am in two minds about this.</P>

      <P>I like the idea of enshrining this in legislation and at the same time I do not think that it would be in the interest of the general public that the law officers in question should be too rigidly tied down or that they should have to look over their shoulders too much to find out what the Bar in general are thinking.  Those are simply some thoughts I have on the section; I do not know whether I am right or wrong, but I think they are worth uttering.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill as introducing a considerable improvement to the legal system and institutions of the State and incorporating balance of fairness and of objectivity in the way in which our law is processed.  I regret that, because we are into the July &ldquo;gallop&rdquo; and because of the late hour of the evening after a long day, my thoughts on the Bill may be more random and more disjointed than would be desirable.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in particular because it will create two distinct roles. It will create a much more significant role for the Attorney General in his capacity as adviser to the Government and hopefully allow him to be an instrument for constitutional development and an instigator of legal reform: a function for which I can see a very real need at the moment.  At the same time it will create a quite separate role of prosecutor in criminal matters who will decide how the State briefs in this area will be distributed in the legal profession.  In achieving that dual purpose the Bill has several merits which I hope will be seen in other similar legislation which may come before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method of appointment is commendable.  It is not just the usual appointment by the Government without consultation with any other interests or without any objective criteria to be met in making such appointment.  We have too many mexaples of appointments to office in <Col N="1144" /> this country being in the sole jurisdiction of the Government of the day. This is not a good way of creating confidence in the objectivity of the particular person appointed.  I welcome the fact that section 2 provides for a committee and that this committee will recommend several names from which the ultimate appointments will be made.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ryan's comments on the qualifications of persons who could be among the names recommended.  In relation to a person in the Civil Service there ought to be a requirement of a minimum period of practice as a barrister or a solicitor.  I would support his view on this.  The particular function of Director is one which requires not just a nominal experience in practice as a barrister or solicitor but a substantial working knowledge of one or other of the branches of the profession.  Also, I welcome the fact that the position of Director of Public Prosecutions will be open to solicitors as well as to barristers.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 4 of the Bill I am not too happy with the provisions of subsection (1) (a) which states that:</P>
    <P>A law official may direct any of his professional officers to perform on his behalf and in accordance with his instructions any particular function of the law officer in relation to particular case or cases or in all cases in which that function falls to be performed.</P>
    <P>As Senator Ryan pointed out, &ldquo;law officer&rdquo; in this context means the Attorney General or the new Director. Does this delegation extend to cover the role which the Attorney General formerly played and presumably which the Director of Public Prosecutions will now play in relation to certifying what persons are to be sent for trial to the Special Criminal Court?  This is not a function I would like to see delegated to somebody lower down the scale because certification by the Attorney General effectively deprives a person of trial by jury and directs that person to go instead to be tried by the judges of the special Criminal Court, it is therefore a function which should be exercised either by the Attorney General as at present or by the Director of Public Prosecutions in person.  It should <Col N="1145" /> not be delegated and we, as Members of this House, should be very concerned not to allow derivation from the personal responsibility of the law officer concerned for any certification which deprives the individual of trial by jury.</P>
    <P>This is particularly necessary because of the very broad terms of reference under which the certification can be done.</P>
    <P>The Offences Against the State Act 1939 provides that certification in some instances can be done in relation to scheduled offences but there is also authority under that Act for sending a person accused of any criminal offence for trial to the Special Criminal Court rather than for trial by jury either in the Circuit Criminal Court or the Central Criminal Court.  It is essential that this power be retained in the sole responsibility of either the Attorney General or the Director and that it is not one which can be delegated and, therefore could become lost in the particular Department and certified by any particular officer to whom the matter comes, without the particular safeguards which are absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>I would welcome clarification on that section and would hope to introduce an amendment if it extends to the powers exercised at present by the Attorney General, in relation to certifying people to be tried before the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment briefly on section 7 of the Bill apropos the retaining of barristers on behalf of the State.  I welcome the fact that the criteria will be more objective and an attempt will be made as provided for in subsection (1):</P>
    <P>... in such manner so as to effect a distribution of such retainers amongst them that, in the opinion of the Attorney General, is fair and equitable, taking one year with another, having regard to their suitability in relation to any particular retainer, to the public interest and to the distribution of retainers under subsection (2) of this section.</P>
    <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions also has to bear in mind these objective criteria.  It has been a very serious <Col N="1146" /> criticism of the legal profession, particularly of that branch of it to which I belong&mdash;the Bar&mdash;that the retainers have been handed out on the system of political patronage.  Any young barrister coming into the Library could see very clearly, within some weeks of entering, that if he wanted to make an income there was a sure road to it by joining the party of the Government of the day and that if he did not do that he would not get any State briefs.  That he would be entirely dependent on other briefs and that he would be substantially worse off than his contemporary who joined the political party.</P>
    <P>This system had a corrosive effect. It was a very unfair and as somebody who witnessed the pervasive and invidious effect of it I welcome any legislative attempt to remove this factor from our legal system.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion at one stage that this type of political patronage only existed in relation to one former Government, and that when there was a change of government recently, it no longer operated.  I was interested during my researches for a paper I prepared as Professor of Criminal Law in Trinity on the Special Criminal Court to find that, going through the records of the two years during which the court was in operation and listing the names of prosecuting and defending counsel that in the list of prosecuting counsel for a period up to shortly after March, 1973 one could put certain initials after the names of prosecuting counsel, whereas after that period one began to put different initials after the names of prosecuting counsel in the Special Criminal Court.  The fact that this exercise could be carried out over that two-year period was an illustration of the degree to which briefs were handed out on the basis of political patronage.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill because it will have the effect of freeing the Attorney General from what must be a considerable work load in relation to criminal matters at the moment, so that he may advise the Government in relation to constitutional matters and in relation to matters pertaining to the European Community.  This will be a decided advantage to our legal system in general and, hopefully, it will make the role of <Col N="1147" /> the Attorney General a more creative one which will promote more consciously the type of reforms which are so necessary to our system.</P>
    <P>A further step which we should take in creating the types of institutions we need would be the step of creating the equivalent of an ombudsman or parliamentary commissioner who could hear complaints against maladministration. This would be a further step in creating through our institutions, a confidence in the system, in ruling out malpractices which have grown up during the years and ensuring that the rule of law in its best sense prevails in relation to the operation of the whole procedure of law and the legal system in the country.  I approve the fact of this Bill subject to getting clarification on the point I raised in connection with section 4 on which I propose, if necessary, to introduce an amendment.</P>

      <P>I want to make it quite clear that the principle behind this Bill is totally acceptable.  The whole idea of dividing responsibility in this area was under examination by the last Government and this is a matter that flows on from what has become, what you might call, as the Minister said in his introductory remarks, an administrative necessity by reason of the burden of work now placed on the Attorney General in his capacity as adviser to the Government and in his rapidly growing capacity of adviser in regard to European affairs.  There is no question about it; the Attorney General as adviser to the Government, as the man sitting in at Government meetings and giving legal advice to them in regard to Government day-to-day administrative affairs and in regard to our involvement with other countries, has a very important wholetime job.</P>
      <P>The other consideration referred to in the Bill is that, from the point of view of appearing&mdash;I use that word deliberately&mdash;to the public, which is often important, to be impartial and distinct from the Attorney General, the prosecution of criminal matters should fall within the ambit of the Director of Public Prosecutions as set out in this Bill.  This is excellent and acceptable and, indeed, welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> I would like to take issue with Senator Robinson and, indeed, with some of the tenor of the implications in the Minister's opening remarks in regard to something going wrong in the Attorney General's office or that, to any degree, since the formation of the State, Attorneys General and their staffs were in any way wrong.  I want to repudiate this totally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel very strongly about this.  In my view, we have had a distinguished list of Attorneys General ranging from a former Taoiseach, ex-Deputy John Costelloe to ex-Deputy P. McGilligan and ex-Deputy Lavery; we have had the present respected Justice of the European Court, Cearbhaill Ó Dálaigh, the last Attorney General and the present Attorney General.  I am just skating over generations quoting names of people who, since 1922 have, in my view, done a tremendous honour to the Office of Attorney General.  Any notion, implicit or explicit, that in any way any of these Attorneys General or their staffs were in any way involved in anything that could be regarded as against the public interest in the prosecution of criminal matters should be repudiated and I repudiate it here and now on behalf of all of them and their staffs.  I am sure the Minister will join with me in that repudiation.  It is for this reason that I dislike&mdash;I want to put it in as sanely as possible&mdash;the whole tenor of section 6 of the Bill.  This is a section of what one might call aspiration.  Aspirations have their place.  We are all full of aspirations.  We are all full of moral intentions, as we saw last night, but these are matters not suitable for inclusion in a statute passed by a responsible Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, the clearer a Bill of this kind the better.  The Bill is too important for the inclusion of aspirational nonsense such as we have in section 6, the whole tenor of which implies that in some way harmless representations have been made over the years to Garda officers.  State solicitors, Attorneys General, politicians and so on and that these harmless representations, 99 <Col N="1149" /> per cent of them well-intentioned, are in some way damaging to public morale and to the community at large. It is a lot of twaddle, a lot of nonsense, and the Minister knows that.  Why it should be included here in a section in a very serious legislative measure, and included without any sanction or any penalty, just included, as I say, as a pious aspiration, is something that defeats me.  That is not what this legislation is about.  It is about a very serious matter.  It is quite right for us to establish an office of Director of Public Prosecutions, separate from the Attorney General, because the job of Attorney General is in itself a wholetime job.  As I said earlier, from the point of view of appearance, it is better that the job should be separate.  Why then bring in this nonsense in section 6?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister very seriously to consider what I am saying. Perhaps I am using extreme language in describing it, but Senator Ryan described it in even greater detail.  Senator O'Higgins suggested certain amendments which, I think, would only make confusion worse confounded by incorporating who is to decide what is proper and improper in matters of this kind.  Let us forget about that.  We are a mature society.  Provided a proper person is appointed&mdash;this is where I welcome section 2 where a scheme of appointment is established which will ensure that the proper person is appointed&mdash;we need go no further.  It is set out in section 2 that the committee will consist of the Chief Justice, the chairman of the General Council to the Bar of Ireland, the president of the Incorporated Law Society, the secretary to the Government and the senior legal assistant in the office of the Attorney General.  Senator Ryan suggested that, in, addition, there should be the President of the High Court.  That is a matter worth considering.  Here you have a scheme of appointment established which is very welcome.  Appointment&mdash;again, I do not go the whole way with Senator Ryan here&mdash;is subject to an ultimate decision by the Government. Senator Ryan objects to that. He suggests that the scheme of appointment, of itself, and the committee of itself, should be sufficient to ensure that <Col N="1150" /> the right person is appointed.  I would always, as an ex-Government member myself&mdash;defend the ultimate right of the Government to have a say in the matter.  At any rate, the screening process and the qualification process are sufficiently adumbrated in section 2 to ensure that, in so far as is humanly possible, the right type of person will be appointed to this job.</P>
    <P>Give or take whatever amendments the Minister may consider after the debate here, I think the whole scheme of appointment and the general principle underlying section 2 are welcome. Why, in the name of heaven, add section 6 on top of that?  If we are going to have the right type of person as envisaged in section 2, why put in this nonsense in section 6 about representation, as if to suggest, by implication, that in some way the person who will be appointed, who hopefully will be a person of the highest integrity and regard, appointed under a screening process that is fairly good though, in my view, it might be improved, is in some way, or some of the staff whom he will appoint and be responsible for, is going to be influenced by ordinary representations? Really it is a bad principle to introduce this sort of nonsense into legislation.  It is meaningless.  It is unenforceable.  There are no penalties that can be devised.  It is entirely aspirational in form.  It is bad generally because, by implication, it means that previous Attorneys General or their staffs were in some way wrong in this matter of succumbing to representations. I do not believe that for an instant and that belief applies right across the board, irrespective of party or irrespective of Government.</P>
    <P>There is the same sort of nonsense running through section 7 about barristers. I do not see how the Attorney General is going to ensure that the barristers selected by him to advise him, or the director is going to ensure that barristers retained by him are going to be, like Caesar's wife, above suspicion. Let us have regard to the integrity of the people appointed.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson has left the House. She paraded many things we hear these days about appointments.  I am speaking now as someone who was responsible <Col N="1151" /> for recommending to the Government the appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court, who is now the Chief Justice and who was election agent for ex-Deputy, now Judge, Tom O'Higgins in his first effort to become President of Ireland.  I made that recommendation to the Government, and I was supported in it by the then Taoiseach, the late Deputy Seán Lemass, and the man whom I recommended for appointment to the Supreme Court at that time was the outstanding legal practitioner in the State at that time.  I personally have been responsible for a number of such appointments and the Coalition Governments and Cumann na nGaedhael Governments were equally responsible.  I do not go along with this nonsense that politicians are incapable of looking other than through party blinkers.  It is time for politicians of all parties to look for themselves.  They made it quite plain that they do not particularly want advice in regard to making responsible appointments and if there are people who have supported respective political parties, and if they have the capacity and ability to serve in a capacity on the bench, be it district, circuit, High or Supreme Court, I see no reason why they should not be appointed by a Government of responsible men.  I can think of no better selection process than a Government of responsible politicians meeting in a responsible way in committee to make a decision.</P>
    <P>I only gave one or two examples, but I know of far more chicanery in regard to all sorts of other methods of alleged independent-from-politics systems of appointment that have operated in the past and are still operating.  I do not see why politicians should not stand up and be counted in this and other areas. In my view, the standard of honesty and the standard of morality in regard to appointments by politicians can be often far better and far in excess of similar standards that are purported to be operated by officials or by other people devised under some sort of aspirational section of a statute to be independent, above board, and apart from politics and apart from undue influence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1152" /> The basic point which I should like to make on the principle of the Bill, which I welcome totally, is that we should rid ourselves of the sort of nonsense there is in section 6 and, in some degree, in section 7, and say to ourselves that we are appointing an officer who will be thoroughly screened in the manner set out in section 2, with final Government decision in case the committee do not come up with the proper person.  As I said earlier, I disagree with my colleague to some extent here in that I think the Government should be the final arbiter in a matter of this kind.  If it was left at that it would be an excellent Bill and would be free of any nonsense.  I would appeal to the Minister&mdash;I know that he is a sensible man who has come up the hard road of politics and the law&mdash;to look at this in the way I suggest and to rid a very good Bill of unnecessary nonsense of this kind.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention one legal point, for clarification purposes more than anything else; I refer to section 3 which is the important one in regard to what the Director of Public Prosecutions will do.  I note that under subsection (1) everything that is referable to the Attorney General heretofore will now be referable to the Director of Public Prosecutions in regard to the functions to be exercised by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the references to the Attorney General are to be construed accordingly.  I note that subsections (4) and (5) specify that notwithstanding anything in this section, the Attorney General may, in addition to the Director, exercise functions under section 29 of the Courts of Justice Act and section 34 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, and in subsection (5), again notwithstanding anything in the section, that the Attorney General preserves these powers.</P>
    <P>Again, for clarification, there is a very important power of which the Minister is aware.  Under section 62 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, the Attorney General may proceed on his own in regard to any case where he may consider it desirable despite what the district justice may do.  The Minister is aware that the Attorney General has <Col N="1153" /> the right to proceed on his own.  I want to know whether that power is included under subsection (1).  I hope it is because I think it is a very useful fundamental power to have in the hands of the Attorney General.  If it is, why is it not specified as subsections (4) and (5) are specified?  Here there are specific Attorney General powers specified in subsections (4) and (5) and a very fundamental power which is there under section 62 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, is not similarly spelled out.  I want to know is the Minister satisfied that he has included this power in the global provision of subsection (1) and, if so, why is it not spelt out?  Why the necessity to spell out subsections (4) and (5)?  It is a legal-cum-drafting point.  Why have subsections (4) and (5) spelled out and why not spell out this particular power under section 62 (1) of the 1936 Act? In other words, why have subsections (4) and (5) there at all, if they, equally, with section 62 (1) of the 1936 Act can be included in the global provision of section 3 (1)?  I think the Minister takes the point.  It does seem a bit sloppy from the point of view of drafting to write in two specific Attorney General powers into two specific subsections and the most important power of all, which is a basic one, in my view giving him the right to prosecute on his own, is included in an overall global provision rather than being spelled out.  Why have two minor powers spelled out and a very important major power not spelled out?  I can assure the Minister that this has been a cause of some concern in some areas and I should like clarification on the matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I think it would be much better without section 6. I do not think there is any merit in amending it as Senator Michael O'Higgins suggested; that would only add confusion.  I think he was just speaking to a brief or speaking because of his particular situation as Leader of the House.  Basically, I think the Bill would be far better without section 6. I would suggest deletion.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is full of the same aspirational nonsense and I would like its deletion also.  It is not in quite the same <Col N="1154" /> aspirational vein as section 6.  The quality of the Bill would be far better without either of these two sections. Certainly it would be better without section 6.</P>

      <P>First of all, I would like to thank the Senators who have spoken for what I regard as a generous acceptance of the Bill on the whole.  The Senators welcomed the Bill and accepted it for what it is&mdash;a piece of reforming legislation long overdue.  I should like to deal with two general points first before dealing with various other points made by the Senators.</P>
      <P>First of all, Senator Lenihan seemed to think it necessary to make it clear that there was no reflection cast on either the present Attorney General or any previous holder of the post or on their staffs.  I want to make it clear that there was no reflection cast on either the present Attorney General or any previous holder of the post or their staffs. I do not know whether Senator Lenihan was here when I made my Second Reading speech or whether he read my script, but I believe I made it perfectly clear in my statement that neither myself nor the Government suggested that there was any malpractice or any undesirable practice in the Attorney General's office either at present under this Government or under any previous Government.  I want to make that abundantly clear.  The Government are satisfied that all holders of the post of Attorney General discharged their duties in the most efficient and best possible tradition of the Bar.  That goes for the staff of the Attorney General.  I am sorry that Senator Lenihan found it necessary to introduce that note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I am coming to that in a minute.  Both in this House and in the Lower House it was made clear that there was no such implication either directly or indirectly. I am somewhat surprised that both Senator Ryan and Senator Lenihan are dissatisfied with section 6.  I believe that section 6 is a very desirable section.  I believe it is long overdue.  I am not suggesting for one moment that representations <Col N="1155" /> which have been made to Garda superintendents, or State solicitors, or the Attorney General, in the past have borne fruit.  I am not suggesting that they influenced those officers in any way in the discharge of their duties. I do believe that there is still in this country a belief that it is not what you know but who you know that matters. The sooner that is killed the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>But you do not kill it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): And I believe that section 6 will do something to kill that.  I would have thought that particularly Members of Parliament would have welcomed section 6.  It merely seeks to prohibit people from communicating with the Director of Public Prosecutions, or the Attorney General, or other people in charge of prosecutions, with a view to influencing the withdrawal or the non-initiation of a prosecution.  I believe that is a good thing.  It is a fact that in the past such representations have been made and following those representations, perhaps, prosecutions were not brought. They would not have been brought anyway if the representations had never been made.  I am also satisfied that people who had these representations made thought that it was as a result of their representations that proceedings were not started.  That is the sort of thing I think should be killed.  It is the sort of thing we should see an end to.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is because I practised as a solicitor for quite a number of years that I recoil from this sort of approach.  My flesh creeps when somebody asks me: &ldquo;Will you see Superintendent so-and-so, or will you talk to the Attorney General?&rdquo; It is really foreign to the training of a member of the legal profession. Yet under the law as it stands, if you refuse to do this you are making bad friends for yourself.  I welcome the lay when I will be able to say to anybody who asks me to do that: &ldquo;I am very sorry, but if I did that, I would be breaking the law.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Maybe the Senator would know more about <Col N="1156" /> those things than I do.  He has longer experience.  I welcome the day when I will be able to tell people that I cannot make representations because it is not lawful.  I also believe that the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and other people charged with the enforcing of the law and the bringing of prosecutions will welcome this Bill and will welcome section 6 because they, too, will be able to say to all and sundry: &ldquo;I am sorry.  I am not permitted by law to discuss that with you.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): They will have a section at their disposal now to reinforce them.  Senator O'Higgins was a little bit afraid lest people might be prevented from passing on information to the officers concerned.  I am satisfied that there is nothing in the section to prevent a member of the public from passing on relevant information by way of a statement to the gardaí in charge of the case or to others in charge of the case.  It was never intended by the section that that should be prohibited and I do not think the section forbids it.  It talks about communications. It does not use the word &ldquo;representations&rdquo; but it is really representations that it is getting at.</P>
      <P>Those were the two points I wanted to deal with in the first instance.  Senator Ryan accepted the Bill in principle.  He thought that the qualifications of the Director of Public Prosecutions should be spelled out more clearly.  In particular, he seemed to think that service in the public service should not be reckoned as part of the ten year service as a barrister or as a solicitor qualifying a person for the post.  Senator Ryan understands, I know, that in order to qualify the person must hold a post for which the qualification of a solicitor or a barrister is a prerequisite.  I agree with Senator Ryan that he could then spend three or four years in the Civil Service doing work which might not be regarded as practice at the Bar, or practice as a solicitor, and that that would be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan may be satisfied that the committee which the Bill sets up to <Col N="1157" /> interview applicants for the position and report to the Government will take into consideration the length of service the civil servant has served, and will take into account the type of service&mdash; the type of work that the civil servant has been doing&mdash;and will weigh that on the one hand against the length of time that the other applicants have spent practising at the Bar, or practising as a solicitor, and will decide which best qualifies the applicant for the position which he seeks.  I think Senator Ryan may rest at ease in the knowledge that the committee which is to be set up will be a very highly qualified and impartial committee and that it will bear all those things in mind.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also raised a query on subsection (6) of section 2 which provides that the Attorney General and the director shall consult together from time to time in relation to matters pertaining to the functions of the director.  I would refer the Senator to the immediately preceding subsection which says that the director shall be independent in the performance of his functions.  The fundamental provision of the section lays down that the Director of Public Prosecutions shall be independent in the performance of his functions and that he will not be compelled to account to the Attorney General, the Government or anybody else.  As I pointed out in my opening speech, that is somewhat different from the practice prevailing in neighbouring jurisdictions where the director is subject to the Attorney General.  Having regard to that subsection it is necessary to write in subsection (6) so that the director will not think that he is so independent that he does not even have to discuss general policy with the Attorney General.  There is nothing more sinister in it than that and I think it will prevent the Director of Public Prosecutions from being so independent that he might become awkward.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also thought that the President of the High Court should be on the committee provided for in subsection (7) (a) of section 2.  The idea in drafting this subsection setting up this committee was to make it a strong committee but to ensure that it <Col N="1158" /> would not be unwieldly.  It was decided to have a judge of the High Court or the Supreme Court on it and in selecting such a judge the highest judge in the land was selected, that is the Chief Justice for the time being.  The Chief Justice very often presides in the Court of Criminal Appeal and has generally first-class knowledge of the criminal side of the courts as well as the civil side.  I suppose the President of the High Court might have been selected but I imagine if we came in here with the President of the High Court as chairman of this committee we would be asked why did we not select the Chief Justice.  It is a matter of selecting one of them and we selected the senior judge.  I think that the Seanad will be satisfied that we were right in doing so.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also raised the point that the Government may reserve the right to refuse to accept a name submitted to it by the committee.  The overriding safeguard here is that the Government cannot appoint a person who has not been recommended by this committee.  It is true that they may refuse to appoint a person for some reason that might be known to them, and that might not be known even to the committee but the public safeguard, if it is necessary, is that the Government cannot appoint a person who has not been screened and recommended to them by the committee consisting of the Chief Justice, the chairman of the General Council of the Bar of Ireland, the president of the Incorporated Law Society, the secretary to the Government and the senior legal assistant in the office of the Attorney General. They cannot appoint somebody who has not been screened and certified as competent by that committee.  I think that is an adequate safeguard and I would ask the Seanad not to tie the hands of the Government beyond that because in the ultimate the Government must accept responsibility for this important appointment.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan was also worried about section 4 because the definition of &ldquo;law officer&rdquo; was left to the very end of the section.  As a practitioner myself I sympathise with him because you have to read to the end of the section <Col N="1159" /> before you find a definition of &ldquo;law officer&rdquo; which appears in the first line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My point was that it should be in section 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): The Senator thought that it should have been transferred to the definition section. The Senator from his experience will know that there are many, many precedents for defining a term when it appears only in one section, in that section.  I think that is what has been done here.  I do not think the term &ldquo;law officer&rdquo; appears in any other section. For that reason it was defined in the section in which it appeared.</P>
      <P>It was Senator Ryan who first dealt with section 6.  I repeat that I think it is a section that will do a lot of good.  It will do something to bring home to the general public that not alone justice is done but that justice is seen to be done. I think that there is nothing more objectionable than when somebody comes to a TD or a Member of Parliament and asks him to make representations and tells him that there was a case a couple of years ago when somebody saw so-and-so and there was nothing more about it.  I want to put an end to that and I am not alleging that these representations bore fruit but they got credit for bearing fruit.  I cannot understand Senator Ryan and Senator Lenihan on this.</P>
      <P>Section 7 deals with the distribution of State briefs and I think it has been generally welcomed by everybody, with the possible exception of Senator Lenihan who gave it a sort of mixed reception.  I think it does nothing more than seek to put an end to the closed shop.  I think we all agree that the closed shop should be ended in this particular branch of the law.  Furthermore, I think it is something that will be welcomed by the first Director of Public Prosecutions.  If the new Director of Public Prosecutions assumed office and had no direction as to which counsel he should brief he might be uncomfortable. I hope that he would not be uncomfortable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I hope he would not be, but he has the direction here.  He knows that he is expected to be completely impartial in his prosecutions. He has a statutory direction giving him independence and a direction directing him to retain counsel on a fair basis.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins dealt with section 6 and I hope I have assured the Senator that the section does not prevent the placing of relevant information in the hands of the proper officers.  It does not do any such thing.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins also spoke on section 7 which deals with the distribution of briefs and I have also dealt with that.  Senator Robinson gave the Bill an unqualified welcome as a piece of reforming legislation.  She did raise one point in regard to section 4 which provides that a law officer may direct any of his professional officers to perform on his behalf and in accordance with his instructions any particular function of the law officer in relation to a particular case or cases or in all cases in which that function falls to be performed. I want to be perfectly clear about this.  There is no question of general delegation of authority here or indeed of any delegation of authority. At present certain functions are performed by the Attorney General in person: he must give the direction himself. He must, for example, direct that a person who is charged with an indictable offence may have that offence disposed of in a summary manner.  It is also true that at present, the Attorney General must direct under section 47 (1), of the Offences Againt the State Act, who will be brought before the Special Criminal Court.  He must be communicated with regardless of where he is; the facts must be put before him as clearly as possible and his direction obtained.  Very often that has to be done by long-distance telephone calls.  Very often the official seeking the direction has much more information about the case than the Attorney General, and more than he could hope to communicate by telephone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section enables the law officer, that is the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General, to direct <Col N="1161" /> a professional officer to perform these functions on his behalf.  A professional officer is a person with the qualification of a barrister or solicitor, in his office. He can give directions to that officer to discharge these functions on his behalf. Of course, he will give his directions having regard to the type of case and circumstances.  From long experience by many Attorneys General, this is an amendment of the law which is necessary and is not in any way an abuse of the functions of the director or the Attorney General.  It is merely calling a spade a spade.  I think that is the point about which Senator Robinson was worried.  I ask her to accept that explanation.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the first two points raised by Senator Lenihan.  He was fearful that some aspersion was being cast on the Attorney General's office. I do not think he really was; that was just a political point which he could not resist making.  I have said very clearly that there is no such intention.  That was stated by me and by those who handled the Bill in the other House.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan did raise a serious point on section 3 (1).  The position is that the omnibus provisions of section 3 (1) enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to send forward somebody who appeared before the district justice, where the district justice refused information. The only person who will now be in a position to send that man for trial will be the Director of Public Prosecutions.  There will be no dual function there.  The Attorney General will not have that right.  That is as it should be because this is part of the clear functions of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Sections 4 and 5 are put in to remove doubts and make it abundantly clear that the Attorney General retains the functions set out in sections 4 and 5 because the rights conferred, clearly, on the Attorney General, in subsection (4) of section 3 are in relation to an appeal on a point of law from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court, <Col N="1162" /> and on a reference of a point of law from the trial judge to the Supreme Court where somebody has been acquitted by direction without prejudice to that acquittal.  It is clear why the Attorney General should still retain those powers&mdash;because they are concerned not with the prosecution of criminals but with the clarification of the law.  The Attorney General is the proper officer to see to it that the law is clarified and that wrong decisions do not become law.  That is the point behind that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Between lines 27 and 28 to insert &ldquo;&lsquo;law officer&rsquo; means the Attorney General, the Director or the Acting Director&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment will put into effect what I said earlier that &ldquo;law officer&rdquo; should be inserted in the definition section and not at the end of section 4. I am aware that the Minister suggested this was because the word &ldquo;law officer&rdquo; only appeared in section 4.  This does not seem to be a sufficient reason.  If it is absolutely necessary to make this point, the definition in section 1 could say that &ldquo;law officer&rdquo; where it appears in such a form means the Attorney General and so on.  I have not had <Col N="1164" /> time to look through the entire Bill but it seems to me that some of the definitions in section 1 do not appear more than once or twice in the remainder of the Bill.  Therefore, that objection does not seem to me to be valid.  As I mentioned, the difficulty and confusion which will arise from people looking through the definitions for the definition of &ldquo;law officer&rdquo; and finding it later in the Bill are very strong arguments for putting the definition in the definition section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say, before the Minister replies, I understand Senator Ryan's point of view but that is only because Bills have always been drafted in this way with the definition section.  From the point of view of the ordinary practitioner, it would be much better if, in this and future Bills, definitions appeared in the appropriate section or where they are first referred to.  Certainly where there is only one reference in a section to a particular definition then it is far easier on practitioners that that section should contain the definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment but when I started looking through this Bill and got as far as section 4, I saw the first line of the section read: &ldquo;A law officer may direct any of his professional officers to perform on his behalf,&rdquo;<i>et cetera.</i>  What is a law officer?  What is a professional officer?  I went to the definition section and there I was told what a professional officer was but not a law officer.  So I went back in some despair to the section and when I got right to the end I discovered what a law officer was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A professional officer, which is in the definition section, appears twice in this Bill, but &ldquo;law officer&rdquo; appears only once.  Technically, the Minister is on sound ground there.  It is the custom in these cases to put the definition into the section when it only appears once. Nonetheless, for practical purposes when one is reading this Bill the first time either &ldquo;law officer&rdquo; or &ldquo;professional officer&rdquo; appears is in section 4.  If we want to know what they are, in one case we look in the definition section and in the other we wait until we get to subsection (4) of section 4. <Col N="1165" /> There we find out what a &ldquo;law officer&rdquo; is.  As happens quite often, we find that the parliamentary draftsman's rather abstruse methods of reasoning&mdash;which are performed in accordance with precedent and are fully understood by the parliamentary draftsman and his officials&mdash;do not make life easier for the ordinary man-in-the-street or, indeed, the ordinary legal man who is trying to read a Bill of this kind I feel that perhaps sometimes common sense could triumph over precedent I am in no doubt that if Senator Ryan's amendment was accepted generations of legal practitioners would be grateful</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan</i>): As I stated in reply to the Second Stage debate, the reason for defining &ldquo;law officer&rdquo; in section 4 instead of in the definition section, is that the expression &ldquo;law officer&rdquo; appears in section 4 only.  Section 4 is a short section.  It is neater and tidier to have a definition in the section instead of having to refer back a number of pages to the definition section.  Legal men when referring to a definition section are inclined to assume that the definition will appear in that section. On the other hand, there is nothing original in this procedure in defining the term &ldquo;law officer&rdquo; in the only section in which it appears.  There is ample precedent for that.  Senators who are members of the legal profession, particularly barristers, will know that it is frequently done; I would nearly say it is invariably done where it is set out to define a term which appears once only.  I would ask Senators to accept that.</P>

We should always remember that there are good and bad precedents.  In my view this is a bad one.  Where the House has an opportunity to eliminate a bad precedent and to improve not only this Bill but also drafting procedure generally, we should avail of the opportunity. Admittedly there is precedent for this but it should not deter us from doing something which would be an improvement to the Bill and in drafting generally.</P>

Would he be willing to consider changing the numbering of the subsections of section 4 and make No. (4) into No. (1)?

      <P>In subsection (7) (a) line 17 after &ldquo;the Chief Justice&rdquo; to add &ldquo;or the President of the High Court&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This arises from my suggestion that the President of the High Court is a more appropriate person to be on this committee than the Chief Justice, or certainly just as appropriate.  My purpose was to allow a choice between the two.  We had very little time to draft these amendments.  I realise now that, as it stands, it would not be clear as to who was to make the choice.  Had I had more time to draft the amendment, I would have said the Chief Justice or judge of the High Court nominated by him, so as to give him an opportunity to delegate this task to the President or some other judge.  The Chief Justice may sometimes feel that it is not a task for which he is particularly well qualified. He may be pleased to hand it over to some other judge and in particular to the President of the High Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): The amendment, as drafted, would create <Col N="1167" /> a position where either the Chief Justice or the President of the High Court might head this distinguished committee. I do not think it desirable that the composition of the committee should be as loose as that.  It is better to have a definite type of committee. As Senator Ryan said, the amendment as drafted is defective.  I am not blaming him for that.  I know it was drafted at very short notice and he had no opportunity to consider it.  Assuming there was a choice which would rest with the Taoiseach, Members of the House could complain about that and rightly so. They might say that on one occasion the Chief Justice would be appointed and on another occasion the President of the High Court.  It is much better if the composition of the committee is known and definite.  This House has control over it now, but if we were to let this Bill out of the House with &ldquo;the Chief Justice or&rdquo; we would be losing control over the composition of the committee.  The Oireachtas should not give away that power of defining that committee.</P>
      <P>There is provision in the Bill for the nomination of a person in place of one of the people mentioned if, for any reason, they should signify their intention not to act.  It is set out in subsection (7) (a) (ii):</P>
      <P>In the event of any of the persons aforesaid signifying at any time his unwillingness or inability to act for any period as a member of the committee, the Taoiseach may, after consultation with the Attorney General, appoint another person to be a member of the committee in his place for that period.</P>
      <P>The House may be satisfied that if the Chief Justice were to stand down for any reason, it is virtually certain&mdash;I am not binding the Government or the Taoiseach -that he would be asked to nominate a judge in his place.  I would ask the House to accept that explanation. The same explanation was given in the Dáil I understand.</P>

    <P>In subsection (7) (b) line 31 after <Col N="1168" />&ldquo;select&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not less than three&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consider this amendment very seriously.  This whole procedure of setting up a very high-powered and distinguished committee and leaving it open to the Government not to accept these recommendations is a bad one.  It is very clumsy and reflects very badly on this distinguished committee if their recommendations should be rejected and they are asked to try again.  It will certainly lead to bad feeling and will be regarded as a slur on the committee.  I see no reason why the Government having handed over the selection of candidates to this committee should not be obliged to accept one of the candidates put forward.</P>
    <P>I agree that if the Government found themselves with just one candidate&mdash; this section suggests there must be more than one&mdash;or perhaps with two they might legitimately have reasons why they did not like either of them and consequently might be in some difficulty. To meet this point I am suggesting that the committee would be asked to select not less than three candidates and that having a choice of three, the Government should then be obliged to appoint one of the three candidates.  That would give them a reasonable choice. One must assume that the candidates would be of a very high calibre, having been selected by this committee, and that the Government should&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 4 eliminates the power of the Government not to appoint any of the candidates selected by the committee pursuant to the particular request.  My suggestion is to ensure the Government have at least three candidates to select from but, having been given that choice, they should be obliged to take one of these candidates.  That would be a much <Col N="1169" /> better way of dealing with the matter. It would not be unduly restrictive as far as the Government were concerned but would ensure that the committee would not find themselves in the position of having their candidates rejected by the Government.  Should the Government continue sending back these candidates to the committee it is quite clear that in due course the procedure would simply break down and we would have another Bill before us to amend the procedure for appointing the director.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): It sets up a very distinguished and impartial committee who will recommend candidates to the Government as suitable for the position.  It is important to note that the Government may not appoint a person who has not been recommended by that committee and who has not been certified by that committee as suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also very important to note that when the Director of Public Prosecutions is appointed he becomes independent. He is independent of the Attorney General.  He is independent of the Government.  He can only be removed from office after a report has been obtained from another distinguished committee.  I think that it is unreasonable to fetter the Government in the manner suggested by the amendment. Indeed, we might also be fettering the committee because if the committee are obliged to put forward three names, what happens if there are only two applicants?  We cannot assume that there are going to be several applicants for this post.  If there were only two applicants it would be impossible for the committee to submit three names. I emphasised, when replying to the Second Stage debate, that the overriding built-in safeguard in so far as the public is concerned, if such a safeguard is necessary, is that the person who is appointed must be selected by this <Col N="1170" /> committee and, so to speak, certified by the committee as suitable.  We are not being realistic when we talk of the Government getting a number of names and saying: &ldquo;We will not appoint any of these&rdquo;, then asking the committee to go into session again and refusing once more to make an appointment from the panel put forward.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): The section provides for the very unlikely situation of a candidate or candidates being put forward but who are known to the Government from information available to the Government, and, possibly not available to the committee, as being unsuitable.  If the Government were to act as suggested by Senator Ryan in refusing to accept one panel, and in refusing to accept another panel, they would obviously be behaving in an irresponsible manner and that would very soon become public because I could see the committee resigning and refusing to put forward any more candidates.  They would, in that way, bring about&mdash;I was going to say a constitutional crisis&mdash;a statutory crisis in regard to the making of this appointment. Therefore, I do not think the Senators are being realistic in putting forward this amendment.  This is the first time since the foundation of the State that a Director of Public Prosecutions has been appointed.  Indeed, it is the first time that machinery of this type has been provided for the appointment of any such officer.  It is a very big step in the right direction and, as I say, is a safeguard to ensure that the person who is appointed is acceptable to this committee.  The ultimate responsibility must rest with the Government.  I repeat the other point I made that what is proposed might just be impossible.  I know this is an unlikely point but it is just as likely as the point made by the Senator in putting forward the amendment. There might not be three candidates and therefore, the machinery would break down because the committee could not put forward three names.</P>

      <P>It is unrealistic to think <Col N="1171" /> that for this position, which everybody, in discussing this Bill, has acknowledged will be a position of great importance, prestige and so on, there might only be two candidates.  That is as may be but there is a contradiction in terms.  There is a serious conflict of approach here, in, on the one hand referring to the setting up of a committee of such distinguished people and on the other hand spelling out that in spite of the trust the Government are placing in the committee, which would be the most prestigious committee that the Government could think of, they may reject the advice given to them by this committee.  The Government should be obliged to accept one of the candidates put before them by this committee and if the Government are not prepared to do this they should not set up the committee at all.  If they are not prepared to accept the kind of advice that they get from a committee of this kind then they should not set up the committee. They should merely act on their own advices and possibly set up a committee unofficially and ask a few people to suggest some names to them. But formally to set up a commiteee of this kind and formally to say that: &ldquo;However, we may not accept the names they put forward&rdquo;, seems to be a contradiction in terms.  It seems to be going a very long way in one direction and then doubling back at a certain point and saying: &ldquo;Nevertheless, we just may not accept the advice we get.&rdquo; This is a very wrong principle.  Either my amendment should be accepted or else the Minister should withdraw the suggestion of a committee of this kind altogether.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to prolong the discussion on the amendment but it does seem to me that, first of all, the point the Minister made is valid&mdash;that the acceptance of this amendment might, so to speak, &ldquo;ban-jax&rdquo; the whole idea of the Act if there were not three candidates for the position. It is unlikely that that situation would arise but it could arise and if it did then the net effect of Senator Ryan's amendment, if it were incorporated in the Bill, would be to make the Bill unworkable.  Neither he nor anybody <Col N="1172" /> who has spoken on this Bill wishes to see that happen.</P>
      <P>The other point I wish to make is that it does not seem to me that there is anything particularly sacrosanct as between three and two.  If the Government wanted to act irresponsibly when only two names come up before them they could act exactly in the same way if there were three names put before them.  Consequently, I do not see how it would help if the committee were shackled by having to forward three names and possibly might not be in a position to do so.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, this is the first legislation of this sort.  What is here is a reasonable provision.  If, in the course of time, it transpires that there are difficulties, this legislation can be amended.  It is breaking new ground. It may have teething troubles and if it has, it will be the responsibility of the Government of the day to bring in amending legislation.  The Bill should be given a chance.</P>

Subsection (7) provides that &ldquo;if the Government decide not to appoint to be the Director any of the candidates selected by the committee pursuant to a particular request under that paragraph,&rdquo; then they can go on and either appoint somebody who was previously recommended or they can ask the committee to make another recommendation.  It is still in the hands of the committee.  If, instead of appointing somebody who was previously recommended, or asking for a further recommendation, the Government were at liberty to go on and make an appointment of their own, without any reference back to the committee, then I would say that Senator Ryan would have a valid point, an unanswerable point.  I repeat that if the Government fail to appoint somebody recommended to them by the committee for good and valid reasons they do not get themselves out of the hands of the committee.  They are still in the hands of the committee and they must go back to the committee and ask them for another recommendation, I cannot see a Government taking those steps <Col N="1173" /> unless it is for the best of reasons. Certainly I cannot see them carrying on what I would describe as the performance suggested by Senator Ryan because they would be certain to bring themselves into ridicule and to create a situation where a committee appointed by the Chief Justice would not act.  I can see that if they did not appoint the person selected by the committee, they would probably make known to the Chief Justice the reason for not appointing that person.  There are plenty of safeguards in this subsection and I request Senators not to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>If the Minister has envisaged the possibility that there might be only two applicants I would like him to visualise the position where this happens and the committee recommend them both as being suitable but the Government refuse to accept either. What is the position?  Who will apply then for a position where two suitable applicants, according to the leaders of the profession, have been nominated, recommended to the Government and the Government refuse to take either? Who would apply for the job after that had occurred?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing on which we are all agreed on all sides of the House and that is that the person appointed to be Director of Public Prosecutions under this section should be by a person of the highest possible standing; his standing in the profession or the Civil Service, as the case may be, will be such that he will be accepted by everyone as a suitable person to be Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried by the terms of subsection (4) which says that he shall be a civil servant in the Civil Service of the State.  I wonder could the Minister tell us what Government thinking is on this? What particular rank in the Civil Service is he likely to hold?  The problem seems to be that if a practising lawyer is appointed, as indeed I think should <Col N="1174" /> be the case rather than a person in the anonymous recesses of the Civil Service who would have difficulty in gaining the acceptance that is required, but if you are going to appoint a person who is eminent in the law, that person is already earning a very considerable salary and it is highly unlikely that the right kind of person would be interested in a position unless its terms are at least moderately comparable with what he is earning at the moment.  The only grade with which it would be practical at all to equate him with would be that of a secretary of a Department.  Anything less would merely lead to the position that either you would have a series of civil servants&mdash;all excellent people in their own way, but not, I think, really what we want in this case&mdash; or you would be getting barristers or solicitors of not quite the top grade, if it is worth their while to acquire this position.  The terms must be such that you will really be able to get those who are eminent in their profession.</P>

      <P>I would like to support very strongly the point that has just been put forward by Senator Yeats. This Bill will be nugatory in the extreme unless the reality incorporated in this section is implemented, in other words that we appoint and establish, <i>ab initio</i>, a Director of Public Prosecutions who is above reproach, a person who will be so invested from the very start with the type of prestige and the type of salary that can be equated with that of a High Court judge or of the Attorney General.  We do not want a faceless bureaucrat as Director of Public Prosecutions.  If we have that sort of situation then the whole Bill will be nugatory and fruitless.  What we want is an outstanding person in his or her profession, who has got humanity, compassion and top class legal ability. That is the sort of person that the spirit of this Bill envisages and I share thoroughly with Senator Yeats the concern that in any way this important position would be diminished.  I appreciate that, of course, the director, when appointed, will have to be a civil servant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate that must be so from the point of view of the Civil Service and public service obligations and remunerations and so on.  At the same time the point raised by Senator Yeats is very important.  It would be no harm at this stage, in what I view as a very important Bill, if we could get from the Minister an assurance that a person of the top class calibre that we envisage will be appointed to this position and that it just will not be a faceless person in an office. A regulation will have to be devised to meet the situation so that it will be a person of the category I mentioned&mdash;a High Court judge or Attorney General. The person should be in that level and of that status.  I am certain that the screening process under the section envisages that type of person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I share the views of the Senators that the person to be appointed should be a person of very high calibre and that he should be seen to be such and be regarded as such.  It is clear that he will be a person who will be of the same status as the Attorney General because he is taking over the function that has been discharged by the Attorney General since the foundation of the State.  Therefore, the House may take it from me that the person will have similar status as and be of similar calibre to the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already the person to be appointed has been built up into a very important person because this Bill is really all about him.  The Bill which is introduced here is for the purpose of appointing him.  Subsection (4) states that &ldquo;The Director shall be a civil servant in the Civil Service of the State&rdquo;.  But from the very next subsection it is abundantly clear that he is not going to be an ordinary civil servant because it states that &ldquo;The Director shall be independent in the performance of his functions&rdquo;. Other civil servants are subject first of all to their superiors in the Civil Service, and, secondly, to the political head of their Department.  In this Bill it also provides that other civil servants can be removed from office by the Government by a simple decision but elsewhere in this Bill it is provided that this particular civil servant can only be <Col N="1176" /> removed from office after the Government have obtained a report on him from another distinguished committee consisting of the Chief Justice, another judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice and the Attorney General.  Therefore, I repeat that I share the concern of the Seanad for securing that this officer, in calibre and in status, will be a man who will stand out as being a very important officer in the administration of justice in this country. That is the intention of the Government. That is the sort of man we will appoint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to hear the Minister, as one would expect, agreeing that the status of the director must be equivalent to that of the Attorney General.  I am still somewhat worried about the appearance in this section of subsection (4).  The Minister, and quite a number of people, have tended to say &ldquo;Oh yes, of course, he must naturally be a civil servant&rdquo;.  I do not see anything natural about it.  I would have thought, in fact, that in view of his functions and in view of the fact that, as the Minister pointed out in relation to section 5, he should be independent in the performance of his functions, that some person outside the Civil Service such as the Comptroller and Auditor General would have been much more apposite to the matter in hand.  His independence would be much better safeguarded.  He would not be then bound by the ordinary rules and regulations of the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>The problem with the civil servant is that in one sense he is cut away from all these statements as to his being independent and so on.  But more important in this particular context it puts him firmly in the ordinary pay scale of the Civil Service.  I do not know what is the salary of the Attorney General but I think I am right in saying that he earns more than the secretary of a Department. Once you put in subsection (4) then the maximum salary and the highest status that you can award our director is that he should be on a level with the secretary of a Department. That in itself would be fairly satisfactory though I am not sure that all lawyers of the eminence we would wish to see take up this post would necessarily be interested at that kind of level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> I would be very worried indeed about the reaction of the Department of Finance.  This is not a matter for this Minister for Finance or any other Minister for Finance.  We know the way the Department work at all times under all Ministers.  I can see the memoranda going the rounds after this Bill is passed.  I can see them going into great detail about the number of people employed in this section.  The director would have only so many people under him whereas if he were to get the secretary's status he would have to have so many.  It is impossible and would completely vitiate the whole purpose of the Civil Service and be contrary to all precedent for him to be more than an assistant secretary or something of that kind.  I would be very worried indeed that once he had to be a civil servant the status of our director might not end up at all in the way both the Minister and we would like to see it. One can only hope for the best.  It would seem from what the Minister said that no definite consideration has been given to the exact status that he will have.  I am not talking now about the theoretical status, the fact that they all look up to him and wish a good person appointed.  I am talking about status in the technical sense of the actual grade that he will hold in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the only possible grade is that equivalent to secretary of a Department.  I certainly would hope, if there is any suggestion of us having any lesser grade, that I myself or somebody else in this House would put down a motion rejecting the scheme once it has been prepared.  That seems to be the minimum requirement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): In the first place the director will be constituted a civil servant in order to give him permanency and to remove him from the realm of politics in the sense that he will not come and go with the Government of the day.  He will be appointed in a permanent capacity as a member of the Civil Service.  While I cannot just spell it out here I think that the wishes of Senator Yeats will be met. I am satisfied and I can assure the Senator that the man appointed will have what I may call an end-of-the-line status within the Civil Service on which <Col N="1178" /> he would not be seeking promotion within the Civil Service.  That, in other words, is meeting the description that Senator Yeats would like to put on him as secretary of a Department.  I understand without disclosing any secrets that the remuneration of a High Court judge is very similar to the remuneration of a secretary of a Department.  That is the sort of thinking that there is on the subject at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Any person who makes or entertains an unlawful communication under this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month or to both such fine and such imprisonment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some differences of opinion with regard to this section.  There are <Col N="1179" /> those who rightly point out that there is something to be said for public representatives making representations in certain cases in which they can bring facts that perhaps need to be made clear, to the attention of the authorities, but I am more inclined to take the line taken by the Minister.  While there are certain cases where public representatives can perform a useful function, at the same time it is important in the administration of justice that people should understand there is no question &mdash;we, as public representatives, know this to be the position&mdash;of criminal proceedings being influenced in any way by representations made.  Accepting that viewpoint, it seems to me that this section is really no more than some kind of vague windowdressing.  What it says, in effect, is that if certain named people &mdash;relatives, social workers and so on&mdash; make representations, those to whom they are made may listen though, of course, they should pay no attention to them, whereas, if other people, including public representatives, make representations they may neither listen nor pay attention.  In any event, if these representations are made, while they are unlawful, there is still no kind of criminal sanction involved.  I do not like to see the word &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; used. If, having committed an unlawful action, there is no sanction of any kind, then in order to bring some meaning into this section&mdash;it is a useful section&mdash; I suggest in this amendment that a third subsection should be added to provide that a person who makes such an unlawful communication and perhaps, even more important, somebody who entertains such a communication contrary to this section, should be liable to a fine not exceeding £50 or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding one month.  The actual amount would be fixed by the court.  This is necessary if section 6 is to mean anything and, in particular, if it is to achieve the end the Minister aims at as adumbrated by him in his reply on the Second Stage.  We must add to this subsection.  We should not simply say that it shall not be lawful to communicate or to entertain communications; we must provide these penalties.  This would add considerably to the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the adjournment it was argued this section did not mean anything; it was unnecessary and superfluous. I cannot understand how one can amend something that has no meaning.  Have some people changed their minds?  I also believe that section 6 has no meaning or value.  An endeavour was made to go back over the history of previous Attorneys General, showing the incumbents carried out their functions and responsibilities with the greatest integrity, honesty and credibility.  We heard about the praiseworthy activities of the previous holders of the office, irrespective of what Government were in power.</P>
      <P>Despite these arguments we now have an amendment.  Despite the integrity of those who held office in the past and the implied integrity of the person likely to be appointed to the new office, who will maintain the high standards which prevailed in the past, we have this amendment and I cannot see the logic in the amendment.  I do not see why a sanction should be written in or a watch kept.  On the one hand, it is argued he will be the same as those who preceded him and, on the other hand, it is argued that he might not be.  I cannot understand the reasoning behind this.  I am not a solicitor and I am surrounded by solicitors, but I find it difficult to understand the logic in this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Senator Harte's point of view, but I am supporting this amendment because of a certain attitude of mind.  This amendment, although I disagree entirely with the whole section, is a logical conclusion to the section as it stands. What the amendment purports to do is to bring into a meaningless section a penalty clause.  You do not, in my view, in any form of legislation take a particular stance or decision in a section of the law unless, side by side with that, you have a penalty.  That is what legislation is all about in any parliament.  You bring in a law; you advance certain provisions and, if people break those provisions, and act in an unlawful manner then penalties are imposed.  There is a logic in this amendment.  What I object to is aspirational or pietistic legislation.  You do not write morality into legislation. <Col N="1181" /> There is no point in section 6 telling people to stop writing letters to Garda Superintendents, State Solicitors, Directors of Public Prosecutions or Attorneys General; you do not put that into an Act of Parliament.  That would be a joke.  It would be making a joke of the whole parliamentary process.  There is a big education job needed among parliamentarians as to what we are doing here.  We are preparing positive proposals.  We had enough trouble last night as to what we are all about here; what we should be at here is preparing positive proposals, and, if people break those proposals, then there are sanctions and penalties imposed.  That is where the logic of this amendment lies.  You just do not say, as I said here, on section 6 that it is unlawful to write letters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said, in an interjection earlier on, that there is nothing against the telephone being picked up, a far more diabolical way of inducing influence than any writing of letters.  All you have here is a series of aspirations.  There is no point in writing the ten Hail Marys into a section of a statute of a sovereign democratic parliament.  That is another day's work.  We all say the ten Hail Mary's in our own time, but we do not write them into a section of an Act. There is a great deal of waffle here or, as ex-Deputy Dillon used to say, a lot of codswallop, written into section 6. It means nothing.  It is absolute codology. It is an aspiration that people should not write letters to people.  The section dealing with the appointment and the screening process is excellent. But here, after appointing a man of the utmost integrity and capacity, we suggest he should be asked to seek out people who write letters.  We all know that people write letters.  We all know it is almost impossible to stop Irish people writing letters.  Thanks be to God for the democratic process in that respect.  It may be burdensome and annoying but, so long as a man of integrity, when appointed, knows how to shift and make decisions in accordance with his own standards of integrity, that is fine but we just do not write it into legislation and make puerile idiots of ourselves with regard to a most important piece of legislation.  I just do not understand the need for writing this <Col N="1182" /> nonsense into section 6.  From the point of view of democracy and the high standards of those whom we appoint to offices of importance of this kind, we do not have aspirations of this kind written into legislation Senator Yeats's amendment is absolutely right in that, if people wish to write in matters of that kind, then they should be pursued to the full logical conclusion and penalties should be imposed and particular sanctions should be written in.  I shall say no more because the Minister may possibly have a closed mind in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly think there is a great deal of consistency and logic in this amendment.  It is an effort to try to help the Minister to sort out his own mind and eliminate the confusion in this section and in the section which we dealt with a short time ago.  In section 2, the Government, on the one hand, set up an important committee to select the director.  On the other hand, they possibly will not accept the recommendation made.  They say that the kind of practice referred to in the section is unlawful, is serious and that something should be done about it; having said that, they then proceed to say they are not going to make it an offence or do anything about it.  This is confused and inconsistent thinking. In my view, the section is nonsense. But if the Government want to press it, or proceed with it, logically they should say, that, if it is unlawful, an offence is created and there should be a sanction one way or the other.  Either withdraw it or do the thing properly.</P>

      <P>The Opposition are having a free vote, or a free think, on this because Senator Ryan and Senator Lenihan say that the section is useless, balderdash, call it what you like.

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): He gives that as his personal opinion.  That is why I believe the Senators opposite are having a free think on it.  I agree with Senator Yeats.  Apart from the all-important sections in this Bill, which provide for the appointment of a Director of Public Prosecutions, this is the most worthwhile section in the Bill. It sets out to make representations unlawful.  It does not constitute these illicit communications a criminal offence.  It simply makes them unlawful. If we were making them a criminal offence we would provide sanctions and penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opening speech I stated that the law in regard to these communications will become widely known and highly respected.  The very fact that the section is here will enable the officers concerned to say: &ldquo;Please, please, do not come near me about this.  You are insulting me if you talk to me about this.  Both of us are breaking the law.&rdquo; If Members of the Oireachtas want to avail of this they can do so when they are asked to meddle in the administration of justice.  They should say: &ldquo;I am sorry.  Under this reforming Government, this sort of thing has been outlawed and is illegal.  I cannot do anything for you.&rdquo;  I believe that this law will become widely known and highly respected and, in a very short time, there will be an end to this sort of representation.  Not alone will the law be impartially enforced, as indeed, it has been in the past, but it will be seen to be impartially enforced.  I have given an undertaking to the House and I would ask the House to accept it; if, in <Col N="1184" /> spite of this section, the Director of Public Prosecutions and other officers are still bothered by these fraudulent representations, which many of them are, the Government will bring in amending legislation to provide for penalties and sanctions.  I have given that undertaking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one small point I would like to make.  To me it is very genuine.  The Minister has just used a phrase &ldquo;fraudulent representations&rdquo;.  In fact, the most harmless and decent people write letters.  Letters freely written are the most harmless form of representation.  I do not have to engage the Minister's mind on all sorts of other representations, involving all sorts of relations, which are really dangerous. If there is any damage done at all in this area it is grossly exaggerated. Merely putting in a whole section purporting to stop people from writing letters is only catching very harmless and decent people who in many situations, are trying to do good.  The Minister is not really dealing with the real situation.  Do not write this section into a serious Bill.  That is my contribution.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I cannot satisfy both of them.  Would Senators accept from me that this section was not lightly put into this Bill?  It was put into the Bill in the light of what has been happening and in the knowledge that a great many people believe that you can get something if you make representations, or, more important still, by having representations made on your behalf.  I believe that is bad for the administration of justice.  In some cases in which representations are made prosecutions will not be taken.  They would not have been taken anyway if representations had never been made, but people will <Col N="1185" /> go about the country taking credit-and that is why I use the word &ldquo;fraudulent&rdquo;&mdash;for having got something for these people, for whom they actually got nothing.  That is the reason I want to ensure that this section remains in the Bill because I think it will do a great deal of good and will instil confidence in the administration of justice.  It will convince people that the Director of Public Prosecutions is there to deal with all citizens equally and that he does not need representations from anybody as to how he should deal with any prosecution.  He will deal with all on their merits.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): &mdash;&mdash; making representations&mdash;that we should suddenly then say that anyone who makes such representations will be fined £50 or get a month in jail.  That is too big a jump.  It should be sufficient, as a first instalment, to outlaw these representations or communications in the belief that, when it is known they are unlawful, they will stop.  If they continue, I assure the House the Government will bring in amending legislation to meet the sentiments expressed in Senator Yeats's amendment. I cannot go further than that.</P>

      <P>I doubt if, when we have dealt with this amendment, anything else will take us very long.  I would suggest that we carry on.  I shall be very brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make it clear to the Minister that, when I say I am in favour of the principle of section 6, I am in favour of it not as it stands but on the basis that some such amendment as this be accepted because, as I said earlier, the section as it stands is meaningless. <Col N="1186" /> We have listened again to the eloquence of the Minister defending the principle in this section.  It is an eloquence which I personally would be prepared to go along with, subject to the exact phrasing of the section.  I would be inclined to support the principle he sets out, but I wonder does he realise that, after 50 years of representations, as he says&mdash;and I must say that Senator Lenihan is more optimistic than I am&mdash;that the most difficult way to make representations is by phone.</P>

      <P>Perhaps he has a better phone than I have; he can get through. For the first time in 50 years, perhaps for the first time in our history, the Minister has, in fact, enshrined in this section a long list of people who are entitled to make representations.  In subsection (1) (b) we are told, in effect, that the people who receive them are entitled to entertain the representations provided they come from a father, a son, a brother, a sister, a step-daughter and so on, or social workers, but it is provided in subsection (1) (b) that, if a person referred to in paragraph (a) is of the opinion that a submission is in breach of that paragraph, it shall be the duty of the person not to entertain the communication.  If he is satisfied that he is not an uncle, who is out, but a father, who is in, telling him all about little Johnny he is entitled to entertain the communication.  For the first time you have a statutory backing which never existed before for this sort of representation.  Does the Minister, I wonder, realise that that is what he is doing?  He is authorising a long list of people to make representations in a most formal and statutory way, something which has never been done before.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Senator Yeats is now defending himself, not against me but against the Senators on either side of him.  What I am doing here is outlawing communications in general, but I am creating exceptions, When Senator Lenihan was discussing this Bill earlier in the evening I do not think he knew that I had provided for <Col N="1187" /> social workers.  I have provided for members of the family, and I think it is reasonable that a man should be able to plead for his son or his daughter.  I do not think it would be reasonable to make that a criminal offence or even to make it unlawful.  I am outlawing communications in general, but creating exceptions in favour of immediate relatives and social workers.</P>
