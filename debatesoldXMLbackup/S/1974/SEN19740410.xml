    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the House adjourned last night I referred to the support given by the media to the present Government.  This was demonstrated to me this morning in a special way in <i>The Irish Times.</i>  In that paper I am quoted as saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. McGlinchey detailed the situation for local elections in Derry and said that, when it came to gerrymandering, the present Minister <Col N="766" /> for Local Government was only an altar boy to Sir Basil Brooke.</P>
    <P>I think the House will agree that what I really did say was:</P>
    <P>that when it came to gerrymandering Sir Basil Brooke was only an altar boy to the present Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous difference between what I said and what I am quoted as saying.</P>
    <P>Before the adjournment last night I was giving examples of the support that an independent, impartial committee on boundary revision had from members of the present Government while they were in Opposition.  I note also in one of this morning's papers that, when Senator Mary Robinson was quoting a speech made by the present Minister on this subject in 1968, the Minister laughed throughout the entire quotation.  While I was not here when Senator Robinson was speaking I can only conclude that the Minister's laughter was due to his embarrassment, embarrassment on being reminded that he had changed his views on a very important subject from his Opposition days to his days in Government. If the Minister was sincere in 1968 he, more than any other man, is now in a position to put his words of 1968 into action.</P>
    <P>In Dáil Éireann on 27th November, 1968, the present Minister for Lands, and a former Member of this House, is also on record as advocating an independent impartial commission to do this work.  In column 1241 of volume 237 of the Official Report of the Dáil, he said and I quote:</P>
    <P>The only conclusion I can draw from the refusal of the Minister for Local Government to accept a commission or to seek the advice of all parties in this House and to insist on doing the job himself, with the assistance of his own henchmen, is that he is interested in arranging constituencies in a fair manner but rather is he interested in arranging them or rigging them in a manner which he considers best calculated to give an advantage to the Fianna Fáil Party. It would not be possible for me to make these allegations or to make <Col N="767" /> this type of speech if the Minister had sought the advice of an all-Party commission of this House.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the views of the Minister for Lands are today.  Seated, as he is, at the Cabinet table he is in a position to influence the decisions of the present Government.  No one could blame me for suggesting, as the now Minister for Lands suggested in 1968, that the only reason the present Minister is not prepared to accept a commission is that he is not interested in arranging constituencies in a fair manner but rather is he interested in arranging them or rigging them in a manner which he considers best calculated to give an advantage to the Fine Gael and to the Labour Parties.</P>
    <P>The present Government have two bites at the cherry.  Not only have the Fine Gael Party during the last six months tried to protect their interests but the Labour Party have been doing likewise.  When it was suggested in Dáil Éireann that certain constituencies in Dublin would now be in a position to return one Fianna Fáil, one Fine Gael and one Labour Deputy, the point was overlooked by supporters of the present Government that that would mean two Government Deputies and one Fianna Fáil Deputy.  The Labour Party know perfectly well that their only hope of participating in a Government of this country is by Coalition with Fine Gael.  To protect themselves against the possibility of the day that Fine Gael would decide to go it alone the present Minister for Local Government in arranging the Dublin constituencies so as to ensure that there will be sufficient Labour Deputies there to prevent Fine Gael from ever getting an overall majority.  Labour are concerned naturally that in the next election Fianna Fáil should not get an overall majority.  That is what politics are all about and nobody can criticise members of the Labour Party for those views.  But I submit that the Labour Party are equally concerned that Fine Gael should not get an overall majority either, because if by chance&mdash;and I admit it would be an <Col N="768" /> odd or very far out chance&mdash;Fine Gael did get an overall majority then the days of the tail wagging the dog would be at an end.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when the Minister for Local Government within weeks of the National Coalition resuming office set about the task of rearranging the constituencies he had two primary objects&mdash;one, to ensure that Fianna Fáil would not get an overall majority and, two, to ensure that his friends, his partners in Government, would not get an overall majority either.  He could best achieve these two objectives by arranging where possible for the election of extra Labour Deputies. During the debate in the Dáil supporters of the Government, both Fine Gael and Labour, were not ordered to keep quiet, as apparently Fine Gael and Labour Senators are in this House.</P>

      <P>In the rules there is a distinction between references to &ldquo;argument&rdquo; and references to &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo;.  I must, therefore rule that Senator McGlinchey is talking about proceedings in the Dáil, which is out of order according to the rules.  I was not in the Chamber when the Minister was speaking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that I am in order in observing that, judging by the silence of the Fine Gael and Labour Senators, instructions have been given to them to remain silent?  I consider it an insult to this House that on an important Bill such as this, which either directly or indirectly affects every man, woman and child, which affects every townland, <Col N="769" /> district electoral division, electoral area, constituency, county and province, the Government of the day should instruct their supporters in this House to remain silent and not to comment on this legislation.  On reading the speeches in the other House I noticed that there were supporters who did speak.  One by one, they glibly said that it was a pity that we must have this legislation, but the Constitution so ordained and the High Court decision of 1960-61 laid down that these changes should be made.</P>
      <P>Their friends in the media have given them full support in this regard. I wish to state clearly and categorically that I believe it is wrong and misleading to suggest that this legislation, framed in the manner in which it has been, is necessary because of the Constitution or the High Court ruling.  I agree that legislation of some kind is necessary because of the Constitution and the High Court, but it is wrong to give the impression that constituencies have to be changed in the manner in which they are changed, where streets are taken from certain areas and given to other areas, because the Constitution or the High Court ruling so lays down.  This is grossly misleading and the day is not too far distant when the Irish people will realise this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is agreement that there is a tolerance ratio of 1,000 people up or down on the national average.  I submit it was not necessary for the present Minister for Local Government and the Government to deprive the county of Clare, the province of Connacht and the county of Donegal of two seats.  Thirty seats could have been left in this area without breaching either the Constitution or the High Court ruling of 1961.  Two seats fewer could have been provided in the city of Dublin without breaching either the Constitution or the High Court ruling.  We have to consider the climate that existed when supporters of the present Government sat down to discuss these measures.  I remember a famous week in this House, when the two Houses discussed the Offences Against the State Bill.  A day or two <Col N="770" /> later I was speaking to a very prominent member of the Fine Gael Party. I said to him that I was surprised at his opposition to the Offences Against the State Bill.  What did he say to me?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we discussing the Bill?  Are we discussing the Offences Against the State Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>He said to me that he wanted the Fianna Fáil Government brought down that evening or that week, because he was afraid they would introduce a constituencies Bill which would take a very important part from his constituency. His main fear on that historic week was not the security of this nation but the fear of losing an important slice of his own constituency.  He was prepared to bring the Government down on an issue which I feel had his support.  There were other members of Fine Gael who did not support his view.  People who were prepared to put their own personal political advantage before the security of this nation could not be expected to advocate that legislation such as this should be fair and democratic to all.</P>
      <P>I remember shortly after the general election reading a speech in the <i>Sligo Champion</i>&mdash;a good Fine Gael paper&mdash; delivered by the Fine Gael Deputy for Donegal-Leitrim in Manorhamilton, County Leitrim.  He told his listeners that while it was desirable County Leitrim should be returned as a single political entity, it just was not on.  He said the people of Carrick-on-Shannon have more in common with the people of Roscommon, that the people of Manorhamilton have more in common with the people of Donegal and that he did not think there should be any electoral change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was not counting on the Minister for Local Government because when the first news of this Electoral Bill came out, the Donegal constituency did not end at Finner Camp where it is proposed it should end in this Bill. It ended between the towns of Ballintra and Ballyshannon.  Sligo-Leitrim, Bundoran and Ballyshannon were to become a five-seat constituency.  There <Col N="771" /> the crack starts, because in that proposed constituency there are four outgoing Fine Gael Deputies&mdash;Deputies Reynolds, McLaughlin, Gilhawley and White.  I could hear from Deputy White's supporters that this simply was not on&mdash;Deputy White was not going to stand for it.  He is an independent man with independent means.  He came to Dublin and told the National Coalition Government to go to the devil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Who told the Senator that?  It never happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that Senator O'Brien does not like to hear the truth when it is spoken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be delighted to hear the Senator.  Deputy White made his position very clear.  It could be said that when these people spoke to the Minister he told them he must try to get a Labour seat in Sligo-Leitrim. It is possible the Minister believed that if he fixed the constituency properly he could get a Labour seat in it.  I have no doubt that when he went back to whatever grassroots Labour have in Sligo he discovered that no matter what he did in that area a Labour seat was simply not on.  But what had it to do with Deputy White? They could not send him to Brussels. They already had sent Deputy Thornley to keep him quiet for fear he would topple the Government.  They could not appoint him Ceann Comhairle.  That had been already done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it in order for a Minister to rise on a point of order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we can take a point of order from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quote statements <Col N="772" /> by former Members of this House which suggest that points of order could not be raised by anyone other than a Member of this House. My authority is no less than the former Senator Garret FitzGerald, now Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I am not attacking the Ceann Comhairle, nor have I cast any reflection on the Ceann Comhairle.  I fully realise that it would be disorderly for me to do so.  I merely said that Deputy White could not be appointed Ceann Comhairle, that that post was already filled.  While the Minister may have thought that I was going into the reasons why that post was filled by the occupant, I fully realise that it would be disorderly for me to do so.</P>
      <P>They could not send Deputy White to Brussels.  Perhaps they could wait and give him one of the four new jobs, with State cars, that are being created to keep a few happy, but the Deputy would not wait.  There was only one thing to do and that was to change the original plan of the constituency and put the town of Ballyshannon back into the Donegal constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be an interesting exercise for any Member of this House who has any sense of justice and any sense of fair play to study the change that was made to keep Deputy White happy.  According to his own words in Dáil Éireann during this debate, his constituency ends a quarter of a mile from his home.  I am sure that during the coming summer many Members of this House who want a really good holiday will visit County Donegal.  I would ask them to take particular note when they cross the Sligo or Leitrim boundary into the county of Donegal.  They will find that in Bundoran they are in the Sligo-Leitrim constituency and if they drive for a mile past the military barracks at Finner Camp they will discover they are in the Donegal constituency. If they drive through the town of Ballyshannon, the home town of Deputy White, they are still in the Donegal constituency.  If they continue their drive towards Ballintra and if they inquire where they are, a few miles from Ballyshannon they will discover that on their left is the <Col N="773" /> Donegal constituency but the right hand side of the road leading to Cashelard, for some peculiar reason, is in Sligo-Leitrim.</P>
    <P>It would be the same as re-arranging the Houses of the Oireachtas so that we would find Seanad Members sitting on this side, Seanad Members sitting on the far side but the middle corridor a portion of Dáil Éireann.  If an official in this House was foolish enough to create such a situation I believe he would not be an official for very long.  The Sligo-Leitrim constituency enters Donegal in a lizard-like fashion and anyone who reads the map will agree that the whole purpose of this operation was to preserve the political future of a Fine Gael Deputy.</P>
    <P>It reminds me of an area in County Monaghan.  For years I drove through it and did not know that a village called Culloville, which stretches across into Monaghan, on the main Monaghan-Omagh road between Dundalk and Castleblayney, is, in fact, part of the Six Counties&mdash;a situation which has caused considerable trouble, particularly in recent years. That situation arose out of the neglect of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government in regard to the Boundary Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator has again gone away from the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was simply comparing a pocket in County Donegal in the Sligo-Leitrim constituency, between the town of Ballyshannon in the Donegal constituency, and the town of Ballintra in the Donegal constituency, with Culloville in County Armagh, which appears to be in County Monaghan and which should be.  Anyone who has any sense of fair play must admit that this constituency was rigged and gerrymandered for one purpose and one purpose only, that was the preservation of a Fine Gael Deputy in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about the crossing of county boundary lines but here again in this area for the <Col N="774" /> very first time we have people from Bundoran and Ballyshannon thrown headlong into the province of Connacht. This is strongly resented by the people of Bundoran and the surrounding districts.  It was Oliver Cromwell who a long time ago told people to go to hell or to Connacht. It would appear that this Government are repeating that famous quotation of Oliver Cromwell as far as the people of Bundoran and the surrounding districts are concerned.  In this legislation they are being told that they can go either to hell or to Sligo-Leitrim.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious from the first day this Government were elected that no attention has been given to the west.  We heard so much about the Government with the so-called talent but we wonder have the Deputies and Senators in Fine Gael and Labour from the west&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We gained two seats there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;no talent at all.  It would appear that they have not.  This is the very area, despite Senator O'Brien's reminder that the Coalition gained two seats, responsible for electing the present Government. I am sure Senator O'Brien would agree with me that this area from Clare through Connacht to Donegal gave this Government two extra seats and ensured their election. How did the Government repay this area for this tremendous work?  The Taoiseach appointed one Parliamentary Secretary from the entire west. It seems to me that the Taoiseach and his Government believe that all the so-called talent that exists in Fine Gael and Labour Deputies only applies to those from Dublin city and surrounding districts.  Senator O'Brien has reminded us that they gained two seats in the west.  When he says &ldquo;we&rdquo; I do not know whether he means the Coaltion, Fine Gael or Labour.  We have to face the fact that Fianna Fáil lost two seats in the western area. One would imagine that the Government would display their gratitude to this area for this tremendous achievement of giving them the opportunity <Col N="775" /> of governing after 16 years.  They propose to repay this area by taking two seats from it, by reducing it from 30 seats to 28.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I expected Senator O'Toole to say.  The Senator said the population dropped. Senator O'Toole is a Mayoman and he is giving facts.  He would like to give the people of the west from Clare to Donegal the impression that it would be contrary to the constitution and to the High Court's ruling to leave 30 seats in Connacht, Clare and Donegal.  I should like to submit that Senator O'Toole has been completely misled in this assertion.  I believe I can prove that this area could be left with 30 seats without any breach of the Constitution or of any breach of the ruling of the High Court in 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time there was tremendous criticism of the rural bias.  It was suggested it was unconstitutional to give a bias to rural Ireland.  The Dubliner's vote was only worth threequarters of the rural vote.  There were many who believed that bias should be given to the rural areas because of the long distances that the public are forced to travel to meet their Deputies or the long distances that Deputies must travel in the interests of their constituents. It was pointed out then, as it is now, that a Deputy could walk through his constituency in this city in a very short time.  The people of Dublin have easy access to their Deputies, in their homes, in their businesses and particularly in Leinster House.  We all know that when the Dáil is in session the people of Dublin avail of that privilege in coming to Leinster House day after day, evening after evening to meet their Deputies. <Col N="776" /> Anyone with any sense of justice, with any sense of fair play, must surely admit that the situation is very different in rural Ireland.  This point was made very clear on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill in 1959 in Dáil Éireann when in Volume 177, column 402, the late Deputy Michael Donnellan said:</P>
    <P>There are more representatives for Dublin city than for the whole Province of Connacht.  Is that fair? I do not think it is.  It may be argued in the fashion in which Deputy O'Higgins argued it, but I hold that mathematics are only one aspect of the matter.  How many people now residing in Dublin City had to leave the province of Connacht because they had to do so?  These people are a loss to Connacht and to the Irish nation because if they could have remained in Connacht they would have produced raw materials, what I would call &ldquo;new money,&rdquo; for this country. ...I must congratulate the Minister on the Bill.  I am voting for it just as it stands, word for word.</P>
    <P>Somewhere in his speech on that occasion Deputy Donnellan named the number of Deputies in Dublin. Deputy Donnellan, before his untimely death, was of course a strong supporter of two Coalition Governments and his son followed his footsteps and is a supporter of the present Government.  Deputy Donnellan was in a position then to be independent in that he was not attached to one of the major parties.  I am quite sure that his son shares the views of his highly respected father but he is not in a position to express his views.  I wonder what would his father say today when he would discover that County Clare, the province of Connacht and County Donegal between them will be able to elect only 28 Deputies in the future and that the city of Dublin, Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown between them will send 43 Deputies to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>No matter which Government are in office, those of us living in the west and north-west want to see that area prosper if at all possible, and every voice irrespective of political views, is <Col N="777" /> a voice that in one way or another can help this area.  I would not mind if it was necessary to deprive this area of two Deputies, but it is not and it is false and misleading propaganda to suggest that it is.  I believe I can prove that, if the Minister had applied to the west the same population ratio per Member as he did to the city of Dublin and other places, two seats could have been retained in the west.</P>
    <P>In the table in the explanatory memorandum we find some very interesting information.  We find, for example, that in the proposed new constituency of Donegal there will be a population of 21,102 per Member but in Dublin South-East we find that there will be a population of 19,292 people per Member.  This suggests to me that the Government believe that it takes 21,102 Donegal people to be as good as 19,292 Dublin people.  I think that it is an insult not alone to our democratic institutions but to the people of Donegal that the constituencies could be arranged in such a way that in Dublin South-East 19,000 people can elect a Deputy but in Donegal it takes over 21,000, a difference of 1,810 people per Deputy which, in effect, means that in the new Donegal constituency 9,050 people have been disenfranchised.</P>
    <P>The Minister of course used the tolerance ratio as permitted by the High Court in favour of the people of Dublin South-East in the hope that the National Coalition Government will have two Deputies elected and that Fianna Fáil will have one.  There is no point in the Labour Party saying that there will be a fair division of one for each party.  There are two parties in this country, Fianna Fáil and the National Coalition Government, and constituencies such as Dublin South-East have been designed so as to ensure a two-to-one representation in favour of the National Coalition.  The Minister could have used the 1,000 deviation in the national average in favour of the west if this Government had any interest in the west and so maintained the two Deputies in this area.</P>
    <P>The national average is 20,123.  The Minister is permitted by the Constitution <Col N="778" /> and by the High Court ruling of 1961 to have 19,123 people elect a Deputy.  If he had done that in County Clare all he needed was a population of 57,369 instead of 62,731.  He has a surplus in County Clare of 5,362 people who are not getting the same treatment as the people in Dublin South-East, Dublin South-Central, Dublin North-Central, Dublin (Clontarf) and Dublin (Cabra).  Indeed if we look at County Louth, where it takes 19,149 people to elect a Deputy, I believe I am entitled to ask this House why, in County Louth, can 19,149 people be allowed to elect a Deputy whereas in County Donegal 21,102 people are required to elect a Deputy.  In Roscommon-Leitrim 21,119 people elect a Deputy and in Sligo-Leitrim 21,010 elect a Deputy. The people of Donegal, of Roscommon-Leitrim and of Sligo-Leitrim have every right to question this undemocratic legislation when in their areas it takes almost 2,000 more to elect a Deputy than in most of the Dublin constituencies and in the Louth constituencies.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is a reason in Louth, an obvious reason, why this Government will emphatically deny that they even considered their political fortunes in designing these constituencies.  Louth was a three-seat constituency, Fianna Fáil hold two seats and Fine Gael one.  It has now become a four-seat constituency, and no matter how the political fortunes of Fianna Fáil improve in this area no one would claim that Fianna Fáil could take three out of four seats.  It is obvious therefore that in County Louth the Minister is hoping that by adding an extra seat to this area he can get a Labour Deputy elected.  In doing so he is allowing 19,149 people to elect a Deputy, whereas in the three constituencies in the north-west it takes 21,000 people.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, if the Minister had used the national deviation as permitted by the Constitution and the High Court ruling in favour of the west as he did in Louth, Dublin and other areas, we would have had a surplus of 5,362 people in Clare, 6,684 in East Galway, 1,832 in West Galway, 2,941 in West Mayo, 447 in <Col N="779" /> East Mayo, 9,894 in Donegal, 5,661 in Sligo-Leitrim and 5,989 in Roscommon-Leitrim, a grand total of 38,810 people in the area from Clare to Donegal.  The surplus in that area, 38,810 people, would have been enough to retain the two Deputies and ensure that 30 Members could be elected from Clare to Donegal.</P>
    <P>The Minister had the same right, indeed he had a greater right, to give preference to the west.  It could be argued that our Constitution lays down that there should be an even distribution of seats per people throughout the country, but under this legislation an even division is not taking place.  I accept that this is within the framework of the Constitution and the High Court ruling, but I have proved by the figures I have given that 30 seats could have been retained in this area.  County Clare has a population of 62,731 for a three-seat constituency.  It requires only 57,369 people to elect a Deputy in a three-seat constituency.  That means that in County Clare there is a surplus of 5,362.  If we go through all the constituencies, using the figures of 76,492 for four-seat constituencies and 95,615 for five-seat constituencies, it is pure and simple mathematics to discover that in this region from Clare to Donegal 38,810 people have for all intents and purposes been disenfranchised. If those 38,810 people were living in the city of Dublin they would be allowed by the present Minister and by the present Government to elect two Deputies.  Because they are living in the west and north-west the Government are depriving them of their proper representation.</P>
    <P>It is completely misleading and politically dishonest for anyone to suggest that two seats have been taken from Clare to Donegal because the Constitution and the High Court ruling so ordained.  This is not true. The Government could have left 30 seats in this area had they so wished. Senator O'Brien told us during one of his interruptions that the Government won two seats in this area in the last election.  I accept that.  I accept that the west is responsible for the election <Col N="780" /> of the present Government, but the present Government do not trust this area.  What was won in 1973 could be lost on the next occasion.  That is why they are taking steps to ensure that this will not happen.  They are taking steps to ensure that never again will the west from County Clare to County Donegal, have their proper voice in the administration of this country.</P>
    <P>If we study the figures for three counties&mdash;Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim &mdash;we will find that it was not necessary to deprive this area of the one seat which was taken from them.  We will also find that that area could have been left intact without breaching the Constitution or the High Court order. In the new constituency of County Donegal, we have a population of 105,509 people, but if the Minister were to apply the same population ratio per Member in Donegal as he did in Louth or in Dublin, it would take only 95,615 people to elect five Deputies in this area.  That means that 9,894 people&mdash;or half a Deputy&mdash;have been disenfranchised.</P>
    <P>In the Sligo-Leitrim constituency we find a surplus of 5,661 people.  It would take 5,661 fewer people to elect three Deputies in this constituency.  In Roscommon-Leitrim we find that it would take 5,989 fewer people to elect a Deputy.  If we add these three figures together&mdash;9,000 and the two 5,000s&mdash;we find that there is a surplus of about 21,000 in this area.  This in effect means that Roscommon need not have been taken into consideration but that in the Counties Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal there is a surplus of over 19,000 people, which is sufficient according to the Constitution to maintain the Deputy that has been taken from them.</P>
    <P>This crying about the Constitution and the High Court to justify foul gerrymandering in the west should cease.  They should be honest about it. They should at least tell the truth and admit that this operation is to deprive the Fianna Fáil Party of two Deputies to which they are entitled.  We have heard over the years the moaning and the groaning about County Leitrim, particularly by supporters of the present Government.  Those supporters had <Col N="781" /> a golden opportunity when this legislation was being prepared to protect the interests of County Leitrim. Obviously for political expediency and in order to ensure perpetuation and power for their own political parties they threw the interests of Counties Leitrim, Sligo and Donegal to the wolves.</P>
    <P>Now we find that, as a result of this, in County Donegal we will have a constituency that extends 125 to 130 miles in length.  A person could leave this city of Dublin and travel through the Six Counties and would have reached the County Donegal border before he would have travelled that distance.  It is the same length through County Donegal as it is from this city to the city of Limerick.  I wonder what the Irish people would say if any Government were to produce a plan to divide constituencies in such a way that even though a Deputy is elected in the city of Dublin his constituency would extend to the city of Limerick.  I believe that there would be public outcry and that no Government would get away with this.  Yet in this legislation the Minister proposes to have a five-seat constituency in the fourth largest county in this country&mdash;a constituency that extends from Malin Head to Glencolumbkille and from Bunbeg to Ballyshannon, a constituency that because of its size will make it very difficult for the electorate to get the representation to which they are justly entitled.  This constituency has been so devised because the Minister and his Government know that in the present two constituencies of County Donegal Fine Gael have two seats out of six.  Under the new arrangement Fine Gael could have two seats out of five.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that Fine Gael have a reasonable good chance of electing two Deputies out of five, thus depriving the county of Donegal and a portion of Leitrim of one representative. I might say that it is immaterial to me who that representative might be.  Every voice that comes from Donegal is a voice.  By reducing this number to five, there is one voice fewer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" /> I believe that the Minister could have left these two constituencies. While I understand that in the constituency in which I live myself, North East Donegal, the population has increased, and that it might have required minor adjustments, it is wholly wrong to create one single unit in a county such as ours.  I was somewhat surprised to discover, when this legislation was discussed in the Dáil, that certain people who participated in the debate were not armed with the facts.  The Minister disagreed with Deputy Molloy on the population figures for Dublin city.  As reported at column 2014, Volume 268 of the Official Report he said:</P>
    <P>To help Deputy Molloy may I say the average in the west is 20,509 and in the Dublin area it is 20,840...</P>
    <P>Later on the Minister was sporting enough and honest enough to point out that the figures he had given were wrong and that, in fact, the figures given by Deputy Molloy were correct. At column 2092 of the same volume he said:</P>
    <P>I stated in good faith from information I got that the average population for Deputies in Dublin was 20,840.  I should like to correct that: I am now informed that the correct figure is 20,142.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Minister was honest enough and sporting enough to correct a mistake he had made.  The point I wish to make on this is that it would appear to me that the Minister and his advisers when framing this Bill were of the opinion that the average population for Deputies in Dublin was 20,840 and that he framed his Bill accordingly.  It is in fact 20,142, or 700 less.  It would appear to me that it was the Minister's intention to increase the tolerance ratio in Dublin to as near 21,000 as possible, as laid down by the Constitution, and that his intention was to have an average population of 20,840.  He discovered that there was a mathematical error and that, in fact, the average population was 700 less per Member. When one considers that 43 Deputies are to be elected in the Dublin city area, then an error of 700 people per <Col N="783" /> Member is a very serious error and amounts to 30,000 people, odd.</P>
    <P>I have the impression that the Minister did not intend a tolerance ratio in Dublin city of the kind he has in the Bill and that he intended it to be as near the maximum as is humanly possible.  When he discovered his mistake of 30,000 for 43 Members he would be justified in saying that the Dublin city area could do with two Deputies less, because these are the two Deputies who are being snatched from the west of Ireland, two Deputies Dublin could well do without and who are very useful and very important in the western part of this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister was not the only person who spoke on this Bill and made mistakes.  We find in column 2024 of the same volume that a former Member of this House, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, spoke about the County Donegal constituency. He said:</P>
    <P>It was a five-seat constituency at one stage and even a seven- or eight-seat constituency far back.  I do not think it was divided into two ... until Mr. Boland divided it and before that the previous Fianna Fáil revisionists had been happy to leave it in that condition.  I do not know why.  Perhaps it suited them.</P>

      <P>I have given it: column 2024, Volume 268.  While I must admit that the Parliamentary Secretary stated that he was speaking subject to correction, nevertheless I think it strange that a man holding a position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach should attempt to mislead the Dáil in the manner in which it would appear to me he did.  Donegal was first made a single-seat constituency when the original electoral boundaries were drawn up in 1925 and, at the first opportunity that the Government of the day had in 1937, Donegal became two constituencies.  To suggest, as did the Parliamentary Secretary, that this change was made by Mr. <Col N="784" /> Boland is wrong and misleading.  Once again it demonstrates clearly to me the lack of knowledge that senior and junior members of the Government have as far as rural Ireland is concerned.</P>
      <P>It is bad enough for a Dublin-elected Deputy to make a mistake about a Donegal constituency.  It is worse when we find a Donegal Deputy making an even more serious mistake. We find at column 626, Volume 269 of the Dáil Debates that Deputy White had this to say:</P>
      <P>It is wrong for the Opposition to say that Donegal is too vast a constituency for five Members to look after.  This is not the first time in the history of the State that Donegal has been a single constituency. It was a single constituency many years ago.  The difference then was that the Unionists were able to elect one of their own.  When Fianna Fáil divided the constituency they divided it in half so that the Unionists would not be able to elect a Member of their own.  That day is gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that Deputy White, a native of Ballyshannon, did not fully equip himself with the proper information before making such a serious charge against any Government in this country.  Deputy White must have known that when Donegal was a single constituency the then traditionally Unionist vote in the county was able to elect a Major Myles from Ballyshannon from Deputy White's own town.  They were able to elect him to Dáil Éireann.  In 1939 the Fianna Fáil Government divided Donegal into two constituencies.  It is true to say that, in a subsequent election in 1943, Major Myles who was elected on a traditional Unionist vote&mdash;lost his seat.  But that seat was not taken from him by either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.  That seat was taken from him by a man who also received the traditional Unionist vote as that time, former Deputy and Senator W. A. W. Sheldon.  I think that the allegation made that the County of Donegal was so divided to deprive the Unionists of a seat is a very serious one and, as Deputy White comes from the same town as Major <Col N="785" /> Myles, he should and must have known that the information he was giving is incorrect.</P>
    <P>In that part of the province of Ulster in the Republic of Ireland we find that it is proposed in this Bill to take two seats from us.  The counties of Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal have suffered disastrously, economically and politically, as a result of Partition.  At the moment we have 12 Deputies elected from the counties of Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan.  In this legislation the Minister proposes to reduce this number to ten.  It is interesting to note that while Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan will be allowed only ten Members to Dáil Éireann in future across the Border in the other part of the province of Ulster, 78 people are elected to the Assembly in Belfast.  I have no doubt that many of those Assembly men, irrespective of their political viewpoints, will take particular note of what this Government are doing.  They will think, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs suggested when he was in Opposition, that the type of gerrymandering which is clearly demonstrated in this legislation could be used against those self-same Northerners in a united Ireland as it was used for so long in the Six Counties to deprive the minority there of their just representation. It will be very hard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The <i>Sunday Independent</i>, 12th November, 1972. It will be very hard to convince the supporters of Mr. Paisley, Mr. Craig and the rest that, if ever they agreed to a united Ireland, this Government would not be prepared to gerrymander Derry, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Antrim, Down and Armagh in the same way as they are gerrymandering the other three counties of Ulster&mdash; Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that there should be some compensation for those three Ulster counties which for the last 50-odd years had to suffer the inconvenience of Partition and whose people have tried, in one way or another, to persuade the people of the Six Counties <Col N="786" /> that it is in the interests of everyone in this country that Ireland should be united.  It will be very difficult in future to explain why this Government deprived the county of Donegal of an elected member and why they deprived the counties of Cavan and Monaghan of another member, as a result of this legislation.  The Northern Protestant is a man noted for his shrewedness, and this Bill would not have been published three hours until the Paisleys and the Craigs were laughing up their sleeves.  Twelve Ulster men were elected to Dáil Éireann in the past and now this Government propose to reduce that number to ten, despite the fact that those 12 Members could have been elected without interfering with the Constitution and without interfering with High Court ruling of 1961.</P>
    <P>Once again we have to consider the serious effects of gerrymandering in the city of Derry and on this side we must warn the Government that there is a grave danger that the pattern set by the Unionist-controlled Corporation of Derry city could be set here. In Derry City Corporation&mdash;a city with a 70 per cent Nationalist vote and a 30 per cent Unionist vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was merely leading up to making a point.  My point is that a Unionist mayor was elected in Derry for 15 years. That Unionist-controlled corporation ensured that not even the cleaner could be a Nationalist.  They perfected the jobs for the boys.  Their supporters demanded, and insisted, that the price of their support was the continuation of jobs for the boys.  That began as a result of gerrymandering and the Minister and his Government should take due note.  When it comes <Col N="787" /> to jobs for the boys the present Government are masters.  One has only to study the record in this field in the last 12 months to realise how masterful they are in this art.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind the Minister that as a result of the gerrymandering of that county his supporters, and the supporters of Fine Gael in the future, will insist that the price of their support will be even a further accleration of jobs for the boys.  It will not be enough to give jobs to Ministers' cousins, uncles, sons-in-law <i>et cetera</i> as has happened in the last 12 months.  They will have to give the jobs to their supporters down the country in greater numbers than they have done already.  They simply will not settle for 423 peace commissioners.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party Newsletter in January this year suggested to its readers that applicants for peace commissioners should apply to their local Deputy or Senator or direct to head office.  They did not do very badly as a result.  The Minister for Justice played ball.  It could happen as a result of gerrymandering of the constituencies, as a possible result of the retention in power of an undemocratic Government that the supporters throughout the nation would acclerate this.  We could find at a future date that notices would appear in the Labour Party Newsletter suggesting that applicants for district justices should apply to their local Deputy, Senator or direct to head office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time will come when many honest and decent members of the Labour Party and Fine Gael Party will regret the passing of this legislation because they will come to the conclusion that what the Minister and his colleague in Government advocated in Opposition should have been put into practice here.  No one who has studied the figures given in this explanatory memorandum can deny that these figures have been used to the best advantage as far as the fortunes of the present Government are concerned.  While it may be within <Col N="788" /> the framework of the Constitution, and while it may be acceptable as far as the High Court ruling is concerned, it is grossly unfair and grossly unjust that in one part of this country 19,000 people can elect a Deputy while in another part it takes more than 21,000 people.</P>
    <P>I believe in Dublin city the Minister should have&mdash;because of the compact constituencies&mdash;allowed the maximum ratio of population per member.  There should have been no constituency in this city with fewer than 21,000 people per Member.  In rural Ireland, if we care about it, the situation could have been reversed without any breach of the Constitution. It is hard to understand because the area in which I live was given the highest ratio of population per Member.  The highest one is Roscommon-Leitrim with 21,119, next is Donegal with 21,102, and Sligo-Leitrim has 21,010.  There are only four constituencies that exceed the 21,000 Member per population ratio, and those of them are Donegal, Sligo-Leitrim and Roscommon-Leitrim.  I want to know why it is that in Dublin North-Central it takes only 19,452 people to elect a Deputy, whereas in Donegal, in Sligo-Leitrim and in Roscommon-Leitrim it takes over 21,000. Is the Minister suggesting that 21,000 Donegal men, Sligo men or Leitrim men are as good as 19,452 Dublin men?  If the Minister is of that opinion he is under a serious misapprehension.</P>
    <P>It is obvious, studying these figures in the Dublin constituencies, that every effort has been made to give the Labour Party every opportunity of gaining seven or eight seats.  The fact that the Dublin city area has been changed from four to three-seaters with the exception of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown justifies this contention.  At the moment in most of the Dublin constituencies in the four-seaters we have two Fianna Fáil and two Government supporters. That is a reasonably fair divide when one considers the voting trends but now the Government propose making these constituencies three-seaters in <Col N="789" /> the hope that in the future the Government will take two seats and Fianna Fáil will take one.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Members of this House who have any sense of justice if they believe that the present Government or any government are entitled to a two to one representation for this city in Dáil Éireann.  It would be very hard to explain to our friends across the Border that this situation is justified in this city.  It would be very hard to tell them that this Government were entitled to arrange the constituencies in such a manner that they would have a two to one majority because they have not a two to one majority in the voting figures of this city.</P>
    <P>Let us leave Dublin for a moment and go to the County Limerick.  We know that when this Bill was first framed the situation in Limerick was very different from what it is now. Limerick city was a four-seat constituency electing two Fianna Fáil Deputies, one Fine Gael Deputy and one Labour Deputy and the West Limerick constituency was a three-seater.  Senator O'Brien, who has interrupted quite a number of times in the last two days and who, I hope, will speak on this Bill, must feel in his heart that he is deeply opposed to the legislation as it is now presented.  He was certainly very much in favour of the original intentions and even the dog in the streets of Limerick knows what those intentions were.</P>
    <P>Limerick city was to become a three-seater and West Limerick was to become a four-seater.  The reason for this was that the Government knew that the chances of Fianna Fáil taking two out of three in the East Limerick constituency would have been very difficult.  If the Government reduced that constituency from a four-seater to a three-seater it was a fair bet that Fianna Fáil would have lost the seat.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Brien during the last two elections has attempted to unseat one of the most decent and honourable men in Dáil Éireann, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I have often heard Senator O'Brien's campaign described.  Politics are tough where I come from but when it comes to the attempts of Senator O'Brien to unseat that decent man, Deputy Jones, we are only in the halfpenny place so far as ruthlessness is concerned.</P>

I was the only Member of the Oireachtas that crossed the Gweebarra Bridge with Dr. Delap on the night of his triumphant election.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with West Limerick.  Last summer, that long hot summer the Minister for Local Government promised Dáil Éireann, was devoted to the wranglings of the supporters of the present <Col N="792" /> Government because of failure to reach agreement.</P>
      <P>One of the places where they failed to get agreement was in County Limerick. It would have worked out very well for the fortunes of the Coalition Government if the Minister's original intention had been allowed.  The original intention was to make the city of Limerick a three-seater in the hope of getting rid of one Fianna Fáil Deputy and to make the county of Limerick a four-seater.  The Government knew that Fianna Fáil have two of the three seats in West Limerick but they could not possibly hope to have three of the four seats in that same situation.  For that reason they were confident of electing a second person in West Limerick and quite obviously a constituency such as West Limerick would not elect a Labour Deputy.  The Minister realised that it would be a Fine Gael Deputy and that the ratio in West Limerick would be two Fianna Fáil Deputies and two Fine Gael Deputies.  I am sure Senator O'Brien clapped his hands with joy when he heard of these proposals because it meant that he would at last succeed in achieving his political ambition of entering Dáil Éireann.  If he appeared to be unseating a decent and respected Member of Dáil Éireann in the process, he was prepared to settle for the next best thing which is a seat made for him.  Then came the crunch.</P>

      <P>Before lunch I was dealing with the situation in County Limerick.  I am sorry that Senator O'Brien has not come back to the House because I hate speaking about people behind their backs particularly if it is possible for them to be here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the luncheon adjournment Senator O'Brien heard me say that I would deal with the dessert after lunch.  I was showing how I believe Senator O'Brien attempted to arrange the constituencies in County Limerick in a manner which would help him to achieve his life-long ambition of being <Col N="793" /> elected to Dáil Éireann.  Having failed on two occasions to stab one of the most respected Fine Gael Deputies in Dáil Éireann in the back and having realised that that stabbing could not work he decided that he would stab yet another Limerick Deputy in the back, a Deputy who is undoubtedly one of the most popular in this country, a Deputy who is considered in his native city of Limerick to be one of the most hard-working public representatives this country has ever produced.  I know Limerick well.  I have a brother living in Limerick city and I know from my contacts in that city that the opinion I have of that Deputy is shared by the people in Limerick city and in the East Limerick constituency.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien did not take into consideration the dynamic persuasive personality of the Labour Deputy, Stevie Coughlan.  When it became apparent that a Fine Gael Senator in West Limerick, in order to achieve his own political ambition, had persuaded the Fine Gael Party to use their influence with the Government to bring this situation about, the thought crossed the minds of many members of the Labour Party, who had attempted on numerous occasions down the years&mdash;without success&mdash;to get rid of Deputy Coughlan, that here possibly was an opportunity to do so. Deputy Coughlan, because of his work in East Limerick, had strong support in the rural area but now because of the conniving of Senator O'Brien and some of the Labour Party radicals it was decided to take from the East Limerick constituency Deputy Coughlan's stronghold and put it into West Limerick in order to elect Senator O'Brien to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Then the crunch came.  Deputy Coughlan was not having any of it. Deputy Coughlan put down his foot and he let the Minister, the Government and Senator O'Brien know that he was still a strong influence in the Labour movement and in the political life of Limerick, that he would have neither lip service nor Lipper and that if the radicals of the Labour Party thought they would grab this opportunity of replacing Deputy <Col N="794" /> Coughlan by Alderman Lipper then Deputy Coughlan made his presence felt to such an extent that the Minister realised he dare not introduce the legislation as it was at first intended.</P>

      <P>Nobody in this House can convince me that Senator O'Brien agrees with the legislation as it is now before the House.  Senator O'Brien and his Fine Gael friends are partly responsible for the holding up of this legislation last summer.  The long hot summer that was promised by the Minister for Local Government to the Deputies in Dáil Éireann debating this legislation was spent instead trying to pacify Senator O'Brien and the other people who had strong views.  It is understandable that Senator O'Brien should be deeply disappointed with the legislation as it is now before us.  I have no doubt that Deputy Coughlan will continue to represent his native city of Limerick in the same manner in which he has done so in the past despite the wishful thinking of some of the &ldquo;Johnnycome-latelys&rdquo; in the Labour Party or indeed despite the wishful thinking of the Senator from West Limerick.</P>

They had to find two other seats. They cast their eyes across the Shannon from Clare to Donegal and have deprived the people of that area of two important voices in Dáil Éireann.</P>

If the Minister had used the population ratio, the tolerance ratio, in the west in the same manner in which he used it in the city of Dublin and in County Louth&mdash;I gave facts and figures this morning to justify my argument&mdash;30 seats could have been retained in this area in accordance with the Constitution of our land or the High Court ruling.  There is nothing to stop the Minister using a population ratio from Clare to Donegal of 19,123 people per Member.  It would be no breach of the Constitution or of the <Col N="796" /> High Court ruling to use that figure; and if Senator O'Toole would write down the figures that I will give, even he would have to admit that the statement that he has made in this House this afternoon is misleading.</P>

While I know that the Minister is an expert at revising, I can only deal with the figures that he has now given us.  The facts are that the Minister could have used a population figure in the west of Ireland of 19,123, just as he did in County Louth where he used a figure of 19,149 people per member, just as he did in Cabra, Dublin, where he allowed 19,771 people per member, just as he did in Finglas, Dublin, where he allowed 19,531 people per member, just as he did in Dublin North Central where he allowed 19,452 people per member.  Would Senator O'Toole explain to this House why the Minister should insist that in my county of Donegal it will take 21,102 people per member and why in his own neighbouring <Col N="797" /> county of Roscommon it will take 21,119 people?</P>

I reject the sugestion that 19,000 Dublin men are as good as 20,000 Mayo men, but if Senator O'Toole votes for this legislation he is telling <Col N="798" /> the people of Mayo that they are inferior to the people of Dublin and to the people of Louth.

      <P>I respect your wishes, Sir.  I do not intend repeating my figures constituency by constituency. The point I am making is that there is a surplus of people from Clare to Donegal of 38,810, sufficient to elect two extra Deputies to Dáil Éireann in accordance with the Constitution and the High Court ruling.  No amount of misleading statements from Senator O'Toole or anybody else will satisfy me because deep down in his heart Senator O'Toole knows that the 30 Members can be retained in the west.</P>
      <P>I have come back to the west via Limerick.  I only mention the west again to show that when the Government discovered that Deputy Coughlan was putting his foot down&mdash; Deputy Coughlan thumped the desk and said: &ldquo;You are not screwing me, you can screw somebody else&rdquo;&mdash;the Government instead screwed the people of the west, aided and abetted by the Deputies and Senators from that province who are their supporters.</P>

    <P>I realise that it may be necessary for some of these supporters to attempt in some way or other to justify their action.  The only way that they can do this is to give misleading information.  Let us leave Limerick and travel along to the Minister's own county of Meath.  Here we find that a three-seater in the past is now becoming a four-seat constituency.  I accept that when in Opposition the Minister was a hard-working Deputy but the electorate tend to overlook that.  I suspect that when the Minister <Col N="800" /> came to his own native county he quite naturally said to himself that this exercise of electoral boundary changes was an exercise of self-preservation for his colleagues in the Fine Gael and Labour parties and that nobody in those parties could criticise him if he took the necessary steps to ensure his own preservation. Quite frankly, one cannot fault him for that&mdash;whether under the present system the final decision is taken or presented by the Minister to the Cabinet&mdash;that he should look after himself.</P>

      <P>We in this part of the country continue to allow one man, aided and abetted by a group of men in the Labour branches of this city and elsewhere, and by Fine Gael supporters throughout this land, to arrange the constituencies.  The fact that it took six months for this legislation to see the light of day and that it was not until the month of November, 1973, that this legislation was introduced demonstrate clearly to me the manner in which the midnight oil was burnt in every constituency, town and village of this country.  The light was put out on some occasions by men like Deputies Coughlan and White who would not have it.  I am sure many others whose names we have not got also rejected it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" /> Let us leave the Minister's county of Meath and travel to the city of Cork.  The exercise in Cork is a very interesting one.  Cork city, which has up to now consisted of two three-seat constituencies now becomes a five-seater and a large portion of the city of Cork has been thrown into the Mid-Cork constituency.  I know the city of Cork reasonably well.  I remember participating in the Mid-Cork by-election of 1965.  I was somewhat surprised to discover that a large suburban area in the Blackrock district was included in part of the Mid-Cork constituency.  That situation was changed and the city of Cork was given the representation that it deserved&mdash;namely, six Deputies.  The Minister for Local Government now proposes to deprive the second largest city in this country of one important voice in Dáil Éireann.  I should like to know if the Lord Mayor of Cork, who is a Member of this House, believes that his native city of Cork is entitled to one representative less, or is there a possibility that the reason Cork city is being made a five-seat constituency is in the hope that the same Lord Mayor, Senator Kerrigan, would be elected to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I would be surprised if the Lord Mayor of Cork would put his own personal, petty advantage before the interests of the people of Cork city. Cork city is entitled to six Members and it deserves six Members.  But Cork was discussed in this House on a Bill similar to this in the past and I should like to quote from column 485, Volumn 54 of the Seanad Official Report for 25th May, 1961.  He said:</P>
    <P>Consider for a moment the position in the county and city of Cork.  At the moment we have 12 rural Deputies and five city Deputies.  We have four rural constituencies of three seats each. These are ideal constituencies, easily accessible.  What will we have under this measure?  We will have one constituency with five members, one with four, and one with three.</P>
    <P>Those were the views of a Cork Senator.  He was then known as Senator John L. O'Sullivan.  He is now Deputy John L. O'Sullivan, and he voted a short time ago on this <Col N="807" /> measure in Dáil Éireann.  What did he vote for?  He voted for five Deputies in Cork city; he voted for five Deputies in Mid-Cork; he voted for four in North-East Cork, and he voted for three in South-West Cork, despite the fact that in this House, when he was in Opposition, on 25th May, 1961, he said: &ldquo;We have four rural constituencies of three seats each.  These are ideal constituencies, easily accessible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan, a well-known Corkman, believed when in Opposition that having three-seat constituencies was the ideal situation in Cork. A few weeks ago he voted for two five-seat, one four-seat and one three-seat constituencies in Cork&mdash;a complete turn around, a complete reversal, of what he did in the past.  It is quite obvious that this exercise is designed purely to give the Government parties stronger representation in the House.  It is another example of the gerrymandering which we have been used to in this legislation.  This legislation will have to be examined line by line and sentence by sentence, and every possible conceivable consideration will have to be given to it when we reach Committee Stage.</P>

During that period on no occasion did the Government party refuse a request by the Opposition to adjourn <Col N="808" /> the next Stage of a Bill until the following week.

It is not enough to sit over there like mummies.  It will be very serious if an attempt is made to deny the right of Members of the Opposition to table amendments to this Bill.

      <P>I believe that this legislation is so important to this nation that every available Member of this House should be allowed to make a contribution on the Second Stage of this Bill.  I hope the Government will not attempt to introduce the guillotine in this House on the Second Stage of this Bill.  I should like the Leader of the House, Senator M. J. O'Higgins, to indicate the views in this respect.  Nobody likes the guillotine. It is an undemocratic procedure. I should like to quote what was said about it in column 388-389 of Volume 177 of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann on 28th October, 1959.  It is a very short quotation.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister at this stage to ensure that there is sufficient time allocated for the Committee discussion on the Bill; that every Deputy will get an opportunity of having his say and that we shall not be discussing the Committee Stage of the Bill with the fear of the Government guillotine hanging over our heads.</P>
      <P>I should like the Leader of this House to indicate his views on this subject because I overlooked saying that the Deputy I was quoting was none other than Deputy Michael J. O'Higgins.  I am sure the views that Senator O'Higgins expressed in Dáil Éireann in 1959 are held by him still.  I am sure that in no way would Senator O'Higgins co-operate with an attempt to introduce the guillotine into this debate.</P>

In view of what has happened, it is a legitimate fear.  We are entitled to call upon the Government, in the interests of justice, not to do the same thing here.</P>

      <P>I come now to the map of the new constituencies, the map produced by the Department of Local Government and issued in connection with this Bill.  It gives us the framework of the constituencies throughout the country and anyone who cares to study it will realise what I meant when I described the constituency of Donegal and the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.  As an Ulsterman and as an Irishman I first want to lodge, in the strongest possible terms, a protest at the misnaming by the present Government of the city of Doire Colmcille in the County of Derry by describing it as Londonderry.  Supporters of the Government may want to refer to Derry as Londonderry, but I want to assure this Government that the people of Derry city have always considered this misnaming an insult to them and to their city.  Here we have a map sent out by the Government once again insulting the people of one of the greatest counties in this land.  From my earliest childhood I considered it obnoxious to misname this city in this way.  The 70 per cent Nationalist population of Derry and, indeed, many more people consider it an insult to them, apart from those in the county of Derry, and I can only conclude that the architect of this map was the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who would have Westminster here in Dublin if he could get away with it.  It is time the supporters of this Government <Col N="813" /> realised that to many of us Derry is Doire Colmcille, an Irish city in an Irish county in an Irish province.  To those in the Government who would like to insist that it now be described as part of the United Kingdom I want to say that nobody in this land will ever persuade me to describe that city, located 20 miles from my home, as anything but an Irish city in an Irish province and I trust this is the last time that the shoneens responsible for this in the present Government will be allowed to get away with it.  Derry is Derry and let London stay where it is.</P>

They know the purpose of this gerrymandering is to ensure the perpetuation in office of the National Coalition Government. Despite the fact that that it was not necessary to do this, we now have a situation in which one province in the country will have only ten representatives in Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>It is desirable that within these basic rules account should also be taken, as far as possible, of certain other matters such as local administrative boundaries, particularly, county boundaries, physical features, community of interest and the existing scheme of Dáil constituencies.</P>
      <P>I cannot be blamed for questioning the sincerity of the Minister's sentiments. If people look at the map issued by the Minister they will see the zig-zag around the town of Ballyshannon and the little inlet that goes into Sligo-Leitrim.  If they recall what I said here earlier this morning about Deputy White they must surely question the sincerity of the Minister in this regard.  We find many examples on this map of the breaching of local administrative boundaries, and particularly county boundaries.  I should like the Minister to explain to me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He would call on the Minister to make Limerick City a three-seater, Limerick West a four-seater and to create a seat for himself.  I wondered last summer why Senator O'Brien looked so well.  He was in great form. Every time he came in here he was rubbing the hands because he thought then that the day was not so far distant when he would be taking a seat in the other House.  It is natural that Senator O'Brien would be told not to speak on this Bill in case he would let the cat out of the bag.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators may not understand what I am talking about.  Ballyshannon is on the Sligo side of Ballintra.  One would imagine that this, the Sligo-Ballybofey-Letter-kenny road is a national primary road and that when one had crossed the Sligo-Leitrim constituency into County Donegal one would not have to enter Sligo-Leitrim again on the way to the town of the Four Masters, Donegal.  The Minister shook his head when he thought I suggested that the town of Ballintra was in Sligo-Leitrim. What I actually said was that one leaves Ballyshannon, drives for three miles and is still in the Donegal constituency, but, suddenly, on the main road, the main entry into Donegal on the western side from Sligo or from Galway or from Dublin, after three miles one is again driving through a portion of Sligo-Leitrim for another mile.  Then, if one continues for three miles in Donegal until reaching the <Col N="818" /> town of Ballintra, which is in the Donegal constituency, one finds a couple of hundred yards up a side road that one is back in Sligo-Leitrim. Surely this is the most blatant example of gerrymandering ever perpetrated in the history of this State, North or South?  It is equalled only by the old, silly constituency in Derry, where Sir Basil Brooke went as far as the town of Eglinton to ensure that a Unionist would be elected there.  He adopted the same wizard-like, or lizard-like approach, as the Minister for Local Government has done so far as Donegal and Sligo-Leitrim are concerned.</P>
      <P>After studying this map, I would challenge anyone with a sense of justice to deny the charge I have made, that is, that this is the most blatant example of gerrymandering ever perpetrated in the history of this land.  The like of it has never been experienced across the Border in the Six Counties even in their darkest hour.  The supporters of the infamous Sir Basil Brooke no doubt in the future will drive Pressmen from all over the world to this very spot between Ballyshannon and Ballintra and show them that they in the Six Counties were not so bad after all. Remember there is a very big flow of people from the Six Counties to the bracing seaside town of Bundoran. When they visit Bundoran they will have a first hand opportunity of witnessing the Tullymander that has been demonstrated in this locality.  There is no point in the pious platitudes of the present Government, in Ministers running up to Belfast to try to convince Unionist opinion that we are not so bad after all when we have to show them this typical example of gerrymandering that has taken place here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs said when he was in Opposition only three months before the general election that Northerners know only too well that this system of gerrymandering could be used against them in a united Ireland as it was used for so long in Northern Ireland to deprive the minority there of just representation in Parliament or in local authorities. These are not my words.  These were not the sentiments that I expressed. <Col N="819" /> These are the sentiments of Dr. Garret FitzGerald, now Minister for Foreign Affairs, in an article that he wrote only three months before the general election in <i>The Sunday Independent.</i>  We must go back and recall that in this House on the 1968 Electoral Bill the Minister for Foreign Affairs, then a front bench Opposition Senator, declared that a Fine Gael Government would introduce a commission and abolish this type of election or boundary fixing.  But here, between Ballyshannon and Ballintra, the Minister for Foreign Affairs voted for the most blatant example of gerrymandering this country has ever seen.</P>

In the years to come Members who are sitting smiling over there just now, justifying the action of the Minister and of the Government, will be asked to give an account of their stewardship, maybe in Cork, Limerick, Waterford or Leitrim.

      <P>If anything affects the reunification of this country it will be this very small inlet&mdash; an inlet described by Fine Gael councillors in Donegal as a damn shame. In the years to come, Members of this House will have to justify this because this is the greatest argument to persuade the Unionists of the Six Counties to have nothing to do with the present Government.</P>
      <P>So much for the sincerity of the Minister's sentiments as far as local administrative boundaries and county boundaries are concerned.  In his speech the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, I accept that Deputy Molloy was speaking for his party on this matter and for my part I am prepared, once the present revision of constituencies has been implemented, to consider any suggestion which the Opposition party may have to make on the question of a commission.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for a Minister to wait for suggestions from the Opposition party as far as a commission are concerned.  I would imagine that all the Minister and his colleagues had to do when they were elected to office was to practise in Government what they preached in Opposition.  When the former Minister for Lands introduced his own Bill on this matter I understand that the present Minister for Local Government supported it, and I have quoted what other Ministers and other Deputies had to say on this subject. I submit that the people of Ireland believed that when they elected a National Coalition Government the act of that Government would be to set up a commission to revise the constituencies. I believe that the people of Ireland who supported the National Coalition Government did so because they were misled into believing that these were honest politicians who pointed out many faults while in Opposition and who, no doubt, would correct them in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We soon found out that that was <Col N="821" /> not to be the case.  We soon found out that the top priority of the present Government, once they assumed office, was to take the necessary steps to ensure that office in Government would be perpetuated, so they very quickly forgot the undertakings they had made in the past.  Either they were insincere and dishonest politically when making those statements in 1968, 1969 and 1972, or they are insincere and politically dishonest now.  I note that the Minister, on page 4 of his speech, states:</P>
    <P>All kinds of selective statistics have been brought forward to support this contention but the fact is that the average population per Deputy in Dublin will be higher than the average per Deputy in the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the Minister arrived at the conclusion that the average population per Deputy in Dublin will be higher than the average per Deputy in the rest of the country, because when one studies this memorandum and the table at the back of it the figures are there.  They state that Dún Laoghaire has 20,216; Dublin (Artane), 20,346; Dublin (Ballyfermot), 20,999; Dublin (Cabra), 19,771; Dublin (Clontarf), 19,531; Dublin (Finglas), 20,034; Dublin North-Central, 19,452; Dublin (Rath-mines), 20,324; Dublin South-Central, 20,072; Dublin South-East, 19,292.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the Minister can say that the average population per Deputy in Dublin will be higher than the average per Deputy in the rest of the country when the four highest constituencies in the country are West County Dublin, County Donegal, Sligo-Leitrim and Roscommon-Leitrim.  All those constituencies have more than 21,000 people per Member while in Dublin it varies from a little more than 19,000 to 20,000.  Indeed there is only one constituency in Dublin, West County Dublin, which has a figure of more than 21,000.  Yet the Minister is trying to convey the impression that the average population per Deputy in Dublin is higher than the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> While I am dealing with Dublin I should like to come to the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. It must seem strange to the impartial observer to discover while studying the Dublin area that every constituency in Dublin is a three-seater with the exception of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. There are 13 three-seaters and one four-seater there.  Naturally I wonder why that situation was allowed to continue when the obvious policy of the Government in the Dublin area is to have three-seat constituencies, but we must remember that this is the Taoiseach's constituency. It is expected naturally that the Taoiseach will be strong enough to bring in a second Fine Gael Deputy.  If this was made a three-seater, no matter what the Government might do Fianna Fáil would have to get a seat in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. But we have Deputy Barry Desmond there.  It is quite obvious to me that if this Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown constituency had been changed into a three-seater, with two seats for Fine Gael and one seat for Fianna Fáil, the future for Deputy Barry Desmond would not be so certain.</P>
    <P>For six months of last year we all know that Deputy Desmond was not too happy with the political situation. There was no job for him.  Then they made him happy because they told him: &ldquo;We are going to have four more junior Ministers, Ministers without portfolio, so that we will not be in breach of the Constitution, and we will keep you and a few others who are causing a bit of trouble happy.&rdquo; It is well known that the Government intend to introduce legislation to this effect to keep Deputy Desmond's support of the National Coalition Government intact.  The Minister found himself in a dilemma in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown because he was not absolutely certain that in a three-seat constituency Deputy Desmond could be elected to Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>And Deputy Desmond is a man who, like Deputy <Col N="823" /> Coughlan, would not allow anyone to stab him in the back.  The Government departed from the principle of three-seat constituencies in the city of Dublin in order to keep Deputy Desmond of the Labour Party happy. In the three-seat constituencies in Dublin it is painfully obvious that the Government are seeking representation to which they are not entitled in a democratic society.  It is perfectly obvious that in the city of Dublin the Government are going for the jackpot.</P>

      <P>When these constituencies were being drawn recognition should not have been given to the Fine Gael and Labour Parties separately.  They should have been taken as one unit, because whether they like it or not they are a Government party and their only hope of remaining in office now and in the future is to stick together and gerrymander the constituencies well.  The Minister realised that the people of rural Ireland after a short time, and the small businessmen throughout this land, would not be looking too kindly on the present Government and that as each month would go by their popularity would ebb.  They hoped that the 14-point plan would be forgotten and overlooked for all time.  The Minister realised that he would have to go for the jackpot in the city of Dublin in the hope that Fianna Fáil would get one seat and Fine Gael and Labour would get one each.  That is not the proper way to look at it.  The way to look at it is that the Government are going for a two to one majority in this city.  I contend that it would be completely undemocratic, that the voting figures per political party in this city would not justify representation of that nature in Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>I am discussing the Minister's speech.  The Minister stated that a Minister for Local Government must weigh up the competing claims of all the areas and strike a balance which is fair to all.  The whole spirit of the Constitution requires an even spread of seats over the whole country without favouring or penalising any area.  Once again I would very much question the sincerity of the Minister's sentiments and indeed the Government's sentiments in this matter.

      <P>I submit that the Minister was not sincere when in the course of his speech he told us that he had to weigh up the competing claims of all the areas and strike a balance which is fair to all.  It is true that he weighed up the competing claims of Alderman Lipper, Deputy Stevie Coughlan and Senator Willie O'Brien.  In the interest of the preservation of the Labour Party he did strike a balance which was fair to Deputy Stevie Coughlan because the Minister knew that if he did not the <Col N="825" /> National Coalition Government, the Labour Party and he would be in trouble.  The Minister continued:</P>
      <P>The whole spirit of the Constitution requires an even spread of seats over the whole country without favouring or penalising any area.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that I must again warn the Senator he is repeating.  By tying the same argument to a different part of the Minister's speech he is infringing the rules of order.  I have had occasion, particularly in the past 20 minutes, to warn the Senator.  If he persists in repetition it will be necessary to ask him to resume his seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the Minister in revising the constituencies did not do what he claims the whole spirit of the Constitution requires.  I submit that he did not provide an even spread of seats over the whole country and that he did favour some areas and penalise other areas.  One has only to study the map that the Minister has issued to see that what I say is correct.  I cannot understand why a county like Donegal should have five seats, and a county like Louth, known as &ldquo;the wee county&rdquo;, should have four seats.  Is that an even spread of seats over the whole country? Would we not say that the Minister favoured County Louth and penalised County Donegal?</P>
      <P>The smallest county, a county that one can drive through in threequarters of an hour, has four representatives in Dáil Éireann whereas the fourth largest county has only one extra representative.  From that example I reject completely the claim made by the Minister in the course of his speech.  Later the Minister said:</P>
      <P>By combining two or more counties in a single constituency it is possible to draw up a scheme in which no county boundary would be breached.  For example, counties Donegal and Leitrim could be combined to form a seven-seat constituency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I have never mentioned that before.  I have only come to it.  I believe the Minister is wrong in leaving Donegal as a single constituency.  I believe he should have left it as two constituencies, that he had a few thousand people to draw from from north-east Donegal and that with a little further help from Leitrim those two constituencies could have remained intact, particularly, as the counties of Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim are in the one region for health purposes and for tourism.</P>
      <P>I would agree, if the Minister was not prepared to leave the constituency in the way in which I have suggested, that Counties Donegal and Leitrim could be combined to form a seven-seat constituency.  I want to ask him why he did not do this if he was not prepared to leave the two constituencies in Donegal.  I believe that once again the Minister is not really sincere in what he is saying because if he had made County Donegal and County Leitrim into a single constituency we would find four out-going Fine Gael Deputies in this constituency.  The Government and the Minister know that even in their wildest dreams those four outgoing Fine Gael Deputies would not hold their seats in a constituency which consists of Counties Donegal and Leitrim.</P>
      <P>So, I would say to the Minister, if he is not prepared to leave the two constituencies in County Donegal that it would be better for the people of Donegal and for the people of Leitrim to be put in a seven-seat constituency which he has suggested here.  I will ask the Minister to implement the suggestion that he has made on page six of his speech, where he states:</P>
      <P>The new Donegal constituency is, in fact, a more compact area than the present constituency of Donegal-Leitrim which stretches from Tory Island to Dromahair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can only conclude that the Minister knows very little about County Donegal when he makes an assertion of <Col N="827" /> this kind.  Further down in the same page the Minister states:</P>
    <P>In drawing up the proposals contained in this Bill my objective was to ensure fair and reasonable representation for the people of every area.</P>
    <P>I believe that I have proved without any shadow of doubt that this claim by the Minister is unacceptable.  I believe that I have proved that the Minister was neither fair nor reasonable towards the people of many areas and I believe, indeed, that many Deputies, supporters of the National Coalition Government, would disagree with the proposals.  But the crunch came in the last sentence of his speech when he said: &ldquo;I hope I have succeeded in these objectives, and judging from a comment of impartial observers I feel that my efforts have, in fact, been successful, and I am confident that Senators will take this view also.&rdquo;  Judging from the comments of impartial observers, the Minister believes that he has been successful in giving fair and reasonable representation to the people of every area. But I should like to know what an impartial observer is, and I would tell the Minister that he could not be living along the road from Ballyshannon to Ballintra, because nobody in his sane senses on that road could say that the Minister was either fair or reasonable.  I believe that any impartial observer who studies these constituency changes in the city of Dublin, in the city and County of Cork, in Cavan and Monaghan and in every county from Clare to Donegal, could not agree that the Minister was fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>This is obnoxious legislation coming at a time when we should be trying to satisfy the people that we have a conscience as far as fair play and justice to all is concerned.  This legislation is distasteful not alone to the people living on this side of the Border but especially to those living in the six of Ulster's nine counties. The day will come when people of all political viewpoints and all denominations will point the finger of scorn at the Minister and his Government and <Col N="828" /> accuse them of doing something that they have stopped doing a year ago. But remember a very heavy price had to be paid by the people of the Six Counties and is still being paid by the people of the Six Counties before that system was stopped there.  I sat down in The Diamond in Derry at the first public meeting ever held by a Nationalist in the city of Doire Cholmcille. I sat after marching with 17,000 people across Craigavon Bridge on that November day in 1968, and I was proud to sit by them and proud, indeed, to say that I am the only Member of the Oireachtas who took part in that historic event. But we cannot overlook that the main reason why that became necessary, the main reason why the people of Derry rose and threw the shackles off them began with the gerrymandering of their constituencies, began with the gerrymandering of their wards, the denial of 70 per cent of the population of that city, of their true and proper representation.  That is why the people of Derry rebelled and on that historic day to which I referred, those 17,000 people would have accepted any abuse from the so-called forces of law and order to make their point.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to appeal to the Minister <Col N="829" /> to take this Bill with him, to study it carefully over the Easter recess and give particular attention to the amendments which we, on this side of the House, intend tabling.  If he should do this, in the years to come he will not regret his action. I realise that the Committee Stage is more appropriate for going into detail. It is my intention to do just that when we reach that Stage.</P>
    <P>This Bill, in my opinion, is the most undemocratic piece of legislation introduced in this House since I came here in 1961.  It is unfair, unjust, and despicable.  If the Government had any decency at all, they would bow their heads in shame in the knowledge that even the greatest Unionist in Belfast has not legislation of this kind today to perpetuate himself in office.  The Minister and the Government are doing something that even the British Government who, for 700 years, did not give two raps about this country, would not tolerate.  Even they insisted that obnoxious legislation of this kind should be wiped from the statute books in north-east Ulster.  The British Government, who never cared for this nation, whose interest in Ireland for 700 years was purely a selfish one, could not tolerate this legislation that existed in the Six Counties. Yet, we have the Government of the Just Society, composed of people who, in Opposition, would like to have been described as paragons of virtue, who are prepared to force through the Houses of the Oireachtas legislation that is not acceptable by any fair-minded Unionist in north-east Ulster.</P>
    <P>In forcing this legislation through this House, the Minister is helping those who are extreme in outlook in the Six Counties.  Indeed, it has been suggested by some that William Craig, who once held a similar office in the Six Counties to that held by the present Minister for Local Government, came from Belfast to help the Minister draw up the constituencies and to draft this Bill.  I do not know if this is true or false.  I do not know if there is any substance in this rumour, <Col N="830" /> but the hands of William Craig, of Ian Paisley, of John Taylor and certainly the hand of the infamous Sir Basil Brooke appear to be very much evident in the drafting of this Bill.</P>

I would suggest to the Minister that if he persists in taking out of Donegal the area to the right of the road from Ballyshannon to Ballintra, which includes Pettigo and Lough Derg, if this injustice is perpetrated on the people of this area, then the decent thing for the Minister, his Government and his supporters to do, is to spend as long <Col N="832" /> as possible in the island of Lough Derg this coming summer.  Lough Derg is a place where some souls suffer for a time on account of their sins.  I believe that the people of the west wonder why this famous Donegal island&mdash;this famous pilgrimage spot which is known not alone throughout Ireland but in distant lands&mdash;is, in the opinion of the Minister for Local Government, no longer in County Donegal.  That is the result of his gerrymandering.  Bill Craig would not have a great deal of interest in Lough Derg.  That might be why this island was removed from the County Donegal and put into Sligo-Leitrim.</P>

I will conclude my speech as I started by saying that the architect of gerrymandering in this country was Sir Basil Brooke, but he is only an altar boy compared to the present Minister for Local Government.  I would call on the Minister and his Government, if they have any sense of fair play at all, to withdraw this obnoxious legislation and to do in office what they said they would do when they were in Opposition, and that is to appoint an independent, impartial commission as was done in the six North-Eastern counties of this country.</P>

      <P>Having listened to that brilliant and lengthy speech by Senator McGlinchey, it is not so easy to find something to say without repeating what he has said.</P>
      <P>I look on this Bill as a deliberate attempt by the present Government to remain in power, even against the wishes of the majority of the people. Like other speakers, I am surprised that we have not had a speaker from the opposite side of the House.  We could not have had one today, but we could yesterday.  The indications are that we will not hear from anybody from that side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true perhaps that the Government party could not say anything against the Bill but there must be something to be said in its favour.  Yet we have not had one speaker from the Government side. Only one Independent Senator has contributed to this debate, Senator Mary Robinson.  On the last Electoral Bill Senator Quinlan spoke for quite a long time, although he claimed he was an Independent Member and had no political ties whatsoever.  It is rather strange that he is not here today to speak against this Bill.</P>
      <P>Another reason perhaps why Government Members are not speaking is that they have been told by the Minister that he wants to get this Bill through this week.  Rumours to that effect have been circulating since lunchtime.  I cannot understand why there should be such a rush now about the Bill.  The Government took office last March.  It took from March until November for the Government to make up their minds what kind of a Bill they wanted.  They came into the Dáil in early November and Fianna Fáil took part in the debate up to a week ago.  They got the guillotine in the Dáil and it looks as if the same tactics are going to be used here.</P>
      <P>There is no rush to get this Bill through, unless there is a general election coming in a few weeks' time. After this budget, perhaps the Government think it might be a good time to have an election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Which budget is right.  I am sure if the Minister would give us a guarantee here that there is going to be an election within a month, we shall give him the Bill straight away.  Despite the gerrymander that is being carried out in this Bill the people will see through it and when an election campaign is under way the Government will realise that they have cut sticks with which to beat themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been here for other Electoral <Col N="834" /> Bills and we heard quite a lot from Government speakers who were then Opposition speakers, including the Minister, about this commission.  It was said that a commission was the only fair way of dividing up boundaries. We have not heard a word about the commission on this Bill, except that the Minister has said that nobody is more suited for this job than the politicians.  I agree with that.  It is rather strange when we had such a lot of talk about a commission before that we do not hear anything about it now.</P>
    <P>The province which concerns me most is Munster.  It is stated in the memorandum:</P>
    <P>Munster, excluding Clare, will maintain its present number of seats. The number of constituencies in the area will be reduced from 12 to 11.</P>
    <P>I understand that from the increase in the population in Munster the Minister, if he wanted to do so, could increase the seats there by two, but he did not decide to do that.  Instead, he has decided to reduce the second most important city in Ireland to a five-seater, instead of a six-seater.  The memorandum says that the ratio of population to Deputies in the existing Cork city constituency is outside the range regarded as permissible. With the increase in population that means that the six-seater is not permissible because we have more people than we should have for a six-seater constituency.  Instead of increasing Cork city to a seven-seater the Minister reduces it to a five-seater.  It is very hard to understand why he decides that Cork city has too large a population for six seats so he makes it a five-seater instead.</P>
    <P>Cork city was a five-seater constituency some years ago.  The population increased there and under the second last Electoral Bill it was made a two three-seater constituency.  It is an insult to the people of Cork city to have it reduced now to a five-seater. We know that the Minister has method in his madness because he is endeavouring to get a seat there for Labour&mdash;for Senator Kerrigan, I presume. We do not begrudge Senator <Col N="835" /> Kerrigan a seat there.  If it is a five-seater. I feel sure we will secure three seats and the other two seats will go to Fine Gael or Labour.  That is the only reason why Cork has been made a five-seater.  It is a poor reflection on Labour to say that in the two three-seaters in Cork city they were unable to win a seat in the last election.</P>
    <P>The portion of Cork city which the Minister does not want included now has been put into the constituency of Mid-Cork, a constituency which sprawls all over Cork from Cork City Hall to the borders of Kerry and Limerick and reaches almost to Clare. It is a constituency which must be more than 100 miles long.  Yet the Minister has decided now to extend that constituency by bringing it deeper into Cork city.  It is very hard to understand why that should happen. The heart of Cork city should be associated with the areas around Millstreet, Rathluirc and North Cork. The present proposal is ridiculous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is going to get a pal in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been transferred from Cork city 15,000 city people to a rural constituency. This does not make sense.  It is very hard to understand why there should be one law for Cork city and another law for Dublin.  All Dublin constituencies, with one exception, have been made three-seaters and yet Cork city has been made a five-seater.</P>
      <P>As far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, we are not grumbling about what has happened.  We will get three seats in Mid-Cork and Cork city.  It is the people of Cork we are thinking about.  They have got a raw deal from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clare is another county in Munster which has been affected and about which we heard quite a lot from Senator Killilea and other Senators. In Clare a provincial boundary has been breached as well as a county boundary.  In the previous Electoral Bill Fianna Fáil put portion of Clare in with Galway and called the constituency Clare-Galway.  The portion <Col N="836" /> that was put in was quite close to Galway.  Deputies were not affected in any way because of the distances they had to travel.  It was a three-seater.</P>
    <P>The Minister has now decided that Galway will have two four-seaters and he has restored that part of Clare, or most of it, to Clare.  He has put another portion of Clare with Galway. That constituency extends from about a mile from Ennis town to away up beyond Clifden, to Inishboffin.  As the Minister himself is a rural Deputy, it is hard to understand why he is making it so difficult for rural Deputies to carry out their work. I pity any Deputy who has to look after a constituency of that kind.</P>
    <P>Long before the Bill was introduced the Minister stated that it was his intention to respect county boundaries. I know that in all cases that was not possible but it was possible in several cases where he has shown little respect for county boundaries. In my own county, Tipperary, we are in the unhappy position of being the only county in Ireland which has two county councils.  There was a revision of constituencies in 1948. Up to that time Tipperary was a seven-seater but then it was divided up into a four-seater in the South and a three-seater in the North.  The dividing line was the dividing line for the county councils.  Therefore, when you break the county council boundary in Tipperary you are breaking a county boundary.</P>
    <P>Later on in the 1961 Electoral Bill, a portion of South Tipperary, two parishes, Gartnahoe and Kilgool had to go into North Tipperary in order to boost North Tipperary.  Tipperary did not have the population for three seats.  Later on, in another electoral revision, a further portion was added to North Tipperary in order to bring it up to the required population.  On this occasion there was no need whatsoever to transfer a large portion of South Tipperary to North Tipperary. North Tipperary already had the population to elect three Deputies and yet the Minister decided to put places like Ballingarry, Ballyphilip, Buolick, Crohane, Farranrory, Nodstown and <Col N="837" /> Killenaule into North Tipperary.  I should like to know the Minister's reason for transferring those places to North Tipperary because, in my view, there was no need to do so.  The position now is that there is a three-seater in South Tipperary and a three-seater in North Tipperary but there is a bigger population in North Tipperary.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has to transfer an area from one county to another on a population basis, that is all right, but this was not the reason he did it in South Tipperary.  I believe this happened in South Tipperary because the Minister was misled by the Labour Party in the county.  In the last election Labour won a North Tipperary seat by 150 votes.  The Government must think that by including Killenaule, Ballingarry and Nodstown in that area, they will hold on to that seat in North Tipperary.  We in Tipperary think differently.  I am not worried about Fianna Fáil.  The people in Killenaule and Ballingarry want to stay in South Tipperary. Their county councillors are in South Tipperary.  They have to work in South Tipperary for county council purposes and they have to go into North Tipperary for Dáil purposes. This is most unfair.</P>
    <P>To be fair to our local Fianna Fáil Deputy, Deputy Noel Davern, I think he has been treated very shabbily by this revision of the constituency. The North Tipperary constituency now extends from the town of Birr in the County Offaly right down to the town of Cashel.  As well as trying to hold onto this extra seat for Labour in North Tipperary, there was also an attempt to take votes from Deputy Noel Davern because, naturally, the biggest vote you get in an election is the vote you get around your own area and that area is now taken from Deputy Davern.</P>
    <P>In the 1961 electoral division Fianna Fáil transferred part of Waterford to Tipperary.  The Waterford people at that time were very disappointed because that happened. Strange to say, now the Waterford people want to stay in Tipperary.  We have given them very good attention <Col N="838" /> during the years they have been with us and they are quite happy to remain with us.  However, I respect the wishes of the Minister because, in transferring that portion of Waterford back again to Waterford, he is respecting county boundaries.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the west and I do not wish to repeat it.  We listened to the Government, when they were in Opposition, blaming Fianna Fáil for neglecting the west down through the years.  The Coalition Government have been in power for one year now and we have seen the way they have been neglecting the west.  Only one Parliamentary Secretary was appointed from the west. Now when the west is entitled to 30 seats, the Government will only allow 28 seats.  It is very hard to understand why we should be trying to take those seats from rural areas and giving them to the city of Dublin.  Fifteen seats in the west would have a population of 315,000 odd, and 15 seats in Dublin would have a population of 293,652.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to understand why a country Deputy should be expected to have a bigger number of constituents than a Dublin Deputy.  A Dublin Deputy has only about one mile to travel to the farthest end of his constituency.  He is here in Leinster House most days of the week when the Dáil is sitting and his constituents can come in to meet him.  The situation of a rural Deputy is completely different.  A rural Deputy has to travel night after night to meetings all over his constituency.  In some cases he has to travel almost 100 miles.  He is expected to be at his home to meet people.  Some years ago Fianna Fáil tried to put through the tolerance issue and we were beaten on a referendum because the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party told the people not to vote for the tolerance issue.  The tolerance issue was intended to make things easier for rural Deputies and to give people in rural Ireland better representation than they had.</P>
    <P>Looking briefly through the different constituencies, I notice that there are a few constituencies where <Col N="839" /> there are no changes.  They are constituencies where the Government have a majority.  In Carlow and Kilkenny, where there are three Government TDs and two Fianna Fáil TDs, there is no change.  In my opinion there could be a change because there is quite a portion of Kilkenny in with the Borough of Waterford. That part of Kilkenny should be returned to Kilkenny and in that way the Minister could give back the part of Wexford that is in with Kilkenny to Wexford.</P>
    <P>I do not think there should be any change in the Cavan and Monaghan constituencies.  We know that the population has dropped there but, at the same time, if Meath and Louth were left as three-seaters, we could have two three-seaters in Cavan and Monaghan as we had in the past. Other than in Cork City and Mid-Cork there is no change in any of the Cork constituencies.  I am sorry to see Donegal being reduced to a five-seater because this is an attempt to victimise the west and the north.  An all-out effort should be made to find a way of having at least six seats in Donegal because it is so far away.  I know the Minister has his reasons for doing this. He believes that by reducing it to a five-seater Fianna Fáil will lose a seat in Donegal.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned West Galway.  South Kerry still remains as it was except that the part of West Cork that is included will not be returned to West Cork again.  I am sorry to see that part of Kildare has been included in some small portion of Meath, probably to help the Minister keep his seat there.  Another portion of it has been included in County Dublin. Dublin is big enough without taking from the country to add to it.  Every county around Dublin should be left on its own.  If anything, it should be the other way about, part of Dublin should be included in Kildare, to help Kildare, Meath and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is no change in Laois-Offaly because again we have only two seats there, but in the next election I expect we will have the three there again. Louth has got four seats at the expense <Col N="840" /> of County Monaghan.  It appears that, on its own, Louth could not have four seats.  I am sorry to see a county such as Monaghan having to suffer at the hands of that small, very prosperous, county of Louth which I think would do very well with three seats.  The same applies to Meath.</P>
    <P>Wicklow is being left as a three-seater. We all expected that Wicklow would be a four-seater after this election because the population there has increased considerably but this is not so.  The Minister has decided that he would take a part of Wicklow&mdash; Little Bray&mdash;and include it in the Mid-County Dublin constituency; again something with which I do not agree.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I believe that the Committee Stage of this Bill certainly will not be taken this week but next week or the week after and that, when we bring in our amendments to the Bill, the Minister will give them careful consideration.  Perhaps he will see our point of view and make some changes in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the many valuable criticisms made on this Bill from this side of the House and because we did not have any speeches from the Government side&mdash;something with which I will deal later &mdash;we all await the Minister's reply with interest.  There is one point I would like to bring to the Minister's attention.  I noticed, in his opening speech, after dealing with the various objections he said:</P>
      <P>I hope I have succeeded in those objectives and, judging from the comments of impartial observers, I feel that my efforts have in fact been successful and I am confident that Senators will take this view also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not just enough to say &ldquo;impartial observers&rdquo;.  I think any Senator would agree we had an impartial observer speaking here last night&mdash; Senator Mary Robinson.  I believe her to be so; she is a very positive type of person in her views.  She has spoken against the Fianna Fáil Government and against this one.  I believe she is sincere in everything she <Col N="841" /> says.  There is something I want to bring to the Minister's attention and I do this for the right reasons.  I do not know whether the Minister has seen this morning's <i>Irish Times.</i>  I hope the report in this is untrue.  It was dealing with Senator Robinson's speech and she was quoting from Dáil Debates. I quote what she said:</P>
    <P>On November the 28th, 1968 Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick, as he then was, introduced a Constituency Commission Bill and said he was doing so on behalf of Fine Gael.  This was supported by Deputy Tully, as he then was, for the Labour Party. As Mrs. Robinson began to quote from Mr. Tully's remarks in that debate, Mr. Tully began to laugh and continued to do so while she continued reading the quotation.</P>
    <P>I bring that to the Minister's attention. He has indicated to me that he has not seen it.  I sincerely hope it is untrue because Senator Robinson is a very positive type of person in the views she expresses and, whatever reaction she inspires at times, certainly it is not one of laughter.  Knowing the Minister reasonably well I doubt if he would be guilty of ungentlemanly conduct in that regard. Might I expect that the Minister will be making a reference of what I said? If it is untrue I expect that he will deny it and if it is true I do not know what his reaction will be but I know the reaction we would expect as regards laughter at any Senator in this House and particularly at Senator Robinson.  I want to believe it is untrue.</P>
    <P>In replying, I hope the Minister will deal also with the apparent sense of urgency surrounding this Bill. Perhaps he will explain why it was so necessary to have the Seanad meet in this particular week.  There is no precedent for meeting this week except, I understand, on one occasion when we met on the Tuesday to deal with some urgent business. We do not regard this as urgent and we could be forgiven for being suspicious when there is this sense of urgency surrounding the Bill, particularly as it is a Bill that can only &mdash;apparently the Minister believes <Col N="842" /> this to be so&mdash;promote the interests of the Coalition Government.  I might also mention that we are still awaiting important legislation promised by the Government.  If this Bill is being treated with greater urgency and importance than all the beautiful schemes were proposed by the Minister, and other Ministers, certainly there are very definite grounds for wondering why.</P>
    <P>One point that has been stressed again and again since this debate started is the fact that the Minister, and other members of the Government, whilst in Opposition, advocated an independent commission to deal with any electoral boundary changes. It is perfectly reasonable for our part &mdash;some of us having studied the comments made by the Minister and other Ministers while in Opposition regarding boundary changes&mdash;to ask why Is it because they were dishonest in their criticisms on the first occasion? they have reneged on their promises. they wish to consolidate their position, Is it because they feel insecure in their present position, or is it that knowing that there is the danger at all times with any Coalition Government of a break-up?</P>
    <P>There are positive indications and, if we take the urgency surrounding this Bill, we might indeed also take this as a positive indication of the Government not being happy with their present position.  It is suggested that there is dissention within the Government itself.  I am not aware if that is so but there is definitely a suggestion of dissention.  Is it that the Minister as a good politician is pressing this Bill so as to have it ready in any emergency that might arise?</P>
    <P>It is difficult at this stage of the debate to say anything new or original as the various speakers up to this have dealt with all aspects of the Bill and, we are denied the opportunity of hearing the views of the Senators on the Government benches, we are also denied the opportunity of replying to what they might have said.  It has become perfectly obvious, so obvious, in fact, that it is not even denied by the Senators on the Government benches, that they are under instructions <Col N="843" /> that under no circumstances are they to speak on this Bill and so we are denied the opportunity of being made aware of what each Senator thinks of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another matter on which I should like to get a reply from the Minister is the reason for the more favourable ratio of Deputies to constituencies in Dublin as against the underdeveloped sparsely populated areas.  I would have thought that in an underdeveloped constituency the more Deputies in that constituency the more good can be done for that constituency.  All of us in rural constituencies are aware of the involvement of Deputies and Senators in various committees, promoting industry and other things for the betterment of the community.  That is why it is difficult to understand why there appears to be a deliberate attempt to give as few representatives as possible to the rural areas and more representatives to the city.  Is it because the Government recognise that the opportunity for creating their own representation in rural constituencies is just not on and, as a result, they are concentrating on Dublin where they feel they will increase their representation?  If this is the reason, a reason one can understand from a purely political point of view, then the Minister should say so. Or is it an indication that any further taxation will be imposed on the rural community and, because of that, they feel that the position may not even be as secure in the future as it may be now?</P>
    <P>Where there is an increase in population, and one must accept that the increase in population is in Dublin, one could argue in favour of increased representation but that is really not completely acceptable. Take the rural constituency of North Tipperary as an example.  If the Labour Party, the Minister's own party, succeed in retaining the seat in North Tipperary which they won the last time, with the increased electorate that the Minister now proposes to give to North Tipperary you will have, in fact, a situation there where the <Col N="844" /> Labour TD, assuming that he is elected&mdash;not a safe assumption in my view&mdash;will be 42 to 45 miles, if not 50, away from the farthest point in the constituency.  I am not just selecting a corner on the map when I say &ldquo;the farthest point away&rdquo; from where he lives; I am, in fact, picking the thickly populated area of Ballingarry, an industrial area with a future increased industrial potential.  As against that, in Dublin I doubt if any TD is more than three miles away from the farthest point in his constituency. I may be wrong in that by a mile or so; I say three miles approximately because I do not know the distance but, studying the map, I know it is not a big area.</P>

      <P>I am totally unable to understand from the statement of the Leader of the House what the purpose is in sitting until 1 a.m.  The whole attitude behind the pushing of this Bill has an extraordinary element of urgency, almost of emergency, about it.  The Minister in the Dáil only last week said, with his typical candid approach to such matters, that he had every expectation that a general election would take place four years from now.  Accepting the candour, honesty and truthfulness on such occasions of the Minister as indeed I must, it seems absolutely clear that there is no element of urgency whatever about this Bill.  I simply cannot understand why we should be treated in this way.</P>
      <P>I have been a Senator for 16 years, on and off, and I can say categorically that never before has this House sat on three days in Holy Week.  I can recall one occasion when the House sat on the Tuesday of Holy Week to take a very urgent Bill, a Central Fund Bill, which had to be dealt with in order to provide moneys by 31st March.  But never did anything of this kind occur in Holy Week previously.  It is quite unprecedented and very unjustified.</P>
      <P>Not only are we being asked to sit for three days in Holy Week but we are being asked to sit through tea. It is simply extraordinary.  Unless the Leader of the House can give us some reason for this we could not possibly agree to it.  The only thing is, as already said by Senator Willie Ryan, that if the Government intended to have an election and to face the people within a month or so, we would give them the Bill in five minutes. But failing that it is unthinkable we would agree to do anything of this kind.  Starting at 10 a.m. and going on until 1 a.m. the following morning is ridiculous for a Bill of this kind which has absolutely no urgency.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Yeats has let the cat out of the bag in the few words he has uttered now.  It is quite clear that Fianna Fáil see no reason why this Bill <Col N="846" /> should not go through in five minutes. What have they done?  They have signalled from the very start that they intend to filibuster on this Bill.  Senator Yeats has been in this House, as he has said, off and on for 16 years.  Neither he nor any other Member of this House has heard a speech in this House which occupied 6 hours and 20 minutes.  Two Fianna Fáil speakers have occupied practically eight hours between them.  I do not know any better definition of filibustering than that.  Fianna Fáil are entitled to do that if they want to. They are quite entitled to use every legitimate device under the Standing Orders.</P>
      <P>So far as this side of the House is concerned, and so far as the Minister is concerned we are also entitled to have regard to the convenience of the Members of this House, to the Government programme of legislation, to the desirability of preventing this House being turned into a farce by any Opposition speakers.  It is for those reasons&mdash;putting them as briefly as I can&mdash;that I am making this proposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept that motion even though it comes from a responsible Member of this House, Senator O'Higgins, because I do not see the reason for it no more than I see the reason for sitting during this particular week. There is no precedent for dealing with any legislation during Holy Week. If, perhaps, the urgency was explained to us then we might have a better understanding.  There has <Col N="850" /> been no reason given whatsoever in support of not just alone sitting this week but now proposing something that I never remember&mdash;sitting until 1 a.m.&mdash;to deal with a Bill that can only further the cause of the Government parties.</P>
      <P>We would react responsibly to any motion asking us to sit late into the night if proper reasons were given. All I recall Senator O'Higgins saying is that he was proposing a motion that we sit not later than 1 a.m. and that we sit through the tea break. No one else on that side of the House has given us any reason why we should sit late.  I am not prepared to accept that we should.  We have sat here all day.  Some of us have been prepared to speak.  We did our homework so that we would be ready to contribute to this very important Bill.  Others, apparently, are not too sure whether they have anything good to say about it because they have said nothing at all.  Occasionally they made interruptions which did not make sense.  They appeared to be just personal attacks on the speaker at the time.</P>
      <P>If the Leader of the House is prepared to give us one good reason why we should sit late to deal with a Bill of this type and explain the urgency to us then he will receive a responsible reaction from this side of the House.</P>

      <P>In making my protest against this motion I think it is only fair that this House take into consideration the staff of this House who, first, are now being asked to work through tea, secondly, to work not later than 1 o'clock and, thirdly, to work tomorrow when this House will again sit.  I do not think it is quite fair on a matter that is not of a great immediate national importance.  This Bill is not an emotional Bill from that point of view.  It is unfair that during Holy Week we should put this extra strain on the staff of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the remark of the Leader of the House when he said that what we are doing here today is a farce is a proper and accurate description of the democratic process <Col N="851" /> that has been gone through since 3 o'clock yesterday.  I cannot see, no more than Senator Hanafin, any reason why we should sit here until 1 o'clock tomorrow morning.  Further to that I have not seen before a motion like this being put in this House in my few short years here.  I always watched the process when we were on the Government side.  At 9.30 the Leader of the House would interject. Prior to that the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition would, presumably, discuss the situation and if the Leader of the House saw fit at that particular time to continue on for two, three, four or five hours, as has happened, it would have been the proper way to put this motion.  It is wrong that this motion be put at seven minutes past six.  We will oppose the motion vehemently. Furthermore, the reason we will oppose it is, as is on the records of the House, the Leader of the House has suggested that we will sit again tomorrow. The urgency seems to have grown since yesterday at 3.15 p.m.</P>
    <P>It is not proper to break with the tradition of this House.  I think at this stage the Leader of the House should withdraw this motion.  He should assess the situation at 9.30 or thereabouts in the way in which it has always been done.  Furthermore, it is not fair to the Senators on this side of the House.  We have tried diligently all this day and all yesterday to make sensible and sound contributions to the debate.  Some of us have worked reasonably hard.  It is not quite fair to us since the Bill is not of great immediate importance that this motion should now be forced on this House.</P>
    <P>There are many of us who would like our normal break for tea.  Some of us&mdash;myself included&mdash;could possibly do without it.  It do not think it is quite fair when we are sitting tomorrow, to be asked to sit until, or not later than 1 a.m.</P>

      <P>I wish to add my voice to that proposal.  We have already protested against this injustice.  This has come as a complete surprise.  It should have been mentioned in the morning on the Order of Business.  When the regulations were made then, a motion from Senator Martin on the Adjournment was accepted.  It is a very interesting motion and one that many of the Senators&mdash;particularly myself&mdash;would be very interested in and to which we would like to contribute.  The proposition has been made that we sit until 1 o'clock and that afterwards we would discuss Senator Martin's motion. I have very considerable respect for Senator Martin who is a neighbour and a colleague and usually his contributions to this House are very interesting and are listened to by most Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is my duty to be present here and I do my utmost to ensure that I am punctual and make a reasonable contribution to the debates.  I resent the insinuation that has been made by the Leader of the House that we on this side of the House are talking tripe and nonsense and that we are trying to filibuster.  If anything has happened in that respect&mdash;and I would not admit one line of it&mdash;that, to my mind, is a gross reflection on the Chair.  I have known the Cathaoirleach for quite a long time.  I have watched his performance as Chairman and think he is excellent.  Certainly, I have never seen a more impartial or a better chairman in any assembly and I am quite sure that the majority of the Senators, even on the other side of the House, would admit that what I am saying is perfectly <Col N="854" /> clear and sincere.  I do not think he is the type of person who would allow anything to slip through&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He is not the type who would allow anything to slip through that was not within the order of debate.  I have learned that he is a man who knows it from A to Z. We were not taken in by the attempt that has been made here to try to stifle us on this side of the House. We were not brought in here by the Taoiseach.  We know we have a worthwhile contribution to make in this House.  I do not like to see the ordinary process of democracy being flouted by the Leader of the House or any other Member.  We are the Upper House in this State, we are part of the Oireachtas irrespective of which side of the House we sit and I think it is wrong for anybody, in particular the Leader of the House, to try to slip this in.  I will admit that he has a majority over there and it seems that he is going to exercise it.  He shows the total disregard which he has for the people of rural Ireland. It has been demonstrated already in the Bill before the House regarding the changing of the constituencies. We have already noted, and it is now on the record, that he has conceded that it would take a greater number of people in rural Ireland to elect a Deputy to Dáil Éireann than it would take in the cities.  That is perfectly true.  You can take the figures anyway you like.  It has been proven here by the figures.  I am reasonably good at mathematics and I would expect that some of the people opposite would try to do their homework in this respect.  I want to say that it is wrong, in my opinion, for the Leader of the House to try to deprive us of taking part in this debate.  To carry on a debate in this House until the unearthly hour of 1 o'clock is certainly beyond comprehension.  Many people may wish to travel back to their homes, as they are entitled to do, and as I think any family man would like to do.  It is only fair that <Col N="855" /> these people should be given a chance. I think it is wrong to introduce this at such an hour.  Let us be sensible about it.  After all we are living in a Christian state.  When the Family Planning Bill was before the House they were emphasising very emphatically how much they were leaning towards Christianity.  It surprises me that in Holy Week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate your protection, a Chathaoirleach.  I want to say again that it surprises me that the Leader of the House, who waxed so eloquent on the Family Planning Bill regarding the Christian and moral aspects of it, is now trying to steamroll all us into degrading Holy Week, making a mockery of Holy Thursday, not allowing us to attend to our duties on Good Friday&mdash;trying to steamroll the very essence of Christianity out of this House.  We start our business here with a prayer, which I think it is an excellent thing.  It happens in the Dáil on the other side and it happens here, and I suppose the next move by the Leader of the House will be to ensure that there will be no prayer for the beginning of our business here and he will also try to have a motion to try to cut that out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this is grossly unfair.  Somebody mentioned the staff of this House.  I as a Labour representative, too, and one who knows what it is to work, try to appreciate that the staff of this House have to work very hard and that they have to stay inside in good sunshine and so forth in overheated conditions.  I appreciate, too, that being human beings they have wives and families and homes to go to.  It is unnatural to expect the restaurant staff to sit up here until 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock for no particular reason at all except to satisfy the whim of the Government who are <Col N="856" /> coming in here and trying to steamroll through the House a Bill about which there cannot be any apparent hurry.  It will be appropriate, I can tell you, before 12 months.  However, I think it is wrong that they should come in here to try to put this across and I want to express my deep disappointment at this treatment, especially from the Leader of the House who just walked in here at the very end of the proceedings, sat down, made his contribution and whipped in the boys behind him&mdash;those silent people who have been silent all of the two days and never made even one sentence of a contribution except interruptions. If they were in earnest about the merits of the Bill and if they believed in it, they should not be ashamed to get up in this House and defend it but not one single Senator on the other side of the House said one word about the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They had been mute for so long on the Constituency Bill which effects everyone of them.  I do not know who silenced them or who gagged them, but during the last two days they have come in here as if they were on a retreat.  Perhaps it is the spirit of Holy Week that has got into them and that they are really on a retreat.  I am not too sure about that <Col N="857" /> but there is something wrong with them.  They have gagged themselves or they have been gagged by somebody else.  I want emphatically to protest.

In fact we are discussing whether we should or should not rise at 6 o'clock and have tea so as to come back at 7 p.m.  We have been discussing this since about five past six.  The question whether we rise for tea or not is certainly part of the issue.</P>

      <P>I think that the level of reality that exists in the House at the moment is of the most tenuous and ephemeral kind.  I did not stand up to make that derisory remark though that derisory remark I think is well justified by the manner in which the national Legislature is behaving and has been, in a sense, behaving all day.  All the Senators who have spoken on this side who object to the motion will be satisfied with the answer to one question: what is the urgency for the Bill?  I presume they are sincere in this.  In other words, if somebody from the Government side can stand up and say what is the urgency for the Bill I think we could all go on and perhaps have tea or go on with the debate as the case may be.  Could we solve the problem by perhaps having that question answered and perhaps then we could proceed with the process of legislation?</P>

It is nothing short of it.  You could not convince the public that this is a reasonable motion.  I think the Minister will have to live with it and the Government will have to live with it and they will live to regret it.  No action that will be recorded during the passage through the House of this Bill will stand to the credit of the Government.  I would ask for a reasonable approach to it.  Those in Government have a responsibility to legislate in a reasonable fashion.  If contributions are to be made they should be sincere contributions.  I do not think these can be made after the hour of 10 o'clock and according to standing orders 10 o'clock was a reasonable hour.  I would ask the Leader of the House not to press this motion, as one who has not been involved in any filibuster here.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my voice to the appeal to the Leader of the House.  I cannot understand the indecent haste with which this matter is being pressed.  We have been called to sit this week for three days. We made arrangements accordingly. I think there is every reason to believe that if we sit the normal hours this evening the Second Stage will be concluded tomorrow and I cannot see any reason for this extraordinary attempt on the second day of a debate of a Bill as important as this to start to apply special hours and sitting until 1 o'clock in the morning. One would have thought that the Government, having disgraced themselves in the Dáil with the guillotine, would have had second thoughts and would have reverted to a normal approach to this matter in the Seanad, but in less than two days they are introducing a suggestion that special hours should be introduced in the Seanad.  No explanation has been given and it will be very difficult to justify what they are attempting to do. <Col N="859" /> We have had remarks from the other side of the House that this was a game&mdash;some people were speaking and behaving over here as though it were a game.  If it is a game it is a game that this House is very familiar with.</P>
      <P>It is a game which Fianna Fáil, when they were in office, had to put up with for 16 years.  There have been many Bills in this House that went on, not for two weeks or two days, but for several weeks.  No matter how long the Opposition of the time went on filibustering, or playing the game that they seemed to know so well, Fianna Fáil allowed them to play that game until they were finished talking. Yet after a day and a half of this important Bill, we have this attempt to curtail the debate.  The Government are in office a little over a year.  The mind boggles at what this Government would be like after another year or two.  God forbid that they should last 16 years.  It would certainly be a totalitarian parliamentary system. They have been there for only a year.  Just let them try to restrain the arrogance which they are displaying about this Bill and let this Seanad sit the normal hours for at least two days.</P>

      <P>I should like to appeal to the Leader of the House to withdraw this motion.  This probably all came about because of the tea break.  Earlier today I agreed with Senator Sanfey that we should sit through tea but there was no mention at that time of sitting until 1 o'clock. If I had known that, I certainly would not have agreed to sit through tea.</P>
      <P>We have been accused by the Government of using delaying tactics here. The House has been sitting for 11 hours discussing the Bill.  Seven speakers have spoken from this side of the House.  The Minister also spoke in that 11 hours.  We could not be accused of delaying the Bill.  We have only about seven other speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a quick look through Seanad debates concerning the other Electoral <Col N="860" /> Bills which have been passed here&mdash; in 1959 and other years.  They took a lot longer in this House than this Bill and we were not the people who held them up at that time.</P>
    <P>It would be very unfair to expect the staff to stay on until 1 o'clock when there is no rush whatsoever about this Bill.  There should not be a rush but, perhaps, there is an election about to take place.</P>

I should like to quote the transcript of what took place this morning.</P>

It seems strange to me that a proposal such as the one that has come from the Leader of the House should come at all.  No doubt it will receive the support of the members of the Labour Party in the division that will take place.  In insisting that this House sit until 1 o'clock. Fine Gael and Labour are showing no consideration whatsoever for the staff of Leinster House.  They are showing no consideration for the officials of the House who have been here since 10 o'clock this morning, for the stenographers who have been here since 10.30 and who are now being forced <Col N="861" /> by Fine Gael and by Labour, the so-called protectors of working people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That last proposal is yet another example of the dictatorship which now exists in this State.  As every day passes we come more and more to the conclusion that the parties that have come together after 16 years of political starvation feel they have a God-given right to flout the democratic principles of this country.  I was dealing with the staff and the inconvenience that Senator O'Higgins's motion would cause them. Does Senator Halligan of the Labour Party consider it just that the Official Reporters attached to this House should be expected to work from 10 o'clock this morning until one o'clock tomorrow morning?  Does he believe that the ushers, who are continuously on their feet, should be forced to remain here when the Official Reporters, the remainder of the staff and all of us know perfectly well that there is no rush with this legislation?  Does Senator Halligan believe that the kitchen in Leinster <Col N="862" /> House and the waitresses in the diningroom and possibly the chef should be forced to continue working until one o'clock tomorrow morning?  Does he believe that the gentlemen of the Press, who have been here since ten o'clock this morning, should be compelled to work until one o'clock tomorrow morning to satisfy some peculiar whim of the Leader of the House and possibly of the Minister?</P>
      <P>I should like to know what is the urgency of this Bill.  This legislation will only become effective when the next general election is declared.  Are the Labour and Fine Gael Parties fighting so much or is the economy of this nation in such serious plight that the Taoiseach is afraid that he may have to dissolve Dáil Éireann at any time?  Supporters of the Government have assured us on numerous occasions that there will not be a general election for the next three-and-a-half years.  Bearing that in mind this means that this Bill should not be needed for the next three-and-a-half years.  There is no reason in the wide world why this House could not adjourn at the normal time this evening until after the Easter recess. One must naturally believe or accept, because of this undemocratic proposal of Senator O'Higgins, that the Government are in danger of falling.</P>
      <P>We all know that there are many members of the Fine Gael Party disturbed over the proposals for wealth tax and the taxation of farmers.  We all know that there are people in Fine Gael who would get rid of the hind tit of the National Coalition Government at any price.  It is common knowledge that the dreoilín pig sucking the sow is left the hind tit.  What this Dublin city Government may not fully understand&mdash;and Cork city as well&mdash;is that when this sow runs out of milk the dreoilín is in trouble from the hind tit. I believe, judging by the apparent urgency of this legislation, that the cream on the milk of the last Coalition Government is running dry and the dreoilin on the hind tit is in trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear that if it is necessary for this House to sit until one o'clock tomorrow morning this legislation is so urgent that it is the <Col N="863" /> intention of the Taoiseach to go to the country after Easter.  It is the duty of the Government to explain to the people exactly what is going wrong with the affairs of Government to justify this situation.  On the last occasion that these two parties were wedded, before the budget of 1957&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will have to refer to my notes because of the unexpected interruption.  I have things to say which I feel are of some importance and I would like to deal with them even at the risk of repetition.  At the same time, I get the feeling that all my suggestions or, indeed, any suggestions which were made from this side of the House, will be all in vain. The attitude of the Government side seems to be one of &ldquo;Let's get rid of this Bill as quickly as possible.&rdquo;  They apparently even resent the time that the Opposition are given to make what I would hope is responsible criticism. This is, of course, a deterrent at all times to anyone who wants to make a responsible contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, in some small way, dealt with the constituencies which I feel are not being given the representation to which they are entitled.  There are constituencies which from one end to the other exceed or are close to 100 miles in length.  It is unreasonable to expect that few public representatives could give such a constituency the attention it deserves.  It was said at one time that the function of a Deputy or a Senator was merely to legislate.  Perhaps that was the original intention but all of us are aware that a public representative's time is taken up not alone with legislating, or preparing for legislation, or doing one's homework so that he can contribute to a Bill, even though after all the <Col N="867" /> hours spent on homework in the hope that he might make a responsible contribution he is running the risk of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the sizeable constituencies in rural areas where we might have few representatives to look after the needs of the constituents.  It was said at one stage that I was guilty of repetition but I must do so to pick up where I left off.  It was said that the only function of Oireachtas Members was to legislate.  I do not, of course, subscribe to that view nor could I possibly subscribe to that view any more than any other Member here.  We are all aware that it is traditional in this country for Oireachtas Members to be approached to use their influence in many matters. It is refreshing when one meets a case of injustice or discrimination in some sense that the public representative can bring it to the notice of higher authorities.  They, irrespective of what party the representative may belong to, if they recognise the injustice and discrimination&mdash;or whatever it may be&mdash;do everything that is possible to rectify the situation.  That is one of the functions of a public representative. It has become traditional for public representatives to open an office or, as it is described now in political terms, &ldquo;a clinic&rdquo;, to deal <Col N="868" /> with the complaints of constituents. This work consumes many man hours. Generally the Oireachtas Member finds that he is fortunate if he has Sunday free to be with his family.  I am not at this stage attempting to describe what hard-working people we are or how over-worked we are.  I am making the point that the public representative in rural areas has always to be available to his constituents. That is part of his work.  He can also be the leader of his community in promoting matters that can only improve that community.  He is called upon to lead deputations relating to industry and often, as has happened to myself, has to travel far in his efforts to be a good representative.  Where you have constituencies, like my own, which is 40 or 50 miles long&mdash;and there are constituencies that are 70, 80 and, at least in one case, close to 100 miles long&mdash;these are the very constituencies in which a TD or a Senator can do so much good work for the community.</P>
      <P>One would think that the Minister and his advisers&mdash;and that includes his impartial advisers&mdash;would be promoting more representation in those areas so that the people would have the benefit of it.  Instead of that being the case, we have in this Bill a situation where Munster would be entitled &mdash;and one could argue about its entitlement on figures&mdash;to one more seat while the west, which is to be reduced by two seats rather than getting more representation, is having these seats taken away and given to the city of Dublin.  No one could argue against the increase in population in Dublin.</P>

      <P>I stressed the need for increased representation in rural areas.  I now wish to deal with the population increase in what might be described as greater Dublin.  Even though the population increase is a fact, and one cannot dispute it, I still <Col N="869" /> find it difficult to justify the Minister's decision to give increased representation to the city of Dublin.</P>
      <P>A representative's work in the city is quite different from the work of a representative in a rural area.  First of all he would not be more than three, four or five miles from the farthest point of his constituency.  He has the advantage of living at home. The rural representatives are away from their constituencies for two or three days at a time.  He also has a regular office system and can give the representation required to his people without any difficulty regarding travel with which the rural Deputy has to contend.  The Minister, as a rural Deputy, should have taken that into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Besides the work required of any representative there is also the work of preparation for those who want to participate in the debates in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is worthwhile work as far as the representative is concerned.  It is tiring but nevertheless a pleasure to give this type of preparation as much time as he can spare.  But what is frustrating is that having given that time to preparation and staying in the House all day waiting to make his speech, he should be accused of filibustering. That, in itself, is frustrating and annoying but it is particularly annoying when one takes into account the fact that the charge of filibustering was made at approximately 6 o'clock this evening and, at that time, we had been dealing with the Bill for a total of only 10½ hours, all the speakers from this side, for a total of 10½ hours. I would remind the Seanad that, when the House was dealing with the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1968, the debate lasted far in excess of 10½ hours.  My figures are in excess of 10½ hours.  I got them from a responsible official of the House.  I am not using them just because they are suitable but because I believe they are true figures.  However I got indications&mdash; not verbal indications&mdash;from the Government side of the House that my figures are not accurate.  If they are not accurate, I would be pleased to get a verbal account from any Member <Col N="870" /> of the Government side as to how many hours were spent in dealing with the 1968 Bill.  There being no offers, I must assume that the figures I have given are accurate.</P>

      <P>Since the last Seanad election I have held the position as Chief Whip of the Opposition group. As such, I was unable to speak as often as I would have liked in the House because I like to give every job I am doing as much time as I think it is worth.  I am going to deal only with what I consider to be important. I had various points which I could not make due to the interruptions at teabreak time.  I was pleased, even though we spent an hour dealing with the motion, that it gave the Minister an opportunity to have his tea and be back here again because it is he to whom we want to refer our points in the hope that he will take some of them into account and do something about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point that has been raised all day today and all day yesterday is why the urgency of this Bill, why the emergency.  Not one Senator, although all of them, by their very actions and by various things that they proposed, showed that there was an urgency.  In fact, they were nearly desperate to get this Bill through but not one of them has told us why.  We have been asked to sit this week. That in itself is unusual.  There is no precedent whatsoever for that.  They asked us to sit this week to deal with the Bill.  We cannot see anything urgent about it perhaps because we are not as politically wise as we should be.  What does this emergency, <Col N="871" /> this rush, this sense of urgency, this desperation mean?  We may not be wise enough to see that this, in fact, could mean something that would be hoped to take the country by surprise in the near future.  If that is the reason, I do not expect the Minister to tell us.  The fact that he is telling us nothing at all leaves us to form our own opinion on the matter.</P>
    <P>Another point was dealt with, not by me but by other people.  Members of this Government, when in Opposition, spoke about setting up a commission to deal with boundary changes.  I am not going to refer to Dáil debates or any other debates to prove this point because it is not at all necessary.  Why do the Minister and his colleagues&mdash;who promised that there would be a commission set up to deal with boundary changes &mdash;not do so now that they have the opportunity?  Is it because they were dishonest in their criticisms the first day?  Is it because they feel insecure in their present position or are they trying to consolidate their position in the fear that we may well have an election in the near future?  The reason they did not avail of the opportunity to use a commission for this purpose can only be because of the circumstances I mentioned&mdash;that they were dishonest in their criticisms the first day or they feel absolutely insecure in their present position or they are consolidating their position in the fear that there may be an election in the near future.  I believe the only possible reason they did not avail of the commission is that they wanted to use this Bill for their own political advantage.  On that point I have no criticism.  If they are using it for their own advantage, and if they say so, it is a political reality that we must accept.  We would find it difficult to criticise but we would accept it as being a political fact. However, do not insult our intelligence and that of our people by presenting imaginary pure motives for this Bill and not availing of the commission. Let us not say that we are doing it for pure motives in order to cloak the real motive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> The only part I picked out of the Minister's Bill which might, even in some little way, have been made use of by members outside the Government party was when he mentioned &ldquo;impartial advisers&rdquo;.  These are two words which mean absolutely nothing without the back-up of who the impartial advisers are.  They mean absolutely nothing otherwise.  Again this reflects the credibility gap.  When one promises something, one must fulfil that promise.  If, however, one cannot fulfil it people are always ready to accept an explanation.  We had a case recently of a Minister in the other House promising something on a certain date.  He was unable to fulfil his promise.  He said so.  He gave the reasons.  The people accepted those reasons because they were right reasons.  He was not getting the co-operation he needed.  He was, perhaps, hasty in giving dates and he admitted his weakness.  He was unable as a Minister to get the co-operation of the people involved and he admitted he made an announcement without the proper back-up knowledge.</P>
    <P>Honesty is the one thing that people are looking for at the present time. Certainly, honesty must always be seen in high places.  In that regard, I am referring to all of us, whether we be Deputies or Senators.  All society goes wrong when things are wrong at the top.  We have had examples of that in other countries where there would seem to be corruption&mdash;I am not suggesting there is corruption here&mdash;and society itself is being destroyed.  That is why we must be absolutely honest at all times&mdash;honest in speech and honest in action.  If a mistake is made at Government level, then admit that mistake and the explanation will be accepted.</P>
    <P>To suggest this Bill is brought in for other than political advantage, no matter what words one uses or how brilliantly one uses them, or what pure motives are suggested, if that is a lie then the people will see through it.</P>
    <P>Insincerity is not a word that I use lightly.  I have respect for any man in a Government position who seeks <Col N="873" /> to get work done, appears to be interested in his work, works hard and introduces new legislation.  My advice is to be sincere always in the reasons given for bringing in new legislation.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, who introduced the 1969 Bill, were accused by all sorts of people of doing all sorts of things. May we now accept, now that this Government, who were so critical of that Bill and who have now presented us with a similar Bill, carved up by their own hands for their own political advantage, that the Fianna Fáil Bill of 1969 was not so bad after all from their point of view?  Must we accept this now?</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand why &mdash;in this I am repeating myself&mdash; representatives and representation is being taken from rural areas.  I quite accept that the increased representation will do good in city areas.  I do not accept that, because it will do good in city areas, that justifies the taking away of representation from rural areas.  Many public representatives in city and country areas give all their time to working for those they represent and sometimes they get very little appreciation for what they do.  I appreciate that there are great representatives in the city of Dublin.  We have had some excellent men in this House.  We had Jimmy Dunne; he was one of the finest men that one could possibly hope to know in this House. It is the function of public representatives to lead and guide and help and I would hope that members of the Labour Party would think of Jimmy Dunne, of Jim Larkin and of the other great socialists of the past and the kind of work they did.  Some of these were people who never got any recognition, who were never public representatives in the sense of being Members of the Oireachtas or even county councillors.  I am including Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil people in all this.  I know one Labour man from my own constituency and I have no hesitation in saying that the work he did for the people in North Tipperary was never fully recognised and appreciated; I am speaking of Jack Murphy, a county councillor and a member of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="874" /> With representation being taken from country areas there will be less and less of these types of people available. Dublin may benefit.  I understand from people more knowledgeable than I am about the city of Dublin that the constituencies have been drafted in such a manner in the city of Dublin as will benefit only the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the reason for the three-seat constituencies in the city of Dublin is to protect and further the interests of the Labour Party.  That is something we will not or cannot criticise.  If the Minister says this is the reason he carved up the constituencies the way he did, we will not fault him, but I would remind the Minister that in Dublin he is dealing with a very sophisticated electorate.  In Dublin one is dealing with a very highly sophisticated electorate who have noticed, and are commenting on, this terribly important word, credibility. They are losing, as I understand it, faith and confidence in the present Administration.  Take care Minister that you have not created a monster because the Dublin people, as I meet them are deeply resentful of broken promises.  It could well be Minister that this is a monster you will find hard to live with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government side have decided to sit until 1 a.m. so I presume they have plenty of time to sit here.  Because I was speaking at the time the Government side moved that we sit until 1 o'clock I took it as a compliment that they did not want me to be curtailed in any way.  They considered my advice as something to be appreciated.  Now I see that the Government side meant it as a compliment when they moved the motion seeing that I was on my feet at the time.  However, I regret I cannot <Col N="875" /> speak until 1 o'clock and give the Government side the benefit of my advice and suggestions because there are some who apparently do not want to listen or to act even on responsible criticism of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Integrity in high places.  I have already dealt with integrity in high places.  Integrity must start in high places before one can expect integrity elsewhere.  I am serious about that.

    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>A point of explanation. I certainly respect the dignity of the House, but when there are interruptions it is difficult to continue.  I have suffered more than my share of interruptions tonight.  I am sorry to appear as if I am facilitating people here or inviting interruptions because I certainly do not intend to do so.  But I am dealing with a very serious Bill and I want to give consideration to every word that I use.  If I am slow in speaking or slow in presenting my case it is because I want every word to be fully understood; fully explained by me and fully understood by others.  It <Col N="876" /> is an important Bill.  Because I see weaknesses in the Bill I want to give consideration.  If I appear slow it is because of the consideration that I am giving to this ill and to each sentence that I utter.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with other constituencies.  The Minister has justified three-seat constituencies in Dublin but he changes the constituencies in Cork.  He justified the three-seat constituencies in Dublin on the basis that it is &ldquo;a built-up area&rdquo;.  What is Cork? Is that not a built-up area?  They were the words the Minister used and if I am misquoting him I invite him to tell me so at any stage while I am speaking.  I will not take it as being rudeness on his part if he interrupts me at any time.  I should like to be so advised because I should not like to misquote or deliberately misinterpret anything he says.  I certainly would not do the latter.  The Minister used the words &ldquo;built-up area&rdquo; to justify the three seats in Dublin.  What is Cork?  Is Cork not a built-up area?  Is that not the same thing?</P>
      <P>I have some figures to illustrate my point.  There is nothing new about them; the Minister knows them well. In Munster, excluding Clare, the population was shown in 1971 as 806,994, an increase in population of 21,257 since the 1966 census.  Having regard to the increase in population one might reasonably expect an increase in representation of one Deputy.  I charge in this instance that there was definitely a case of political bias.  There is no way that that can be explained away.  Because it was Cork and because Munster generally is known for the high esteem in which it holds the Leader of the Opposition, as was evidenced in the Mid-Cork by-election.  I presume everyone remembers that election.  It is political bias to deny the people of Munster one extra representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an increase in population of 13,180 in Cork city and county. The city area increased its population by 6,499, a total of 128,000 people live in the Cork County Borough area but only 100,000 of those will be represented in the new constituency, which is a five-seat constituency, <Col N="877" /> while 28,000 are being placed in the Mid-Cork area, which is a rural constituency. How does the Minister justify that?  There were two three-seat constituencies in Cork.  The Minister has justified placing three-seat constituencies in Dublin and I accept that because it is a built-up area he has a good point.  He says that was the main reason for his action in relation to Dublin.  Why does the same argument and the same principle not prevail in Cork?  Is it for the reason I mentioned, that is, the high esteem in which the Leader of the Opposition, together with the strength of the organisation in Munster?  I hope the Minister will show respect to me by replying to that question and explaining the reason for his action in so far as Cork is concerned.</P>
    <P>We have a situation in Cork where there is a population increase of 13,180, but there is to be no extra seat.  Yet in Dublin County Borough, Dún Laoghaire Borough and Dublin County, where in all there is an increase of 57,171, there are to be five extra seats.  In other words, for a little more than 10,000 Dublin County area is to get one more seat.  Rather than be misunderstood I shall repeat what I said: for an increase in the population of Dublin of 57,171 they are to get five extra seats.  In other words, for a little more than each 10,000, Dublin County area is to get one more seat.  Why then refuse a seat where there has been a population increase of 13,180 and grant five seats on the basis of one for a little in excess of 10,000 of an increase in population? If there is any way of explaining that away other than political bias, I should be delighted to hear it.  I have given it deep thought, I like to be fair and try to understand the weakness of people in Government but if I could find any reason that would justify their doing things of this nature other than political bias, I should be delighted and the reason for my delight would be because they are the Government.</P>

      <P>I hope that in all that I said I have said something useful, something the Minister will take note of and something that the Minister will act upon. I believe the Minister is a good man who would like to do a good job.  I hope that, despite the note of urgency, or emergency, or desperation attached to pushing this Bill through&mdash;particularly the note of emergency, or desperation from the Leader of the House when he proposed the motion that we sit until 1 a.m.&mdash;our amendments on the Committee Stage will be seriously considered.  The Leader of the House is without question a responsible man. He was responsible in Opposition; I hope he will be responsible when he is Leader of the House in Government, but he still has not explained the emergency, the desperation or the urgency attached to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of all that, I hope that on the Committee Stage the amendments we will propose to the Minister will be taken as being proposed for the right reasons, because we believe you cannot promote a regional policy in the EEC for underdeveloped areas on the one hand and deny them representation on the other hand.  That is dishonest in itself.  At the same time I repeat: never try to fool the Irish people.  They are too wise.  Take care. This Bill is being prepared for the next election.  When that will be I am not in a position to know; but when it does happen the contents of the Bill as we have read them here and the suggestions that the Minister has made will be law and the constituencies will exist as the map here shows.  The present Government are afraid to meet us again on the previous battleground, but we will welcome the opportunity of meeting them on their battleground.  The sooner this happens the better because we know the people <Col N="883" /> are tired of broken promises.  To try to fool them any further will widen the credibility gap even more, and God knows that is saying something.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, if I live long enough, to vote against the Second Stage of this Bill.  I propose to do so for a number of reasons.  The first is because of the total lack of any offer by the Government to take the whole business of drawing the constituencies out of the hands of political parties and put it into the hands of an independent commission. This point has already been made with considerable force by Senator Robinson.  At this point I should like to add my voice to hers, to echo the points she has made and to express my deep disappointment that the Government of which so much was expected should have fallen short in this respect.</P>
      <P>There is provision in the Constitution, which allows the Dáil to extend the lifetime of any Parliament up to a maximum of seven years.  At the moment legislation fixes the maximum lifetime of any Dáil at five years.  But if the kind of attitude we see in this Bill is any guide to the intentions of the Government I would not be at all surprised to see, on some pretext of national emergency, the life of the Dáil prolonged by legislation to the maximum allowed by the Constitution.  I hope I am wrong in this but the sort of attitude that is behind this Bill does not give me any great confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody looking at what is going on in this House or at what has gone on in the other House over the past few weeks would, I think, agree that very few people here have enhanced their reputations or the reputation of the institutions of government in this country.  If an outside observer had a sense of fair play he might derive a momentary sense of satisfaction from seeing a political party which had itself redrawn the constituencies twice, to my knowledge, to its own advantage, now after 16 years at the other end of a loaded stick.  Part of me shares that sentiment but the way in <Col N="884" /> which the punishment is being meted out and the lack of what the catechism used call &ldquo;a firm purpose of amendment for the future&rdquo; is something to be regretted.</P>
    <P>Even if it is admitted in terms of fair play that the present Government should have the right to try to redress the balance of the last two constituency revisions, it is not too much to ask that this Government should also make clear an intention to take the matter completely out of the hands of party politicians.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not present at the Minister's opening speech.  If he has already made such a commitment I should be delighted to withdraw the criticism.</P>
      <P>It is very unpleasant to say this about the Government, but I believe it to be true: firm and irrevocable steps to put the business of constituency redrawing and electoral management generally into impartial hands should have been part of the policy of this Government.  I know it is not part of the policy of this Government and it was not part of their election policy, so one can hardly accuse them of not fulfilling it.  But, at the same time, as the fair-minded Administration that people hoped it would be, many people would have reacted very positively to this kind of step.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I find myself with a considerable lack of sympathy for the crocodile tears that have been shed on this side of the House.  Perhaps &ldquo;crocodile tears&rdquo; is unfair; I am sure they are genuine tears.  From my very scanty understanding of the working of the Electoral Act tears will flow even thicker and faster at the next general election and there will be less of the crocodile about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that when they attempted to abolish proportional representation completely one of the proposals of the then Fianna Fáil Government was to take the whole business of redrawing of <Col N="885" /> constituencies out of the hands of the Government of the day.  I quote from a Tuairim pamplet which was published in 1959 the following précis of the proposal by the Government of the day:</P>
    <P>The Government, however, has provided, as part of its proposal, for the establishment of a Commission to decide on the constituency boundaries.</P>
    <P>This Commission is to consist of three TDs from the Government benches to be appointed by the Taoiseach, three TDs from the Opposition benches to be appointed by the Chairman of Dáil Éireann and a judge from the High or Supreme Court to preside over the Commission, and to be appointed by the President.</P>
    <P>We all know the fate of the attempt by the Fianna Fáil Government of the day to get rid of proportional representation. It is a black mark against that Government that having failed to get rid of proportional representation, they also failed to introduce into the electoral system the type of commission which they would have proposed for single member constituencies. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  I find it extraordinary that this commission should have been proposed by them for single member constituencies and rejected by them for multi-member constituencies. As I said, I have something less than total sympathy with the Senators who are shedding tears on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I have one minor point of objection to the Bill which I do not propose to go into in much detail.  It has often occurred to me that there are huge numbers of people who were born and achieved their maturity in this country and who have been forced by economic circumstances to leave this country and it is unfair that these people should be deprived of some sort of judgment on the political and economic system which has forced them often unwillingly out of their own country.  A Bill like this, the general title of which is &ldquo;An Act to provide for the number of Members <Col N="886" /> of Dáil Éireann and for the revision of constituencies and to amend the law relating to the election of such Members&rdquo; could and should have provided if not for a complete postal vote of Irish nationals who may be living elsewhere at least for a widening of the categories of postal vote which exist at the moment.</P>
    <P>One of the ironies of our electoral system was that when we held the referendum to join the Common Market a small but important group of people who were totally denied the exercise of the franchise were the members of our diplomatic missions in Brussels and elsewhere in Europe who had played a major part in negotiating the terms of entry and in providing information on which the policies of the Government of the day were based.  I choose only one of the more obvious anomalies.  At the moment only the armed forces are entitled to vote by post.  It seems to me that there is a very strong case for a general postal ballot for all Irish nationals wherever they may live and an even stronger case for at least a partial widening of the franchise to include people in other categories such as the diplomatic corps who are temporarily resident outside the country.</P>
    <P>Another objection which I have to the Bill is that it is a measure which effectively gives marginally less representation in the rural areas west of the Shannon compared with the richer and more populous areas on the east coast.  In the lifetime of the last two Parliaments it seemed strange to me that a country which is rapidly becoming industrial should have been dominated, electorally speaking and in terms of public representatives, by people from that part of the country where the population was dwindling and where the former activity was largely agricultural.  It seemed to me strange and anomalous that a rapidly industrialising country should still be ruled by a rural minority.  It does not make any sense to simply reverse that situation in the hope that two wrongs will make a right.  One of the unfortunate consequences of the way in which the tolerance mechanism has been used is to drive a wedge &mdash; an <Col N="887" /> even greater wedge than existed before &mdash; between country and city in Ireland.  There are enough divisions in Ireland already without adding more or reinforcing the ones that exist, in particular divisions based on the sort of area where you live or the sort of industry pursued.  This attitude is only likely to increase a sense of competition between the rural part of Ireland and the industrial, urbanised part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>At a time when we should be encouraging co-operation between both parts of Ireland, at a time when, perhaps, certain elements in the rural population are entitled to more help than ever before from their urbanised, more wealthy brethren, it seems very sad to me that we should be in danger of enacting something which will set these people at each other's throats.</P>
    <P>My final objection to the Bill relates to the organisation of constituencies, in particular to the way in which the Bill is effectively, in common with previous Bills introduced by other administrations, reducing the validity and effect of proportional representation. I should like to read a quotation from a book called <i>Elections Abroad</i> edited by David Butler which will show how the situation has been remorselessly developing over the past few decades.  The quotation is from the article in that book by Professor Basil Chubb dealing with the election in this country in 1957.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The 1947 revision left the Dáil with 147 members, elected from 40 constituencies (9 returning five members, 9 returning four members, and 22 returning three members). In 1923 there were 153 members and 30 constituencies and in 1935, 138 members and 34 constituencies. In other words, the three revisions have seen the number of members returned from each constituency drop from an average of 5.1 to 4.1 and then to 3.6.  Since it is generally recognised that &lsquo;the decisive point in PR is the size of the constituencies&rsquo;, the deliberate reduction in the size of constituencies, and in particular the dismemberment of all returning <Col N="888" /> more than five members was significant. It also was deliberate.</P>
    <P>In 1957, according to Professor Chubb's figures, the number of Members returned from each constituency was 3.6.  In 1974, according to my calculations, it has dropped even further to 3.5 something.  Certainly, that is what it was at that particular time.</P>
    <P>I should like to give added emphasis to this point by quoting what is perhaps one of the standard works on PR, <i>Election and Representation,</i> by James Hogan, then Professor of History at University College, Cork.  One of the phrases in Professor Chubb's essay is taken without acknowledgement from Professor Hogan's book.  The phrase reads:</P>
    <P>... the decisive point in PR is the size of the constituencies.</P>
    <P>Incidentally Professor Hogan pointed out that logically the best possible way of ensuring representation for everybody in the country in the fairest possible manner would be to have the entire country as one constituency. He did however recognise that there were certain practical difficulties in the way of organising this type of election and agreed that one had to depart from this system of full proportionality in order to reconcile the principle of numerical representation with the territorial principle.  Professor Hogan says:</P>
    <P>... the larger the constituency, that is, the greater the number of members which it elects, the more closely will the result approximate to proportionality.  On the other hand, the smaller the constituency, that is, the fewer the number of members which it returns, the more radical will be the departure from proportionality.  When the number of seats in a constituency is less than five there ceases to be a real proportionality between votes cast and seats obtained.  For example, in a constituency of three seats any party which polls more than 50 per cent of the total valid vote &mdash; 52 per cent will do &mdash; is certain to obtain two of the three seats.  From the <Col N="889" /> fact that in a three-member constituency the party obtaining a simple majority of the votes cast elects its candidates in the ratio of 2 to 1, it is evident that the three-member type of constituency is as near to the majority system as it is to PR proper.  This consideration has a significant bearing on the question whether the PR we have in Éire does not in fact represent a radical departure from the principle of PR. For it is to be borne in mind that since the Electoral Act of 1935 we have had as many as 15 three-member constituencies.</P>
    <P>The state of affairs which Professor Horgan is bewailing in which there were 15 three-member constituencies, has now changed greatly.  In the Bill presented to us today there are to be 26 three-seater constituencies.  The fact that he wrote at that stage that there were 15 three-seat constituencies means that 45 of the 137 seats of the Dáil are contested on a basis as near to the majority as to the proportional method of voting.</P>
    <P>Again, 26 multiplied by three is 78. We are now in a situation where, thanks to the Government's decision to have such a large number of three-seat constituencies, approximately half of the total number of seats have effectively been taken completely out of the PR system.  Approximately half the total number of seats might just as well be fought on the straight vote system as in this sham, which is proportional representation in name only.</P>

      <P>I am quite conscious of that.  I am also conscious that it <Col N="890" /> was again on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government.  As I say, in this respect, I see this Government in direct line of descent from Mr. de Valera and Mr. Lemass and I find it very strange.  This leads to one particular consequence of which I certainly would be very glad to have the Minister's opinion when he is replying to the debate.  It seems to me that the decision to utilise so many three-seater constituencies, especially in Dublin, betokens a belief on the part of the party of which the Minister is a member that they will invariably get at least one of these three seats.  It appears to me that there is another consequence which may or may not have escaped the Minister's attention and that is that if the system remains like this there is also the very strong possibility that his party will never get any more than one of these three seats.  It seems to me to be a recipe for remaining static.  If this is so, does it mean that the Minister's party have abandoned any intention they may have had of forming a majority Government? I can assure him that his partners in Government have not abandoned any such intention.  They would be far happier to form a majority Government than take part in a Coalition Government.  This is perfectly natural and, indeed, I would have every sympathy with anybody in any party who thinks this.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the mathematics of this exercise would, in return for some short-term gain, condemn the Minister's party to a permanently junior role in any Government in which they participate.  There has been considerable criticism of this within the Minister's own party, which he must be aware of; and, as a dispassionate outsider, I would be interested to know if the Minister thinks that my reading of this situation is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to the point I was making about the size of the constituencies, I should like to reiterate my total opposition to the slow, creeping growth in the number of three-member constituencies and the devastating consequences this has for representation in the country as a whole.  The whole benefit of proportional representation <Col N="891" /> has always been that it has given fair representation &mdash; certainly much fairer than many other systems &mdash; to minorities.  We are a country which has many minority problems. Are we going to get rid of all our minority problems by pushing them under the carpet of the three-seat constituency?  It seems to me that this is a time when we should, instead of pretending that minorities do not exist, instead of copperfastening our political system into a three-party system &mdash; two up and one down &mdash; we should be instead extending the proportionality of our electoral system, increasing the number of five-seat constituencies and bigger constituencies as part of a philosophy of democracy designed to ensure that minorities, however troublesome, however awkward to deal with, have an effective voice in the running of our country. I believe that the consequences for minorities of this slow erosion of the proportional representation principle will be disastrous.  Because of this, and because of the Government's unwillingness to put the whole matter into the hands of an impartial and permanent commission, I object to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputies in the Dáil and indeed my own colleagues in this House I welcome this opportunity to criticise this Bill.  I recall statements from Ministers in this Government and senior spokesmen in the Fine Gael and Labour Parties in regard to Electoral Bills brought before both Houses under Fianna Fáil Government in which they advocated &mdash; and when they got the opportunity they did not put it into effect &mdash; that a Commission should be set up, that the feelings and thinking of the people in regard to Electoral Bills would be governed and controlled by this commission, and that proposals would be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas to be passed.  They were given this opportunity to put their words into effect. They did not do that.  They have criticised Fianna Fáil Electoral Bills in the past as gerrymandering the constituencies, but I believe that this <Col N="892" /> Bill illustrates the greatest gerrymandering job that was ever done on the constituencies.</P>
      <P>Surprisingly, the Fine Gael and Labour Parties found themselves in Government and may still be a bit surprised that the Minister did not reflect on what he said when previous Electoral Bills came before the Dáil. I think he was one who did strongly advocate that a commission should be set up and that we should get away from the position in which the Minister for Local Government could rearrange the constituencies to suit his own or, as the case is now, their own political parties.</P>
      <P>I had the honour of representing Laois-Offaly in the Dáil from 1969 until the last general election.  If the Minister for Local Government, being a Labour Party man, was looking at Laois-Offaly in the context of how the Labour vote was ever going to fair there, he would ensure that some revision of this particular constituency of Laois-Offaly would take place.  In effect, what is happening in Laois-Offaly is that the Labour vote ensures the election of a third Fine Gael representative.  Perhaps the Minister or some spokesman from the Coalition Parties could say if this is Coalition policy.  When we have a Labour Minister for Local Government I would imagine that he should be looking to the interests of the candidates that stood for his Labour Party and, indeed, to the supporters in general in Laois-Offaly to ensure that at some time in future elections there would be a possibility of electing a Labour representative in a five-seat constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to representation in Laois-Offaly, I would say that for a period of at least 25 years a Labour representative was elected in successive general elections in the person of the late Deputy Davin.  In 1957, when we had a by-election on account of the late Mr. Davin's death, Fianna Fáil had a landslide victory, and what was noteworthy from the Coalition point of view was that in that by-election we just had one candidate, and he was a Labour candidate, the late Deputy Davin's son.  I wonder did the <Col N="893" /> Fine Gael organisation row in with the Labour organisation in trying to get that candidate elected.  I doubt it very much, looking back on that landslide result.  From 1957 to 1965, a period of eight years, Labour had no representation in Laois-Offaly.  They did get a Labour man elected in the general election of 1965.  He was beaten again in 1969, and we now find ourselves in the position in Laois-Offaly that the Fine Gael Party have the majority.  It is not a Coalition from a Fine Gael point of view.  They have three representatives.  I would imagine that the present Labour Minister for Local Government should have done something in regard to his own party in this constituency.</P>

With the next opportunity &mdash; which will not be too far away &mdash; Fianna Fáil will, I hope, hold three out of five.  As I say, whether there is a swing one way or the other, it will mean that never again will Labour have a chance of regaining a seat in Laois-Offaly.  The onus is on the Minister for Local Government to do something about this and he has failed his own party supporters and failed his own candidates who have stood loyally by the party down through the years.</P>

If you take Laois-Offaly as representative and if we had all five-seat constituencies and if the trend in regard to Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil was in all areas something similar to Laois-Offaly, the fact is that Labour would not have anyone representing them in Dáil Éireann.  It is as simple as that. The position is, as I have pointed out, that the future of the Labour Party in this constituency is nil.  They will never get anywhere.  I am within my rights in speaking of the constituency I come from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel a bit ashamed being a Fianna Fáil representative to have to come into the House and speak on behalf of the Labour supporters.</P>
      <P>In regard to the re-arranging of the constituencies in Dublin so that each constituency is now a three-seater, the Minister's hope is to consolidate the positions of Labour candidates.  As Senator Horgan pointed out, he could see Labour in most of those constituencies getting a seat but he could never see them improving themselves beyond that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not say that.  My own honest opinion is that a three-seat constituency is the nearest thing you can get to a single seat constituency. If there is a swing away from the present Government, which there is as we all know, and even allowing for the coalescing of the two major parties in the present Government the position may be &mdash; as Senator Hanafin pointed out &mdash; that the Minister may have created a monster for himself in regard to the future of Labour in the Dublin constituencies.  It is quite possible that a future election with a swing in the Dublin areas towards <Col N="895" /> Fianna Fáil would give us two out of the three seats.  I can guarantee the Minister that the third one will not be for the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>It all adds up to the Labour Party being swallowed up by Fine Gael. Making comparisons with the cities I have mentioned I have pointed out how things will work out in the city of Dublin.  You go to Cork which is the next largest city in the country and you find a different situation altogether.  Naturally, the Minister realises that Cork is Lynch country. Cork should be comparable with Dublin. In Cork the position is that we now have two five-seaters, a four-seater and one three-seater.  Here again I doubt very much if the Minister has done a good day's work because I firmly believe that Fianna Fáil have the majority in both the city and the country of Cork.  The Minister will get no increased representation by re-arranging Cork to this extent. In fact, the greatest piece of gerrymandering in the Cork area was that you now have an area of Cork City being taken into Mid-Cork.  I had reason to be in that constituency during the by-election.  It is farcical that a representative elected in Cork City would now have to represent Mid-Cork. I imagine that it would mean that he would have to travel in the region of 80 to 90 miles to represent one end of his constituency.</P>
    <P>Here again the people are well aware of the gerrymandering that has taken place in this Bill.  Knowing the Cork people as I do I feel quite certain that they are even more aware of this than others and when given the opportunity they will give the Minister and the Government their answer in regard to the gerrymandering carried out, particularly in the Cork area.</P>
    <P>The position in the west under this Bill is that the area is to lose two of its representative.  This, to me, is the real injustice in this Bill.  It is an area that is developing rapidly.  In the main, it is a rural area and an area in which it is very hard for a representative to get from one end of a <Col N="896" /> constituency to the other.  It is difficult terrain.  Why this type of area is to have less representation beats me. As others on this side of the House pointed out today when they asked the Members on the opposite side&mdash; particularly the Members from the west who would not open their mouths in this debate to speak&mdash;they are letting down the people they are representing in this House when by their silence they condone the attitude of the Minister and the Government in regard to the west.</P>
    <P>My own constituency is a rural area and I well know that in such areas there is much more work put on the representative in comparison with a city representative.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives the Dublin constituencies an increase of five.  To do his job properly a representative in the west may have to cover an area of 70 to 80 miles&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which would be a short journey, according to my colleague. The constituency of West Galway is 140 miles long.</P>
      <P>How can the Minister justify the fact that such areas are to lose out in representation and Dublin city, in particular, is to gain five seats?  The Minister is well aware that in most cases a Dublin representative can walk around his constituency in one or two hours, whereas in a constituency in the west it could take the representative nearly half a day to drive through it.</P>

      <P>It is up to the Minister to accept some of the amendments which we will put before him on Committee Stage, particularly with <Col N="897" /> regard to proper representation for the west.  His arm may have been twisted when he was drawing up the various constituencies.  I know he is an honest, straightforward and thinking man.  I would admire him a lot more if he accepted some of the amendments which will come before him and see to it that the injustice to the west as a result of this Bill will be rectified.  The onus is on him to do this.</P>
      <P>I strongly criticise the Fine Gael and Labour representatives from the west who have gone hand in hand with regard to the position in that part of the country.  I notice that this Bill tends towards better representation in urban areas.  The rural areas are being neglected on that score.  There are many Fine Gael and Labour representatives in the Dáil and Seanad, particularly those from rural areas, who deep down know that this is the case.  They have lain low and have not come into the open and expressed their feelings.  The local representatives in Dáil Éireann have let down their constituents in so doing.  The onus was on them to ensure that the west would not lose two representatives through any Electoral Bill.  What I am trying to get across is that areas such as the west need more representation instead of losing what they already have.</P>
      <P>There must have been a lot of gerrymandering in regard to the drawing up of constituencies in the west, when you take into account the significant increase in population in the west, particularly in the city of Galway.  The Minister has managed through this Bill to get away with giving an area which is entitled to more representation, two representatives less than they had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in population in Cork is 13,180, and there is still no increase in representation.  Dublin increased in population from the previous census to the tune of 57,000 and get five new seats.  Surely, on that basis alone, Cork should be entitled to an increase of one seat at least.  West of the Shannon the population is 574,254, which justifies 30 seats.  The position <Col N="898" /> is &mdash; I am not sure of the figure &mdash; that the people in that area have to settle for something in the region of 27 seats.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency of Laois-Offaly, the Minister is neglecting his own party supporters.  I feel that he is neglecting them not alone in Laois-Offaly, but in every rural constituency throughout the country with the exception of West Galway.  There they are trying to consolidate a seat for Senator Michael D. Higgins.</P>

      <P>I am not sure, but it is the Galway Higgins.  He referred to him as the pal of the Minister.  There will be no mix up when a future general election comes around.  People are not that gullible.  They will see in effect what the Minister and the Government are trying to do through this Bill and that they are trying to consolidate their own parties and help their own personnel.  As is the case in Laois-Offaly there will be a revolt against the coalescing aspect of Fine Gael and Labour.  People are not going to come out and vote one, two and three Fine Gael and four Labour to ensure that a Fine Gael man is elected in any area.</P>
      <P>My own honest opinion of the feelings and thoughts of the vast majority of the Labour supporters is that they would like to have Labour representation. That does not mean Fine Gael representation from their point of view.  This is the case in my own constituency. A Labour representative may happen to get elected in another five-seat constituency, -Carlow-Kilkenny, but there is no guarantee that the Labour Party man in that constituency will hold that seat.  The thinking of the people seems to be that they are not, by voting Labour, going to ensure the election of any Fine Gael representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Senator Horgan summed up where the Labour Party were going when he said that the Labour Party would eventually play a very junior role in our political life.  The present Minister for Local Government is not <Col N="899" /> very farseeing politically.  If the Coalition were returned at the next general election my own honest opinion is &mdash; and I am sure that the Minister for Local Government would agree with me &mdash; that the Labour representation will not be as strong as it is at present. Because of the Minister's creation in Dublin Labour could fare very badly indeed in Dublin constituencies at future general elections.</P>

      <P>The trend was that, when they had a surplus of votes in Wicklow County, they were moved into Dublin.  I say this to substantiate the fact that Dublin will get an increase of five seats through this Bill. Here again is a tendency towards demoralising the rural constituencies. Personally I feel that Wicklow is and should be a rural constituency.  Some Wicklow people will have to vote in Dublin.  This is the trend of the thinking of the Minister and the Government who wish to downgrade the rural areas and to ensure that the urban areas get the left-overs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again the opportunity will be taken by the electorate in the next general election whenever it comes, to show how they feel.  Rural areas and rural people are very sensitive when anyone tries to change their way of life. We were all brought up and reared in the rural way of life.  I know that the Minister also comes from a rural area.  This Bill affects the rural constituencies: they cannot see their Oireachtas representation improving. There is no increase in representation in this Bill for any rural constituency. We have four extra seats, making it now 148.  The west loses two seats and here again Dublin reaps the reward. It has been the thinking of most politicians on all sides that everything in this country is too centralised round the city of Dublin.  When an Electoral Bill such as this presents an opportunity to do something about this, we find the Minister and the <Col N="900" /> Government ensuring that the rural areas have no hope of extra representation. That is the summing-up of it: there is no increase whatever in representation for rural areas.

      <P>I will not detain the House much longer on this Bill, because it is one of the greatest pieces of gerrymandering that has ever been witnessed by either House of the Oireachtas.  I hope that the Minister, after hearing various speakers from this side of the House, will consider some of the amendments that will be tabled on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>By accepting some of them he may ensure that the people <Col N="902" /> in the rural areas will not have the feeling that they are being neglected by this Bill, and that it is very much urbanised.  It is a Bill that will ensure and consolidate the election of Coalition candidates.</P>
      <P>I shall finish on the note that, when the next general election comes around, in Dublin in particular, the sway will be towards Fianna Fáil. Labour particularly will suffer and the National Coalition will suffer by what they are doing in this Bill.  They will suffer more so in the rural constituencies and, irrespective of what the Government parties think, I am quite confident that, when given the opportunity, the people will give them their answer in regard to this Bill and see to it that Fianna Fáil are returned to power.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate until I was quoted rather extensively by Senator McGlinchey on the question of constituencies.  In the past I took rather an active part in the debate which, at the time, was indeed, a very drastic and gerrymandered effort by the then Minister, Mr. Kevin Boland. It was aimed at undoing the verdict given so decisively two years previously on the Referendum on the amendment of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should look at the Bill in perspective. It has to be in accordance with the Constitution, which lays down that when census reports are available due note should be taken of them in adjusting the boundaries of the constituencies as required.  When the present Government came into power, Fianna Fáil had already embarked on that task and a Bill was available setting out what they intended to do.  Therefore, I do not see why there is all the fuss and excitement about this Bill.  It is largely just playing around with the three and four-seat constituencies in a way that will lose some of the advantages which the previous subdivision gave to the Fianna Fáil Party.  I suppose the Minister is entitled to some advantage from that; that is in accordance with what is expected.  Indeed, three-seat constituencies, while they appear to <Col N="903" /> give some advantage can act decisively against the majority party when the vote swings.  The situation can quickly change from having two out of three to having one out of three.</P>
    <P>The Government did not have much time to do anything.  There was an ongoing Bill there which had to be brought in rather speedily.  If an election was called &mdash; and an election is likely at any time with the slender majority of the Government &mdash; it would have to be fought on the old constituencies.  It was obviously necessary for the Government for practical reasons to bring in the Bill as quickly as possible.  We have to look to the future, to think and plan for a drastic revision of our whole approach to this.  In our approach to it, if we look at Northern Ireland, we see what we applauded there.  We applauded the large, multi-seat constituencies, the seven and the nine-seater constituencies, that have been created there. That is the pattern we require to aim at in the future, where we aim at representing the various strands of opinion in Parliament.</P>
    <P>Having said that, we must also look at the other side.  We were very familiar with the argument in the PR campaign of the almost inhuman burden of work that the present arrangements place on Deputies. Obviously we could not contemplate larger constituencies than three-seaters until such time as all parties combined and faced up to the task of studying how the burden of work on public representatives could be lightened.  It must be lightened; it cannot continue as it is.  There will have to be drastic development which will mean that individual Deputies will have to be provided with office facilities and full-time, paid secretaries, in their constituencies, to deal with most of the representations made to them as Deputies.  Deputies would then concern themselves only with what would be referred to them by their secretaries. That is what we must aim at but it calls for a great development. It would be well worthwhile if, on the one hand, we could lighten the task of the Deputies, give them more time <Col N="904" /> for parliamentary work and, at the same time, broaden the representation base of our Parliament.  Then we would have achieved a lot.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if he would consider setting up in the near future a joint committee, or an all-party committee, to look at this specific task and at the task also of aligning the system broadly with the multi-seat constituency system that has proved successful in the North.  When this comes about I suggest there should then be a constituency commission to draw the boundaries.  If there are large constituencies there should be no need to redraw the boundaries from time to time.  A seven-seater constituency today would have a population of 140,000.  The only adjustment necessary in that area, as the population increased or decreased, would be to round off the figures by dividing, say, the total population on the census by the number allowed per Deputy &mdash; say 20.  It could be rounded to the nearest whole number.  If the figure were 7.6 or 7.7 it could be rounded up to 8 and the constituency gains a seat.  On the other hand, if it went down to 6.2 or 6.3, the constituency obviously loses a seat.  The whole thing could be made automatic.  There would be no use tinkering around at present with the three or four-seat arrangement.  We certainly could not go to a system of five-seaters, much as we would like it, without giving the necessary aid to Deputies to carry out their work.</P>
    <P>We must also look at the matter of Deputies who are members of the European Parliament and who are discharging a very vital role in representing our country in Europe.  We must see how these fit in.  In large-seat constituencies, they should be entitled to automatic re-election.  But we must study this.  In short, there are a number of problems to be gone into but it is not reasonable to blame the Government for not having solved all of them in their first year of office, especially when they could not be expected to have got down to the planning of investigation necessary to carry it out.  This work must be carried out on an all-party basis.  I suggest <Col N="905" /> that this Bill, by and large, is as good as can be had at this stage.  I am expressing my own hope, and I think, the hope of all parties, that we will now get down to tackling the system and try to evolve a system which, on the one hand, will give a very wide measure of representation through large constituencies&mdash;I would suggest seven-seat uniform representation&mdash; and, at the same time, reduce the inhuman burden our Deputies carry today.  As an Independent, I marvel how they stand up to the work imposed on them.  Everyone wants to see his TD, whether it is in regard to an old age pension, a grant or a letter that has not been replied to and all this has to be tackled.  We have not modernised our system and it needs modernisation.  The Minister might indicate his agreement, at least in principle, with setting up an all-party committee of the Dáil to study these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I was rather amused to hear Senator Quinlan describing himself as an Independent Senator.  In the speech that he has just delivered, he has shown once again that he is anything but an Independent Senator; that he never supports anything that Fianna Fáil have done and never opposed anything that Fine Gael have done.</P>
      <P>He mentioned voting with us.  I once wasted my time&mdash;I admit it was a foolish exercise but I did it for what it was worth&mdash;looking through the division lists.  I got as far as 120 divisions and then I got tired.  In all of those 120 divisions the Senator voted only once with Fianna Fáil and that time, I suspect, it was by accident. However, leaving aside the question of Senator Quinlan who, on the last occasion, spoke eloquently in favour of having a commission to arrange the constituencies, on this occasion, because a different Government are in office, he was not going to bother coming in at all until Senator McGlinchey quoted him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We get then to the rather extraordinary&mdash;I think quite unprecedented &mdash;background to this Bill.  We must remember that this Bill, which has, of course, been in preparation with a <Col N="906" /> good deal of assiduity for some 12 months now, has been hailed not merely by Coalition supporters but also by the newspapers, particularly those friendly to the Coalition, as a means by which the Coalition hope to copperfasten their hold on the country and, as <i>The Irish Times</i> said in relation to the Bill, they hope to remain in office for many years to come.  It is this background to the Bill that is so unusual.  It has been hailed almost openly, almost frankly, not as an exercise in re-arranging the constituencies to meet the constitutional formalities but as a political gesture on the grand scale.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks we have had the progress of this Bill through the Dáil ending with the guillotine motion in the Dáil last week and the rushing&mdash;I can only describe it as rushing&mdash;of the Bill into the Seanad in the middle of Holy Week at one week's notice. This meeting in Holy Week is quite unprecedented.  The only other time we may have met&mdash;I do not remember it, but I believe there was such an occasion&mdash;was a one-day meeting on a Tuesday of Holy Week to deal with a Money Bill which was urgent and had inevitably to be dealt with before the end of March.  A Bill of this kind of no great urgency has certainly never been brought before us in Holy Week.  It is the custom to take a recess of two weeks on each side of Easter.  This tradition, going back as far as my memory goes, has been broken with this Bill which, as the Minister said in the Dáil, has no urgency whatever but has been rushed into the Seanad.  We were told officially by the Coalition that we were to meet three days this week&mdash; Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday&mdash; in order to deal with this Electoral (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    <P>We meet here on Tuesday and debate the Bill.  We meet here on Wednesday, debate the Bill, and, half way through Wednesday, we suddenly find a Government rush to get the Bill through today.  We have this very strange decision in the middle of what had been advertised and officially announced to all Senators as a threeday sitting to deal with this Bill.  We have the even stranger and apparently <Col N="907" /> officially inspired silence by Government Senators.  I do not want to sound like the &ldquo;old man of the sea&rdquo;, constantly dredging up memories of past years but, as far as my memory goes, I cannot remember such a scene.  I do not know if the Minister was referring to the last time a Bill of this kind was discussed in the Seanad but he was so unwise as to mention this earlier so I took the precaution of looking it up.  If the Minister is really interested in the Second Reading of what one might describe as the &ldquo;Boland Bill&rdquo; there were eight speeches from the Coalition parties and six from Fianna Fáil, which is about average for a Bill of the kind. We must, apparently, be looking at different Bills and I suggest the Minister takes another look at it.</P>
    <P>I never remember an occurrence of this kind.  The debate in question took place in the Seanad in March, 1968. The opening speech&mdash;I am referring the Minister to this&mdash;was made by the Minister, Mr. Kevin Boland.  Senator Garret FitzGerald made the opening speech for the Fine Gael Party, followed by Senator Miss Davidson for the Labour Party, followed by Senator Sheehy-Skeffington for the Independents, followed by Senator McElgunn of Fianna Fáil, followed by Senator Quinlan&mdash;who, of course, spoke on that occasion because it was a Fianna Fáil Government were introducing the Bill and he had to oppose it&mdash;followed by Senator Nash of Fianna Fáil, followed by Senator Rooney of Fine Gael and Senator D.J. O'Sullivan of Fine Gael&mdash;he spoke for quite a long time&mdash;followed by Senator Seán Ó Donnabháin of Fianna Fáil, Senator Crowley of Labour and Senator Murphy of Labour, followed by Senator McHugh of Fine Gael&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It did not take very long.  I propose to draw the Minister's attention to certain aspects of his Bill which I think are unprecedented.  Mr. Kevin Boland's Bill certainly was in no sense a gerrymandering exercise on a par with the Minister's Bill.  I was diverted by the nod from the Minister; these nods are very significant. Indeed, it is rather dangerous for the Minister to nod because all kinds of things can happen.  We have an extraordinary situation in this debate. I repeat again that, in my memory, this situation is unprecedented; we have had on a Bill of this importance the whole Government party sitting there, saying absolutely nothing except for making a few interjections from time to time, but not one of them made a speech.</P>

      <P>I was referring to Senator Horgan who spoke of what he looked upon as the crocodile tears of the Opposition about this Bill.  I was not quite clear what he meant by crocodile tears but I took it that his general line was, well after all did not you do the same thing when you were in power.  The point I make in reply is that this is the only occasion in which a Bill of this kind was discussed in the newspapers on the basis of the extra seats that the Government of the day hope to get as a result of it.  The entire discussion of this Bill in the public Press, including the public Press friendly to the Minister, has been on the basis of the number of seats which they think the Government would win&mdash;and, mind you journalists are almost always wrong about these matters. The discussion all through has been about the number of extra seats that these newspapers think will accrue to the Government as a result of this exercise in legalised gerrymandering. This has never happened on any previous occasion.  It certainly did not happen with regard to the 1968 Bill. My answer, therefore, to Senator Horgan is that it is not a case of crocodile tears; it is simply a case of justified disgust at the type of exercise the Minister is indulging in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing we have to consider with any Bill of this kind is the obvious <Col N="910" /> point; why is such a Bill necessary? As we all know the Constitution provides that there must be a redistribution of constituencies at least once every 12 years.  As a result of the decision of the High Court we now are in the position that successive Governments have apparently felt obliged, on the basis of legal advice, to make these changes after every census, which in fact take place every five years.</P>
    <P>This is a point which is not directed at any particular Government; it is a general thought I had about these things.  But we are now in a position of extreme inconvenience as a result of that High Court decision.  It is obviously inconvenient, and I accept that now.  I will have many criticisms to make of the Minister's decisions with regards to this Bill, but obviously one must accept that a Bill of this kind involves any Minister with very great problems and difficulties.  These difficulties, these complexities, now recur at approximately five-year intervals. Not only that, but we have the suggestion made by the court, not as I understand it the decision&mdash; though the Minister tended to refer to it as a decision, even as a decision of the Supreme Court on one occasion in the Dáil last week&mdash;it was a kind of <i>obiter dictum</i> of the High Court that perhaps 1,000 up or 1,000 down from the average figure would be about right for the tolerance.</P>
    <P>This seems to be an altogether too small figure.  As far as I know there is no other country in the world that has constituencies of our kind; there is no country that arranges its members in constituencies with a tolerance range as small as that.  It is ludicrously small. It involves us in this ridiculous exercise of topping up counties, adding a hundred here and taking a thousand off there.  Not only does it involve this kind of thing but it also means that frequently, where a county might be perfectly well off within its normal boundaries, just because there are 500 too few or too many one has to start all over again changing the county at maybe five-year intervals instead of, perhaps, another five if the tolerance was somewhat larger.</P>
    <P>I had often thought that it would <Col N="911" /> be worthwhile for some Government putting a Bill of this kind through the Dáil and Seanad with a somewhat larger tolerance&mdash;perhaps from 18,000 to 22,000&mdash;a tolerance based on traditional county boundaries, rivers or natural formations, a tolerance one could stand over on that type of basis. Then before the President signed it it could be sent to the Supreme Court to see if it was all right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supreme Court have ruled on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that they were sent the Bill and said that this was all right.  I did not understand that they said that this was the limit and the Minister could not go beyond that.  That is my understanding of it. In other words, the Bill was sent to them with this 1,000 tolerance and they said this was a good Bill.  There was an election coming up at that time and it was a very rapid job.  I feel that if a Bill had been sent up with 18,000 to 22,000 and worked out properly, I suspect they might have accepted it.  However, it is a highly academic point because we are faced with the position of having these ridiculously small tolerances of some 19,000 on the one hand and some 21,000 on the other.  I will accept completely that this causes difficulties.  It makes it impossible to adhere completely to county boundaries but that is the limit we are working inside. This was the problem, therefore, the Minister had to face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question arises of precisely what type of policy the Minister should have set himself.  He said at the beginning of his speech that this Bill proposes to fix the total number of Members of Dáil Éireann and to revise the Dáil constituencies in order to take account of the increase in population and of the changes in the distribution of population as recorded by the census taken in April, 1971.  To my mind that is precisely what he has not done.  If he had he would have left county boundaries as near as possible to what they were before making such changes as were necessitated by changes in population.  He has, in fact, <Col N="912" /> done quite the opposite.  In various parts of the country the changes in population were quite small&mdash;in one or two cases they were substantial&mdash; but in the vast majority of cases the changes were quite small.  The Minister has taken advantage of these small changes in population to make very radical alterations in constituencies throughout the country, including alterations in a number of constituencies which did not require alteration at all and which under the close tolerances by which we are now bound could have been left alone.  In spite of this the Minister has taken these constituencies and others which required very minor changes and has started from scratch changing the entire constituency set-up of the country for purely narrow party political advantage.</P>
    <P>I am again referring to the crocodile tears of Senator Horgan.  This is an approach to a Bill of its kind which has never, in fact, been used before on this scale.  There are many examples.  Take first of all the situation in Dublin city.  One thing about the borough of Dublin is that its total population in the five years from the census in 1966 to 1971 increased by 64.  Taking the borough of Dublin the convenient situation was that there was no need whatever to take in from outside.  It was a self-sufficient entity and it was a matter merely of reorganising the constituencies in the city of Dublin.  We find, looking at these present constituencies still in existence until the next general election, that in the case of Dublin North-West and Dublin South-Central, only very minor changes would have been required to leave them as they are at present.  In the case of Dublin South-West slightly greater but still very minor changes would have been needed while in Dublin South-East only minor changes were needed.  The really substantial change was needed in Dublin North-East which has had a very big increase in population and needed to lose around 28,000 votes.</P>
    <P>This would have involved substantial additions and losses in both Dublin North-Central and Dublin Central.  The majority of the constituencies <Col N="913" /> in the city of Dublin could have been left relatively unchanged.  Of course, the Minister has not done this.  The Minister, as we know, has divided Dublin city into three-seat constituencies.  I have the impression, and here I think he is quite wrong, that he is misjudging the air of frustration that exists among the people of Dublin about the policies or lack of policies of this Government&mdash;the constantly rising prices, the breach of undertakings given and so on.  Nonetheless, he has divided Dublin city into nine three-seat constituencies under, I think, the rather innocent impression that this would result in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour each having 13 seats.  It is very significant that by some sort of accident of fate, if one can use that term, my own constituency of Dún Laoghaire, of all the 14 constituencies of Dublin city and county, has four seats, not three.  The population of Dún Laoghaire in the 1971 census was 98,000 odd. The Minister does not need me to tell him what that means.  It means that without any alteration whatever in the existing boundaries of the constituency of Dún Laoghaire it could have been made into a five-seater as he made Cork into a five-seater.  This, of course, would not do.  I said from the start, when the Minister was framing this Bill, knowing the kind of attitude with which this Bill was being approached, that the one constituency in the entire country which would not be changed under any circumstances would be Dún Laoghaire.  If it were made a three-seater, the result would be a loss for the Coalition whereas to bring it up to five seats would mean a Fianna Fáil gain.  Therefore, it must be left a four-seater. It could have been left with its existing boundaries and five seats.  But it is the odd one out.  All the other constituencies in the Dublin area are three-seaters but not Dún Laoghaire.  This is the procedure of the Minister who claims, whether he expects to be believed I do not know, that this has been an operation conducted solely in accordance with the Constitution; solely in accordance with the requirements brought about by changes in population, giving fair play to all, treating all areas equally.  This is the <Col N="914" /> attitude that the Minister would like us to think he has had.  I would like to know why the simple straightforward step was not taken of leaving Dún Laoghaire with its existing boundaries and allowing changes in population to take their effect by simply adding one seat.</P>
    <P>We can go to Cork.  I am sorry Senator Quinlan is not here because he is a great champion of the rights of all Cork men.  The Minister, in the course of his speech, pointed out that Cork was one of the few counties which was self-sufficient in the sense that the population was such that it did not need the addition of territory or the loss of territory to other areas. Its population, while it changed, did not change very drastically.  It increased from 339,713 in 1966 to 352,883 in 1971&mdash;an increase of about 13,000, which on a marginal basis could have been said to justify an extra seat but it was legitimate to say: &ldquo;No, we leave it with the existing number of seats.&rdquo;  The Minister, in fact, did not leave the Cork constituencies the way they were.  In 1971 the two existing Cork city constituencies each had a population of about 64,000, marginally over the allowable number for three seats each.  Mid Cork and North-East Cork had again about 1,000 more than the marginal amount allowable to keep their four seats in each case.  South-West Cork while it was within the Constitution limits was somewhat below the average for the country as a whole.  All that was needed in Cork was to hand over a couple of thousand votes from Mid Cork and North-East Cork to South-West Cork and thus give a very small marginal addition of votes from the two city constituencies to the various county constituencies. Very little change was needed in Cork.  The Minister who was, in fact, observing his constitutional duty to make such changes as were required by the Constitution provision and changes in population, could have dealt with Cork city, borough and county by making very minor changes.  Indeed, this would have been in accordance not only with the constitutional principles he should have followed, but the two three-seat constituencies <Col N="915" /> in Cork city fitted in very well with his principle of dividing Dublin into three-seat constituencies. This, of course, is not what he did.</P>
    <P>Cork city, which has had an increase in population of 6,500 since 1966, has gained 6,500 votes in the five years and has had a seat taken from it.  From the city of Cork some of the most historic and oldest parishes were taken such as St. Finbarrs, The Lough, Ballyphehane and Togher.  Nearly all the corporation housing estates were pushed into Mid Cork away from Cork city.  University College, Cork is now in the area of Mid Cork and not Cork city. There is an enormous wedge of Mid Cork sticking way up almost into the centre of the city of Cork.  This is a procedure which could be justified under other circumstances if there was no alternative to it.  These things sometimes happen under this unfortunate, very close tolerance with which we have to work.</P>
    <P>In the case of Cork county, there was absolutely no necessity for any radical changes, solely the Minister's feeling that whereas Fianna Fáil in the two three-seat constituencies of Cork city gained two votes out of three in each case, clearly they could only get three out of five.  Further the Minister had the feeling that whereas it was difficult for the candidates of his own party to get a quarter of the votes necessary for a quota in a three-seat constituency it would be considerably easier for them to get one-sixth of the votes to gain a quota in a five-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>This to my mind is an indefensible piece of gerrymandering.  In replying I would like the Minister to tell us openly and straightforwardly why he divided Cork borough and Cork county in this fashion?  I do not want smart cracks or anything like that, or remarks about what anybody else did or could have done.  I would simply like an answer.  Why was Cork dealt with in this way?  When the city of Cork had an increase of 5,500 in population why was a seat taken from it?  Why is this enormous wedge of <Col N="916" /> Mid Cork put into Cork city?  Is it not simply an exercise in political gerrymandering?</P>
    <P>We can go on from Cork to the interesting situation in Clare-Galway. We have heard a good deal about that already today.  The population of County Clare in 1971 was 75,008. The addition of another 1,000 or so votes would, in fact, be adequate to give four seats.  The Minister told us, even as late as yesterday, how anxious he was to preserve county boundaries as much as possible.  All he had to do with Clare was to take 1,000 votes or so out of Galway&mdash;even 1,500&mdash; and there was a perfectly good constituency with four seats.</P>
    <P>What did he do instead of that?  He shoved a very large part of Clare, going down to within a couple of miles of the county town of Ennis, into West Galway, making in geographical terms an impossible constituency.  All the way down from Ennis through Galway city and way up into Connemara, into Clifden and the islands beyond is an impossible constituency. You have a very large number of Clare people pushed into a neighbouring county instead of the very small number it would have been necessary to bring from outside into Clare.  The reason, as we all know, was that it was feared that in a four-seat Clare constituency Fianna Fáil might get three seats, whereas in a four-seat West Galway constituency Fianna Fáil would presumably only get two.  There was also the possibility&mdash;a possibility that many people doubt very much and I am inclined to agree with them &mdash;that the Minister's own party might gain a seat.  At any rate Fianna Fáil clearly would have great difficulty getting three out of four in West Galway. Even there I think the Minister might be surprised.</P>
    <P>There again you have an operation which in no way could be justified on the basis of the Minister's brief, on the basis of the spirit of the Constitution, or on the basis of what the Minister should be doing.  The Minister should be making the minimum necessary changes, keeping as closely as possible to county boundaries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="917" /> We have an even more interesting situation if one takes the west as a whole.  A number of Senators, particularly those from the west, have complained about the Minister taking two seats from that area.  There have been the smart cracks from our silent brethren opposite.  They say that it was the incompetent Fianna Fáil Governments during 16 years who lowered the population of the west and so on and as a result lost some seats.</P>
    <P>The interesting thing is that in Galway and Clare as a result of the happy and beneficial results of Fianna Fáil policy the population has not been falling.  It has been rising.  The Minister's attitude to these rises in population and the unfortunately still falling population in other parts of the west has been very interesting.  We have the position that in Clare the population rose by 1,400&mdash;I will not quote the exact figures because it complicates things too much, but I can if anyone wants them.  These are rounded figures.  In Galway the population rose by about 900 in the five years from 1966 to 1971.  In these two areas combined the population went up and the Minister has taken a seat from them.</P>
    <P>In Mayo, on the other hand, in the same period the population went down by 6,000 and the Minister has left them with six seats.  I do not want to be misunderstood on this.  I think that whatever his reasoning may have been the Minister was right; a far flung, very remote, very large and thinly populated constituency like Mayo should have been left six seats. Nonetheless it seems significant that in an area such as Mayo, where the Fine Gael Party are very strong, they are left with six seats in face of a falling population of 6,000.  On the other hand in Clare-Galway, where Fine Gael are weak and Fianna Fáil very strong and where there is a rising population the Minister takes a seat from them.</P>
    <P>You have the position also in the counties of Leitrim, Sligo and Roscommon.  The population of Leitrim fell by some 2,200 votes in the five years.  In Sligo it fell by 1,000 and in Roscommon it fell by 2,700. <Col N="918" /> This is a pattern of falling population in each case.  As we know, the existing representation of Sligo-Leitrim was left the same as the existing representation of Roscommon-Leitrim. Going further north-west, the population of Donegal was static &mdash;it fell by a mere 205, so for all practical purposes, there was neither fall nor rise in the five years, but a seat was taken from them.</P>
    <P>Donegal, also, I need hardly say, is an area where Fine Gael are weak. So, in Clare, Galway, and Donegal, the population is either rising or static and the Minister deprives them of seats.  In Mayo, Sligo-Leitrim and Roscommon, where the population is falling, sometimes quite rapidly, the Minister leaves them with their existing representation.</P>
    <P>Let me take some of the constituencies in more general terms.  There were 21 constituencies in the country that on the basis of the census of 1971, could have been left unchanged.  They were within the narrow tolerances that we are now allowed.  I accept that, taken individually, each of these 21 constituencies could have been left unchanged.  Naturally, there was a possibility that as a result of changes which were made inevitable elsewhere some of these constituencies might have had marginal changes required in them.  These 21 if taken by themselves could have retained their existing representation and their existing boundaries.  What did the Minister do?</P>
    <P>In nine of the 21 he completely changed the constituencies.  In the case of eight, he changed the whole basis of representation&mdash;he either took a seat from them or added a seat.  In the case of one, Clare, as I have already mentioned, while leaving them three seats for reasons which we all know, he entirely changed the geographical basis of the constituency. So nine of the 21 were changed.  That left 12 which were unchanged essentially in their existing boundaries and with the same number of seats as they had before.</P>
    <P>On which basis did the Minister make the decision that nine were to <Col N="919" /> be changed and 12 left unchanged? Of course we cannot know the Minister's mind at any particular time&mdash; only he can know that.  However, I think there are some significant clues to this.  There were, as I mentioned, 21 constituencies which under the Constitution, and on the basis of their population in 1971, could have been left unchanged.  The Minister changed nine.  Nine, to the Minister, were not satisfactory.  We find that in none of these nine constituencies was there a Coalition majority of seats.  Not in one of them.  Eight out of the other 12 had a Coalition majority.  Three were level pegging&mdash;that is, two seats each in four-seat constituencies; and one had a Fianna Fáil majority.  And which was that one?  West Limerick.</P>
    <P>You have heard a lot about West Limerick.  I must confess that when I first heard the rumour about West Limerick I thought it could not be true.  Here we have a situation where as the Minister, I am sure will assent, the Limerick constituencies were self-sufficient: the number of votes in each was such that it did not need any addition or subtraction&mdash;each constituency was satisfactory as it stood.</P>
    <P>I said it was impossible that any Minister would be so crooked that he would reverse them and have West Limerick as the four-seater, to gain an extra seat for the Coalition, and East Limerick as a three-seater to lose a seat for Fianna Fáil.  This matter has been raised on a number of occasions in the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I interrupt the Senator?  There is absolutely not one scintilla of truth in the statements which were made in the Dáil that there was not any schmozzle about those two constituencies.  He was right first.  The constituencies did not need to be changed and I did not change them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to hear that, but I cannot understand why it has taken him until now to say this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think it was worth commenting on, but when someone <Col N="920" /> like Senator Yeats makes a comment of that kind I thought it was only right that I should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to hear this because I have been getting increasingly worried that there were no denials of any kind about it.  So we will give the Minister credit then, on the basis of the 12 constituencies that he left unchanged, that he allowed us one in West Limerick.  That left eight with a Coalition majority, three with level pegging, and of the ones that were changed that were not satisfactory, none had a Coalition majority.</P>
      <P>It seems to me we have a pattern all through the thing.  You have a pattern in Dublin and Dún Laoghaire, a pattern of extraordinary, unnecessary and uncalled for changes in Cork; you have a pattern in Clare-Galway; you have a pattern all through the west where areas with rising population lose seats and areas with falling population gain seats.  You have the whole situation where these 21 if they had not Coalition majorities were changed drastically.  It seems to me that this pattern is one of sheer gerrymandering &mdash;that the Minister has taken advantage all round of what in most cases were very small population changes to bring in extensive countrywide changes in constituencies.</P>
      <P>One of the great advantages of economic progress in recent years has been the massive fall in the enormous emigration that used to take place&mdash; though to our great regret, there are certain areas, for example, Leitrim, Roscommon, Sligo and other areas where the population is still falling. Even there, the changes are much less than they used be and in other areas the population is now rising and the overall pattern is nothing like as drastic as it used to be in former years. Therefore, in many cases the actual changes needed were marginal.  The facts do quite clearly show that in almost all cases where extensive changes were made there was a hoped for political advantage involved.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to reply to a query.  There is the interesting comparison of Counties Meath and Clare. The Minister stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Minister for Local Government <Col N="921" /> must weigh up the competing claims of all the areas and strike a balance which is fair to all.  The whole spirit of the Constitution requires an even spread over the whole country without favouring or penalising any area. This is what I have tried to do; to provide fair and reasonable representation for the people of every area.</P>
    <P>He mentioned several times, both here and in the Dáil, that he had, so far as possible, tried to preserve the existing county boundaries.</P>
    <P>On the basis of all this, I find it very difficult to understand why, if one compares Meath and Clare, Meath which in 1971, had a population of 71,729, was given four seats; and County Clare with a population of 75,008, was given three seats.  You have Clare with a population of over 3,000 more than Meath, very near the number required to have four seats, and Clare was given only three seats and Meath was given four.  It may not have occurred to the Minister when he was thinking of Meath that it might be easier for him to get a quota of 20 per cent in a four-seat constituency as opposed to 25 per cent in a three-seat constituency.  I do not know.  Perhaps it did not.  I should like to know why Meath, on the basis of population, was treated so much more favourably than Clare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister introduced this Bill in a rather aggressive tone.  Indeed, it was a rather unusual Second Reading speech.  Normally Second Reading speeches by Ministers are fairly formal affairs.  They go through the sections of a Bill, explain them, perhaps make a couple of points at the end, ask us to pass it and so on.  I cannot remember a speech such as this, argumentative all through, referring to events in another place.  At the end of this interesting speech the Minister spoke of the impartial observers who had told him what a fine Bill this was.  I really would like to know the name of even <Col N="922" /> one of those observers.  Certainly the newspapers, which in most cases can hardly be said to be basically unfriendly to the Coalition, have looked at this Bill, and some of them with some approval, as a naked exercise in politics and have with some pleasure in some cases, spoken of this Bill as copperfastening the hold of the Coalition on the country and as the semi-permanent ruination of Fianna Fáil.  I think they are wrong.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, it has been the general public attitude.  I know of no impartial observers, certainly no informed impartial observers, who look upon this Bill as a genuine effort to play fair with all parties or with all parts of the country.  Even if I did think it was such I would have been disabused by the typically candid remarks of the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Kelly, Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, in the Dáil. Deputy Kelly was a respected Senator, a colleague of ours for several years, given to making vigorous speeches with a good deal of candour.  Reading with interest his contributions in the Dáil one sees he seems to have retained this ability.  He was discussing the Minister's Bill on 15th November, the day it was introduced for a Second Reading, and he let quite a few cats out of the bag.  He had a fairly excellent and accurate explanation as to why the Minister had dealt with Cork in the way he did.  Deputy Kelly said at column 2030 Volume 268 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>The situation in relation to Cork is a special one because one would expect a good Fianna Fáil vote there by reason of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition comes from the constituency.</P>
      <P>This is an interesting sort of doctrine for Ministers for Local Government. The leader of the Opposition comes from a constituency so, therefore, it needs special attention in a constituencies Bill like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Cork in 1973 Fianna Fáil won four seats for which they paid 7,591 votes each.  Fine Gael won two seats at a cost of 8,071 votes each while the Labour Party did not <Col N="923" /> succeed in returning anyone to the Dáil although they succeeded in winning 4,715 first preference votes. The Minister for Local Government is not St. Francis of Assisi and it would be asking a superhuman virtue on his part to permit that situation to continue.</P>
    <P>Alas, the Minister has not superhuman virtue and certainly he is no relation of St. Francis of Assisi.  I think the Minister is more likely to be a remote cousin of that well known former Governor of Massachusetts, Mr. Gerry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's colleague who made the long speech was not quite sure where the governor came from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know it was Massachusetts.  The Minister does all right, even not knowing that.  At column 2032 Deputy Kelly discussed the sad situation, from the Fine Gael point of view, in North-East Galway, West Galway, Clare-South Galway, East Mayo, West Mayo, Clare, Roscommon-Leitrim and Sligo-Leitrim and he went into detail on the number of seats in Connacht and the number of votes per seat.  Having assessed the situation he said:</P>
      <P>How could the Minister be expected to maintain that situation?</P>
      <P>In other words, the result was good for Fianna Fáil and on that basis how could the Minister be expected to maintain that situation.  It is apparently on that kind of basis that this Bill has been framed.</P>
      <P>We have had this extraordinary and unprecedented debate in this House. I am not sure if &ldquo;debate&rdquo; is the correct word.  The word &ldquo;debate&rdquo; whether in Parliament or elsewhere suggests some interchange of opinions, that one side gives its views and is replied to in due course by the other side.  I can only conclude that the silence of the Government side reflects essentially the knowledge that this Bill, by any normal standards of public behaviour, is indefensible.  It is quite clear that in no genuine way has there been an effort to fulfil the constitutional obligations laid upon the Minister.  It is a naked exercise in power grabbing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> However, the Minister has made a serious political miscalculation.  We are not, of course, discussing the Minister here as a political judge.  I think he is not a very good political judge.  We are discussing his conduct as a Minister.  For what it is worth, I can assure the Minister that he has made a serious miscalculation.  His plans, particularly in the Dublin area, are very dangerous ones.  A very slight shift in public opinion, a shift which I think has already taken place, would be sufficient to turn the whole ship around the other way.  Politically, we are not worried.  The sad thing is the damage that is done by a Bill of this kind to our political institutions and in particular to public confidence in politicians.  It is a sad thing, where the public, encouraged by the newspapers, get the impression that this is the kind of thing that is expected of a new Government coming to office. It is assumed as a matter of course apparently that when the Minister goes into office he will try to scupper the Opposition in this legal way.  That is bad.  It is dangerous to our political institutions.  This is a grimy little Bill.  The Government Senators, by their attitude during the past two days have shown quite clearly their own view on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatBrowne" hpid="Mr. P. Browne Mr. P. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We in Waterford are delighted that after 13 years we have got back our four-seat constituency. I think that in 1969 we could have got back this four-seater with a little bit of pressure.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about other constituencies.  I am not worried because I am convinced that no matter what way those constituencies are chopped up it will not make any difference in the long run.  In 1966 the farmers were protesting in Merrion Street and turnover tax had been introduced by the Fianna Fáil Party. Everything was against the Fianna Fáil organisation at that time.  Nevertheless, they were successful in the South Kerry by-election.  I am fully convinced that no matter what way constituencies are carved up you cannot dictate to people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1969, when we had a three-seat <Col N="925" /> constituency, it was against all odds that Fianna Fáil would not, or could not, get two representatives out of three.  I thought when I came in in a by-election in 1966 I had no possible chance of retaining the seat in 1969. Here, again, the people made up their minds and I was re-elected.  I do not mind what other Senators said here. It is the people who will make the difference and not the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>We have only heard speakers from this side of the House.  I am sorry that we did not have contributions from the other side so that I could judge for myself who is right and who is wrong. There is no doubt that somebody is wrong.  Listening to the contributions from this side of the House, I am fully convinced that it is the Government side who are wrong.  How could I say anything else when I heard nothing from the other side?  I have been a politician all my life but nobody knows what my politics are.  I never discuss politics because to my mind everybody in this House and in the other House is entitled to his views.</P>
    <P>We had a six-hour contribution by one of our own gentlemen.  It would be very hard to contradict what he said but I was hoping that somebody on the other side of the House would do so and give me an insight into whether he was right or wrong.  I cannot compliment or congratulate the Minister.  Being in Opposition that is only natural.  However, I thank the Minister for the fact that after 13 years we have got back our own again.  I am convinced that no matter what a Minister will do it is the people who decide in the end.</P>
    <P>We had the first Coalition Government. After three years there was a general election.  Subsequently there was another general election.  The Coalition were not defeated by any means.  They just left office and walked out.  I thought I would never see a Coalition Government again.  Perhaps I am not the youngest or the oldest here but I heard a very prominent Fine Gael Minister for Agriculture advise the farmers at a meeting in Waterford city to hold their corn until the next <Col N="926" /> year when there might be a better price for it.  A very prominent Fine Gael man who had invited him to Waterford city asked the Minister: &ldquo;Is that the only thing you have to offer to the people of Ireland&mdash;keep your barley, oats and wheat until the next year for the rats and mice to eat.  I say I was always opposed to Jim Ryan, God rest him, but he was a decent man.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No matter what Deputy Tully as Minister for Local Government can do or what he intends to do he will not convince the people to vote for what he wants.  The people of Ireland are very perceptive.  I am not in the least worried about the slicing of constituencies. I am fully convinced that Fianna Fáil will not beat the present Government but I am convinced that they will beat themselves.  If they last for four-and-a-half years there is no reason why we should not have the Fianna Fáil Party back in power.</P>
    <P>In 1932 when Fianna Fáil took office for the first time they stayed in office until the advent of the first Coalition. Then after a break of six years they came back.  Many people said that Fianna Fáil were too long in power. How many business people are there in the House?  Why are they business people?  They give service to the public and that is why they are in business. If you have a man who is not able to look after his business he will be a very short time in it because if he does not give satisfaction to the public he will not remain.  Many people to whom Fianna Fáil are anathema told me they were fully convinced that a Fianna Fáil Cabinet are the only Cabinet that can rule this country.  Needless to say I was glad to hear them say that.  It is not my policy to offend anybody. Everybody is entitled to this view.</P>
    <P>No matter what the Minister might try to do, no matter what anybody here might try to do, the people will decide whenever an election takes place.  I do not know.  That is up to the Minister for Local Government and the Taoiseach. I would like to thank the Minister for giving us back our four-seat constituency.  To me it does not matter a damn.</P>

I have been in politics for 50 years.  When Fianna Fáil was founded I was at the first meeting.  You would not believe that I am that old.  There are some people here who got into politics very quickly and very easily.  Nobody can stand up here and say I am not involved in politics.  No one can say that a man who has fought three elections and two Seanad elections and was a county councillor for 32 years is not involved in politics.</P>
      <P>I have not said much here in the past 11 months in this House.  What I heard this evening was a disgrace. It reminded me of an old GAA club being formed down the country, or boys who have just left school at 13 or 14 years of age having fist fights and so on.  I thought when I came to the Seanad that I would be among the intellectuals.  They are a disgrace and this House is a disgrace.  The Leader of the House is a legal gentleman and he is to my mind the man who started it.  I was backing Labour years ago&mdash;and I am still a Labour man&mdash;when some of the men here today backing Fine Gael would not give them a crust of bread.  They would cut their throats.  Go back to 1932 when our Government took over office, where was the Labour man?  The farmers were feeding him in the cow house.  They would not let them inside the door to feed them although they were working for him. Now the big Fine Gael ranchers of Ireland know what Fine Gael and Labour will do to them.  Fine Gael did not want to do it to them, but they were compelled to do it to them. In the next election they will know what the big farmers will do to them.</P>

      <P>The whole thing depends on an election.  None of us would be here without an election. That is what it all hinges on, getting us quickly through this Constituencies Bill in case there is a snap election.  It is coming close to that.  I do not want an election for four years.  There must be something wrong when we want to get this put through the Seanad in Holy Week.  It was never known in the history of the Seanad that it sat in Holy Week.  It was not good enough to finish at 10.30 or 10 o'clock as usual. As bad as Fianna Fáil were&mdash;and they were bad enough in many ways&mdash;they never did that.  When a man from rural Ireland sees a Minister for Local Government ensuring that it takes 1,500 more people to elect a Member in a rural constituency than in Dublin city, it is time to start thinking.  In Dublin city you walk one and a half miles and cover your whole constituency. In my constituency alone, Carlow-Kilkenny, I have to go 60 miles to meet my constituents at one end and 70 miles in the other direction to meet them.  Here in Dublin a Member can be elected with 19,300 votes and in other constituencies in the west and in parts of Ulster they have to get 21,400 votes to get elected.  Is that justice or is there any honesty in it? We talk about the north.  We should be ashamed to say we are in the south. The north is twice as good as we are. I went through the figures.  I heard my colleague, Senator Dolan, quote them. In the three Ulster counties they are losing two seats.  In Connacht they are losing two more, that is four seats altogether. Who are gaining the four seats? The Dubliners.  No one can deny it.  If the Minister wants to stand up and deny it he can.  In my own constituency we have heard a lot about the dishonesty of the Ministers of Fianna Fáil.  In this constituency two parts of my area were given away by Fianna Fáil Ministers who were criticised by the Opposition right, left and centre.  There were 4,000 Kilkenny votes three miles from me and I would be here as a Minister for the last 15 years only for the change.  Perhaps I am better off for not being here.  In Ferrybank, Rockingham, and Marymount, 4,000 or more votes have gone in to elect <Col N="930" /> Fad Browne in Waterford, or perhaps, to elect the Labour man.  They took 1,000 votes in Rosbercon and gave them to Wexford.  They gave us 2,000 votes in Bunclody.  Perhaps the Minister does not know where Bunclody is: it is in the County Wexford.  Is there any justice in taking 1,000 votes from Rosbercon and giving them to Wexford and giving 3,000 in Bunclody to Carlow-Kilkenny?</P>

He would be elected anyway if there were only two seats perhaps.  Why give people a chance to say these things?  Why did you leave Kilkenny with Carlow?  The reason is you wanted your own man elected again.  Are Fine Gael all asleep or what is wrong with them? They cannot see further than their noses, I think.  We do not care in Fianna Fáil whether you make it a three-seater or not.  I would like to see the whole country in three-seaters.  I would not be worried about that.  Why is the constituency of the Taoiseach left as a four-seater?  Why is a bit of Wicklow gone into Dublin?  Why is a bit of Kildare gone into Dublin? Dublin will still have more TDs than all the rest of Ireland together.</P>
      <P>Why not bring them out of Dublin instead of bringing them in?  Why not start with Cork?  Cork would have five seats.  Kilkenny has sufficient for three seats and still you are afraid of your lives to leave them together.  Why not give back Ferrybank and Rockingham if you are as honest as you say?  Mr. Boland and Mr. Blaney took them from us.  Now is your chance to prove your honesty.  There is no use in laughing about it.  Did Mr. Boland in 1959 do the wrong thing?  The Coalition have been talking about this for so long.  The Minister has an honest face.  I often heard it said &ldquo;Look out for the man who is smiling the whole time because he is dangerous.&rdquo;  Is something happening we do not know anything about that we have to stay here until 1 a.m. to debate this Bill during Holy Week?

I hope the Minister in his reply will tell me why the three remaining counties of Ulster lost two seats, why Connacht lost two seats and why it will be possible for a smaller population to elect a man in Dublin than in Ulster or Connacht.  I ask him why he did not give back Ferrybank and Rockingham to Kilkenny?  Why give us a little bit up in the hills of Bunclody 20 miles away and take 1,000 people from Rosbercon alongside Kilkenny?  Why did the Minister do that?  These &ldquo;honest men&rdquo; in the Cabinet have been saying for 20 years that Fianna Fáil did the wrong thing.

I have never seen anything to equal it in all the meetings I have attended.  Perhaps I am not eligible to speak here.  I am neither an intellectual nor a legal man.  I did not go to University.  I am not a rugby man either.  I am an Irishman. We all know what happened when these intellectuals came down the country.  Are we coming to the day when rural Ireland is being pushed out and urban Ireland being pushed in?  Could I ask the Minister why rural Ireland, where there are three houses every mile, did not get a better representation than the cities? There are a lot of Senators and ex-Deputies here from Mayo, Galway, Donegal, Monaghan, Cavan and so on who have not protested at the higher ratio the city people have got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Minister tell me why a man can be elected in Dublin with 19,600 votes and 21,000 votes are needed to elect a man in rural Ireland? <Col N="937" /> Could I ask the Minister why he did not give back Ferrybank and Rockingham to Kilkenny and make it a three-seater?  Why did he not give Rosbercon back to Kilkenny and Bunclody back to Wexford?  Carlow was with Kildare before, but now part of Kildare is with Dublin.  Why did he not make Wexford, Carlow and Kilkenny three-seaters?  Could he not have given us back Ferrybank and Rockingham and even it up with a three-seater each?</P>

I have a pride in my own parish, in my own townland.  I would not vote for a man who put me into another county.  Could the Minister not have left the boundaries as they were?  For instance, in the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, Kilkenny is a three-seater constituency.  Why not take part of Paulstown and Graiguenamanagh, which is on the border of Carlow, and make two three-seaters?  Could the Minister not have left us Kilkenny and given Waterford their own part back and left it as it was?  Perhaps he had other reasons.  That is no good to the local people who were born and reared in South Kilkenny who have to go in with Waterford.  I know the reason&mdash;he wanted to save a seat for Labour.  We are not all as green as we look.  I will conclude by wishing the Coaltion the best of luck.  I hope they will be here for four years, but I am afraid they will not.</P>

      <P>Many hours have been spent in the Dáil discussing the <Col N="938" /> title of this Bill but as a rural Senator I am more interested in the rural areas than in the cities.  I think the five hours that have been spent in discussing this title have been completely useless.  The title of this Bill, in my opinion, should be&mdash;something that was introduced into Ireland recently&mdash;the &ldquo;Streakers Bill&rdquo;.  This Bill is denuding the rural population of their proper and justified representation in Dáil Éireann.  The title should be&mdash;and I say it without fear of contradiction&mdash;the &ldquo;Streakers Bill&rdquo;.  A Minister who comes from a rural area should have had more consideration for the rural areas and should have given them more concessions in his constituency Bill or &ldquo;Streakers Bill&rdquo; similar to what he has given to Leinster and within the Pale, as we know it in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulties. He is a Labour Minister in a Coalition Government.  I look over at all those Senators who listened to all the accusations that have been made against the Minister today by this side of the House.  Not one individual on that side of the House had the courage to stand up and defend him.  It is a very poor reflection on them.  What can the Minister expect from his colleagues in the next few months when they failed to stand up and defend his actions in this House for the past two days&mdash;apart from their lousy interjections? For example there was the callous interjection about 1932.  When this country, in 1932, was left starving and penniless after a Cumann na nGaedheal Government the Fianna Fáil Government took over.  In order to bring the people back to maturity and to give them ability and strength the free beef scheme had to be introduced. The poor old pensioners lost their ten shillings a week.  There was the first introduction of the dole.  I do not want to dwell on this too long but merely to reply to Senator McAuliffe who was not a member of the Fianna Fáil party at the time.  When he saw he could get no further he left it.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to <Col N="939" /> travel around the country for five or six hours.  I do not intend to go around Monaghan, Cork, Waterford or other places like them.  I am going to dwell on my own native county of Mayo. The only amendment brought in by the Minister to the Bill was brought in to make sure that the Parliamentary Secretary would well and truly retain his seat.  We had a tradition in what was then known as West Mayo of returning two Fianna Fáil candidates. The peculiar thing about the last election was that, when the first preference votes were counted in West Mayo, Fianna Fáil had 300 votes more than the Fine Gael Party but, under proportional representation, we returned one candidate and Fine Gael returned two.  It was the first time in the history of West Mayo that that happened.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government in his original Bill handed over to West Mayo&mdash;I have the map here&mdash; Crossmolina North, Crossmolina South, Deel, Kilfian South and Kilfian West and Lacken North.  In that area Fianna Fáil have in the region of 1,500 votes&mdash;of course we are not bothered with the Labour Party in Mayo&mdash;and Fine Gael have 600 votes, but the boys got together in a sort of cominform&mdash;I would not call it a coaltion because Labour do not come into our area at all&mdash;and told the Minister that he was now assured of two Fianna Fáil seats because he was handing them over at least 900 votes. Of course, after the recent budget and the increased prices, there is no Fine Gael vote in that part of the country now.  They are finished there.</P>

      <P>The Minister said in the Dáil on various occasions, and I will quote him if he wishes, that <Col N="940" /> Deputy Molloy as Minister for Local Government had a Bill drafted. Deputy Molloy challenged the Minister on several occasions in the Dáil, and I will quote his words if the Minister wants me to, to prove his statement but he has never done so.  Does the Minister know what he is known as down in our county, and does he know what John Reilly knows him as &mdash;the man they expelled from the Labour Party for castrating the itinerants and putting them onto Tory Island&mdash;he is known as &ldquo;Slippery Jimmy&rdquo;.

In the constituencies of East Mayo and West Mayo Mr. Tully discovered that he was handing over a majority of 900, and we already had 300 No. 1 votes more than the Fine Gael Party, the boys got together and said: &ldquo;That is wrong.

      <P>I am not worried whether Senator O'Toole is here or not. The Minister gave them back to East Mayo and took my little area out of it completely because I was the danger man, the strong man.  Then he makes a big jump and goes from Crossmolina up as far as Hollymount, between Ballinrobe and Claremorris, and he picks an area there.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary told him: &ldquo;That is a strong area of mine.  You know Myles beat me the last time by a few hundred votes but I want to get back the next time as Parliamentary Secretary&rdquo; and the Minister for Local Government handed over this packet of Fine Gael votes to West Mayo from East Mayo.  They kept a bit of Lacken, Belderrig, Ballycastle, Kilfian, Letterbrick and all those areas.  That is a strong Fianna Fáil area so no matter what happens in West Mayo the next time, Fianna Fáil will have two seats and the Fine Gael fight will be between the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Henry Kenny, a man for whom I have great respect and who is a great friend of mine, and Deputy Myles Staunton. Under the circumstances Senator Lyons and I will be on the long road canvassing for the Seanad because the Minister made sure that I would not get into West Mayo because he was told I was a very dangerous man in that constituency.

He talked about going from Ballyshannon to Ballintra, a distance of 12 miles, and he crossed over constituency boundaries three or four times.  I should like to ask the Minister who drew up the constituency boundaries for him.  How will a Deputy for West Mayo&mdash;the Fianna Fáil Deputy I am speaking about, of course, will be in the Castlebar area and the other one, Deputy Denis Gallagher, will be in the Achill area &mdash;get to Kilfinan, to Ballycastle, to Lacken South, without going through the constituency of East Mayo?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Take East or West Mayo, leaving Poulacapple&mdash;anyone who looks at a map will see it is the next village to America&mdash;and travelling to the Galway boundary you come within 1½ miles of Tuam.  On the other hand, if one leaves Lacken South and travels to Keem Bay in Achill, it is roughly 155 miles.  To leave Lacken South, or Belderrig, or Kilcummin Pier and travel to Keem Bay in Achill is a distance of at least 120 miles.  It is absolutely cruel to think that a man who represents that area has to get practically 22,000 votes, whereas a man in Dublin, who can have a constitutional around his constituency in the morning before breakfast, needs only 19,123 votes to be elected.  I do not know what to call it&mdash;&ldquo;Tullymandering&rdquo;, &ldquo;Coalitionmandering&rdquo; or whatever it is&mdash;but it is an absolute <Col N="943" /> disgrace, an insult to the intelligence of the rural population.</P>
    <P>I know there is urgency about this Bill.  I have discussed it with some gentlemen outside the House today. They have admitted that there is urgency.  That is why the Leader of the House, who gave us all a lecture on religion during the Contraception Bill, thumped his craw and said: &ldquo;There, but for the grace of God, go I&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I should like to know the reason this motion was moved tonight that we sit until 1 o'clock to discuss this Bill.  I should like to compare the piety of Holy Week with what happened on the Contraception Bill introduced here a few weeks ago, when we got a lecture on religion, on pious attitudes, on morals from the Leader of the House.  Does he realise the position regarding confession in rural areas during Holy Week?  Of course, it does not matter a damn; piety comes in only when it is useful. For instance, in my home chapel this evening there are confessions from 1 o'clock to 3 o'clock for Holy Week. I am not allowed to be there to go to confession.  I will have to travel to Ballina perhaps, not that I shall have a hell of a lot to tell.  But when I look over there and think what they have to tell.  God forgive me I will not be judge or jury, I will let them condemn themselves.</P>

I know that the Minister for Local Government, who is a member of the Labour Party, is not very much interested in East or West Mayo, because it is Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael there.

I do not mind taking a canter across the bridge at Crossmolina and travelling on towards the eastern side of the county, which comprises Ballina, Foxford, Swinford, Charlestown, Ballyhaunis, Claremorris, Kiltimagh&mdash;the lot.  One can start in Lacken North and tour along for about 100 or 120 miles to within a mile-and-a-half of a little place called Irishtown, and then from the butt of Nephin right along to Ballaghaderreen, Frenchpark, Loughlynn, Ballinlough, and you travel at least another 100 miles.  I want to know from the Minister is it accepted by him and by his draftsmen that a man who covers a constituency of that length and breath requires practically 22,000 votes to elect him?  Compare him with a city Deputy who can travel his constituency on his walk in the morning before he has his breakfast.  This is absolutely unfair and the Minister, coming as he does from a rural area, should have more respect for the rural areas.  I appreciate his difficulty.  He has, in my estimation, done the best he was allowed to do.  Looking over on my right at the Minister, who has been an honest, hard-working man ever since he left the cradle&mdash;I should say he has been as honest as he was allowed to be&mdash;in drafting this Bill he had to deal with conservatives, capitalists, socialists, lords, ladies and leaders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>I wish to raise the situation relating to the site on Wood Quay, Dublin, the archaeological possibilities of that site, the plan of the Government or the plan of the corporation to erect these municipal offices.  The two decisions of the Minister that are relevant to what I want to say are, curiously enough, related to the 13th day of two months.  On 13th November, 1973, it was announced that the Government had decided that development of the Winetavern Street site for the municipal offices should cease <Col N="949" /> pending further investigation.  That was one decision by the Minister. Then on 13th February, 1974 there was the announcement that the Government had granted permission but that the complex would be moved eastward to give a full view of Christchurch Cathedral and to preserve the old city walls.</P>
    <P>I should like to argue that the decision of 13th November was a good decision but that the further investigation which took place was inadequate and, therefore, the decision of 13th February, 1974 was not as good a decision.  If I wanted to make some kind of rhetorical flourish out of these two unlucky dates, 13th November and 13th February, and if I had time to do it and if I had the energy to pursue it, in other words if my name was Senator McGlinchey, I could make some kind of an interesting case along those lines but time does not allow it.  I do not think I could command the same kind of rhetorical eloquence that the Senator displayed so lavishly over the last couple of days.</P>
    <P>The latest statement on this is the statement by the corporation about a fortnight ago to the effect that the corporation was now arguing that the area designated by the National Museum authorities as of prime archaeological importance will not be built on for at least two years.  The question arises there, first of all, the degree of investigation which I wish to challenge, and, on the other hand, the fact that we do not know what a site of prime archaeological importance is until an archaeological investigation excavation has taken place.  The sites that are being excavated and investigated are only known to be of interest because, in fact, they have been excavated.</P>
    <P>Throughout that entire area, and within that whole city wall one has the remains of a Viking civilisation which in medieval times was laid down here and which is of enormous value and importance archaeologically to us and, indeed, to the whole community of nations which is Europe.  The fact that they have not been excavated is a fact which simply argues that we do not <Col N="950" /> really know what is there.  If we build these large massive buildings on it, the chances are, with these heavy foundations and with the mass of building above it, it may be lost forever.  I wish to make that point strongly and I want to talk in terms of this city of ours. I am a country man myself but I am living here, and there are many Dublin city men here.</P>
    <P>Several dreadful things have been perpetrated against this city in our own time.  Nobody walking along Fitzwilliam Street and looking at the ESB offices, nobody of any sensitivity, could fail to be moved by the violation that was done there.  We had the longest Georgian Street in the world and there was a perfect opportunity of keeping a Georgian entirety but now that street has been violated.  Everybody regrets that.  Therefore, there is an urgency about this sort of situation.  If we love the city of Dublin, the seventh city of Christendom, and if we want its best features preserved we must take thought and think deeply before making a major move of the kind envisaged in relation to Wood Quay.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the present Minister has not thought deeply on this subject.  The fact that he, in the first place, stalled the project is ample evidence of that but I am going to argue that the amount of evidence available to him was necessarily inadequate. I am not going to argue very strongly in terms of architecture or, indeed, in terms of environment.  I am not, for instance, going to argue very strongly, though if I had time I would do it, that the civic offices there employing 2,000 employees, one-third of them would have cars, and situated on a one-way street, will cause tremendous traffic congestion in that area.  When those cars come in some place has to be found for these cars to park.  This valuable unique site which contains both Viking and Norman remains, and, indeed, later 18th century remains, will be steadily devastated or the danger of that is going to be there.  It seems the argument is that it is a bad site environmentally speaking.  I am not going to argue too strongly though if I had time I would.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> I do not want to argue that, for instance, the desires of the people of the Liberties, the Liberties Association, run counter to this plan because there is a strong desire that in this area there should be a revival of the kind of houses, the kind of proportion between street and house, and a desire that the kind of a living city which was once there in the Liberties should be preserved.  There is the fact that this plan may threaten that too. If I had time I would argue that case, but I know that the Minister is strenuously, and, indeed, passionately, committed to the sense of a living city.  I think he is very aware&mdash;and some of his public statements have made this clear&mdash;of the need to revive the centre of Dublin.  He has taken considerable interest in it.  I am not going to argue, although there was a time when I would, the case for the cattle market site as an alternative site because it looks hideous at the moment.  There is no archaelogical interest concerned with that site.  It is almost available, perhaps it will take a little longer to make it available, for the civic buildings.  It would certainly be well sited.  It would be central enough.</P>
    <P>I can see from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; the crying need for civic offices.  I am aware that there are 2,000 employees who, at the moment, are working in 27 run-down, inadquate and dingy offices all over Dublin and that these employees of the corporation are entitled to proper housing and a proper environment for their work. I know these difficulties.  They are there.  I know that the Minister is aware of them but I want to talk more about the archaeological dimensions to the entire situation.  However, before moving on to that I should like to quote one of our most distinguished architects, Mr. Myles Montgomery, a great literary man, a man who is very much aware of what a city is about, what its traditions are, both literary and architectural, commenting in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 15th November, 1973, he said that, Dublin, with the environment of the corporation, was trying successfully <Col N="952" /> to reproduce the sophisticated image of the great metropolis, skyscrapers, fly-overs, congestion, pollution and all.</P>
    <P>I want to concern myself with the archaeological dimension of this area and I want to refer to a meeting, attended by a number of very distinguished archaeologists, which took place in the Mansion House on Tuesday, 12th March, 1974.  The following speakers had, very briefly, the following things to say.  One of our most distinguished archaeologists, George Hogan, pointed out that in this area of Wood Quay there was an extraordinary wealth of materials available which could be destroyed.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Wherever work is in progress on any aspect of the Viking civilisation the Dublin material must be taken into consideration.  Likewise for Norman and post-Norman studies, results are of equal value and importance.</P>
    <P>In other words, Dublin looms large, according to George Hogan, in the whole world of the investigation of Viking and Norman civilisation.  This is Dublin, the seventh city of Christendom. It is a city about which we should have as much concern as the Florentine has for Florence or the man of Salzburg has for Salzburg or as have the people of Prague for their city, and who, when the city was devasted, built all those old building again brick by brick.  They put first things first.  They saw that in their city there was a living symbol of their own dignity, their own sense of themselves.</P>
    <P>Thomas Delaney, a professional archaeologist from Belfast, on that occasion in the Mansion House said that:</P>
    <P>Some cities such as Bergen have permanent archaelogical units working since the beginning of this century, covering all aspects of investigation of the early remains from initial surveys through excavation to conservation and display.  Excavation of sites prior to redevelopment is the norm and the programmes includes, in many cases, preservation of the ancient structures <Col N="953" /> on the sites where they have been discovered.  Even some small provincial cities in Britain now have archaeological units which have been established on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>We are talking about Dublin.  Brian Scott, a professional archaeologist from Belfast and a specialist in conservation, said that:</P>
    <P>The preservation of the remains which have been excavated in Dublin is quite feasible and would be in line with work carried out elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Richard Haworth, a professional archaeologist and a researcher, pointed out that:</P>
    <P>The cost of funding excavation and of a permanent archaeological unit to deal with excavation arising out of urban renewal is automatically thought to have to come from central or local public funds.</P>
    <P>He points out that the third source of funding is the actual site developer. A figure of 1 per cent of the total cost of redevelopment would, in most cases, cover the necessary prior archaeological investigations of the site. Such a method of funding excavation of urban sites is practised on the Continent.</P>
    <P>I could go on and quote from Nuala Burke of UCD, Peter Harbison, another archaeologist, and Séamus Caulfield.  Séamus Caulfield raised one important point where he said that:</P>
    <P>A common and erroneous view is that such a unit would have a staffing problem.  In fact, large numbers of students of archaeology graduate every year from Irish universities and a sizeable number go on to take post-graduate degrees in the subject.  The question of a staffing problem for a Dublin archaeological unit therefore does not arise.</P>
    <P>I would point out that at present there are 21 archaeological students doing the MA in UCD who are hungry for the opportunity to work on sites.  The site in Wood Quay is ideal in this connection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> I now wish to move on to the problem that I raised at the beginning.  It is connected with the investigation of the problem and how well it has been carried out.  The situation as it stands is that we have not got in Dublin a city archaeologist.  We did not have a city architect until a few days ago and it is to the eternal credit of the Minister that he has appointed him because many architectural problems in the city have gone by default through lack of a city architect.  I would also like to compliment the Minister on the fact that about six months ago he appointed a housing co-ordinator.  In other words, he is thinking of the patterns that seem to be relevant and right in this connection, but what we need with regard to the archaeological dimension of Dublin is either an archaeological unit, perhaps still attached to the National Museum, or a city archaeologist who would draw up a comprehensive plan on what was archaeologically available in the city.  That plan would be in the hands of the corporation and would be there for reference to any developer who wanted to erect a new building in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing that we should just look at the past and forget about the future.  In fact, if I ever go down in this House as having said anything worthwhile I would go down as having said, over and over again, that we need a Minister for the Environment. I should like to suggest that what one needs is an overall plan which would be worked out by the city architect and the city archaeologist.  As things stand we have an assistant keeper of the National Museum who is part-time at work on that site and who, being a civil servant, cannot come into the open and say publicly what is happening there.  Looking around the city you can see that the lack of a co-ordinated plan is producing, over and over again, gapped and mutilated squares and buildings.  You can see that that whole area of the Liberties and the whole area which involves Christchurch, St. Patrick's Cathedral and Dublin Castle is increasingly being neglected.  That could be a very great tourist amenity to which people could come and which, if it were <Col N="955" /> built up, would be a marvellous amenity both human and aesthetic for visitors to Dublin.  The city of Dublin as it stands is becoming more and more ugly and inadequate every day.</P>
    <P>I should like particularly to appeal to Senators who are Dublin people&mdash; Senators Halligan, Harte, Mullins, Kennedy, Holmes, Boland, Yeats, Lord Iveagh, FitzGerald, McGrath, Ryan and Sanfey&mdash;to put as much pressure as they can on the relevant authorities to see that this heritage which they have in stone, brick and in archaeological remains will be preserved and treasured by us.  On a national level a Minister for the Environment should be immediately appointed.</P>
    <P>We know that natural gas, oil, zinc and mining have to be developed.  Nobody wants to stop it, and no archaeologist would want to stop it.  The future archaeologist will think about this building but side by side with that there has to be a concern and a tenderness for what is there from the past.</P>
    <P>I have not the slightest doubt that the Minister for Local Government is thinking along the right lines in this direction.  My only feeling at the moment is that his first decision was a good one.  I know the enormous pressures that came on him with regard to his second decision, but I would ask him to think again about that area, about what is going to be lost, about what the future generations will have to say about what we, at this stage, did with Dublin.  Once Dublin was really one of the most beautiful cities in the world but at the moment it is on the brink of becoming one of the ugliest.  In fact, even if we should lose on that front&mdash; the front of Wood Quay, and I hope we do not lose&mdash;we at least do not lose on the others.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to this possibility, that there is an enormous opportunity to make reparation for the sins of the past in this direction.  Whatever he  do in terms of archaeological <Col N="956" /> and achitectural planning will be something that our children may ultimately bless us for.  I am sorry for having overrun my time.</P>

      <P>This is my first time to have an Adjournment debate in this House and I am rather surprised at what has happened.  Yesterday morning the Senator asked to have this matter raised on the Adjournment and it was ruled out of order on a technicality. As I left the House at 10 o'clock last night, the Senator approached me and explained what had happened.  Although I had 30 miles to go home.  I spent 20 minutes explaining the matter and discussing it with him.  I understood he was satisfied with the discussion he had with me and I told him that, if necessary, I would see him again today and discuss the matter further.  I was not approached today and so I was rather surprised when I came into the House to find that it was being raised on the Adjournment tonight.</P>
      <P>There may be a reason for this but I believe in meeting those things and saying exactly what I think.  I am not satisfied that I was treated properly in this manner by the Senator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The decisions referred to in the motion were taken on the authority of the Government and in the light of all the relevant considerations. I would like to make it clear also that the civic offices project is now out of my hands, and is the responsibility of Dublin Corporation following the decision of the commissioners on 4th February to proceed with the amended scheme.</P>
      <P>I would point out that I issued a public statement on 13th February last in which I explained the action which had been taken by the Government and the reason for it.  However, I have no objection to going over the ground again.</P>
      <P>The planning of the corporation's civic offices project was, in fact, suspended for more than three months while a general reappraisal was carried out.  This followed a Government decision in November last that the development should cease pending consultation and further investigation. The decision was motivated by concern regarding the use of the particular site for civic offices because of its significance, not only from the archaeological point of view, but also in its relationship to Christchurch Cathedral and its potential value as an open space, bearing in mind the Government's decision to develop the Liberties and the surrounding area for housing.</P>
      <P>I have gone to more trouble than any Minister for Local Government ever did in this State to try to preserve old Dublin and to have the centre of Dublin rebuilt as a living city.</P>
      <P>The Government's decision was conveyed to the city manager at that time. He was informed of my concern that the further consideration of the matter should include an examination of possible alternative sites for the civic offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The city manager submitted a full report in December.  There was a reappraisal of the project which took account of the relevant planning, <Col N="958" /> archaeological and general amenity considerations.  It included assessment of the possibilities for alternative sites. Five alternative sites in different parts of the city were considered as regards size, location, ownership and relevant planning, traffic, financial and other considerations.  The possibility of renting accommodation in new offices was also examined by the city manager but no satisfactory solution could be found in that direction.  I had discussions on the matter with city commissioners. Let me say here that the Fianna Fáil commissioners walked out of the chamber when the matter was being discussed, I understand, and refused to meet me to discuss it.  However, I had discussions on the matter with the other city commissioners and alternative plans involving regrouping of the buildings on the site were prepared by the corporation's consultants.</P>
    <P>The question was considered again by the Government and on 13th February, 1974, it was conveyed to the corporation that no objection would be raised to an amended scheme which the commissioners had proposed to a plan submitted by their consultants. This scheme involves a regrouping of the office buildings so they are confined to the eastern portion of the site and a sizeable area is left clear of development with a view over it to the cathedral.  This space will be available for suitable open space/amenity development in the future.  This was agreed on unanimously by the city commissioners.</P>
    <P>As I have explained the reassessment of the project took account of the planning and amenity considerations, as well as of the archaeological aspects.  This was appropriate in view not only of the historic significance of the location but of its distinctive importance as part of the architectural heritage of the city, and of the Government's plans for reviving related areas through housing development.  I am sure the Senator appreciates the great importance of these revival and renewal objectives.</P>
    <P>As regards the archaeological aspects, the National Museum authorities, who are responsible for the excavations, were consulted.  They have expressed <Col N="959" /> themselves satisfied, on the basis of discussions with the corporation, that it is feasible for the proposed civic office development to proceed with proper regard to the archaeological interest and that the two operations can be suitably co-ordinated on the site.  This, to my mind, is a major consideration. I know that full and detailed consultation has taken place, and is continuing, between the National Museum authorities and corporation officials, with a view to determining the details of co-ordinating the excavations and the development so that the former is facilitated in every way possible.</P>
    <P>All in all there can scarcely have been a more fully or frequently appraised project than this one.  The present proposal follows acquisition of the site for civic offices by compulsory purchase order confirmed by the then Minister for Local Government in 1964; an open invitation to development interests in 1967 to submit proposals to a prepared brief, and assessment of the results by a panel of specialists; selection of a scheme accordingly; grant of planning permission; planning appeals, an oral hearing and the grant of planning approval by the then Minister in 1972 subject to conditions and now a further reassessment at the behest of the Government, and modification of the proposals by the corporation.  The modifications will not please everyone: that would be too much to expect.  But I believe that they make for a better treatment overall, including the maintenance of a sizeable open space, as well as facilitating the archaeological work.</P>
    <P>The need for centralised office accommodation for the corporation has been recognised since the beginning of the century and the matter has been actively pursued for the past 20 years. Senator, to renew this point, at present staff are spread over some 27 offices and this is a serious problem for the corporation and for the public.  There are no proper facilities for accommodating the public in many of the corporation's public offices and there is considerable confusion as to where particular services are administered.  In this situation the efficient administration of public services and the maintenance <Col N="960" /> of high morale among corporation staffs is unduly hampered.  I mention these considerations not because I believe that they should override all other considerations but because the new offices are an urgent civic need.  It would be wrong, therefore, to interfere with the development unnecessarily and&mdash;as I have indicated&mdash;it is the view of the competent archaeological authorities that it is not necessary that the project should be abandoned or further suspended in the archaeological interest.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Government have shown a proper sense of responsibility in this matter.  Their intervention was fully justified in a matter of such public importance and concern.  But now that the reappraisal has been completed and a compromise devised which meets the essential requirements both of the preservation and of the development interests there is no justification for further intervention by me, in view particularly of the urgency of the corporation's need for new accommodation.</P>
    <P>The matter is now in the hands of the corporation.  I think I should say a few words about the corporation's general attitude as I have experienced it.  Their original scheme had gone through all due process and was cleared to proceed when the Government intervened last November.  The reaction of the corporation officials, and of the commissioners in general, was positive and helpful, even though some delay in the provision of the offices was bound to occur.  It would be grossly unfair to suggest that the corporation are oblivious to the archaeological interest.  On the contrary, they have been facilitating excavations on the site for several years and have obviously taken trouble to keep closely in touch with the archaeological authorities and to take account of their views in considering the planning, organisation and phasing of the work now proposed. The corporation's record in this matter, and the satisfaction expressed by the National Museum authorities, are an indication that maximum cooperation in the archaeological investigation of the site will continue to <Col N="961" /> be forthcoming.  There is no basis for further intervention by me.</P>
    <P>I should say, Sir, that while I would myself have preferred if the offices had been sited elsewhere, nevertheless I am a democrat, and the unanimous democratic view of the commissioners in Dublin is that the revised development should take place.  Although I agree that eminent people have claimed that there are priceless finds still on that site, other eminent people have said that that is not so.  I am not competent to say which view is correct, but I gave permission to Dublin Corporation to build their offices after the frustrating experience which they have had.  I would be happy if they built elsewhere, but the decision has been made.  While I agree it is important that people should be on the alert to see that more of Dublin's past is not destroyed, but the time for people to come forward is when it is threatened, not when final decisions have been taken.</P>
