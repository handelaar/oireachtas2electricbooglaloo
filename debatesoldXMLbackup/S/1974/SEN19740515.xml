      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and in that order.  With regard to No. 1, we are in a situation which I do not like and which I know the Minister himself has endeavoured to avoid.  The position is that nominations in respect of the local elections open at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning and it is necessary, if this Bill is to apply to the present local elections, that all Stages should be passed in this House today.  Not only that&mdash;and I do earnestly look for co-operation in this respect&mdash;it will be necessary to have all Stages passed by 2.30 p.m., because the procedure, as Senators will be aware, is that following the passage of the Bill and the Early Signature Motion, which is No. 2 on the Order Paper, it is necessary for the vellum copy of the Bill authenticated by the Clerk to be presented for signature. Normally it would be for the signature of the President, but the President being abroad, it is necessary for the Bill to be signed by the Presidential Commission, which consists of three persons: the Chief Justice, the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil, and the Chairman of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that has been done, it is necessary for at least three Ministers to make orders under section 25 of the Bill: the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Local Government. In addition to that it is necessary to transmit the orders, when they are made, by post to the various local authorities and also to notify the <Col N="132" /> various authorities of the enactment of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly I do not like this situation developing in the Seanad where we are put in the position of having, willy-nilly, to co-operate with a shortened timetable.  This has occurred on a number of occasions in the past, as Senators will be aware.  I think when I occupied the seat opposite I co-operated on each occasion, but it was not something I did entirely without protest.  However Senators will be aware that there is urgency of a particular vital nature in this case.  It is not a situation for which any Member of the Seanad is responsible for having allowed develop.  It is no business of mine to suggest why we are put in this situation, but I do know that the Minister was anxious to avoid it.  In fact it was not avoided and we are faced with that situation.  I would earnestly appeal for co-operation to meet this stringent timetable we have in front of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole business of summoning the Seanad to a meeting at 10.30 a.m. by telegram must be avoided.  It is a question of the Government ordering their business in a more orderly fashion. We are anxious to co-operate here, but unless a mockery is going to be made of Parliament something must be done by the Government to introduce their business in a more orderly fashion.  The behaviour of the Government in their approach to legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas in recent months has been disgraceful.  There is no other word for it.  It is the height of incompetence. For a Government alleged to possess some brains, the manner in which the ordinary day-to-day business of legislation has been ordered for debate, discussion and amendment before the Houses of the Oireachtas, is appalling.  This is just another example of that.  If the priorities were got right by the Government this is the matter we should have been discussing weeks ago, instead of the &ldquo;gerrymander&rdquo; Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious Bill.  I am in agreement with it in many respects but there are many aspects which my <Col N="133" /> party would like to see improved by way of positive amendment.  I should like to emphasise that we are willing to meet the deadline of the Minister if he listens to reasonable proposals put forward by us.  There is no reason why the Minister cannot accept reasonable amendments between now and 2 o'clock.  I will be specific and refer to one amendment which he refused to accept in the Dáil, a matter which caused all the delay in the Dáil. On the &ldquo;gerrymander&rdquo; Bill he refused to accept our amendment on the Report Stage although he could have accepted it.</P>
    <P>Similarly on this Bill we had a very reasoned amendment put down by Deputy Molloy in the Dáil, relating to page 12 of the Bill.  That amendment, in effect, sought to exclude certain officers of a local authority, clerical officers, from qualification.  That was a very reasoned amendment because on its merits it had much to commend itself in that it removed any outrageous situation.</P>

      <P>The Senator has given us notice of his amendment and I do not want him to go into detail on it at this stage.  We are discussing the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. What I want to emphasise at this stage is that unless this amendment is acceptable or there is some move by the Minister towards accepting an amendment of that nature, we are going to stay here and debate this Bill all day today on the Second Stage. We will then have Committee and Report Stages because the Bill itself is not urgent for the purpose of holding the local elections.  We can hold the local elections without the Bill. We do not want to make a charade out of Parliament.  We have a very reasoned amendment and I will not go into the merits of it yet but unless there is real consideration given to it we are going to sit here and have a full parliamentary debate on this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go over the ground covered by Senator Lenihan.  Senator O'Higgins, if I understood him correctly, hinted that the <Col N="134" /> reason why consideration of this Bill was so long delayed was due to legislative business.  He delicately skated over any precise description.  The implication, I think, was that because of the prolonged debates in the other House, and to a limited extent in this House, on the Constituencies Bill, it was not possible to take this particular Bill sooner.  If that was what was in his mind he ought to have made it quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it shorten it if I said it was not in my mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I am unable to find out what was in his mind.  The fact is we will get down to the straightforward position about this Bill.  The First Reading of this Bill was moved, as I understand it, on the 9th May, 1974, when it was ordered by Dáil Éireann to be printed.  More than 12 months ago the Minister knew, when he took the decision to postpone the local elections which had been scheduled for June, 1973, that the elections would be held in 1974 and in the second half of June.  He knew, in other words, the exact date of the local elections to within, perhaps, seven days over a year ago.</P>
      <P>On 9th May, 1974, the First Stage of this Bill was moved after which the Bill was circulated.  I am at a loss to understand what the cause of the delay was.  There are many reasons one could suggest but there is no great profit in that.  When a rush of this kind is brought about, when we are being asked to meet at 10.30 by telegram and are then told by the Leader of the House that we are expected to give all Stages of this Bill by 2 p.m., we should be given some explanation as to what caused the delay in the circulation and consideration of this Bill.  We would be very reasonable on a matter of this kind if an adequate reason were given as to why there was this delay.  No explanation, that I know of, was given here or in the other House as to what happened to this Bill during the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister had a year in which to draft, circulate and have this Bill <Col N="135" /> considered.  It is not good enough to come in, within weeks of the local elections, and say that we have to give all Stages of this Bill by 2 p.m.  We must have some reasonable explanation as to what caused this extraordinary delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the House asked for co-operation from us on this side of the House.  We have always been willing to give co-operation whenever we considered it necessary and desirable but a situation such as this&mdash;trying to rush a very important Bill through the House in an hour or two&mdash;shows the type of muddled thinking and lack of planning and co-operation on behalf of the Government so far as legislation in general is concerned.</P>
      <P>There has been a tremendous scarcity of legislation since the Government took office.  This Bill has been brought in at a very late hour despite the fact that it is seven years since local elections were held, and that everybody knew that local elections were due last year.  I cannot for the life of me see what the Government have been doing in this respect but at the last minute they try to rush through legislation and ask for our co-operation.  It is asking a bit much and it shows the ordinary individual, and the workers in particular, that this Government have not much idea of planning legislation or giving sufficient time to the Opposition to ensure that any legislation being put through is thoroughly debated.  We have already had many instances of the guillotine. This treatment of Members on this side of the House is scandalous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, like the previous speaker, find myself in great difficulty.  From the point of view of travelling, because I happened to be in the city last night, my position was less arduous than that of other Senators.  I understand most Members were called by wire.  On inquiry this morning in the Clerk's office, I found Members got a warning notice early last Friday.  I was not at home when that came, but I did get to know that <Col N="136" /> the House was meeting this morning at 10.30 a.m.</P>
      <P>This is a very important piece of legislation.  No matter how the Leader of the House may try to convince us that one can deal adequately with a Bill like this just in a matter of hours, nothing could be further from the truth.  I refrained from speaking on the Constituency Bill, notwithstanding the fact that I was tempted very often to do so.  I have no less than 32 years experience of local government.  I give myself credit for average intelligence. No intelligent person I have ever met in local government, or who is associated with local government, would ever dream of giving this right to clerical officers.  I think that is what they are described as&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is exactly what I am speaking about and it would not take a very deep X-ray to find that out.  Actually this House is being treated with a sort of contempt that one might associate with a Punch and Judy show.  This is not an urban council, or town commissioners or even a county council.  It is a legislative body.</P>
      <P>I just do not agree with the fact that you are going to rush this Bill through in a matter of hours.  I think that the House should adjourn until three o'clock the hour at which it was originally intended to sit.  When we were on the Government side of the House, the Leader of the House then was continually criticised for undue delay.  Now we have undue haste. Which do we prefer?  I would prefer undue delay rather than undue haste. I therefore cannot agree with rushing this piece of legislation through in a particular number of hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirleach, last Thursday evening when the Whips met to discuss the Order of <Col N="137" /> Business for Friday morning the question of when we would sit in connection with this Bill came up.  I agreed that we would sit on Wednesday morning at 10.30 a.m.  However since then there were some changes.  First of all, when the Seanad adjourned on Friday it adjourned <i>sine die.</i>  We, in the Fianna Fáil Party believed then that it was not meeting at 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday but would meet at 3 o'clock.</P>
      <P>Telegrams were sent out yesterday. The telegram arrived at my house at about three o'clock.  I was away from home at the time.  I could not be contacted by phone and I did not return home until ten o'clock last night.  I am just wondering how many more Senators were placed in the same position. Even if they got the message at three o'clock yesterday afternoon it could not have been that easy for some to be here at 10.30 this morning. We met last week at 10.30 a.m.  We had no objection to that because we knew well in advance and most of us were in town from the night before.</P>
      <P>I protest again against this 10.30 a.m. meeting.  We should adjourn now until three o'clock.  We are placed in the awkward position that we have very few of our Senators in the House.  I do not imagine that they will be here before lunch time.</P>
      <P>Of course, as our Leader has said, if the Minister were prepared to accept the one amendment that we are anxious to have inserted in the Bill we would agree definitely to meeting at 10.30 a.m. and we would give him the Bill straight away.  Probably the Minister is not in favour of doing that and is not in a position to answer just yet.</P>

      <P>On a very brief point of explanation, I gave the wrong date for introduction of the Bill in the Dáil. It was a couple of weeks earlier but that in no way invalidates the point I was making.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Yeats made that correction and I will, I am sure, be corrected if I am wrong on this point: I understand that one of the reasons for the delay was that the Minister very graciously co-operated with the Opposition in the <Col N="138" /> Dáil and delayed the discussion for a week there in order to suit the convenience of the Opposition and, but for the Minister's graciousness in that respect, this Bill would have been before us earlier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lenihan is gaining the reputation of the great protester.  I recall that last week we had vehement protests about not ordering business.  We were reprimanded severely; we were told that there was all sorts of business on the Order Paper and why not take it? When we did take it there was immediate opposition from Fianna Fáil, they objected to taking any business in the absence of a Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a Minister here today.  I simply make the point.  If I am wrong, no doubt I will be corrected.  As regards any other reasons Senator Yeats or other Senators may like to hear about, I am quite sure that the Minister can answer for himself regarding the timetable and give whatever explanations are necessary.  I have some sympathy with the point of view that, in view of the fact that the local elections are imminent and that nominations are tomorrow, it might have been possible to arrange for this discussion earlier. Irrespective of whatever views and feelings I may have on the matter, if the Senators opposite do not mind taking a word of advice, I think this is something about which they should not talk too loudly.  The fact is that away back 13 years ago the courts of this country decided that the petition court which was in existence in relation to local elections was unconstitutional. That was in 1961.  Nothing was done about remedying that situation until the present Government took office.  So do not talk too loudly about delays and laches as regards legislation because that is something to my mind that should have been remedied by three successive Fianna Fáil Governments <Col N="139" /> and nothing was done about it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that Senators opposite can either decide that this Bill should be available to the people in relation to these elections or they can endeavour to stop that process.  As far as this side of the House and the Government are concerned we feel that the Bill should be available to the people and we will make every effort to ensure that this will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry if the Deputies opposite feel that they cannot co-operate in this. I do not think I have asked very frequently for co-operation.  When I occupied Senator Lenihan's seat I was <Col N="140" /> frequently asked for co-operation and I think that where a case was made for it it was certainly given.  It may sound dramatic to talk about the Seanad being summoned by telegram. It is not the first time this happened. On this occasion it was summoned by telegram in order to pass legislation which is of considerable importance to the people in connection with the local elections.  It is open legislation.  It is legislation which is liberal in the sense that it is expanding the field so far as local government candidates are concerned. On the last occasion on which the Seanad was summoned by telegram I do not think the particular type of legislation which the then Government asked us to discuss fell into the same category.  My recollection is that it was the Fianna Fáil Offences Against the State Act.</P>

    <Title>Local Elections (Petitions and Disqualifications) Bill, 1974: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill falls into two parts: sections 1 to 22 deal with election petitions and the remaining sections with the removal of membership disqualifications and related matters.  The provisions of the Bill are dealt with very fully in the explanatory memorandum circulated with it.</P>
      <P>The procedure for dealing with local election petitions was contained mainly in the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, and the Municipal Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Practices) Act, 1884.  Under this law the court for the trial of a local election petition consisted of a barrister, of at least 15 years' standing, appointed by the judges on a rota for the trial of parliamentary election petitions.  In February, 1961, the High Court ruled that this election court was unconstitutional on the grounds that it purported to exercise judicial powers in criminal matters and that the exercise of such powers by authorities other than the courts is expressly prohibited by the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill, local election petitions will be tried by the Circuit Court.  The system generally will be similar to that which existed under the former law.  The new system will be specifically related to proportional representation and some outdated procedures will be dropped.  The Bill does not deal with parliamentary election petitions.  This particular branch of the law has not been found to be unconstitutional and appeared to work relatively satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will remove the disqualifications for membership of a local authority on the grounds of being an alien, a person in holy orders or holding <Col N="142" /> an office of profit under the authority. The disqualification of aliens is contained in the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1898.  Aliens have the right to vote at local elections and it is only logical that they should also have the right to become members of a local authority if they enjoy sufficient popular support.  The disqualification for membership of local authorities on persons in holy orders and ministers of religion which goes back to 1840 appears to contravene Article 44.2.3º of the Constitution which provides that: &ldquo;The State shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is a double barrier which prevents a local authority employee becoming a member of the local authority. A person is disqualified for membership if he holds any paid office or place of profit under or in the gift of the authority, other than the office of mayor.  This applies also to committees of agriculture and vocational education committees.  In addition, the Local Government Act, 1955, provides that no person may hold any office of profit under or be employed for remuneration by or under a local authority while he is a member of that authority.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the electoral disqualification will be removed altogether and provision is made whereby the restriction on employment of members may be lifted in relation to particular classes of employees. Orders will be made by the appropriate Ministers specifying the classes of employees which will be so exempted.  Each such order will be a statutory instrument and will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution of either House within 21 sitting days after being so laid.  Any order proposed to be made on or after 1st July, 1975 will require approval in draft by both House of the Oireachtas before it can be made.  The intention is that generally the restriction would be lifted for all employees except those holding fairly senior posts and others involved in policy matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> My intention would be to remove the restriction on employment in relation to all employees who are not officers&mdash;these are in the main manual workers&mdash;and in relation to all officers other than certain categories whose duties are such that it would be inappropriate to remove the restriction in their case.  The offices in relation to which the restriction would still apply would in general be all administrative staff down to but not including the rank of clerical officer, all town clerks, all professional staff, library staff down to and including the level of assistant librarian, certain officers of fire brigades, certain outdoor offices of clerk of works, inspector and assistant inspector and analogous grades, rate collector, rent collector, rate inspector, rent inspector, housing welfare officer, means investigation officer, social worker, and, where employed under county councils and county borough councils, assistance officer and superintendent assistance officer.  These are the categories of officer on which the restriction would remain.  The principal classes of offices from which the restriction would be lifted are the grades of clerical officer, library assistant, branch librarian, storekeeper and draughtsman.  As already mentioned, it would be lifted also from all employees who are not officers.  To reduce the matter to figures it is estimated that of the 30,000 persons employed by local authorities, only about 3,000 will remain subject to the restriction on employment under the 1955 Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education would propose to lift the restriction in relation to all employees of vocational education committees who are not officers, clerical staff up to and including clerical officer and vocational teachers.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries would lift the restriction for all employees of committees of agriculture except professional staff and clerical staff above the rank of clerical officer.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Senators will welcome this opening up of the field of eligibility for local authority membership <Col N="144" /> which is in line with the general principle enunciated by the Joint Committee on the Electoral Law 14 years ago in relation to membership of the Oireachtas, that an individual should be prevented from putting himself forward for election only for the gravest and most compelling reasons of public policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill that needs to be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas and discussed in a legitimate and open fashion.  It is a Bill which has, I know, been worked on in the Department of Local Government for some time.  It should be open to positive amendment and improvement by the people best equipped to deal with a Bill of this kind&mdash;practising politicians who are Members of the Dáil and the Seanad. It is ideally a Bill that we should have here for deep and mature consideration. It is the very type of Bill that should not be rushed through the House.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the House, Senator O'Higgins, made an outrageous comparison when he compared the urgency surrounding this Bill with the urgency surrounding the passage of the Offences Against the State Bill which is still an Act and still being implemented as law by the present Government.  Matters dealing with the security of the State surmount everything else in importance.  These matters have, inevitably, to be rushed through the Houses of Parliament in this and in every other democratic country.  That is an essential and fundamental matter in which everything else is dropped, as it were, in the interests of the overall security of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not that type of Bill.  Let us get that clear.  This is a practical Bill of some importance.  Most of it is welcome but it can be improved, added to and given mature consideration by this House.  That is the purpose of this House and the Dáil is also there for the same purpose.  It can be rounded into a legislative measure that can give real effect and improvement to our local government structure.  Why the rush in regard to it?  The local elections can be held <Col N="145" /> without it.  There is no doubt about that.  There is no compelling reason why we should sit here and pass this Bill by 2 o'clock because nominations for the local elections are imminent. The local elections can proceed.  We do not want this Bill for that purpose.</P>
    <P>We, on this side, have some positive amendments to the Bill which we consider would improve it.  I mentioned one amendment when we were discussing the Order of Business.  I received my telegram this morning&mdash; I was away yesterday evening&mdash;and I just flicked through the Bill and immediately I saw a number of positive matters which I suggest could be improved.  The Seanad should fulfil its proper function by having a day on Committee Stage and allow Senators to put forward amendments and to make a case for the amendments.  I am sure they would be met by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we have a sensible Second Stage debate today, adjourn for a week&mdash;as we always do&mdash;have a Committee Stage debate, adjourn for another week, have a Report Stage debate and let the local elections proceed accordingly.  I should like to hear, straightforwardly, from the Minister, can the local elections proceed without this Bill?  They can. There really is no answer to that.  The Minister knows as well as I know that this is true, that the local elections can proceed without this Bill.  Why can we not have a sensible, practical debate about this measure, suggest improvements, put down amendments and have them debated?  This is what the legislative process is all about. This is why we are taking a stand on this issue.  We want this Bill debated in a normal, sensible, practical way by this House as a legislative Chamber. We see no need whatever for the unseemly rush.</P>
    <P>If the Minister states that he must have the Bill in order that the local government elections take place, that is a different day's work.  There is logic in that.  I can say in answer to that, it is due to Government incompetence that the Bill is brought in on the eve of the local elections.  At least <Col N="146" /> there is a logic in the situation if the Minister can tell me that he needs this Bill in order that people can be nominated for the local elections or in order that local elections take place. I would criticise that attitude and say that if it is so important and urgent, why did the Minister not bring in the Bill much earlier than this?  However, I would grant the Minister and the Government some credit for logic in that if they want the Bill urgently in order that the local elections can take place that is a point of view.  There may have been incompetence, there may have been stupid delays, or mismanagement of the country's affairs in regard to the legislative programme before the Houses of the Oireachtas. It may have been any of these things but it is understandable and we can have a debate about it.  The Minister has a point of view if the Bill is necessary for the purpose of nomination and election in regard to local authorities.</P>
    <P>The date for the local elections has been fixed for 18th June.  We appreciate that nominations are imminent. If this Bill is needed for that purpose, the Minister should make that case and we could debate that matter.  But this Bill is not necessary for that purpose. This is a Bill rectifying a number of anomalies in local government legislation and qualifications that have existed over a number of years.  As I said earlier, in broad principle I agree with the Bill.  It is a Bill that can be improved very substantially.  Members of the Seanad are entitled to put forward their points of view as to how it can be improved.  We can have a sensible Second Stage debate today, the Committee Stage next week and the Report Stage the following week. The Bill is not necessary for the purpose of local elections.  Why the haste?</P>
    <P>I should like to say that there is something in the Minister's temperament that I do not like.  I do not understand the reasons.  We had the same attitude in regard to the Constituencies Bill.  A very reasonable amendment, which the Minister conceded in the Dáil as having merit, was not adopted in this House.  We, on this side, made it plain that it was <Col N="147" /> just one amendment which we considered highly reasonable, and which the Minister by implication agreed in the Dáil as reasonable, and yet it was not accepted.  This is an extraordinary attitude.  I pointed out, when I was speaking on the Order of Business, that again, even at this late stage, there is no reason why a reasonable amendment or amendments could not be adopted by the Minister.  There is no difficulty, the printing press is standing by, in getting a reasonable amendment put in.  I should like to know, why the rush?  Why the unseemly haste?  Is this a matter of a Minister of State bulldozing for the sake of bulldozing?  I can understand the Minister bulldozing, it has to be done sometimes in the public interest. Where the security of the State is involved it is very understandable.  Why this attitude, having Senators summoned by telegram, to have the whole Bill finished by 2 o'clock in the afternoon? It must be law by then.  Why, especially when, and I reiterate the point, it is not necessary for the purpose of nomination or the holding of local elections?</P>
    <P>The Bill itself in many respects is one that is necessary as I have stated already.  Certainly the statutory procedure for questioning a local election by petition to the Circuit Court has been necessary for some time, since the High Court ruling in 1961. It is a matter, which the Minister knows, that is a very unlikely sort of occurence; it is basically a legal tidying up of the whole procedure relating to local petitions that existed in various pieces of legislation dating back to the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882 and the Municipal Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Practices) Act, 1884.  The procedure of petition was found in 1961 to be unconstitutional in that there was a particular tribunal appointed under these Acts that was exercising judicial power, and the court found in 1961 that this was a judicial procedure appropriate to the courts rather than to any particular non-judicial tribunal. It is a welcome improvement.</P>
    <P>I want to put the matter in perspective: <Col N="148" /> that is all that is about. A main part of the early sections of the Bill relate precisely to this area of electoral petition.  It is a legal matter of tidying up the law in accordance with the High Court decision. It is not of any great importance but it is welcome.  It is making judicial a matter that should be judicial, bringing within the compass of the Circuit Court a matter that was there under a non-judicial tribunal. That is all there is to it.  I should like to know, just as a matter of interest, taking a layman's attitude instead of a lawyer's attitude, when was the last petition.  I certainly have no recollection of any such petition under the old statutory procedure in recent years although there may have been one or two.  I want to put the matter in perspective, that it is just making legal and constitutional what was held by the High Court specifically in 1961 to be unconstitutional, by reason of vesting this particular petition procedure in a non-judicial tribunal.  What we are doing now is vesting it in the Circuit Court.  This is hardly a matter that should be bulldozed through the Seanad before 2 o'clock in the afternoon.  It is a matter on which we could have some excellent advice from legal, constitutional lawyers and academic Members of the House.  It is a matter in which the Seanad could go in some detail at its leisure and perhaps suggest improvements.  I cannot suggest any improvement but, other Members of the House, particularly Independent Members with some expertise in this area, might have improvements to suggest.  However, there is no great reason why we should be rushing that aspect of the Bill before 2 o'clock.</P>
    <P>The petition procedure is not likely to be invoked after these local elections because it was not invoked after the last local elections nor under the previous local elections.</P>
    <P>Then, there is the removal of disqualification for membership of local authorities in the case of ministers of religion.  This is a welcome improvement. It is one of the healthier features of European life that clerics of all denominations are entitled to <Col N="149" /> stand for and sit not only on local authorities but in the Houses of Parliament. This was an outdated procedure dating back to an age of prejudice. I welcome its removal.  It may not be of great moment.  I cannot see many of our clerics seeking election to local authorities.  This might happen in four or eight years' time.  It is not a matter of such urgency to summon the Seanad by telegram and seek to have legislation passed before 2 o'clock today.  It is not a bulldozing matter that clerics be made eligible for membership of local authorities. I welcome this without understanding the urgency.</P>
    <P>The third main matter in the Bill is to remove the disqualification for membership of local authorities, committees of agriculture and vocational education committees on the grounds of being an alien or of holding an office of profit or being employed under the body concerned.</P>
    <P>The fourth matter in the Bill is to provide a procedure whereby categories of employees of local authorities, committees of agriculture and vocational education committees may become members of the authority employing them without forfeiting their employment.  This is an area in which practical amendments may be put down.  We have positive views concerning this and practical amendments which we hope can be formulated during the week and put down on Committee Stage next week.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension set out by the Minister in his speech in the categories involved who are not officers. It is clear this can be done.  It concerns mainly manual workers and officers in local authorities where there is no conflict between their duties and their representation or local authorities. That is agreed.  With regard to the area of conflict between duty and membership, certain views were put forward in the Dáil.  In this House we wish to put forward some views also. We can outline them in general principle on the Second Stage and they can be specified more positively in an amendment on Committee Stage next week.</P>
    <P>I am proceeding with this debate <Col N="150" /> on the basis that we are not finishing at 2 o'clock, that we are having a Second Stage debate today, that we are having a Committee Stage debate next week and a Report Stage debate the following week.  This is legislation which should be considered in a deliberative and constructive manner by the House.  I am disregarding the outrageous notice that a serious Bill, which requires mature consideration, needs to be bulldozed through before 2 o'clock today.  I will treat the matter on its merits.</P>
    <P>If I received any indication from the Minister that this Bill was necessary in order that the local elections be held on 18th June, in order that nominations should take place and that the election should proceed, I would go along with him.  Having made my contribution, I would agree to all Stages going through this House if he tells me that this is essential and that the local elections cannot take place otherwise.  Having had no indication to that effect I will proceed to deal with this Bill on the basis that we are now on the Second Stage, that we will have Committee Stage next week and Report Stage the following week.  On that approach to the Bill I should like to discuss the question of qualification.  In the Minister's introductory speech he emphasised that in regard to extending the range of qualifications:</P>
    <P>The intention is that generally the restriction would be lifted for all employees except those holding fairly senior posts and others involved in policy matters.</P>
    <P>He rightly goes on to state:</P>
    <P>... all officers other than certain categories whose duties are such that it would be inappropriate to remove the restriction in their case.</P>
    <P>They should be allowed to stand for local elections and allowed to sit on local authority bodies.  He goes on to state:</P>
    <P>The offices in relation to which the restriction would still apply that is where conflict exists between duty and membership would in general be all administrative staff <Col N="151" /> down to but not including the rank of clerical officer, all town clerks, all professional staff, library staff, down to and including the level of assistant librarian, certain officers of fire brigades, certain outdoor offices of clerk of works, inspector and assistant inspector and analogous grades, rate collector, rent collector, rate inspector, rent inspector, housing welfare officer, means investigation officer, social worker, and, where employed on the county councils and county borough councils, assistance officer and superintendent assistance officer.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that we in this House may have a different view on how an amendment should be phrased on Committee Stage.  On the previous Bill concerning the constituencies, we put down amendments which were not quite in line with the Dáil amendments.  We would have to consider the amendments put down by Deputy Molloy.  The first amendment is the one which concerns us.  The Minister refused to accept it on Report Stage and Committee Stage in the Dáil.  It relates to the clerical officer category of employment in local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister has served for some time on local authorities.  He is fully aware that a clerical officer in a local authority has a very valid area of discretion and decision-making in regard to pertinent matters relating to local government.  These concern administration under various headings. In reading the Dáil debates it appeared the Minister decried the fact that county council or corporation members would have to consult a clerical officer in regard to certain matters.  He apparently felt that the councillor concerned should go to some higher authority within the county council administration who would deal with his affairs.</P>
    <P>I was a member of a local authority and this was not my experience. In many cases one was concerned about injustices being done in regard to road matters, and particularly health and housing.  If a matter can <Col N="152" /> be rectified quickly one does not automatically go to the county manager and the county secretary.  As a Minister representing a constituency I have gone in and discussed matters of this nature with a clerical officer in the health or housing sections of a local authority.  The Minister is well aware that this is common practice on the part of local authority members.</P>
    <P>The clerical officer has a real part to play.  He happens to be a person who is handling files and who could give information to a member of a local authority, and who can and does draft the letter which eventually goes up for the secretary's signature, or the county manager's signature.  It is at clerical officer level in many cases in local authorities that the basic decisions are taken.  Are we to have a situation in which that person can become a member of his or her local authority, a person intimately involved in an aspect of administration which basically affects many people's lives and interests?</P>
    <P>I shall take housing as one example. If a clerical officer in the housing section of a local authority is amenable, he can exercise a very real and positive discretion in regard to making decisions.  We could have a situation in which if that person&mdash;to put it at its extreme aspect, and that is written into the Bill&mdash;became a member of a local authority, he could be phrasing, or dictating, or suggesting, the sort of reply that should go to councillor A.  Clerical officer A can help to decide in regard to a housing matter what county councillor A wants to hear.  That is what the Bill means as it now stands.  A clerical officer in Limerick County Council or Meath County Council, in the housing section of these local authorities or in any area, can, if he or she becomes a member of the local authority, be in a position in which he or she is deciding on housing allocations.  That will be of importance as far as that clerical officer's constituents are concerned <i>vis-a-vis</i> membership of a local authority.  Is that desirable or undersirable.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to meet a <Col N="153" /> positive point of view here.  He has put down a number of categories that are excluded for the very reason I have mentioned&mdash;a real conflict of interest&mdash;and many of these categories do not have anything like the discretionary power or the same interest in a sensitive area concerning the public or concerning representation on local authorities which clerical officers have.</P>
    <P>Let us take library staff for an example.  The Minister is as well aware as I am of the position of library staff.  Library staffing is not a matter of day to day political interest. It is an important cultural matter beyond politics, and a matter that does not need to be dealt with in this manner of exclusion.  I do not see the logic in excluding library people and including clerical officers.  I should imagine that the clerical officer in the housing section of any local authority has a far higher degree of conflict of interest than any member of the staff of the library right up to the top librarian position in any local authority. The whole library area is excluded from politics.  I cannot imagine a situation in which any member of the library staff, right up to the rank of librarian, would in any way be involved in a day-to-day conflict <i>vis-a-vis</i> membership of a local authority. I respect the Minister's wisdom in the matter.  The point I want to make is that a clerical officer in a housing department of any local authority is in a far more sensitive area than a librarian in charge of the library system of a local authority.</P>
    <P>I could make the same point in regard to rate collectors.  I am not making the point there because I can see wisdom in the exclusion of rate collectors.  I am trying to be totally fair and dispassionate here.  I see wisdom in excluding anybody concerned with the handling of money. In that respect I agree with the exclusion of everybody in the rate collecting, rent collecting and assistance officer category.  The Minister is absolutely right to exclude these people.  There is an obvious and straightforward conflict here and, on that aspect, the Bill is welcome.  I do <Col N="154" /> not understand why people who can be in a very sensitive position as clerical officers are not added to the list of exclusions.  I made my position quite clear on the Order of Business. Would the Minister intervene in the debate at this stage and indicate that he will bring in an amendment along the lines suggested by Deputy Molloy in the Dáil in which he proposed that in page 12, lines 42 and 43, a new subsection should be included, subsection (2)?  I quote:</P>
    <P>An order made under this section shall not exclude an employee who is a member of the administrative staff down to and including the rank of clerical officer from the operation of section 21 (1) of the Local Government Act, 1955.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy had a further amendment down which I will not press at this stage.  If we could get an indication now that an amendment along the lines suggested by Deputy Molloy will be accepted, I would then recommend to the members of my group that we give the Minister all Stages today, even though the procedure is highly undesirable.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is going to flout parliamentary democracy in a Bill which is not essential for the purpose of nomination and for the purpose of holding the local elections, we will also say that the Minister will go through the Parliamentary mill.  That is what Houses of Parliament are for. The Minister will sit here and hear out the Second Stage.  He will sit here in a week's time and hear out the Committee Stage.  He will sit here the week after that and hear out the Report Stage.  We will have practical amendments of the kind I mentioned put down to him.</P>
    <P>I should like some eludication from the Minister on the question of vocational teachers.  Representations have been made to me in regard to vocational teachers being allowed to sit on vocational education bodies.  Has the Minister had any representations in that regard?  There is a strong case that they should be represented on vocational education bodies.  I appreciate <Col N="155" /> that the restriction is being lifted as stated by the Minister:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education would propose to lift the restriction in relation to all employees of vocational education committees who are not officers, clerical staff up to and including clerical officer and vocational teachers.</P>
    <P>That permits vocational teachers to be members of a local authority.  Does it permit them to be members of a vocational education committee?  This is a matter on which strong representations have been made to me by members of the vocational teachers profession.  In a situation in which national teachers are allowed to sit on vocational education committees at present, school managers and members of the clergy are allowed to sit on vocational education committees, secondary teachers are allowed to sit on vocational education committees why cannot vocational teachers be allowed to sit on vocational education committees?</P>
    <P>The Minister may reply by saying that the secondary teacher or the primary teacher, or the clerical manager, is not employed by the vocational education committee.  In these days of comprehensive education that seems to me&mdash;and I would anticipate this to be the official reply&mdash;to be rather spurious in its reasoning.  As far as education today is concerned, it is all integrated and comprehensive.  Primary, second and vocational levels are tending to be co-ordinated into a comprehensive scheme of education.  Therefore, if secondary teachers, national teachers and school managers are all sitting on a vocational education committee and vocational teachers are excluded, that appears to be anomalous in this day and age.  We are concerned with a Bill that is broadly a liberalising measure and I would ask the Minister to look into what type of amendment can be devised to allow vocational teachers, not alone to be members of local authorities as is guaranteed under the Bill, but also to be members of a vocational education committee on which they can give <Col N="156" /> advice from their own expertise and knowledge.  It is a matter which, if we are allowed to have a proper Committee Stage, we will certainly be considering between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>That is a matter which was not raised in the Dáil to any great extent and about which I would be personally concerned with here having got very strong representations from the body representing vocational teachers. I also, have had very strong representations from a number of vocational teachers who are anxious to make a contribution towards this area of education.  They are especially qualified to make a contribution which is at the moment being given by national and secondary teachers and clerical managers.  An amendment of section 24 could be devised to meet this aspect which I have mentioned.  Again, that is a matter which we should like to consider between now and Committee Stage&mdash; an amendment to section 24 that would incorporate this category of people and allow them to sit on vocational education committees.  It is rather interesting that I do not hear members of the Labour Party being active in this particular cause, because, as I say, the trade union representing vocational teachers have approached me in the matter.  A number of their members have also approached me on the desirability of allowing them to be members of vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>The other matter which I would ask the Minister to consider very seriously, which was debated at length in the Dáil, is the real desirability of incorporating an amendment on the lines of the amendment suggested by Deputy Molloy in the other House related to clerical officers.  They have a very real function in a very sensitive area of local democracy, and having regard to the list of people whom the Minister has excluded from eligibility, this particular category would certainly merit exclusion.  I mentioned the extreme case of some members of library staffs who are excluded.  I see no sensitivity whatever in 99.9 per cent of their relations with the general <Col N="157" /> public.  I see an awful lot of sensitivity and a high degree of danger, of conflict of interest, in regard to the relationship existing between clerical officers in sensitive areas, such as housing departments of local authorities, and the general public and members of local authorities&mdash;a very real danger and a conflict of interest where you have a clerical officer in that situation who is also a member of a local authority where he or she is concerned with the allocation of houses and he or she happens to be a member of the local authority as well, concerned with the allocation of houses.  I do not have to spell out in a political chamber the very real degree of conflict which can arise in that sort of relationship.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to emphasise that if the Minister is reasonable we will be reasonable.  I do not understand the rush, what the bulldozing is about or why this Bill has to be passed before 2 o'clock.  If the Minister, for some obscure reason, wants the Bill before 2 o'clock, we will give it to him if he gives an assurance of an amendment along the lines I have mentioned relating to clerical officers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to refer to something which happened here this morning.  The Leader of the House referred to the urgency for this Bill.  I also want to protest because the Seanad has been summoned by telegram.  I know there is nothing unusual in that and that public representatives should be prepared for urgent meetings, but it is unreasonable to expect Members to get here at such short notice to debate an important issue such as this.  This is something which should not have happened.  We consider this a very important piece of legislation.  I want to register a protest in that respect.  I came from Killeshandra. It was easy enough for me to get here.  Nevertheless, I only got here on time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to previous occasions when the Houses of the Oireachtas were got together by telegram.  That is not unusual, but I think the comparisons which were made were very unfair.  The only time I can recall being summoned here by telegram was to discuss some important <Col N="158" /> piece of legislation pertaining to the State itself.  This is certainly not in this category.</P>
    <P>Secondly, to arrive here and learn that this must be through by 2 o'clock was something which would shake the confidence of anybody in the usefulness of the second House of the Oireachtas, or, indeed, of parliamentary procedure in general.  No attempt whatever should be made at any time to prevent elected representatives of either House of the Oireachtas from debating any matter pertaining to important legislation. This certainly is an attempt to do that.  I cannot see any urgency whatever in this piece of legislation.  If it is contended that there was urgency, surely there was 18 months of this present Government's activity in which to prepare and present this legislation to either House of the Oireachtas.  That has not been done. An attempt has now been made to rush through this at a very late hour.</P>
    <P>I freely admit that anything any Minister can do at any time to improve the general structure of local authorities and increase their efficiency in any way is to be commended. If an attempt has been made here&mdash; and rightly so, I think&mdash;to extend local authority candidature to a wider category and to enable more categories of people to offer themselves in local elections, that is to be commended. County council work has become so complicated and so involved that it requires a fair standard of intelligence for representatives to keep abreast of present day legislation and to keep themselves sufficiently well informed to be able to take part in an intelligent way in affairs at local level.  The tendency has been more or less to give them extra power.  I would go a long way with that reasoning because the people who are working and have lived all their lives in a locality are closely in touch with the people among whom they live and work.  They certainly would have a tremendous grasp of the problems that are important to their electors.</P>
    <P>I can see no earthly reason whatever for this unnatural rush in this <Col N="159" /> piece of legislation.  The fact is that we have not had local government elections for the past seven years.  It was evident to the Government that elections would be held this year and they should accordingly have made legislative provision for them.  It was up to the Minister, if he had these changes in mind, to have brought in this piece of legislation 12 months ago, if it was so important and meant so much to local authorities and to the people in general.  There is no valid reason whatever why they did not bring in this piece of legislation at an earlier date.  My main protest is that, having discussed the Bill in Dáil Éireann, they should come along and expect us to rush it through in a day. If it is so important, it should not be bulldozed and steamrolled through the second House of the Oireachtas in a matter of hours.</P>
    <P>One would think these are the only local government elections to be held in the future.  I cannot see why failure to enact this Bill today should affect the present local elections that are planned, because this legislation would in no way interfere with the holding of the elections.  The election date has already been set.  I admit that nominations are due on Thursday but it would not make any difference whatever except that those categories listed here by the Minister would be excluded. That has been happening for a long time.  Surely, in making a choice between these categories, he should have known that there would have been some opposition while, in the main, there would be general agreement. The wider you make the field and the greater choice you give the people, the better, probably, for legislation and the better performance you will get.</P>
    <P>At the same time it is asking quite a bit to expect everybody here to sit mute and to allow this to pass through in a matter of a couple of hours.  I am almost sure&mdash;not that I deem myself a prophet&mdash;that very few Members of the Government will take part in this debate in any form.  The reason for that will be that they were probably asked to keep as mute as mice <Col N="160" /> in a church.  They will keep their mouths closed tightly so that nothing will delay this Bill in so far as the deadline of 2 o'clock is concerned.  I will also admit freely that there are many Members of the Government&mdash; despite the fact that they may not agree with me politically&mdash;who are intelligent people.  I would welcome some contributions from the people on the other side of the House.  Indeed I know many of them on the other side of the House who are old and respected members of local authorities. They have given very good service on them; they know local government from A to Z.  I am sure the same could be said of the Minister himself whom I know to have served a long period in his native County Meath and he rendered good service there.</P>
    <P>What worries us on this side of the House is that, in so far as we can see, no amendments are to be allowed on this piece of legislation.  In other words, the Minister and the Government are saying simply &ldquo;The people in the second House of the Oireachtas have nothing worth while to contribute on this debate; there is no use in our asking or allowing them submit any amendments; it seems their intelligence would not be fit to do that.  For that reason we will ask them to steamroll this through by 2 o'clock today or, if not, we will do as we have done on many previous occasions&mdash;use the guillotine and put it through whether you like it or not&rdquo;.  I do not think that is good for democracy or legislation in any shape or form.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Bill itself is concerned, I suppose the first part of it will be accepted.  There may be room for further improvement and so on. But it is an endeavour to improve the legislation and, as such, should be welcomed.  I also welcome the fact that ministers of various types of religion are being allowed to stand as candidates in county council elections. It is only correct that they should have this right as citizens and individuals in this State.  We all must admit that they are a highly intelligent body of men on all sides and that they would be very close in <Col N="161" /> many respects to the needs of community. Their contributions and deliberations would be very enlightened and very welcome.</P>
    <P>In my own county we have had a clergyman, Canon P. O'Reilly, who has been chairman of our vocational committee for 40 years.  He has given tremendous service and certainly is very close to happenings in so far as vocational education is concerned. Senators who go to vocational congresses will have noticed Canon McCarthy of Athlone, Fr. Breen of Bray and various other clergymen taking part in the deliberations of congress and indeed acting as chairman. Bishop Hevener, D.D. of Monaghan is another who comes to mind. They have at all times put up a tremendous performance.  Their assistance has been highly valued and their contributions respected.  Therefore this section; which allows clergymen of all denominations if they so wish to offer themselves for election in local government elections, is to be welcomed.  I suppose the ban in this respect may have gone back to the evil days in the history of our State. As the Leader of our Party has already said, it is a fact that ministers and clergymen of all denominations not alone in this country but in other countries in Europe have been playing a very prominent part in the politics of their various countries.  It is only right that they should be allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not take issue whatever with that part of the legislation.  But I must say emphatically that I am not in favour of the proposal to allow certain clerical officers to become members of a local authority.  I have the height of respect for the clerical staff in my own authority in county Cavan, Clerical workers in many grades of government and county council offices all over the country do excellent work. They are highly qualified and perform their tasks very diligently and efficiently. But I respectfully submit that this proposal is placing them in a very invidious position.  I do not believe it will help in any way towards increasing the respect and confidence that the ordinary worker and citizen <Col N="162" /> would have for these clerical officers if they are now to be allowed become members of local authorities.  I have been 24 years in Cavan County Council during which time I have been dealing with many matters from the health services to hospitals&mdash;before they went out of our control&mdash;and rural improvement schemes which form a great and varied part of our work in the county council.</P>
    <P>County Cavan is a county with a great number of small lakes, hills and twisty roads; it also has a great proportion of lanes.  We have to deal a few times a week with clients who come to us regarding rural improvement schemes.  On these rural improvement schemes, as the Minister well knows, there is a local contribution apart from the contribution made by the county council.  Certain officers of the county council and personnel go out, inspect these schemes and come to a decision in a legitimate way and fair-minded manner.</P>
    <P>Very recently I had a woman from Gowra South, in Bawnboy, where a Mr. Kevin McCaffey, a Mr. O'Reilly and a few others joined together to have a particular lane tarred.  In doing that the county council made an assessment of what the scheme would cost.  They said that the local people would have to pay so much money.  There is nothing wrong with that.  Indeed I am sure the local people have accepted it.  This is the nature of the scheme since its inception. It means that somebody in the county council offices has decided that this is to be the local contribution. This is the point with which I take issue.</P>
    <P>At present nobody has any fault whatever to find with the efficiency or integrity of any of the people in the county councils dealing with this particular matter.  But it happens to be a rather sensitive matter because a local contribution is involved.  The amount of the local contribution depends on the decisions made in the county council.  I am not going to say what clerical officer does that but if I write to a county council, to the manager or to the secretary, on any of these schemes or, indeed, <Col N="163" /> on other problems I am not sure where that letter goes to.</P>
    <P>It may go right down the line to the clerical officer who will have to deal with it.  He will say &ldquo;Séamus Dolan from Killeshandra has been making inquiries about a rural improvement scheme down in Gowra South, Bawnboy, Glangevlin or Blacklion. There is nothing wrong with that.&rdquo; If the person dealing with that is a county councillor, in Séamus Dolan's area or in anybody else's area, is it not only fair to assume, human nature being what it is, that somebody will have suspicions.  Somebody will say: &ldquo;If you have a good pull with that clerical officer you will get your local contribution reduced so far as the rural improvement scheme is concerned. If you are not nice to him you will certainly get the hammer. You will not be able to get your scheme on for such an amount.&rdquo;  This is the position into which we as a legislative body are going to put ourselves. I do not think we should advocate legislation that would do anything like that.  I am not trying to insinuate or suggest that people in local authorities are in any way dishonest. I simply want to say that the temptations are there and will be there.</P>
    <P>Surely there is a wide enough choice for selecting people from any walk in life without having to take in people who are dealing financially with matters such as these.  Finance, as every Senator knows, down through the history of the world has been a very tricky problem.  There have been temptations since the world was created.  Human nature is human nature.  Even though that individual or that clerical officer is as straight as a gun barrel he would leave himself open to criticism no matter what way he made the decision.  Somebody is bound to suggest that he was doing it for such a political client, because he was Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour.  I think we should not do something like that in this day and age.</P>
    <P>I emphatically protest against any legislation that will allow such people <Col N="164" /> to stand for local authorities.  I do not think we are encroaching in any way on their rights.  There are in every State, every Government and in every county council certain officers and people in whom the State always has implicit trust.  It does not matter whether the Government change from one year to another these loyal civil servants in all walks, areas and offices remain steadfast.  They remain working on behalf of the State in the employment of whatever Government are in office.  It is to their credit that down the years, irrespective of what change of Government took place in this country, men of the calibre of clerical officers and all other officials who are in these positions have shown a tremendous fidelity and loyalty to the State.</P>
    <P>I do not think there will be any great rush by any of them into these jobs because they know the position fairly well.  It is bound in one way or another to affect them.  As a matter of fact, all civil servants and all clerical officers have some friends here and there.  One can be put in a very awkward position if somebody comes along and asks: &ldquo;What about my housing grant?  I was docked a few pounds there, I thought I should have got so much.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I deal a lot with housing grants in my county as there has been a lot of house building there, renovation of old houses and building of new ones. There is no doubt that in relation to almost every housing grant you have to communicate with the county council on the matter.  The present position is that a farmer will get £450 for a new house and £450 from the local authority.  There is a certain scaling down carried out by each local authority.  There are cases in which one must make a decision and say that particular person is not going to get exactly that.  I know we have auditors in all these places who can check and recheck.  At the same time, the official would be within his legitimate duties where he makes a decision and it would be accepted.</P>
    <P>If somebody goes to him, tries to put him in an awkward position and tries to use the intimacy and friendly <Col N="165" /> relations which he has with him to try to persuade him to lean slightly in his favour, that is wrong.  If it takes place, it will be to the detriment of the ordinary citizen.  The person I would like to protect here and whom all public representatives should protect is the underdog, the ordinary person who has very little or nothing to live on, the man with the large family who is struggling to keep his head above water, the man who is unable to get education for his children. These are the types of people that I have been championing all my life, the under-priviliged classes, in particular, because we have a duty to them.  I come from an area where thousands lived on small farms and where there were no post-primary educational facilities of any kind within a radius of 46 miles of where I was born.  It is a scandalous situation for anybody to have to admit but it is true.  Any public representative must be free.  If he is a good representative, he will criticise the officials at all levels if it is necessary.  We cannot be mealy-mouthed or softhearted about it.  We must criticise the officials if we feel that what is being done is not for the betterment of the downtrodden people.  That is the attitude I have adopted all my life.</P>
    <P>The officials are well able to stand up to it.  I think that the ordinary country person going into a county council office in Tipperary or in Donegal has not got the same standing and is not treated in the same way as an elected representative.  An individual may call at some of our offices when the manager is away as often happens&mdash;our manager often attends regional development authority meetings with me in Dundalk and Drogheda&mdash;somebody else from lower down the line is stepped up and he becomes the temporary county manager for a time.  Then there is an assistant manager or a secretary and they are also taken from the lower grades. The result is that the clerical officer is also stepped up.  When the manager returns, these people revert to their previous positions.  He might be the person that the individual who came in from the country and who <Col N="166" /> had a grievance met and had to deal with his problem.  When he went into this official he found out that he was the local county councillor, that he was the county councillor, who did not profess the same type of politics he did, that he was the county councillor who was the agent outside the school trying to get an opposition county councillor elected.  I ask what faith could any individual have in a performance such as this.  The Minister has made the selection very wide.  He has put a lot of categories into this; he has extended very liberally, and justly so, because he will bring in extra people.  At the same time, I think that he has gone a little bit too far, particularly when he includes somebody of the status of a clerical officer.</P>
    <P>I do not want people in the rural areas to have suspicions as to what might be happening in our offices in County Cavan.  I do not want to have to point a finger and say: &ldquo;That person works in the council offices as a staff officer or something else.  She or he has access to all the letters that Séamus Dolan writes into the county council and knows exactly what I have been looking for&rdquo;.  That is not fair to me or to any other county councillor irrespective of what politics he or she has.  I would not like to see any type of legislation introduced that would lower in any way the standards and efficiency of the county councils or the respect which the people have for them.  In circumstances such as these I do not think any staff officer or clerical officer will attempt to offer his services.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, in a Bill such as this anything that helps to improve the standards and structures of local government is to be commended. I am not endeavouring to tear this legislation asunder.  I am trying to ensure that the legislation we pass here will be of the utmost benefit to the community in general.  We will not do ourselves any good by trying to steamroll it through in a matter of an hour or two in this House. Reasonable amendments such as the one we have already suggested should be accepted.  Any fair-minded Minister <Col N="167" /> or Government would accept it. After all, this is legislation that will last for quite a while, and it should be designed to improve the character of local government.  As I said at the beginning, people who offer themselves for election are few and far between.  There is not that great a number of candidates to rush into the field when elections are announced. As we all know, politics is a very uncertain life.  It is really a dedication, and the men and women who offer themselves for it do so in the belief that they can help to provide legislation that will be for the betterment of the community as a whole. That is the real reason why most people enter politics.  Irrespective of how hard they work, and how much good they do, it has been the experience of many politicians all down through history that they are eventually disregarded.  They are not rewarded in any way whatever and are left out by people who once cheered them on to victory.  This is the sad part of it.  People who enter politics have very little home life.  They are away every night at meetings.  They are away every day at county council meetings, vocational meetings, agricultural meetings and various sub-committees and useful types of gatherings set up by county councils, the Government and other people and designed to improve the lot of the ordinary people who cannot attend.</P>
    <P>It is very fair and reasonable that the Minister would give a wide choice in this respect and that he would not prevent people from offering themselves for election if he is completely satisfied that that would not infringe the right of those whom those elected representatives were going to serve.  We have to be very careful in this amendment in regard to the clerical officer.  County councillors have a very important part to play in the administration of various schemes.  They are now members not alone of county councils but of various regional organisations such as the rural development association, the north-eastern development association, health boards and various other boards that have been set up and that <Col N="168" /> are doing tremendous work.  It is very important that we would get people of a very high calibre, but we also have to seek people who will be dedicated to this very important aspect of political life.</P>
    <P>We have had good service in the past.  There may have been some faults regarding the set-up of local government in the past, but in the main county councillors all over Ireland have given a fair performance down through the years.  They have been straightforward, diligent, hardworking men who were unpaid and who sacrificed many days during their lives to work for the betterment of their fellowmen.  They have, as I know, visited hospitals when they could have been at home doing their own work.  They have helped people who have been in various forms of trouble and people who did not know their rights and did not know the right approach.  For that reason, it is good to see that many more people are being allowed to offer their services. In particular I am pleased with the provision that allows road workers to offer themselves as county council candidates.  They are a type of worker to whom sufficient respect has not been given in the past.  They have never got credit for the tremendous job they have done.  They have realigned and rebuilt the roads in a very short period.  They are as highly skilled in their professions as engineers or anybody in any other profession, because road making and road building even in the days of the Romans was a very skilled operation.</P>
    <P>In driving from one end of this country to the other one is impressed by the excellent way in which our workers have attempted to improve the alignment and surface of our roads with the limited money that is available.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the day has come when a road worker can now offer himself as a candidate in a county council election.  This has been long overdue.  I have known some of these men who have had to leave their homes at six o'clock in the morning in order to reach their place of employment at eight o'clock.  That was in the bad old days when the pay was <Col N="169" /> very bad and there was no wet time allowance, no shelter and so forth. These were the people who were out all of the time in wind, snow and rain.  It is a good gesture now that they are allowed to stand for election. I know some of them who are offering themselves for election.  They are very intelligent people and are very well acquainted with what is happening in rural Ireland and in the cities. They are very down to earth, and nobody knows better than they do about rising prices and the various things that are happening at present. For that reason I hope that when the new county councils are elected, those men will have representation on them.</P>
    <P>There are other categories of people in the employment of county councils such as fire brigade men.  They give a great service.  They are very intelligent too.  The man who drives a fire engine and goes to extinguish a fire is a highly skilled individual and is a person that must be looked up to. I am glad that he has been given this opportunity.  He has to make decisions.  He has to be well versed in first-aid and he must know where hydrants are and how water pumps work.  He must know something about saving people from burning buildings. He certainly should be a very intelligent type.  He may not have university degrees or any such recognised qualifications but the main reason for this, probably, is that he or his people had not the money to send him to university; he certainly has the brains.  That has often happened in the past.  I hope that position will be rectified; it is being rectified at present when people with four honours can get to university. I am glad to see that a man working with the fire brigade may now have a university degree if he so wishes.</P>
    <P>Members of local authorities who work on committees of agriculture are, to my mind, in a very important category of county councillors.  In aiming to get as wide a panel of candidates as possible the Minister is doing the right thing.  Agriculture has been the cinderella industry of this country for a long period.  It was not <Col N="170" /> the fault of the committees of agriculture that the farmers did not change their ways.  Perhaps it was due to the general thinking of the times and how difficult it is to get people, especially in the farming sphere, to change their methods.  The farmer was very conservative and was not willing to change for the sake of change and irrespective of how many agricultural officers came to visit him, he had his own opinion and he usually worked on it.  Sometimes he suffered a loss by doing that; sometimes he was on the right side.  Now science has come to his aid and agriculture has expanded immensely; the cow population has increased and in various ways the standard of agriculture in the country has improved enormously.  I cannot say the same for the prices of cattle and pigs, but that is beside the point.</P>
    <P>I welcome anything that will ensure that we will have a good representation on a committee of agriculture. As at present constituted committees of agriculture are more or less dominated by elected members of the county council.  For that reason it is important that there should be many farmer candidates on the panel, people who are well up in agriculture, people who have served in agricultural colleges, who have visited countries abroad and have some idea of the methods and means employed in progressive countries and people who have a fair idea of cattle and pigs and poultry and those things that constitute the main bulk of our agricultural output.  I think, too, people who work in milk processing factories and places like that should also have a fair chance of being on the panel for election if they wish.</P>
    <P>There are other committees on which county councillors serve such as the library committee which was referred to by Senator Brennan.  Libraries in this country are few and far between except for county council libraries.  Many people in rural Ireland have not had the facilities in the past of availing of good books with which to augment their education and to widen their outlook on life in general.  Lately, most county councils <Col N="171" /> have adopted a new scheme for schools and the county councillors are well aware of this.  This had to come before the county councillors and their decision had to be in favour of granting such facilities.  After a second meeting I am glad to say I was one of the persons who persuaded our county council to adopt this library scheme which will be of tremendous benefit to the children of County Cavan.  It is important that the people working in the library, if they so wish, should have some idea what goes on at those meetings.  The librarian is present.  It is important that county councillors should know what libraries do and what benefits they give.</P>
    <P>These are only some of the many committees on which county councillors serve.  I should also mention another important area in which county councillors are very interested and in which they can do an enormous amount of good for their own locality and that is the regional tourist board.  It is important that each county council be allowed to send a member to the board and that that member should be interested in tourism, know exactly what it taking place at meetings and he should pinpoint the needs for improvement in his own locality.</P>
    <P>I am merely outlining some of the things in which county councillors have taken a tremendous interest down the years.  I am endeavouring to point out to the Government that we on this side of the House are dissatisfied with the undue haste which necessitated the summoning of the Seanad by telegram to pass legislation that is not urgent in any shape or form.  Secondly, I want to protest emphatically against this part of the legislation which allows people who are clerical officers to offer themselves as county council candidates. I hope I will have an opportunity on Committee Stage, or next week when our amendment will be debated in this House, to speak again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill for one main reason, that is that it removes from vocational teachers a burden under which they have <Col N="172" /> laboured and sweated for a very long time now.  I would emphatically reject suggestions made on this side of the House that this Bill is not an urgent Bill.</P>
      <P>As far as members of the vocational teaching profession are concerned, this is an urgent Bill.  They have been carrying this burden with increasing dissatisfaction over a long number of years.  Senator O'Higgins has referred in the debate on the Order of Business and the Minister referred during his opening speech to certain changes that have been necessary since the Joint Committee On Electoral Law reported some 14 years ago.</P>
      <P>I should like to bring it to the attention of the House that the disability under which vocational teachers have been labouring was first put on the Statute Books over 30 years ago almost to this day.  In recent years the volume of opposition and criticism of this from vocational teachers has been growing, and with very good reason. Any vocational teacher who sees coming up next month the first set of local elections for seven years and then sees people attempting to deprive them of a right which they have not been able to exercise for 30 years would be very angry.</P>
      <P>It is largely from that point of view that I am in favour of this Bill.  I agree with the urgency of it.  I would go so far as to say I would not vote against the guillotine motion, depending on the calibre of the contributions from this side of the House.  I must say that they have not done a great deal of good to my blood pressure for the past two hours.  I might even vote for it. We must be sensible and logical about this.  For the last 30 years or so we have been treating vocational teachers as children.  We refused to allow them very much trust.  We have refused to allow them any effective role in the management and control of the schools in which they work.  The teachers are the most important people in those schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had the situation in which teachers and any and every other branch of the profession can and have been members of vocational education committees.  In a situation <Col N="173" /> in which the vocational system was effectively in competition with other sectors of the educational system, and this is a situation which has obtained for some time after the introduction of the Donagh O'Malley free education scheme, there existed a situation in which managers and teachers of secondary schools were sitting in judgment on vocational schools with which their schools were in competition.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to draw the analogy too far but it is similar to members of the board of one company being allowed a free seat on the board of a rival company.  Things have not gone quite as far along the lines towards comprehensive education as Senator Lenihan might wish.  Teachers in this category have been entitled to and have exercised such rights even though they have in many cases, with due respect to the acting Cathaoirleach, been slow to accept any public involvement in our systems of education, systems which are increasingly, and in some cases, entirely, funded from public money. The changes being made in this Bill will reinforce the value of the committee system as it appertains to school management.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senator Lenihan that there is no reason for him, or anyone else, to put down an amendment to section 24 in order to ensure that a teacher whose disqualification from candidacy has been removed can also be a member of a local authority. According to the Minister's speech this is not a matter for legislation; it is a matter for an order to be made by him and by the Minister for Education. We have the assurance of the Minister that both he and the Minister for Education are in agreement on this.  The only point for clarification is whether these orders will be made at such a time so that they will become effective for the current round of local elections.  I warmly welcome this development.  Vocational teachers have been waiting for this for years.</P>
    <P>The other main objection to the Bill from this side of the House was in regard to clerical officers.  I am <Col N="174" /> astonished by the assumptions which appear to lie behind this objection. The main assumption is that local government is the most fertile breeding ground for corruption that we have.  We are not all blue-eyed, innocent boys.  We are all aware that in every large organisation, in every bureaucracy there is the possibility of corruption and the actual occurrence of corruption.  What I cannot understand is the assumption of speakers on this side of the House that corruption is the norm and that anybody who is doing his job honestly and capably is an exception. Is this something to do with the quality of life about which we have heard so much recently?  Is it true that after more than half a century of independence we still cannot trust our public servants?  If we are stating this, we are stating that we cannot trust ourselves.</P>
    <P>We are passing judgment on ourselves as an immature society, unwilling to trust others, unwilling to allow people to exercise responsibility and accurately their legitimate function in society.  I see no substance in Senator Lenihan's point to amend section 24 of the Bill and I see any possible amendment dealing with clerical officers as being founded on an attitude of distrust and contempt for the whole processes of local government, which should be rejected by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome an opportunity of making some comments on this piece of legislation.  I sympathise with Senator Horgan if this debate puts up his blood pressure but that is his worry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever legislation is introduced broadening the area of qualification for candidature at a local election there are bound to be objections. There is bound to be opposition when one endeavours to draw the line and debar certain categories of individuals from seeking public office.  The Minister can expect criticism because of the method he has adopted in drawing the line.  A rate collector should not be debarred.  He is involved with the people and is not concerned with the inside activities of any local government <Col N="175" /> or the policy-making decisions of any county manager or county secretary.  It is unfortunate that this Bill at this stage does not include some provision increasing the power of members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The role of the county councillor is not fully appreciated.  His work has increased four-fold over the past 15 to 20 years.  There have been excessive demands made on his time. He should have been granted additional powers because of his involvement. I ask the Minister to consider this if he is considering local government reform.  County councillors should be entrusted with more powers. They have given valuable service irrespective of Senator Horgan's statement or the statements of any other Senator about corruption.</P>
    <P>All that has gone by the board for the past 40 years.  There is no such thing as corruption at local authority level.  There could be no advantage from it and it is non-existent.  I was 21 years of age when elected to the Westmeath County Council in 1955. I have never witnessed any effort to introduce any form of corruption.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the Minister on his method of segregation with regard to the classes of people who may offer themselves for local elections.  In debarring rate collectors was he influenced by some situation in his own area or was it a general decision? To include clerical officers and debar other members is not the most correct method of opening up the area of qualification.  In dealing with qualification we must bear in mind that we have come a long way in the past 50 years.  In the old days one had to be a justice of the peace before offering oneself to what was the old board of guardians.  One had to have a specific land valuation and be a householder and a ratepayer before having the right to vote.</P>
    <P>However, gradual, slow changes have taken place over the years.  The right to vote at local authority level was extended to all sections of the community.  There was the limited franchise but now there is a situation where all electors have the right to vote at local elections.  This is desirable <Col N="176" /> because of the problems which are handled by the local authorities and because of their involvement.</P>
    <P>I agree that every effort must be made to ensure that the people have an opportunity of electing the best talent made available to them.  I would say that there are not that many running wild today in an effort to seek election because many of them know the amount of time which must be given to a local authority; they know that sacrifices must be made.  I am disappointed that the Minister in introducing the Bill did not see fit to offer some form of remuneration to the county councillor for the amount of time he must give to both local and public service.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of clergy and other categories who can seek election is to be welcomed.  However, do not think that many clergymen will go before the people and seek election through the ballot boxes because they will not want to divide their communities. Suppose my parish priest offered himself for election, and he is affiliated to a political party and I am his opponent, it is only natural to expect that I will never again have the same regard for him as I have while he is neutral and a non-participant in party politics.  The clergy themselves will realise that and they will want to ensure at all times that they enjoy the confidence of their flock.  If they are prepared to allow themselves to go forward as members of a political party then they can expect to be treated in the same way as I am or anybody else is treated. They can also expect to become as thick-skinned as many of us are because politics give a human being the skin of a rhinoceros.  However, they are free to become members of the various political parties if they so desire.</P>
    <P>We could have a situation where all local authorities&mdash;in theory, this is worth debate, though, in practice, it may never happen&mdash;could be constituted of members of the staff of that local authority.  I do not know whether that would be good for the people.  I believe there must be a balance with regard to the professions of all members of a council.  Because <Col N="177" /> of the divergence of views and, different shades of opinion a balance is desirable.</P>
    <P>With regard to the clerical officer's involvement in policy-making decision in the county council, I would have no objection to his inclusion if the ordinary elected members could become more involved in policy-making decisions or have the real power.  As matters stand at the moment the real power rests with the county manager who, in turn, delegates certain functions to the county engineer, the county secretary, the staff officer in housing, and so on.  Therefore, in order to open up the entire field of local government, it is both necessary and desirable to give additional powers with regard to policy-making decisions to the elected members.</P>
    <P>I am glad that vocational teachers will have an opportunity of making their views known.  Teachers are involved in education; they are involved in the teaching of our children.  They know that changes are necessary. They know how to deal with the various types of pupils&mdash;the intelligent, the slow learner, the backward or mentally retarded pupil.  In their capacity as teachers they know all those problems and they will now be able to air their opinions at local authority level.  Of course, over the years we have had the opinions of those people because they have always expressed their opinions in one way or another.  I am not particularly worried about their inclusion at party political level.  Indeed, so many vocational teachers never offered themselves for urban councils as are offering on this occasion.  In my county alone at least six came forward seeking nomination.  It is only right that they be given the opportunity of expressing themselves.  For a long time national teachers have enjoyed privileges vocational teachers did not have; the vocational teacher was regarded in many ways as a second-class citizen.  The fact that he will now enjoy the same status as the national teacher is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The efforts made in this Bill to allow the clerical officer stand as a candidate and exclude other categories <Col N="178" /> are wrong.  The Minister should have opened up the entire field and then the dissatisfaction of those who have been debarred would be removed forever. You have the rate collector and the home assistance officer, who is now a health inspector; all these should be allowed to contest elections.  If that were done all categories would be involved and a situation would be created in which a better local authority would be attained because of the inclusion of all shades of opinion.  When the clerical officer is elected he will be in a privileged position because he will be doing the groundwork for the county manager, the county engineer, the local area engineer and the housing officer.  Those of us involved in local authorities know that the two principal areas in which problems arise are housing and roads.  The engineer's clerk, who would be involved with a big area, would have access to all the councillor's representations.  Assuming an engineer's clerk gets elected to the Westmeath County Council, he would have access to every complaint that I would make with regard to roads, bog drains, boreens, local improvement schemes, all forms of sanitary services, all planning applications and all other activities associated with the work and duties of an engineer.  Therefore, the engineer's clerk is at the hub of activities.  He is in a privileged position to know everything that is going on. He has prior information with regard to when a particular bog road will be tarred and rolled, when a dangerous bend will be removed, when a junction will be improved.  He has prior information with regard to when sewerage will be extended to some scheme of houses and he will be able to pass the message along to all the constituents perhaps a week ahead of the county councillor who had been asked to make representations and speed up some particular works necessary in that particular area.  So far as the main political parties are concerned I think it will cut both ways.</P>
    <P>In fairness to everybody, clerical officers should have been excluded when the Minister has allowed so <Col N="179" /> many other public officers and local officials to be excluded from the Bill. I feel the Minister could have done more in this Bill to bring home to the people the full role of the county councillor.  That role is never properly understood by the people.  The councillor is treated as a messenger boy. He gets nothing except his travelling expenses and subsistence allowance.</P>
    <P>The officials are well-paid for their work.  They know the amount of work the county councillor is involved in.  I doubt if many of them will go forward for election because of the fact that they will not receive any additional remuneration for all the additional duties which are part and parcel of the role of the county councillor.  Therefore I would mention again the position of the clerical officer.  He is at the hub of the activities of local government, particularly those officers involved in sections dealing with housing and roads, engineers, clerks, and so on.</P>
    <P>The road worker has been included. He is not involved in policy-making decisions or in the representations of various councillors.  He would have very little inside information which he could use to his own party's advantage or to the disadvantage of his opponents.  Therefore the only people who would have an advantage in this case would be the clerical officers attached to the various offices of the local authority.  Such an officer is in a privileged position.  If 20 clerical officers offered themselves for election to any local authority and succeeded in being elected they could dominate the entire activities of that local authority and could swamp their opponents and have them completely isolated from the people so far as the work of that local authority is concerned.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, who always claimed to be a realist, and his Parliamentary Secretary, who is a member of a local authority and also likes to be regarded as a realist, to have a second look at this Bill.  After all, their predecessors accepted amendments from the Opposition groups.  The present Government should be realistic on this occasion and act in a similar manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> A very important task performed by the county councillor has not been mentioned here today.  That is the election of Members of this House.  That is the prime function of the county councillor.  It is something he does, is expected to do and has been doing over the years without fear or favour. It is important that the role of the county councillor should be fully debated in this House.</P>
    <P>I object to any attempts by the Minister to restrict debate in this House which is, in turn, elected by the county council, Councillors have the majority vote with regard to Seanad elections and a greater say in this Assembly than anybody else because of the fact that they elect the Members of the Seanad.  No effort should be made to sidestep the important issue or curb the democratic process. That is what we are doing on this occasion.  We are exercising our democratic right to debate this Bill.  All Members of this House should be allowed to debate this Bill freely.  If it is true that the Government side have been asked not to speak, that is to be regretted.  It is against the public good and the normal functioning of the democratic process.</P>
    <P>There is nothing more I wish to say on this Bill except that I doubt very much if aliens should be allowed to offer themselves for election.  In other countries one has to be a citizen of that country before one has the right to offer oneself for election.  This is not the case in this Bill.  I do not think that is right.  Aliens should be expected to become Irish citizens, enjoy the status of Irishmen, uphold the Constitution of this country, and obey all the laws every Irishman is expected to obey.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a step forward in many ways.  I dislike a particular paragraph which contains the words &ldquo;corrupt and illegal practice&rdquo;.  I have been a member of a local authority since I was 21 years of age and I have no knowledge whatsoever of any corrupt or illegal practice being operated or carried on by any members of local authorities.  Possibly it has taken place; I do not know.  The standing of the majority of members of local authorities is unquestionable. <Col N="181" /> Their integrity is beyond question.  I would be saddened and sorry if anybody tried to brand our local authority members as being involved in any form of skulduggery or any form of corruption.  I do not think it exists. It may have been the case in the past when members of the local authorities voted for rate collectors, county managers, the county secretary or the medical officer.  Corruption may have taken place then.  But with the establishment of the Local Appointments Commission all that has gone.  The best-qualified men are appointed to all the posts.</P>
    <P>There are only one or two categories where members of local authorities still appoint staff.  They are concerned with vocational education committees and county committees of agriculture.  Voting still exists for such appointments.  With regard to the vocational education committee I am glad to say that they have set up an interview board, comprised of teachers, CEOs from outside areas and members of the local authority. That interview board does an excelcent job.  It always seems to select the best candidates for the post.  Many local authorities still appoint temporary agricultural officers by vote.  The candidate who can mount the best lobby is always successful.  It is always ensured that the candidates have full qualifications.  That is only right. Permanent agricultural advisers are appointed by the appointments commission and the elected member has no say whatsoever with regard to their selection.  I think the day is gone when corruption or favouritism can occur in this community.  That is only as it should be.</P>
    <P>That is all I can say on the Bill except that again I would appeal to the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary that, if they want to demonstrate their realism, they should have a second look and accept the amendments we are pressing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply want to say that I very much agreed with Senator Horgan when he welcomed this Bill in so far as it extends participation in decision-making in education to vocational teachers.  I <Col N="182" /> think vocational teachers&mdash;and other Senators have said this&mdash;have a contribution to make to the vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>Many members of the Opposition, practically all the people who have spoken, welcome the Bill except for this category of clerical officer.  I know from listening to the speeches that Members are not reflecting their experience of any particular clerical officers in any particular local authority but an impression is given by the speeches here, and given particularly by the speeches in the Dáil, that clerical officers are a peculiar category, a peculiar&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Human frailty has been described as something which applies to the human condition generally but clerical officers would appear, by implication at least, to be particularly prone to human frailty.  I would suggest that something else comes across in the speeches as well.  Not only are they frail but they are extraordinarily energetic frail people, if one thinks of Deputy Cunningham's description of the clerical officer who might become a county councillor.  Speaking on the 9th May, column 1177 of the Dáil Official Report, he had this to say:</P>
      <P>He can deliver by word of mouth, or by telephone, or by any other means, the glad tidings to the lucky tenant appointed.  He can be the bearer of the good news of the supplementary grant of £230 through his efforts as a county councillor and not as a clerical officer.</P>
      <P>Later on the clerical officer cum county councillor is on his bicycle. Deputy Cunningham went on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again he gets out his bicycle.  He is a county councillor and the poor widow on the side of the hill is notified that, due to his activities as a member of the county council, and due to the pressure he put on, he was able to get her and her children a medical card.  The other <Col N="183" /> county councillors will be notified by letter a week later.</P>
    <P>With the greatest of respect for this point of view, I would suggest that it is a very pessimistic view of local government.  It suggests that members of local authorities will blatantly use information and access to information as an unreasonable source of power.  Remember we are speaking about legislation of the future.  If we presume that local government in the future is going to be a cross between a competition for the dissemination of information and a bicycle race up a mountain distributing letters and telegrams, we should say so.  I should like to think it is something else.  All Members of this House and of the other House are willing to concede that local government needs to be reformed generally.  The people who have served in local authorities have served well.  At the same time I think people's attitudes are changing. People are seeing that simple, crude patronage no longer applies.  The simple abuse of access to information would simply not work.</P>
    <P>It would be very unfortunate if the impression were to be given, either in this House or in the other House that clerical officers have this peculiar mentality and that they hold it to a degree more pronounced than in the rest of the community in general. For example, this suggestion that the clerical officer will be dashing out in the evening.  Obviously he would have to do it by evening.  There is going to be a lot of night travelling delivering his messages of goodwill about particular favours granted.</P>
    <P>It is also somewhat insulting to the electorate.  The electorate would, I think, very quickly see through this new peculiar band of night-riders who delivered good news and could use their votes accordingly.  Again there is a certain inconsistency in the speeches in the other House, too.  It was pointed out that not many clerical officers would offer themselves for election.  Why then the objection?</P>
    <P>The details of potential abuse were mentioned.  I think that what is involved in this Bill are principles rather <Col N="184" /> than potential malpractice.  We should address ourselves to the principles involved. I think all Members of the House are agreed on most of the sections. I particularly welcome the section dealing with the participation of vocational teachers in local authorities and I hope in the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>It is rather sad that those in favour of amending the section dealing with clerical officers have such a pessimistic view of politics at local government level, particularly with regard to the future.  They have welcomed into the mainstream of decision-making members of religious orders.  If they are willing to extend such a charity to professional people in religion, surely they should not be reluctant to extend the same charity or judgment to people involved in the clerical service?  I think it is a bit fanciful to suggest that the public would accept a local authority composed entirely of clerical officers.  The public are a bit better than that.  To summarise that point, it can be said that it is a very pessimistic view of political decision-making generally.  It is a particularly pessimistic view of people involved in local authority service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy, when he spoke on this Bill, clearly indicated what he had in mind regarding clerical officers.  On the 9th May, at column 1306 of the Dáil Official Report, he said:</P>
    <P>The Minister is depriving the community of its right to elect representatives who will act as a buffer between them and the bureaucrats.</P>
    <P>This acceptance of an inevitable division between, on the one hand, clerical officers, who are considered as bureaucrats, and elected representatives, who are considered to have a monopoly of democratic principles, is again a very pessimistic view of the future relationship between elected representatives and people who happen to be earning their living working for a local authority.</P>
    <P>All in all it is unfortunate that so much should be made of so little and that we would not be willing to see the urgency of extending rights in the general matter of participation and <Col N="185" /> decision-making rather than quibbling and making unfounded suggestions concerning one category of workers within the local authority service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that there is urgency about this Bill.  It is a pity that the Minister did not co-operate a little more with the Fianna Fáil Party in this matter.  With a few exceptions the Bill is a very good one.  Indeed I welcome most of its provisions.  A month or two ago it was stated that the ban would also be lifted on rate collectors.  I met a rate collector about five weeks ago outside Leinster House. He told me that he was selected as a candidate for the county council in County Meath by the Fianna Fáil Party.  His actual words were that he &ldquo;would drive the Labour candidate into the ground&rdquo;.  The Labour candidate, I understand, is a son of the Minister.  I do not know if that is the reason the division was changed.</P>
      <P>I think it was a pity that rate collectors were not included because I cannot see that they could affect the position in any way by standing for the county council.  I listened to Senator Michael D. Higgins and I came to the conclusion that if he was sincere in what he was saying he must be politically naïve.  Having listened to him I do not believe he was sincere or that he believed what he was saying. If he devotes a few more years to the rough and tumble of Galway politics he might change his views.  He appeared to be astounded that a county councillor, whether he is a clerical officer or not, would pass on information before his colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he was speaking I thought of a story that a former official of Dublin County Council used to tell about the late, and indeed highly respected Labour Deputy in Dáil Éireann, Seán Dunne.  Apparently a Dublin committee&mdash;possibly <Col N="186" /> it was a housing committee&mdash;used meet and the allocation of tenancies would be disclosed&mdash;this is going back 20 or 25 years.  This official was present one day at a meeting in Balbriggan when the names were disclosed, and one by one councillors from the various parties left the meeting and rushed to Balbriggan with the news.  When they arrived they discovered that in the centre, at the monument, was a notice announcing the tenancies and it was signed by the late Deputy Seán Dunne. Apparently he was quicker than the rest.  He left the meeting but he did not rush to Balbriggan.  He telephoned from the office to his friend who was waiting in Balbriggan and he already had the letter signed.  I am not criticising him by the way.  I thought it was a very good move.  In doing so he stole a march on the rest of his colleagues in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, and possibly in Labour.  It was a shrewd move and I often thought that many of us would do the same if the opportunity presented itself.  We are all human, and if we can score a political point on a political foe or a political colleague I think we would do so.  That is why I believe it is very serious indeed that clerical officers are included in this Bill.  Our objection is not a political one because the clerical officer could come from any party.</P>
    <P>With nominations opening tomorrow I do not believe there will be any clerical officers nominated so late in the day.  I am not aware of any in my county and I would think that is the situation in most counties.  That is why I feel the Minister should at this stage have withdrawn this provision, given it a lot more thought and, if he felt it was right, brought it in in an amending Bill at a later stage.  It does not affect this particular election.  Why would I object to a clerical officer being a member of a local authority?  Like Senator Keegan, I have been a member of a local authority since I was 21 years of age. I have now 19 years' experience in this field.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is a member of a county council and I am sure he will agree with me that <Col N="187" /> frequently county councillors come together irrespective of their political viewpoints and take a line completely opposed to that of the county manager and his officials.  I will give one example as far as Donegal is concerned. We have a scheme&mdash;and I am sure most counties have it&mdash;of building specific instance cottages in the rural parts of the county.  We have found that the county manager and his officials are completely opposed to the building of these cottages.  They appear to believe that people should be forced into towns and villages against their will.  My council have an unwritten agreement&mdash;in fact we never reached agreement, it just came into being&mdash;that if any councillor, irrespective of his political viewpoint, tables a section 4 motion directing the county manager to build an SI cottage then we all support it, bearing in mind, of course, that there is no priority scheme for applicants.  I can say that on dozens of occasions during the last seven years I have voted for section 4 motions of this kind tabled by Deputy Harte and he has done the same for motions tabled by me. We believe that the manager is wrong.</P>
    <P>There is in this particular case a question of principle as far as we are concerned.  I wonder what attitude a junior clerical officer would take if he were a member of the county council?  Would he vote against the policy of the county manager, the county secretary and his officials if he disagreed with them or would he say to himself that he simply could not afford to antagonise the senior officials of the county council in any way because they can help him in his efforts to get promotion? In order to get promotion a clerical officer has to sit for interview. We must bear in mind that there are many occasions when the manager is in a position to help an official.  He can, for example, appoint him an acting town clerk to gain experience. Indeed, most of the officials I know from Donegal who got promotion&mdash;and there are many of them throughout the country, county managers, county secretaries, county <Col N="188" /> accountants&mdash;began their line of promotion by being appointed acting town clerks.  It was the experience they gained in that particular field which later earned them their promotion. There are many other ways in which the manager and the secretary can help a young junior clerical officer.  The election of a clerical officer to a county council would place him in an impossible position.  The Minister is very wrong to include this provision in the Bill.  There is no doubt that senior officials of the council could pressure such an officer.</P>
    <P>I read with interest a few weeks ago a speech by Deputy Harte suggesting that if Fianna Fáil got an overall majority in the local elections in my county they would obstruct the Government and that possibly the grants to which my county would be entitled would not be forthcoming.  I recall when we were in office on many, many occasions the Fine Gael Party voted that the rate in my county should not be struck.  I recall many bitter arguments about this. This was tactical obstruction by Fine Gael.  That is not the point that I am trying to make.</P>
    <P>If a Fine Gael clerical officer was a member of the county council and was under instructions from his party to vote against the striking of the rate, would he not again find himself in an impossible position so far as the officials are concerned?</P>
    <P>Let us take, for instance, road grants.  County engineers may want more money spent on the main roads than on the county roads.  At times, they may want money transferred from one fund to another.  This can raise serious argument of a non-political nature, indeed, of a parochial nature. What line would the clerical officer who may be working in the engineering department take in this matter? Again, I feel he would be placed in an impossible position.  To get back to Senator Michael O'Higgins who apparently believes there is no political skulduggery in Irish politics.</P>

I do not know if he is a candidate in the forthcoming elections, but I feel that if he is and is elected and spends some time in Galway County Council he will change his views.  We have a system in Donegal which may or may not obtain in other counties whereby the councillors for the electoral area receive a notice from the county council seven days before tenants are informed of their appointment to new houses.  This applies only on the county council.  Letterkenny Urban Council, of which I am also a member, did away with this years ago.  Here we have a situation where six councillors have seven days' notice in writing before the tenants are appointed.  I can stand here and say clearly and categorically that in all my years as a member of Donegal County Council I have never written to the tenants informing them that they were appointed and trying to give them the impression that I was responsible. On every single occasion on which a housing scheme was allocated in my electoral area, I can also state clearly, truthfully and categorically that Deputy Harte did, either by telephone, or by writing, and in most cases by writing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will not be too long until Deputy Harte will be in the Chamber to reply.  The point I am arriving at is that the clerical officer could go one better than Deputy Harte, because he could know, before any councillor, before any notices were sent out, that those tenants had been appointed.  Despite what Senator Michael D. Higgins has said, I believe that many clerical officers, or many councillors fighting for their political survival, fighting for their political existence, would be tempted to use information of this kind.</P>
      <P>The section dealing with this matter will not benefit any particular political party.  I should imagine that if a particular party selected a clerical officer the other party would select another clerical officer and that is where the trouble would really begin.  Consider the situation where you would have a Fine Gael clerical officer and a Fianna Fáil clerical officer on the one county council. Here you really would have political &ldquo;hatchetry&rdquo; at its best.  No matter what the Parliamentary Secretary might say, I believe deep in his heart he would agree with me, because he is a good, tough, Kerry politician who knows what this game of politics is all about.</P>
      <P>I am quite certain&mdash;I would be the first to admit it&mdash;that if I had a colleague in my party who was a clerical officer on the county council I would use him to the best advantage possible.  I believe that public representatives of all political parties would do the same.  Some, of course, would put their hands on their hearts and say: &ldquo;Me?  No; never&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to get back to the seven days' notice in case someone would use what I have now said.  The principal reason why I have never notified tenants is this.  I recall&mdash;I think it was in 1965, a few days before the general election; it may have been in 1961, but I think it was 1965&mdash;that a housing scheme was allocated in the town of Ramelton in County Donegal. I received the letter giving me seven days' notice.  I must confess that I had my hand out to ring the Secretary of <Col N="191" /> the local Fianna Fáil Cumann.  I put down the telephone again and I said: &ldquo;Eighty applicants, eight successful.  I will not get involved.&rdquo;  A phone call came to the same town from the Deputy I have just mentioned passing on this information.  I remember at a Fianna Fáil victory meeting referring to this in Ramelton and saying that I had nothing whatsoever to do with the eight or ten people getting their houses. All I had to say was that I was responsible for the houses being built.</P>
    <P>I remember on another occasion in the town of Lifford being summoned to a protest meeting on a Good Friday a few years ago where all the unsuccessful applicants had gathered to protest at their failure to get houses.  The Deputy I have just mentioned did not attend that meeting because he had, in fact, on this occasion written a letter to all the successful applicants. He found it impossible then to meet the unsuccessful applicants.</P>
    <P>This is where the clerical officer could use his position.  As I said earlier it would become much more serious if you had a clerical officer from each political party.  I believe that there could be underhand work of a very serious nature affecting most of the people in any county.  It is not politically contentious.  The advantages and disadvantages lie with all political parties.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister came in I had expressed the belief that as nominations open tomorrow, the likelihood of any clerical officer being nominated on this occasion is very remote indeed.  It is a pity that he would not consider withdrawing this provision at this stage. When he would have given it more consideration and decided it was right, he could bring in amending legislation at a later stage.  If this Bill is passed, the day is not far distant when this Minister or some other Minister or some other Government will change it.  They will discover from experience that it is wrong.</P>
    <P>Some years ago we passed legislation, or possibly draft regulations, allowing patients in mental institutions to vote in the institutions.  The Labour Party put down a motion after that election calling on the Government <Col N="192" /> to change this procedure.  The Government accepted that motion.  While I agreed with the original proposal, I found from experience that this could lead to great abuse.  On the day of that election, I was there with my associates and we were the only party who acted on that occasion.  It was quite obvious that the procedure was wrong and that a mistake had been made.  The Government of the time were wise to accept the proposal of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Something similar will happen here. The Minister will discover that if a clerical officer is elected situations will develop which will make things impossible for him and for his colleagues. It may be hard, then, during the lifetime of the local authority to bring in amending legislation.  This provision is wrong.  While I agree that the Bill itself is good&mdash;most of it is very welcome and should prove beneficial to all&mdash;it is a pity that this particular reference to clerical officers should be left in.</P>

      <P>Like other Senators I have not had much opportunity to study this Bill.  For that reason I intend to be brief.  Like most of my colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party I welcome this Bill with the sole exception of the provision removing the restriction on clerical officers.  The Minister, while removing the restriction from clerical officers, retains the restriction on various categories of officers in the employment of local authorities such as town clerks, library staff, certain officers of fire brigades, certain outdoor offices of clerks of works, inspectors and rate and rent collectors.  These are in a privileged position in the employment of local authorities.  Why does the Minister distinguish and discriminate between a clerical officer working for the county council and a clerk of works working for the county council?  Is this not an admission on the part of the Minister that these people are in a position of influence where they can be accused of abusing the privilege of their office?  That argument also applies to a clerical officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Horgan and Senator M. D. Higgins accused the speakers on <Col N="193" /> this side of the House of attributing unworthy motives to would-be employees of county councils, urban councils or corporations who are also members of the local authority.  Senator Horgan is not a member of a local authority.  I do not know if Senator M.D. Higgins is, but if they were they would think otherwise.  It has been pointed out by Senator Lenihan and other Senators on this side of the House that clerical officers employed by the county council are human and are in the privileged position of having prior knowledge and information with regard to the allocation of houses, the allocation of grants, housing loans and so forth.  In the health boards they are in a position to advise and assist in the allocation and the distribution of medical cards.  They would be in a strong position, knowing the ropes and having prior information, to assist people waiting for admission to hospital.  In every aspect of local government a clerical officer would be in a very advantageous position. No matter how honest he might be, and even if he were above using this privileged position and his prior knowledge to any political advantage, he would still be blamed for it and accused of it.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what the position would be if a member of the staff of a local authority, through the instruments which he would be able to wield over the other members of the authority, gained a position of power in the local authority with his own party or even as an independent. I could visualise a member of the county council or a member of the corporation becoming the chairman of the county council or a mayor or a Lord Mayor.  What would the position be when Jack, the county councillor, would be better than his master, the manager or the assistant manager, as the case may be.  I am sure a situation like that would almost be inevitable if clerical officers were elected to the county council or, the corporation. There would be a conflict of interests between the boss, the manager, and a member of his staff.  Would the Minister, in replying, throw some light on a situation like that?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> Unlike my colleague, Senator Keegan, I welcome the provision about aliens.  In the context of the European Common Market we should be more liberal in our approach to aliens and, in particular, to citizens of the Common Market countries.  I have come across quite a number of English people in the vicinity of Cork city and in Youghal; they are always aggrieved and they do not hesitate to express their grievance that they can only vote in local elections.  They feel that they are only second-rate citizens.  The provision in this Bill removing the restriction from aliens should go a long way towards removing the grievance.  In parts of west Cork and in Kerry there is a very large German colony.  Most of these people are in very responsible and influential positions.  They make a considerable contribution towards the economy.  They are ratepayers and taxpayers.  It is only fair that they should be in a position to be elected to a local authority.  The fact that they are aliens certainly would make it more difficult for them to become elected to a local authority, and it would be more meritorious on their part if they were elected.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan and Senator Higgins both welcomed the removal of the restriction on vocational teachers.  It was Senator Lenihan who said these people still had a grievance, that they were prevented from becoming members of vocational committees.  I understood Senator Lenihan to say that; perhaps the Minister would clarify the matter.  If that is so, it is unjust.  Vocational teachers because of their training and qualifications would be admirably qualified to act as members of vocational education committees.  If that restriction still applies, I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider that aspect of it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change in the procedure for presenting petitions.  The fact that the matter is now in the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is a step forward.  There is one criticism I should like to make on section 20 in regard to witnesses.  This section dealing with the evidence of witnesses in the hearing of a petition was <Col N="195" /> debated in the Dáil at length.  There seemed to be a serious departure from one of the fundamental rules of law with regard to the admission of evidence.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>Subject to subsection (3) of this section, a person who is called as a witness at the trial of a petition shall not be excused from answering any questions relating to any offence at or connected with the relevant local election on the ground that the answer thereto may incriminate or tend to incriminate him or on grounds of privilege;</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister in his reply would clarify that matter for me.</P>

Senator O'Higgins says that there is an amendment to Riar na hOibre and a separate motion.  If it is also a motion dealing with other matters it is a motion requiring notice, and the Leas-Chathaoirleach must consider this matter and decide whether in her view it is proper that this should be moved without notice.  It simply is not good enough to describe this as an amendment to the Order of Business and therefore these can be moved without notice.</P>

      <P>That, in the case of the Local Elections (Petitions and Disqualifications) Bill, 1974, the proceedings on the remaining stages of the Bill and on the motion for earlier signature of the Bill if not previously brought to a conclusion shall be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m. today by putting from the Chair forthwith and successively the Questions necessary to bring them to a conclusion: Provided that after the said hour on the said day</P>

      <P>Let us at least go through the motions of conducting a Parliamentary Assembly, even though it has been debased by the behaviour of the Government and the Fine Gael and Labour groups in the House.  Let us know precisely what we are doing. We have had two pieces of paper representing two different motions handed here to us.  It now appears that the second piece of paper is, in effect, as the one read out by Senator O'Higgins, the proposal now before the House and it is that the Order of Business be varied.  I take it that we will proceed then to vote on that, because we intend to oppose it very vehemently.  Having taken that vote I understand then that this infamous motion will be moved. We do not want any confusion.  We are not going to vote and be beaten on an amendment to the Order of Business and then find that in doing so we were voting on the motion that is before us here.  What we are going to vote on now is an amendment to the Order of Business and then Senator O'Higgins will move this infamous motion on the second piece of paper.  Is that correct? Are we quite clear on that?</P>

      <P>That proposal of Senator O'Higgins is a perfect example of the system by which this Government intend running this nation during whatever period of power remains to them.  Indeed their actions today will recall, for the older people in this country their actions of 40 years ago, because today we see once again the Blue Shirts in action in this country.  Every act of the Government in this House and in the other House during the last few months recalls, for those people who can remember, the actions of the Blue Shirts.</P>
      <P>I live in the most northern part of this land.  At a very late hour yesterday evening I received a telegram to be in this House at 10.30 a.m. today. It was necessary for me to drive through that part of this country occupied by British forces.  It was necessary for me to have my car searched six times today by Her Majesty's troops.  It was impossible for me to be here at 10.30 a.m. this morning to discuss this business which now the Government are attempting to change.  It would appear to me that this Government have no consideration for anyone but themselves.  By a few hundred votes in three constituencies they managed to be elected to office on policies which they were unable and unwilling to carry out.  They know, despite their gerrymandering Bill, that when they face the people in the not-too-distant future, that the hindtit of this Government, the Labour Party, is sickening the mongrel foxes of Fine Gael.  It is well known&mdash;and Fine Gael Deputies in Dáil Éireann are saying so&mdash;that before Christmas of this year the split will come and they will go to the country.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the reason the Order of Business is being challenged, <Col N="205" /> the reason the Government want to change the Order of Business, the reason they want to rush this document through this House, is that they know that their honeymoon is nearly over and that they, in the short time left to them, are going to take every opportunity to do what they can as far as jobbery and corruption are concerned in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The performance of this Government is absolutely disgraceful.  Today a Bill, which proposes to give authority to make an employee an employer at the same time, is to be rushed through this House with only three or four Members of the Opposition given an opportunity to speak on it.  The democratic rights of the Opposition are being blatantly flouted. This is not the first time in the few short months that they have been in office that we have had examples of this kind.  I have sat on these benches for 12 years and I listened to lectures from Senator O'Higgins, the then Senator Garret FitzGerald and the then Senator John Kelly on the democratic principles of government.  One would think, listening to these paragons of virtue when in Opposition, that when they got the opportunity of governing in this country that they would do so in a fair and democratic manner.  I submit that the proposal to change the Order of Business today is neither fair nor democratic.  I believe that every Member of this House has a right&mdash;and the whole purpose of this House was to give each Member <Col N="206" /> of it that right&mdash;to study legislation long enough to enable him, if he so desires, to table amendments.</P>
    <P>That right has been denied to the Opposition.  In denying that right they are demonstrating clearly to the people of this land the political tyrants they are.  I should like to remind them that their days in Government may be very short and that it may not be too long until they are back sitting on these benches preaching political democracy.  Perhaps some of the so-called learned Members of the Government party should study political democracy before they proceed to give lectures on it in future. I feel that this proposal before us at this moment is low, mean, despicable, unfair, unjust and tyrannical.</P>

The word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; means &ldquo;at once&rdquo;, which suggests that no debate is to be allowed on this resolution.

      <P>I am not passing criticism on any one person who may or may not be creating it.  I am just making a statement.  The House has been very unruly today.  A motion has been moved by Senator M.J. O'Higgins and I have received several amendments to it.  I understand that if the terms of the Bill before the House are to apply to the forthcoming local elections it must become law today.  In the circumstances, I am accepting the allocation of time motion on short notice so that the House will have the opportunity to decide whether the Bill should have effect accordingly.  That can be taken as meaning the Chair is accepting the motion.  The motion is for debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, this is a difficult situation.  There can be a two-hour debate on this.  At the end of it, we would be in the ridiculous position, assuming that the Government amendment, as seems likely, is accepted on a division, that we would have passed a resolution to the effect that everything was to finish forthwith although it did not finish for several hours afterwards.  I would be extremely doubtful whether in fact they will have been validly passed.  I suspect it could <Col N="216" /> be upset legally afterwards.  The word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo;, whatever it means, does not mean two hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I, by way of explanation, say to Senator Yeats that the position as I see it is this.  There is the motion and a number of amendments which have been read out by the Chair.  One of these amendments suggests another time for the operation of the motion as being 3.30 p.m. tomorrow.  My amendment suggests, as an alternative, that the operation of the motion should commence forthwith.  That, in effect, means that when the motion has been discussed and a decision has been taken on the motion, if the decision of the House is affirmative&mdash;in other words that the motion be adopted&mdash;the motion then as amended would come into operation and would provide for the putting of the various questions to bring this Bill to conclusion forthwith at that stage.  It is only on the passing of the motion that the time becomes operative.</P>

      <P>We have been prevented from having a sensible Second Stage debate on the Bill.  We have been prevented from putting down practical amendments on Committee Stage, <Col N="217" /> and the end result of the whole procedure is that the Seanad is now discussing a guillotine motion in regard to an important piece of legislation which has nothing to do with the nominations proceeding, nothing to do with the actual holding of the local government elections, but is a piece of legislation that is welcome in many respects, one to which we would have proposed practical amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I indicated in my Second Reading speech the nature of these amendments. They are matters that could have been considered by the Minister, and perhaps the Minister would then have come forward, or we would have come forward, with practical Committee Stage amendments next week when Committee Stage would have been taken.  This is what parliamentary democracy is supposed to be about.  That is why we are elected here and why Members of Dáil Éireann are elected&mdash;to consider legislation prepared by the Government, submitted by the Government of the day to the Houses of the Oireachtas, and thereafter a considered constructive discussion on Second Stage on general principle and then on Committee Stage by way of reasoned and constructive amendments. Otherwise the whole procedure is a farce and a charade.  Mark you, when violence is done to institutions in any society it is very serious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of what we have witnessed here today is a direct result of violence being done to our democratic institutions by the present Minister for Local Government and by the Leader of the House.  We had an instance of it recently in regard to the Constituencies Bill when reasoned and considered amendments were put forward here, argued logically from this side of the House for hours on end and no attention whatever paid ultimately by the Minister for Local Government to constructive suggestions put forward.  The point is that, pushed to the ultimate, this is the sort of situation that existed in the Reichstag when Hitler <Col N="218" /> was in power&mdash;he just had people in the Reichstag to say &ldquo;Heil Hitler&rdquo;. You had the same situation under Mussolini.  You have the same situation under what passes for a parliament in Russia today.</P>
      <P>Nobody who has any real conciousness of what democracy is about and the morality of democracy can do anything but deplore the sort of attitude of contempt that is being shown both to the Dáil and the Seanad by the present Minister for Local Government, both in the Constituencies Bill and in this measure. We have been prevented from giving mature consideration to an act of legislation because the Minister for Local Government decides that he must have the Bill today, a Bill that is not necessary and not relevant to the conduct of the imminent local elections, a Bill that can be improved and amended as we think fit.  It is the duty of every Senator and every Deputy in the Dáil to advance considered amendments for improvement of any act of legislation.  We have been denied this.  Instead violence has been done to the democratic institutions of this State by introducing, for the second time in a matter of months, a guillotine motion; and the same Minister for Local Government responsible for a guillotine motion in the Dáil on the Constituencies Bill now brings forward, through the Leader of this House, a guillotine motion in regard to this particular legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would again emphasise that this Bill is an important piece of legislation in which there are many aspects of liberalising improvements with which I am in thorough agreement.  It is a Bill that can be examined through the processes of parliamentary procedure and where improvements can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But we are confronted with this attitude of mind, and it is a very dangerous jackboot attitude, which says that nothing can be improved: <Col N="219" />&ldquo;I want my Bill and nobody in Dáil or Seanad can improve my Bill.&rdquo;  It is an attitude of mind which says, &ldquo;Why have any parliament at all?&rdquo; The logical extension of that attitude is: why have any elected representatives here, either in Dáil or Seanad? Why not let the appropriate Minister of the day, with his officials, prepare the legislation, present it and tell the people that they can have that legislation, and that is that?</P>
    <P>There is no logic in having Dáil or Seanad sit here to consider legislation brought forward by the Government and to have an attitude from the Government representative: &ldquo;This is my legislation; I want this legislation by today.  If you do not pass it we will bring in a motion to stop you discussing it.&rdquo;  This is highly unreasonable, particularly in a matter of this kind which was only introduced this morning at 10.30 on an urgency telegram summons.</P>

      <P>The main reason behind this indecent haste is that the Minister and the Government were so obsessed with the gerrymandering of the country that the Constituencies Bill had to take priority both in Dáil and Seanad.  This House was brought together in Holy Week to debate a Constituencies Bill and not a single amendment was accepted by the Minister&mdash;again, an example of the jackboot attitude.</P>

      <P>I made a practice of this, particularly in this House where constructive suggestions were regularly put forward on Bills.  I want to say this, and I should like if the Press would take it down, that I have found over the years that the Seanad, when it does its job properly, is a very good legislative chamber, one where positive contributions and constructive suggestions in regard to amendments of Bills have been made and where Bills have been improved.  That can be done.  There is no difficulty about doing that if the Government of the day and the relevant Minister organise their business in a proper fashion.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill that should have been before us months ago.  It is a Bill concerned with very desirable reforms and a Bill to which we would like to suggest very desirable improvements. There was no reason why at the last minute this measure should have been rushed before us when a less important matter, if the Government are serious about staying there for a period&mdash;the constituencies gerrymander Bill&mdash;was rushed through with indecent haste.  This is a practical measure that I certainly should like to consider in detail.  We have been deprived in this House of considering it in any way and we have been told to take it or leave it by motion put down here by the Leader of the House&mdash;the motion which suggests that forthwith we pass this measure. Follow that to its logical conclusion and every Bill would be dealt with in that manner.  Why have the Dáil? Why have the Seanad?  Why have a First Stage of introduction, a Second Stage of general discussion, a Third Stage in Committee, a Fourth Stage of Report on Committee and a Fifth and Final Stage?  Why have these procedures at all?  We have seen what institutional violence has done in the North of Ireland.</P>

      <P>We have seen what institutional violence has done in Eastern Europe.  We have seen what institutional violence did in Germany and Italy a generation ago.  This sort of flouting of democracy carries very dangerous significance and so long as we are here&mdash;we are in a minority in this House&mdash;we will not be trampled on.  We are only adumbrating the basic constitutional rights written into the Constitution, the basic rights that form the warp and the weft of any parliamentary democracy&mdash;the basic rights of having a considerate discussion by the representatives elected by the people in regard to any measure proposed to those representatives by the Government of the day.</P>
      <P>That, in basic terms, is what parliamentary democracy is about.  If the representatives of the people, gathered in the parliament of the people, are not given their due time and their due right to consider whatever legislation comes forward to the parliamentary institutions from the Government, then the whole notion of parliamentary democracy goes by the board.</P>
      <P>All of us here&mdash;this applies to Independent Senators, Fine Gael Senators and Labour Senators as well as Fianna Fáil Senators&mdash;have a very sacred duty, as the Deputies in the other House have also.  We are all Members of a Parliament.  The democratic Parliament in this State is concerned about viewing and reviewing and making constructive comment, and indeed adopting constructive comment, to deal with whichever legislative measures come before the Parliament and the Government of the day.  Otherwise, we are into a jackboot situation.  Otherwise the Government of the day or the Minister of the day get the document, say to a civil servant, &ldquo;Prepare the legislation&rdquo;, and have a machined majority through Dáil and Senate, without any regard to whatever the elected representatives of the people may say. No honest people, or proud people, would dare to participate in that charade of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> That is the situation and the attitude of mind that I have seen twice displayed in a matter of months by the Minister for Local Government.  It is an attitude that is very serious because, pushed to its ultimate, it makes nonsense of all of us here who are elected representatives of the people. All of us must examine our consciences and examine exactly why we are in this House or in the other House.  We want to give constructive suggestions and to propose constructive amendments to legislative measures which come before us, and we are deprived of doing so by a crude guillotine-type motion meant only for the most extreme circumstances, to prevent constructive and reasoned debate.</P>
    <P>Senator M.J. O'Higgins earlier referred to the fact that on a previous occasion we brought in a guillotine motion here as a Government.  We brought in a guillotine motion as a Government when the security of this State was at stake and when the Fine Gael Party were totally divided on how the security of the State should be organised.  The Offences Against the State Act in December, 1972, introduced by us, was an urgent measure in which the security of the State, in our regard as the Government of the time, was paramount. That is the only time when we, as a Government, brought in a guillotine motion.</P>
    <P>That is the matter referred to this morning by Senator M.D. Higgins. Of course we brought in a guillotine motion on a matter of that kind, when the people opposed to us were in total disarray, where the present Taoiseach, as Leader of the Fine Gael Party, did not have the support of the great majority of his party, when he needed to be propped up and supported by us and when legislation passed by us as a matter of urgency for the security of this State and for the protection of our society was pushed through and has not been changed one iota since then by the incoming Government.  It has now been adopted and implemented in full by the present Government.</P>
    <P>Yes, in a situation like that a guillotine motion is necessary, when <Col N="223" /> the lives and the properties of our citizens are concerned; but in a matter of the kind we are now dealing with, it makes total nonsense of what parliamentary democracy is all about. When a Bill that can be legitimately improved&mdash;when constructive amendments can be made&mdash;is treated in this cavalier manner, this guillotine procedure, there are the portents of democratic negation.</P>
    <P>As I say, this is the second time in a matter of months that this has happened&mdash;once in the Dáil on the Constituencies Bill and now it is happening here on this Bill.  Of course we have plenty of other Ministers who are capable of doing that and much more dictatorial behaviour than the Minister for Local Government who is not in any way the villain of the piece in that respect.  I can well imagine the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs coming forward here with any measure with which he meets some disagreement and, hey presto, a guillotine will be produced out of the hat.</P>
    <P>Democracy is a very cherished flower which we should nurture carefully. Many people in this State who died in the past have worked so that it be cherished and maintained.  It does no good whatever to do violence to the basic institutions written into the Constitution, that are enshrined in procedure and have been adopted during the years.</P>
    <P>The most basic institution in parliamentary democracy is the right of elected representatives to go through the procedures of examination in regard to legislation coming to Parliament from the Government.  If we start to flout or treat that right in a cavalier manner we are on the slippery slope, which means that we are all redundant.  Let us remember that one.  We can be made redundant, and unless there is a justification for Parliamentarians to be here&mdash;a practical justification shown to the people outside and shown to the people who report us here for the people outside&mdash; then the logical consequences of that is that we are redundant and that we can leave Government to whoever is <Col N="224" /> there in whichever Department at whatever particular time of the year he or she happens to be there.  What we must watch is the respect in which the public outside hold our institutions.</P>
    <P>The rightful indignation expressed by Members of our group here today is a direct consequence of their rights being flouted, a direct consequence of the fact that they came here to engage in a serious debate and make a serious contribution and found themselves frustrated right, left and centre at every stage.  We found, indeed, motions being introduced right through the day eventually winding up with this particular form of guillotine motion that no further discussion is to take place.</P>
    <P>This is very dangerous procedure and I should like to finish on the note that I warn the Government we are all concerned with the survival of democracy in Ireland.  Every one of us, of all political parties and Independents, are concerned with the survival of democracy.  None of us wants to see a situation where institutions of democracy are debased in any way. When that happens the people outside ask: &ldquo;Why have it at all&rdquo;.  Then the way is made easy for another type of facile totalitarian alternative.</P>
    <P>Let us consider very seriously in the future, before any Government come into either House to put down a guillotine motion of this kind, that this has happened twice in three months.  It is a measure that should be used very sparingly.  The only time we used it was in December, 1972, when it was essential for the security of the State to get the Offences Against the State Bill through despite the opposition of the Labour Party, despite the opposition of a great majority of the Fine Gael Party, with the honourable support of the present Taoiseach and one or two of his supporters in the Fine Gael Party of that time.  We decided as a matter of extreme urgency that that Bill would have to go through Parliament and a guillotine motion was applied.</P>
    <P>That has no relevance whatever here today.  In regard to ordinary legislation this should not happen.  The <Col N="225" /> Minister and the Government should not indulge in pique.  Nobody should engage in the type of conceit which says: &ldquo;I want my Bill through.&rdquo;  That is not good enough.  It is not good enough to come forward to any House of mature people and say that.  That is not what we are here for.  We are here to consider the Bill and to make practical improvements to the Bill.  As I said in my Second Reading speech, there were practical improvements which we would have put forward by way of amendments and we could have had a discussion on them.  I am sad to see this, the second occasion on which the Minister has come forward here with legislation in which not alone has no amendment been accepted but deliberate closure has been applied at every Stage of the Bill leading up to the final guillotine motion.  I should like if it were otherwise.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that there is absolutely no personal animus as far as the Minister and myself are concerned. I am seeking to put this debate on a base of principle.  What we are all concerned or should be concerned with here is, first of all, making representative parliamentary democracy work, and, secondly, making it appear to the public to work.  Not alone should we make it work and function well but behave here in a way that is credible and understandable to the public who are concerned about what their representatives are doing.  The day institutional violence of this kind is started, and the day violence is done at Government level to the procedures of this House and to Bills introduced by Government, that is the day you invite the sort of honest indignation that was expressed here on this side of the House&mdash;honest indignation when the Chair was obviously and blatantly used and abused in order to create this situation.  Again, there is no personal animus in this with regard to the occupant of the Chair, with whom I am very friendly.  Certainly, we will have to examine very seriously the whole conduct of the Chair in this matter today with a view, possibly, to putting down a motion of censure in that regard.  It is important for the <Col N="226" /> institutions of this House that the Chair not alone be impartial but appear to be impartial.  We have had a gross abuse of the democratic institutions which we have cherished in this country over the years.</P>
    <P>It is a sad day, in my view, that we should have this type of conduct.  I hope that the lesson from it will be salutary as far as the Government are concerned and that the signs of arrogance which we have witnessed in recent months will not be intensified. Let us hope also that we shall not have a repetition of this mockery of Parliament and mockery of democracy which we witnessed today and which the Dáil witnessed just a few months ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a sad day for parliamentary democracy in Ireland. We have had a series of quite extraordinary procedures and precedents of procedures on the part of the Government, the Minister and, in particular the Leader of the House.  The day started off at 10.30 this morning, the House having been called together by an urgent telegram, and we were told by the Leader of the House that all Stages of this difficult, complex and important Bill were to be passed by 2 o'clock.  We started with the Second Reading debate, a Second Reading debate which was not half over when, at 1.30 p.m., after about two-and-a-half hours of debate, a guillotine motion in the name of the Government parties and the Leader of the House was circulated.  I do not know if there is a precedent for this.  I think it is unlikely that in either House of the Oireachtas, going back over 50 years, there is a precedent for a guillotine motion of this kind being moved during a Second Reading debate.  Certainly there is no precedent for a guillotine motion of this kind being circulated after less than three hours of debate has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now discussing this motion and in a moment of perhaps undue optimism I congratulated the Leader of the House for the amendment he had moved to replace the words &ldquo;3.30 p.m.&rdquo; by &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo;.  It was only later I realised that the implications of this change, which presumably <Col N="227" /> will be voted by the troops on the Government side, are that a motion has been moved in the course of the Second Reading of this Bill by the Leader of the House, which will be supported by Government Senators, and which says in effect that all Stages of the Bill are to be ended forthwith.  There is to be no more discussion for even a short period, on the Second Stage of the Bill, on the Committee Stage, Report Stage or Final Stage.  It is a complete cut-off contrary to the usual guillotine practice of at least leaving a certain number of hours for debate.</P>
    <P>More serious than this particular motion and the unreasonable and dictatorial way in which it was moved, has been the serious and quite unprecedented series of closure motions under Standing Order No. 44.  These are unusual things and indeed Government Senators, in an attempt to justify this, have had to go back over past years and mention one particular instance in which one was used.  They are rare, particularly in this House.  I do not know how many we have had today, I have not counted them.  Certainly we have had a number.  It is well to consider for a moment the conditions under which these closure motions are supposed to be moved.  It is stated quite clearly in Standing Order No. 44, subsection (1), that such a motion can only be put if it is clear that it is not an infringement of the rights of the minority and if it is clear that the question has been adequately discussed.  The attitude of the Leader of the House to this Standing Order is shown very clearly when we began briefly to discuss the question of the amendment of the Order of Business.  Before anyone had said anything, before one sentence of one speech was uttered on this the Leader of the House stood up and moved the closure of the debate.  A debate which had never even begun was to be closed.  The Chair rejected the Leader of the House's proposition but it does show the attitude there is on the Government side.  It is not merely that they wished to shorten the debate but on that occasion they wished to end any debate at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> Are we a democratic country or are we a pseudo-parliament of the kind they once had in Portugal and they still have in Spain and in various eastern European countries&mdash;Parliaments that have the trappings of parliamentary life without the realities? Are we to have a situation&mdash;this is a very dangerous precedent that has been created today&mdash;that a Minister can come in and say: &ldquo;Here I have a Bill and you have three hours to discuss it. If you do not like it you can lump it. I will get my Leader of the House to move a guillotine motion and inside three hours the debate will be finished.&rdquo;  This is being done today. There is nothing to stop it being done again.  It would seem to suggest that the Minister, the Leader of the House, Senators opposite and indeed the Government have absolutely no respect or regard for parliamentary life.  They look upon both Houses of the Oireachtas, and in particular this House, as mere instruments for rubber stamping their proposals.  They are not interested in debate.  Now that the Leader of the House has come back I should like to remind him that I have already mentioned that on one occasion today he disgraced himself by moving the closure of a debate that had not even begun, although the Standing Order makes it quite clear that the closure is envisaged only where there has been no infringement of the rights of the minority or the question has been adequately discussed. On that particular occasion the question had not even begun to be discussed, and yet the Leader of the House moved the closure of the debate.  That is his notion of democracy.  This has been a sad day for this House.  It is absolutely clear that the rights of the minority have been completely trampled upon. We hope this will not occur again, but at least we will give a guarantee that when we are back in Government we will not treat the House like that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second time recently that the Minister has been in this House putting through a Bill and the second time he has attempted to introduce the guillotine to prevent debate on an important Bill. <Col N="229" /> He has been in office for only 15 months and already has shown a degree of impatience and arrogance that is astonishing.  If this continues it will lead to a dictatorial approach to all his Bills, and this is frightening.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is essential for the local elections it should have been introduced a long time ago.  The Minister should have known that the local elections were to take place this year.  He had many months in which to introduce this Bill and had time to allow it to be properly debated.  During the last 15 months there have been long periods in this House and the other House during which there was no business and there was every opportunity to deal with this Bill and to have it properly debated.  The Bill has been brought to this House in an outrageous fashion, and we are asked to debate it and finish in approximately three hours.</P>
      <P>The Bill was debated for several days in the Dáil spread over a number of weeks, yet after three hours in this House we had a motion to put the question on an important Bill of this nature.  There were at least two well qualified speakers who were anxious to discuss the Bill; yet the question was put after three hours and then came the guillotine motion. By no stretch of the imagination was the debate on this Bill excessive.  It could not be stated that the speeches were too long or that there was any question of filibustering on this Bill. This was not said, so there is some honesty left on the other side of the House.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill and there has been a blunt refusal to allow it to be debated in this House.  It is against every principle of parliamentary procedure, democracy and fair play to the minority in this House that that attitude should be adopted. It cannot be defended and the only way this attitude can be pursued is by voting down every attempt by this side of the House to have the matter properly discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the justification for preventing discussion on this Bill? What is the justification for preventing from speaking Senators who wish to speak on the Bill and who have <Col N="230" /> interesting, useful and constructive points to put forward?  There is no justification for the Minister, the House or the Chair taking such action.  The principles in this Bill merit reasonable discussion on the Second Stage.  There should have been a debate on the Committee Stage, as this is primarily a Committee Stage Bill.  There were a number of points which needed to be raised on the Committee Stage.  Not only is the House prevented from getting an opportunity of discussing this Bill on the Committee Stage, but it is not to be allowed to complete the Second Stage.</P>
    <P>This is an outrageous negation of parliamentary procedure and democracy. It is of interest that one of the main items we had hoped to discuss in this Bill was the question of who should be allowed to stand as candidate for the local elections.  There should have been a section in this Bill to ensure that when candidates were elected to the county council or the corporation they would be allowed to debate matters which came before them.  There should have been a section in this Bill to prohibit the Minister from using his influence to apply the closure in debates in the county councils and the corporations.  At the rate he is going there is no limit to how far he will go to restrict debate, to restrict parliamentary procedure, to restrict democracy in this House and possibly in the local authorities in due course, because he is the Minister in charge of local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be introduced in due course a Bill to deal with that matter and if the Minister brings forward that kind of a Bill to restrict discussion in the local authorities when it comes before us we will get only an hour or two to discuss it before the guillotine is once more applied.  It can be taken for granted that in future any Bill the Minister brings before this House will be brought with the guillotine ready <Col N="231" /> to be applied.  In the 17 years I have been a Member of this House I have never seen such an outrageous abuse of parliamentary procedure, of democracy, and of anything which could be remotely described as fair play.  This was a blunt application of the guillotine: &ldquo;I want the Bill now, I want it my way, I do not want any debate.  I do not wish to hear the views of any Senator.&rdquo;  It is like a spoiled child saying: &ldquo;I want my toy now and no one is to stand in my way.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This may be seen, when the vote is taken in this House, as a victory for the Government.  It will be a peculiar victory.  It will be a very short-term victory and one which will not go down to the credit of the Government. This may be seen as a victory for the Minister, but it is one he will regret many times in the future.</P>

      <P>I oppose this motion, vehemently and vigorously with all sincerity.  There has been a display of impatience and arrogance in regard to this measure.  It is despicable that any Minister should come into either House of the Oireachtas and deliberately state he is setting a time limit of a few hours on the discussion of an important Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a very important one.  It relates to local government structure, the type of candidates who will be elected to public bodies, be they county councils, urban councils or town commissioners.  I am in favour of parts of this Bill.  I felt there were good points in it and that the Minister was widening the scope so as to allow certain people to offer themselves as candidates.  I thought we would have had sincere deliberations and some constructive talk regarding the improvement of this Bill by way of amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of a county council for 24 years I am very close to the work performed by county councils and their subsidiary bodies, including the committee of agriculture, vocational committees, libraries, regional development associations, and various other subsidiary bodies connected <Col N="232" /> with local government.  It is important that we should have men and women of the highest calibre to represent the people on these bodies.  Anybody offering himself for election or occupying a position such as that should be independent and should not be placed in such an invidious position that his actions could be interpreted in a way detrimental to the esteem in which public representatives and their institutions should be held. Part of this Bill will ensure that this will not happen.</P>
    <P>I particularly disagree with this motion to guillotine the proceedings, because on Committee Stage we should have had an opportunity of getting our amendment accepted, in that it asked that clerical officers would not be allowed to stand as members for a local body.  There were many valid reasons why that should happen.  I will not go into them now. One can envisage what the position would be like with a county manager and a clerical officer at a council meeting.  We can appreciate that that clerical officer would not too easily&mdash; even though he felt like doing it&mdash; criticise his own county manager.  It might reflect on his opportunities for promotion, and for that reason he would not be a free agent as a public representative.  I do not think he should be there.</P>
    <P>I do not know what has driven the Government to this type of performance here today.  They have criticised the fact that local elections were overdue&mdash;it is seven years since we had local government elections. Surely this Government who, according to themselves, were master politicians, wonderful legislators who knew it all, should have been able in the last 15 or 16 months to draft a Bill and bring it through this House instead of steamrolling it through in a couple of hours?  Do they really think that the people elected here as public representatives from all over Ireland have no intelligence or constructive criticism or suggestions to offer?  Is the Minister such an all-powerful man that nobody can advise him in any way whatever or suggest even the slightest amendment that <Col N="233" /> would be of any benefit to improve this legislation?  We are not here for destructive purposes.  We do not try to obstruct the House or prevent legislation from going through.  I said that very deliberately this morning.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a comment before we go on to item No. 2 on the Order Paper.  I am sure the House will agree with me that some remarks were made today in regard to your good self and the Cathaoirleach.  We should all like you to know that it is recognised that those remarks were made purely in the heat of discussion.  I personally feel quite certain that the maker of the remarks will be very ready, on reflection, to assure you, as I do now, that you have the utmost respect of both sides of the House, as indeed has the Cathaoirleach. I feel everyone will agree that the remarks were not intended, even though possibly so framed, as being in any sense personal.  I should certainly like you to know that.</P>

      <P>I should just like to say that Senator McGlinchey, who was removed from the House on the basis of remarks he made, was expressing on behalf of Members on this side of the House a feeling of honest indignation at the manner in which this piece of legislation has been treated in this House.  The approach to it was frustrated by the attitude of the Minister and the Chair.  I say that without any personal animus whatever against the Chair.</P>
      <P>Senator McGlinchey expressed indignant remarks but he did not intend them to be taken personally.  This may be said about any remarks which emanated from this side of the House. As I have already stated, during the debate, this type of violence to parliamentary institutions gives rise to situations of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Governments would stop rushing matters through Parliament, stop applying guillotine motions, stop trying to apply the jackboot and instead conform to the normal parliamentary procedures which have been well tested in parliamentary democracy over the years, and keep to these procedures except in exceptional circumstances, then business could be got through much easier.  We can organise ourselves in this House if the Government of the day have good sense and realises that they have a function <i>vis-a-vis</i> the institutions of Parliament, <Col N="242" /> in our case the Dáil and Seanad.  The Government must recognise that legislation is there to be processed in a proper way, with proper amendments and consideration.  If that approach had been adopted from the start, the kind of behaviour we saw today and the type of remark which was inadvertently made in regard to the Chair would not have arisen.</P>
    <P>If any such remark was inadvertently made by any Member of our group to the Chair in any personal capacity, I, on behalf of my group, apologise.  The procedure adopted by the Government gave rise to the heated situation where this type of remark was injected.  The remark should not have been passed and was not intended in any personal way.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill before the House is to simplify the procedures required under the Building Societies Acts, 1874 to 1942, in effecting mergers of societies and to provide for the guaranteeing by the Minister for Finance of certain borrowings <Col N="243" /> by building societies.</P>
      <P>Section 33 of the Building Societies Act, 1874, and section 19 of the Building Societies Act, 1894, deal with amalgamations and mergers of societies&mdash;or unions and transfers of engagements as they are called in the Acts.  At present a union or transfer of engagements is a two-stage process. Firstly, the proposal must be agreed at a general meeting of each society by three-fourths of the members present. Secondly, the agreement must be confirmed in writing by the holders of not less than two-thirds of the whole number of shares of each society.</P>
      <P>The Building Societies Association have represented that these requirements are unworkable in practice.  The difficulty of fulfilling the requirements will be appreciated when it is realised that some of the larger societies may have upwards of 30,000 shareholders.</P>
      <P>The rationalisation of the building society movement in this country is desirable as at present it is somewhat fragmented.  A trend towards larger and fewer societies should mean greater efficiency and economy and should give rise to savings in management expenses.  Such savings should lead to the provision of a better service for both borrowers and shareholders. From the viewpoint of the housing programme, rationalisation is desirable to ensure better co-ordination in the use of the substantial amounts of money which the societies provide in housing loans and to strengthen the financial standing of the movement as a whole.</P>
      <P>I know that preliminary steps have been taken towards one desirable merger of existing societies.  It would be unfortunate if the rather onerous requirements of the existing law were to prevent such a merger.  The Government, having given careful consideration to the position, have decided that, even though a comprehensive review of the Building Societies Acts is being undertaken, the present short measure should be promoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already explained, under the existing law a union or transfer <Col N="244" /> of engagements is a two-stage process. The proposal must first be agreed at a general meeting of each society by three-quarters of the members present and then this agreement must be confirmed in writing by the holders of not less than two-thirds of the whole number of shares of each society.  The aim of sections 2 and 4 of the Bill is to simplify this somewhat cumbersome procedure by reducing the majority required for the first stage to a simple majority, and by providing for confirmation of the union or transfer by the Registrar of Friendly Societies as an alternative to the second stage.  This alternative is much more practical than seeking the approval in writing of perhaps some tens of thousands of shareholders.  Such a situation was hardly envisaged when the legislation was enacted a century ago.  The reduction of the three-quarters majority in the first stage to a simple majority should not adversely affect shareholders or creditors since the proposed union or transfer must be registered by the Registrar of Friendly Societies. The registrar may, of course, refuse to register if he feels that there are circumstances which make this desirable.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 3 of the Bill is to make statutory provision for the guarantee by the Minister for Finance of special borrowing facilities which, at the instance of the Minister for Local Government and in co-operation with the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank, were arranged in October last between the Associated Banks and certain building societies.  The background to this provision is that the Minister for Local Government became aware that, in the light of the trends in interest rates which prevailed in 1973 and the resultant uncertainties in relation to the inflow of new funds, the societies found it difficult to assume forward commitments for loans on a scale appropriate to the needs of the private housing programme and of the house-building industry.  A series of discussions on this problem took place among the parties involved.  It was clear that the <Col N="245" /> societies' needs were not for immediate recourse to borrowing facilities but for an assurance that, in the event of their embarking on an extended programme of loan approvals, fall-back borrowing facilities would be available to them at a later stage to meet any shortfall that the expansion might create in their net inflow of new funds.  The Associated Banks, I am glad to say, co-operated fully in making available the kind of facility that was seen to be required and the societies for their part responded positively by means of an immediate relaxation of their lending policies.  The total amount involved in the arrangement was £6 million. This amount may be drawn on at any time up to 30th June, 1974, and is to be repaid during the period of 12 months commencing in July, 1975.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the Minister for Finance simply guarantees loans which may be made by the Associated Banks and it is not expected that there will be any charge to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The provision in relation to the guarantee which is set out in the section is standard.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House is aimed principally at the rationalisation of societies by simplifying the procedures for unions and transfers of engagements.  It is relevant, I think, to mention in this connection that I have become aware recently, in the context of my responsibility for the Registry of Friendly Societies, that there has been a rush to register new building societies.  It appears that the increased activity is related to the Government's proposals to introduce comprehensive new legislation governing all aspects of building society operations.</P>
    <P>I think it is right that I should use this occasion to emphasise that the comprehensive Building Societies Bill will provide for new requirements in connection with the establishment and registration of societies and that we regard it as reasonable that means should be found of ensuring that societies which have been registered as a result of the recent spate of <Col N="246" /> applications, and other societies which in effect have evolved from a reactivation of old dormant societies, will comply with the requirements to be prescribed for new societies.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, nothing to be gained in terms of legislative control by registering a society now rather than after the comprehensive legislation comes into force.  It is well, I feel, that persons who are thinking of setting up new societies or who are engaged in the preliminary processes involved in the registration of new societies should be made fully aware of this situation.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that the Minister's warning in the last part of his statement is very necessary because with the present stage of building society development and loan finance for housing, generally, it would be undesirable to have any rush of new building societies.  The whole purpose of this legislation is to facilitate the reorganisation and rationalisation of existing building societies.  The warning in this Bill is timely.  The comprehensive control Bill, which is envisaged by the Minister, will deal with any societies that are established as from now.</P>
      <P>This Bill quite clearly deals with two matters.  First, it provides for the improvement of the outmoded voting procedures between shareholders, which dates back to the 1874 and 1894 Acts, which have up to now frustrated appropriate amalgamations of building societies.  As in the case of co-operatives, that type of improvement is very necessary.  In our society what we do not want is more building societies what we do want is efficient and viable building societies that can raise the necessary finance and be in a position to meet the basic needs of house purchasers.  The difficulties which have been encountered in recent times have resulted in non-viable building society organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said in his statement, we want to organise a situation here in which we will not encourage <Col N="247" /> the growth of any more of those, and the positive part of the Bill seeks, by modifying and improving the voting procedures, to encourage amalgamations and mergers of societies.</P>
    <P>The other main matter is concerned with section 3 where the finance which has been guaranteed to the building societies by the Associated Banks has been given statutory approval in regard to fall-back borrowing facilities.  It is a measure which is fully approved both in the practical implementation and in regard to statutory effect.</P>
    <P>Arising from the Bill generally&mdash;it is accepted on this side of the House as a welcome measure.  However, there arises the whole question of future mortgage rates as they affect the ordinary house purchaser.  There is a social problem involved in mortgage rates, fluctuating as they have been.  There is a situation where a small dwellings loan from a local authority is at a fixed rate of interest whereas the mortgage rate return from building society loans has fluctuated during the years and still fluctuates and will continue to fluctuate. The help given by the Associated Banks, which is now being given statutory effect here, is designed to assist the building societies in some way to meet loan applications.</P>
    <P>There is still the situation where a bargain is made by the house purchaser with the building society.  That bargain is made for £X at X interest rate; that interest rate continues to fluctuate.  I appreciate in regard to building societies that they have money on short call, but I would suggest that there should be some radical examination of the whole structure of building societies.</P>
    <P>I think this Bill is necessary but I would advocate going further than this Bill.  I feel very strongly that if a house purchaser enters into a contractual commitment in regard to a loan with a loan agency the repayment should remain at a fixed rate. Fluctuating interest rates in regard to mortgage payment are altogether wrong and immoral as far as the purchaser is concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" /> If one makes a deal with a bank for a loan it is at a fixed interest rate for a specific sum.  In regard to the local authorities under the SDA scheme it is again a fixed repayment in regard to interest.  It is a matter that requires investigation.</P>
    <P>I have been making some practical suggestions which strictly are not relevant to the Bill but arise from it. In my view, the necessity for having fixed interest repayments on mortgages for house purchasers is the big social area of discontent at the present time.  I know this flows from the financial structure of building societies.  This is a Bill which I welcome in that I can see it progressing towards a larger legislative measure, which the Minister for Industry and Commerce obviously has in mind, to deal with the whole financial structuring of building societies into a situation where they can give fixed interest loans as far as house purchasers are concerned.  This is the situation at the moment in regard to local authority loans and in my view improvement should be in that direction.  The step that was taken by the Government, and given statutory effect to here in section 3, is a move in that direction.</P>
    <P>There is one more suggestion I should like to make in conclusion&mdash; and I think it is open to the Government to implement it.  It is possible for the Government to do something of a practical kind without waiting for any restructuring of building societies and without introducing any new legislation.  If building societies were relieved of their liability to pay income tax in regard to the whole area of house purchase business, they could, I am informed, substantially reduce their present repayment rates to house purchasers.  The reduction could very easily be of the order of 1¾ per cent to 2 per cent.  That would be a substantial reduction.  However, it is a matter of financial ramification, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Minister for Finance&mdash;it is a Government matter. But it is a comparatively easy way in which interest rates could be reduced fairly quickly, pending the greater restructuring of the code as a whole. <Col N="249" /> It is a suggestion; I believe it can be done and that it simply requires an amendment of the Finance Act to that effect.  It has been estimated that overall the financial saving to the building societies would be of such a nature as to make it possible for them to reduce interest rates to house purchasers.  In other words, the thing could be wrapped up in some sort of package so that you would not be just relieving them for the purpose of relief but relieving them in regard to their income tax liability side by side with the mandatory direction that they reduce interest rates accordingly.</P>
    <P>That is all I will say.  The Bill is welcome.  I look forward to the fundamental legislative measure which was promised by the Minister and which will deal with the basic restructuring of the building societies, which, in my view, are highly unsatisfactory in their organisation of financial structure.  Most of the trouble arises because basically there are too many of them.  They are too weak in the financial sense and not viable to cope with a problem which is a growing one in this country and in any developing country.  There will have to be basic thinking done on the whole financial restructuring and reorganisation of building societies and their relationships with the banks, local authorities and the State generally. I would not exclude any radical remedy in dealing with that very fundamental problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as a very useful measure towards the rationalisation of the building societies. It is necessary that building societies should be strong, although I would be very sorry to see anything like a near monopoly situation created in the building society industry.  I for one would never accept that because a thing is big it is necessarily efficient or good for the community.  I think, and I am sure the Minister would agree, that it is necessary to ensure that in our society there will be adequate competition between the building societies. It is obvious that for various reasons building societies must have <Col N="250" /> a measure of strength not only from the point of view of being able to service loans and to provide facilities for house builders, but in order that the depositors' money can be safeguarded. In order to encourage deposits in any building society, the society must have the reputation of being a strong society.  It would, as Senator Lenihan suggested, be very desirable if you could have fixed mortgage rates over a period of years.  But in these days of bounding interest rates it is unrealistic to suggest that a building society could borrow today and give a loan for 35 years without any variation in the rate of that loan.  Building societies of their very nature borrow short and lend long.  Any run on their resources would have very serious consequences.  It is true of course that their collateral, in buildings and houses, is the best collateral of all.  They would not have any difficulty in raising funds to meet any run on their deposits.  That would be an undesirable situation.  Like every other business, building societies must maintain an efficient and liquid position if they are to carry out their business efficiently.</P>
      <P>This Bill is also&mdash;I say this in view of some ill-timed and ill-informed criticisms of building societies which we have listened to recently&mdash;a recognition of the fact that the building societies have a very important rôle to play in the provision of capital to prospective house owners.  I would like to underline the words &ldquo;house owners&rdquo;, because it is not unknown that building societies have been utilised by certain building interests to acquire funds for building operations. I think it should be clearly spelled out to all the building societies that their sole function should be the provision of funds to prospective house owners, not to house builders. Any speculative builder who requires finance for his operations should acquire them from another source. The building societies should be left to do the job they were originally established to do more than a century ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree completely with Senator <Col N="251" /> Lenihan's suggestion that the building societies might be relieved of the requirement to pay income tax.  I do not know what the resultant reduction in the rates would be.  It might not be as great as Senator Lenihan anticipates, but it would be of assistance to them. If this is possible, the Minister might keep it in mind.  I hope the investigation which is taking place currently into the affairs of the building societies will take this proposal into account.</P>
    <P>The assistance of the banks, the underwriting of the fallback facility of the banks, is to be welcomed.  It is a very difficult thing in this day and age to borrow money to lend at competitive interest rates, and building societies in many instances are in a disadvantageous position <i>vis-a-vis</i> merchant banks and companies or corporations who engage in hire purchase transactions. They are competing in a very strong market for funds and in the present day and age some very attractive offers appear in our daily newspapers for those who have funds to lend.  It is therefore necessary to ensure that the building societies are put in a competitive position, first of all by relieving them of income tax if this can be done&mdash;and I think it should be done&mdash;and secondly, by being given the type of assistance that the Government have been giving them during the past year or two.  They have a very useful rôle to perform and they should be allowed to continue in that rôle.  I think there should be competition between the building societies.</P>
    <P>This measure should ensure that we will have in the country strong societies, strong in the sense that they will be able to provide funds for house owners and in the sense that they will be able to encourage deposits from people who have money to lend.  At the same time, there is an obligation on the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Finance to keep a close watching brief on the activities of the building societies.  I do not think they were ever intended to be bonanzas for directors, depositors or other interests. They were primarily intended to provide funds for prospective house owners at the lowest possible interest <Col N="252" /> rates on the longest possible terms.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wish to seek clarification of one point.  I welcome the Bill.  The evidence is there that the building societies are mushrooming.  In other areas where things mushroom like this you very soon lose control. There are some industries that go out of their way to provide money through building societies.  They are registered building societies in the normal way.  I am wondering if there is anything in the Bill that might be an impediment to people who envisage doing this in certain types of industries.  Would there be anything in the Bill to discourage them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am in favour of the Bill.  In the past building societies have played a very important rôle in our society particularly in the provision of money for people who wished to build or purchase their own houses.  I would agree with what Senator Russell has suggested, that a special eye might be kept on them so as to ensure that if at all possible funds and energies will be spent in that direction, because there is nothing more encouraging to a citizen than to be in a position to buy out and own his own home.  From my experience on local authorities it is much better that the person himself receive the encouragement to provide his own house rather than expect a local authority or such institution to provide it for him.  Anything that can be done to help the building societies to perform that useful service should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>From the fact that Senators concerned themselves with the broad issues in the Bill and with thoughts about the future, it is evident that there is broad agreement on the contents of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the value of having a small Bill now and not waiting until the big Bill was ready, one reason given was the simple urgency of the merger which is already fairly well advanced in negotiation.  I now see another <Col N="253" /> advantage in the small Bill, because in the course of the Dáil debate and the debate here, useful points about more general questions have been made which will certainly be taken into account when we are putting the final touches to the larger measure. Let me try to deal quite briefly with these major points which were raised, perhaps in reverse order in order to dispose of the last or the second last point made&mdash;the practical question of Senator Harte as to whether this Bill would in any way interfere with the activities which do have a building society structure by which they can help their employees.  The answer is an uniquivocal &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  There is nothing in it that would bear on them at all.  It is a useful point to have raised precisely for the reason that we will keep it in mind in connection with the larger legislation when that is coming along.</P>
    <P>In regard to what Senator Lenihan says, first, he has isolated this social problem of mortgage rates.  All of us agree that this is an immense social problem and one that is embarrassing to every public representative, but to people on the Government side of the House&mdash;people like the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Finance and myself&mdash;more than to anybody else.  It is proper that this embarrassment should be primarily on our desk, as it were, because we are the people directly involved in this.</P>
    <P>This is a huge problem and an immensely difficult one, because the question of the cost of money is not a question which finds a restriction inside the boundaries of this country.  First, we are part of the sterling area and, secondly, interest rates overflow from one currency to another.  One has to bid for money and stay in the hunt or the money gets away to wherever there is a higher interest rate.  At times of raging inflation, which the world is now experiencing, we have this unprecedentedly high cost of money which is embarrassing everyone.  It is embarrassing to the man who holds stock for his business on the basis of bank borrowing.  It is embarrassing to every section of the community and none more than the mortgage holder <Col N="254" /> whose rates are fluctuating.</P>
    <P>What should be done?  I think I ought to re-emphasise that, quite apart from the £6 million&mdash;which is only something that the State has guaranteed and which therefore is not anything on which we anticipate we will have to make any actual expenditure&mdash; there has been an expenditure of £2 million in the form of a subsidy which has had the effect of reducing the mortgage rates, dreadful as they are, by 1¼ per cent, not as much of a reduction as one would like, but still a significant and measurable reduction. The question is: can one have fixed interest rates?  I think Senator Russell answered this within the framework of existing building society attitudes, which is to say: as long as you lend on a long-term basis and borrow on a short-term basis, you cannot.  I welcome the suggestion of Senator Lenihan that this should be looked at in a very fundamental way in connection with the oncoming Bill.  Nothing should be ruled out as a solution because the problem is a desperate one.  It is iniquitous that people who contract in at the level of 6 and 7 per cent, as people did, should find themselves paying twice that and have their whole projections knocked sideways.</P>
    <P>The alternative of subsidy is the sort of open-ended commitment&mdash;and Senator Lenihan will appreciate the imperatives of these sort of decisions &mdash;that Governments hate, because one never knows how big it is going to get.  One could start off with that sort of subsidy costing a couple of million pounds and then find oneself in an explosive situation of interest rates in which it was costing £25 million or something like that.  It is certainly a real difficulty, but I think the value of that contribution was that we must look at all the options in connection with the oncoming legislation.  It may mean a lot of State money, and if that is so it can only come from taxation, so that we may be shifting wealth.  Governments do not generate wealth; they just distribute it.  If we have to shift it it may be a correct decision to do so, because this is bearing very heavily on people who should not have that <Col N="255" /> sort of imposition.  However it is certainly worth considering.</P>
    <P>In regard to the matter of taxation, I think it fair to say&mdash;again this is for the record&mdash;that total removal of taxation may be extremely expensive. I will not invade the proper area of responsibility of the Minister for Finance, but it is no harm to put on the record in reply to the remarks that have been made that there are valuable income tax concessions made to the societies themselves and also to shareholders and depositors.  Of course the value of the latter is that it encourages people to put their money in and the more money the societies get in the more they can put out.</P>
    <P>There is the exemption from corporation profits tax.  The White Paper on Company Taxation proposes to give this a statutory sanction.  There is the freedom from income tax on the interest to shareholders and depositors which makes depositing with the societies relatively more attractive.  There is the reduction to 70 per cent of the standard rate. There is a complete rate of income tax payable by societies which is complicated but which is 70 per cent of the standard rate.  Then there is also an arrangement for the purposes of surtax assessment where the assessment, the interest paid to shareholders and the depositors is based on the surtax of the interest-free amount rather than on the gross amount.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> These are concessions of significance though they are not enormous. Again if one makes the concession of removing income tax totally then one raises the tax elsewhere because the money is needed.  It is a matter for decision as to distributions of resources whether one should or should not.  It is certainly a valuable suggestion which should be seriously looked at.  I thank the Seanad for its consideration and valuable suggestions, and I recommend that the Bill be read a Second Time.</P>
