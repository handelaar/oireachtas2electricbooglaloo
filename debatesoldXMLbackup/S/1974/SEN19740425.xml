    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the House of Parliament amendments are put down, sometimes not in real expectation of their acceptance, but to make a point. If the Minister is not to make a mockery out of the Committee Stage of the Bill he should apply his mind very seriously to the amendments which we have put down in this group.  The Minister, in regard to the previous group of amendments concerning the North Leinster area, made some good points from his own particular local knowledge of County Meath.  In this instance we have a group of western counties brought together in our series of amendments in this group, hinging particularly on the two counties of Clare and Galway. In this instance, as I quoted last night, we have a specific implication from the Minister's statement in the Dáil, in which he said he would consider any amendment which would mean a four-seater in Clare, preserving Clare's county identity, and a three-seater in West Galway.</P>
      <P>In answer to the Minister we have taken him at his word and put down precisely such an amendment to that effect in this group.  The amendment which we are now discussing envisages Clare as a county on its own, with some slight addition from County Galway, making a four-seat constituency.  It further envisages an amendment to the Schedule in regard to West Galway, in which the Minister has a four-seater, and for which we suggest three seats.  All the reason in this matter points to our suggested amendments in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an irrefutable logic in our position compared to what the Minister proposes&mdash;which is a mutilated three-seater County Clare with the north-western portion taken away and added to West Galway to make a four-seater.  By a simple reversal of <Col N="1161" /> what the Minister proposes we feel greater weight would be given to logic. This is precisely the sort of approach which should be taken by any impartial judicial or quasi-judicial commission or tribunal.  They would look at that combined area and say, &ldquo;All reason points to maintaining Clare as a county and giving it the four seats to which it is entitled.  All reason points to West Galway, based on Galway city and Connemara, being a three-seater.&rdquo;  In this way the seven seats in the combined area are properly allocated in accordance with both county boundaries, traditional loyalties and associations, and with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Minister has chosen the other way of doing this.  In order to have West Galway a three-seater he has mutilated the county of Clare and has added to it, as I mentioned last night, an area of County Clare which comes down to the rural district of Ennis.  He has that part of County Clare from Ennis to Ennistymon, to Lisdoonvarna and Ballyvaghan linked in with West Galway to form a constituency which goes beyond Clifden.</P>
    <P>I went through the townlands and the details of this matter last night and I am not going into further detail now but I should like if the Minister would tell me on this particular point where our logic falls down.  The Minister should approach this particular area in a logical and open manner, which is the way in which any Minister should approach the Committee Stage of any legislation coming before these Houses.  In many cases the Minister may have had ample excuse for rebuttal, many amendments having been put down more in expectation than anything else.</P>
    <P>This is an important amendment in which all logic and reason is on our side and no logic or reason on the side of the Minister.  It is a question of how to allocate seven seats while preserving the criteria which we all regard as important.  There is, first of all, the constitutional criteria to justify seven seats in the area.  Secondly, it is a question of allocating the seats while acknowledging the constitutional <Col N="1162" /> criterion of 20,000 people per representative, give or take a tolerance of 1,000 and at the same time not doing any damage to county boundaries or to traditional loyalties and associations.</P>
    <P>By adopting our amendments County Clare is preserved almost entirely as a county and the natural units of Galway city and its hinterland and Connemara are contained within the constituency area in which they have been traditionally contained.  The Minister knows this is the position and I should like to hear his answer.</P>
    <P>We next deal with amendments Nos. 3 and 10 in our group.  Amendment No. 3 deals with Clare and amendment No. 10 deals with West Galway.  Amendment No. 9 deals with the constituency of East Galway.  As a logical follow-on to our main point, which is preserving Clare as a unit and preserving Galway city and Connemara as a unit within one constituency, we move on to the logic of keeping East Galway a five-seat constituency.  The remainder of County Galway, based naturally on Tuam, Loughrea and Ballinasloe, together with existing parts of Roscommon, are contained within the present constituency of North-East Galway. We can have five seats in that natural area rather than the Minister's proposal, which is a four-seat constituency. In the interests of flouting county boundaries in Clare and in the interests of inventing a totally artificial constituency in West Galway, the Minister proposes to deprive East Galway of its natural representation of five seats.</P>
    <P>The only reason why this is being done in regard to East Galway is that the Minister is well aware that it happens to be a strong Fianna Fáil constituency.  The Minister wants to reduce our natural three quotas in that area, where we would get three seats out of five.  By a piece of gerrymandering, there would be a situation where well over two quotas in a four-seat constituency will result in only two seats out of four for Fianna Fáil in East Galway.  That is the reality of the situation flowing from the totally illogical rearrangement of West Galway and Clare.  East Galway <Col N="1163" /> must suffer.  It is deprived of its natural right to five seats, as we propose in our amendment No. 9 and which has been rejected in the Minister's proposal in the Schedule.  The Minister wants to have East Galway reduced to four seats when the hinterlands of Loughrea, Ballinasloe and Tuam&mdash;taking those three towns as the three key towns from the location point of view within the whole area of East Galway&mdash;combined together justify five seats on a population basis. They are being deprived of a seat because of the Minister's twisted and perverse attitude towards Clare and West Galway.</P>
    <P>That is the gist of our proposal in amendment No. 9.  In amendments Nos. 3, 9 and 10 a situation is embodied where Clare is deprived of its county right to send four Members to the Dáil.  West Galway is given an artificial four seats in order to bring in a third of County Clare with it.  The net effect of that is to deprive West Galway of its natural entitlement to five seats and to reduce it to four seats, because there are practically three quotas in that area which would guarantee Fianna Fáil three seats out of five.  As the Minister knows from the mechanics of proportional representation, with that sort of first preference vote in a four-seat constituency it would be virtually impossible to get three seats out of four.</P>
    <P>Practically a quota of Fianna Fáil voters in a strong Fianna Fáil area are being deprived of a seat in Dáil Éireann because of the machinations by the Minister regarding the whole of Counties Galway and Clare.</P>
    <P>The other amendments in the group are Nos. 13, 14, 16 and 18.  While these areas are not so important as the key areas I have mentioned in terms of injustice and inequity, we have put down valid amendments to the Minister's proposals.  Our main argument contained in these group of amendments is based on what I have just stated in regard to the fundamentally logical approach which is embodied in amendments Nos. 3, 9 and 10 and will result in a clean and fair allocation <Col N="1164" /> of seats in Counties Clare and Galway. The amendments I am now going to speak on are less important, though valid in regard to the Minister's proposals.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 13 we suggest that in the Minister's proposals relating to East Mayo, there should be an adjustment which would retain the present situation as between East Mayo and Roscommon.  The Minister is breaching county boundaries here and is again interfering with the present constituency arrangement.  He is taking specific areas from part of West Roscommon and putting them into East Mayo.  He is breaching the Mayo-Roscommon border in the interests of achieving that end.  East Mayo, while retaining three seats, can retain them within the existing constituency and county boundaries.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 is designed for the same purpose, that is the making of a tidier rearrangement between east and west Mayo and preserving the county territorial identity of County Mayo.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 16 and 18 are the further consequential amendments in this group on the basic matter I mentioned initially.  These relate to preserving the existing situation regarding Roscommon-Leitrim, a three-seat constituency, and also Sligo-Leitrim. These are adjustments which do least damage to the present constituency situation.</P>
    <P>The reasonable approach over the years should be to try to achieve a degree of consistency with regard to the establishment of constituencies, bearing in mind the three principles I mentioned earlier of county identity, traditional loyalty and association and the constitutional requirements.  Bearing those in mind there should not be any swinging departure from existing constituency arrangements.  This would be the way a judicial or a quasi-judicial commission or tribunal would look at the matter.  They would see the situation at it is and would not make any violent departures from the existing constituency situation.</P>
    <P>It was in that spirit that we put down the amendments relating to Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon. <Col N="1165" /> They are amendments which make for a tidier presentation in that they do not depart violently from the present constituency rearrangement. The Minister has in Roscommon-Leitrim made a very radical change. He has made a very radical change in regard to Sligo-Leitrim involving a breach of the county boundary in Donegal.  He has made a radical change in regard to Mayo involving the breach of a county boundary into Roscommon.  For some obscure reason&mdash;I can only think it must be some corridor machinations in regard to particular Deputies&mdash;niggling changes have been made that breach county boundaries and are obviously designed to ensure the re-election of particular favourite sons among the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Sligo, Leitrim and Mayo constituencies there is no disagreement between us as to numbers. The numbers per constituency agree with us.  What we are suggesting is that breaches of county boundaries have been made in Donegal, Leitrim and Roscommon that need not have been made.  They were only made by reason of operations behind the scenes in the interests of specific Deputies of particular parties.  Indeed the Minister accepted an amendment at a late stage in the Dáil within the Mayo rearrangement.  It was an amendment that was obviously designed to suit the requirements of a very popular Fine Gael Deputy in West Mayo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle is one whereby Deputy Finn is not regarded as being as favourite a son as Deputy Kenny.  At the last minute in the Dáil the Minister for Local Government, flouting again all principle or sense of adopting a conscientious attitude towards this Bill, proceeded to swing townlands from Deputy Finn to Deputy Kenny at a very late stage of the passage of the Bill.  There was no acknowledgement to principle, or integrity.  It was blatantly a back-door operation.</P>
      <P>As I said initially, the kernel of our argument on this group of amendments does not rest so much on the petty manoeuvring by the Minister and the Government in regard to the counties of Leitrim, Roscommon, Sligo and Mayo.  Leitrim obviously has been added to Roscommon for the benefit of Deputy Reynolds of Ballinamore. It is quite clear he has got a substantial backup for his future in the constituency of Roscommon-Leitrim, just as Deputy Kenny was facilitated at a late stage in the passage of the Bill in the Dáil.  I do not intend to remain any longer in the petty realm in which I know the Minister likes to operate&mdash;the petty realm of switching townlands to suit particular Deputies.  There is no great argument of principle in this.  The Minister is entitled to his bit of backdoors fun in this respect if it pleases some Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fundamentally, on principle, we have no objection to the broad scheme of three-seaters in Mayo, Roscommon-Leitrim and Sligo-Leitrim.  I appreciate that there was little the Minister could do in the sense of changing from that broad scheme, but in the implementation of that scheme he did real violence to principle in the interests of helping particular Deputies and in the process of doing so breached county boundaries to an outrageous extent.  The Minister breached county boundaries particularly in bringing part of Donegal into Sligo-Leitrim, taking part of Roscommon and putting it into East Mayo and at the last minute making an adjustment <Col N="1167" /> in the interest of particular Deputies between East Mayo and West Mayo.</P>
    <P>These are really small points compared to the outrageous surgery the Minister applied to Clare and Galway. This is the central point in my argument. The Minister has butchered those two counties and the three constituencies involved either in the narrow interest of maintaining Coalition strength in those two counties&mdash; he made it so obvious and blatant that it is the cause of serve public comment because of the injustice involved &mdash;or because of some obscure reason for which the Minister may be able to give a logical explanation in this House.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's duty on this Committee Stage to advance not a hectoring or rhetorical argument but the fundamental and basic reasoning behind his proposals.  I give the Minister credit here.  I take it that he may be able to advance such a foundation of reason but we should like to hear it, because if we do not get any logical reason we can only conclude that it was done for narrow, mean, petty party advantage.  Every logical reason that one can advance indicates that County Clare as a territorial unit can be given four seats and West Galway, based on the traditional areas of Galway city and Connemara can be given three seats.  East Galway, based on the towns and the rural hinterlands of Tuam, Ballinasloe and Loughrea, justifies five seats.</P>
    <P>That is what we propose here.  We propose five seats for East Galway, four seats for County Clare and three seats for West Galway.  In that way the least possible violence is done to existing county boundaries, traditional associations and loyalties are preserved and the constitutional criteria are totally observed.  You have there a perfect balance.  County Clare is based on its capital town, Ennis.  You do not have a situation where West Galway constituency goes from Clifden down to the rural district of Ennis and where Ennis, which is more than half way down the county of Clare, is practically pushed into West Galway.  Parts of its own rural district are put into West Galway constituency stretching <Col N="1168" /> up to Clifden in what I can only describe as a vain attempt to scrape in a Labour Senator into a four-seater constituency of West Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will stick to principle and I will try to refrain from going down these political by-passes. The principle of a four-seat constituency in Clare is irrefutable.  I should like to hear the logic behind an artificial four-seat constituency that takes in a third of County Clare&mdash;all of north-west Clare down to the town of Ennis.  Since the foundation of the state West Galway has been based fundamentally on the two units of Galway city and Connemara.  We propose in our amendment, give or take a few parishes, the same constituency as has existed over a long number of years.  In this way East Galway would get its legitimate entitlement to five seats.  The only reason I can think of why this has been done&mdash;unless the Minister has another bit of reason to advance for reducing East Galway to four seats&mdash;is that it was to deprive a quota of Fianna Fáil voters of their logical entitlement to three seats.</P>
      <P>I shall conclude by asking the Minister specifically to deal with what he knows are my fundamental points and to ask: why not four seats in County Clare, preserving County Clare as a county?  Why not three seats in West Galway, keeping Galway city and Connemara as two natural units?  Why not five seats in East Galway, based on the towns of East Galway that naturally, with their rural hinterland, comprise a model five-seat constituency?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I love the bit about Senator Lenihan sticking to principle. In view of the fact that the House has decided on a limited time for the remainder of the debate, it would be unfair of me to take up too much time.  Therefore, I propose to be very short.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into that debate again: it was decided yesterday when perhaps some Senators were not here.  I am satisfied that there will be ample time.  We are not finishing it today, but I think it would be unfair if I take up too much time.  Therefore, I will be as brief as possible.</P>
      <P>As Senator Lenihan has so rightly said, I do not know the Galway-Mayo-Clare area as well as I know the north Meath, Cavan, Louth and Monaghan areas&mdash;and indeed other parts of the country.  However, having studied it very carefully&mdash;anybody who has had the job of drafting an Electoral (Amendment) Bill has to know a lot about practically every townland in the country, at least on a map or on the records, before he draws it up&mdash;I know a good deal about it, but last night I boned up on what the position was exactly.  If the House will forgive me, I shall refer perhaps a little more to notes than I normally do when replying to arguments made.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan made one argument on which I should like to dwell. Three times he repeated the phrase: &ldquo;This is the natural boundary which if a commission were set up they would say &lsquo;We will not change that&rsquo;&mdash;this is what we would want&rdquo;.  This is exactly the reason why I have gone for a change in the constituencies in this way before having the question of a commission considered.  I want to make it clear that I am not against a commission: it would probably be a better way of dealing with it, and discussions later on, after this Bill has been passed, will probably result in a commission.</P>
      <P>However, the boundaries had to be put straight first.  I am sure now, even though Fianna Fáil speakers have been talking about what has been done before as if it were a fair and reasonable way of doing it, they must realise that nobody in his sober senses would attempt to justify what was done in the 1969 allocation of constituencies.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister keep to the group of amendments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to argue about it at all, but it is only right that I should point out a few things in a general reply to what Senator Lenihan has said.  He has spoken about the way seats should be allocated.  Deputy Loughnane, for whom I have a very high regard and whom I consider to be a personal friend, on more than one occasion has said to me that the result of these constituency changes leave him the option of three constituencies in any of which he could get elected.  I believe him to be right. It is another thing that is worrying the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;that Deputy Loughnane can pick his own constituency and get elected in it.  This is a worry because a number of people are wondering who will lose their seats as a result, and I suppose I cannot blame them.</P>
      <P>It has been stated that I suggested and that I proposed certain things in the other House and I should like to cover this.  Deputy Loughnane asked: &ldquo;Why not a four-seater in Clare&rdquo;?  He was entitled to ask that question.  My reply, at column 1374 of Volume 271 on 2nd April, 1974, was:</P>
      <P>It would have been possible to have a four-seater in Clare but it would have meant changing quite a lot of what had already been prepared.</P>
      <P>These are the facts: it would mean changing around a lot of the other constituencies.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Molloy had proposed something like that maybe we would have considered doing it, but he did not...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what I said.  To suggest that I proposed there should be a change and that there should be a four-seater introduced into Clare is not correct. Obviously neither the Fianna Fáil Party in the Dáil nor I considered that a four-seater should operate in Clare. The afterthought has been introduced <Col N="1171" /> here.  I am not quarrelling with the Senators for introducing it: they were entitled to do so and at least they did a little bit of work.  It was a little bit because they missed out on some things which they should have known.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot about Clare and Galway and it is about time that the facts were put on record and the debate taken out of the realms of fairyland.  County Clare has a population of 75,008, which is too high for three seats and too low for four seats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I should be glad if he would listen as patiently. I will not be as long as he was.  A population of 75,008 is too high for three seats and too low for four seats. It had to have a constituency on its own.  County Galway has a population of 149,223, which is too high for seven seats and too low for eight seats.  It cannot stand on its own for constituency purposes.  Each of these counties must be associated in some way with each other.  We heard a lot about natural affinity between areas, and it must be accepted that there is affinity between Clare and Galway. Certainly there is more affinity between them than between, say, Clare and Roscommon.  On the last occasion it was seen fit to put parts of Clare and parts of Roscommon into the same constituency.  Do not let us talk about following an argument that just does not stand up.</P>

      <P>I am stating facts and when I have finished, if anybody can say that it is untrue, that is all right. The natural thing is to combine Clare <Col N="1172" /> and Galway and to treat them as a unit.  The combined population of the two counties is 224,231, which is within the range for 11 seats, and that has been recognised by Fianna Fáil. The natural and obvious course is to give them the 11 seats, but the obvious is never good enough for Fianna Fáil. They want to breach the Roscommon boundary and transfer thousands of people from Roscommon to Galway, simply to give an extra seat to Clare and Galway.  Why should we do this? Why should we do violence to the Roscommon county boundary?  In Senator McGlinchey's colourful phrase: &ldquo;We would vote thousands of Roscommon people headlong into Galway.&rdquo;  There is no necessity to do this.  Clare and Galway are already within the range of 11 seats.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, we give them 11 without doing this.  I would not accuse Senator Lenihan of being irresponsible.  However, I think he dealt rather unfairly with his former constituents by dumping a big number of them into a constituency which was not necessary.  There is not a reason in the world that this should be done. He said I had no reason for doing certain things.  I should like to know the reasoning behind this.  Why take a whole lot of people from Roscommon and dump them into Galway for no apparent reason, unless perhaps for punishment.  I would not consider it punishment, for I think Galway is a a grand county.</P>
      <P>There are a number of ways in which these 11 seats can be allocated. In practical terms, it boils down to two four-seaters and one three-seater, or two three-seaters and one five-seater. Either arrangement would suit, and because on the whole there seems to be a general preference for the smaller type of constituency, we decided on two four-seaters out of three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amused at one argument which has been made here: that we have put three-seaters in areas where we feel that the Coalition will get two out of three and it would have helped <Col N="1173" /> if we had put four-seaters there because Fianna Fáil would have got three out of the four seats.  When we do it in Dún Laoghaire it is wrong and when we do it in Galway it is wrong.  Apparently this is one of the cases where it is not a question of you cannot win them all.  You cannot win any of them with Fianna Fáil because they keep changing feet as they go along.  I could understand it if there was a consistent argument being made by Fianna Fáil which we could follow.  It is wrong to reduce an area to three- or four-seaters, that is because the Coalition are going to get two and they will only get one. Then you put four in and they say that is wrong, too.  It is hard to follow an argument such as that.</P>
    <P>The next thing we have got to get to is: should Clare get three or four seats and should people be transferred from Clare to Galway or from Galway to Clare?  It is as simple as that. The existing situation is that people are being transferred from Clare to Galway and we decided to continue that arrangement.  On the last occasion, when the previous Government were confronted with this identical problem, they also opted for a three-seater in Clare.  Let us have no more of this hypocrisy about the fact that Fianna Fáil believe Clare are entitled to four seats.  They were entitled to it the last time with the same argument but they did not get it.  Fianna Fáil are the people who decided that they should not get it.  For goodness sake, do not let us try to make an argument like that.  It just does not hold any water.  At that time they were accused of doing this for party political advantage. Mr. Boland, who drew up the scheme later, admitted on television that the constituencies in 1969 were drawn up specifically to give maximum advantage to Fianna Fáil.  If Clare were given three seats in 1969 to give Fianna Fáil the advantage how can it be said that doing the same thing now favours the National Coalition?</P>

      <P>How can it now be said that we are giving ourselves an advantage? Yesterday we were accused of putting three-seaters where the National Coalition is strong and four-seaters where Fianna Fáil had the advantage, except in Dún Laoghaire. In Dún Laoghaire it is wrong.  According to the argument made by Fianna Fáil; they are weak in Clare and strong in Dún Laoghaire.  It is hard to know.  If they were consistent and said threes or fours and what they are for, I would understand.  But I am afraid I do not understand the way they are going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are doing is leaving the existing situation in Clare undisturbed. The surplus population in Clare must then be added to one or other of the Galway constituencies.  As mentioned already, we could have a three-seater and a five-seater in Galway or we could have two four-seaters.  But the latter seemed to be a better solution and the one that seemed most likely to find acceptance with the Opposition, given their known preference to this type of constituency.  The next decision was whether West Galway should be brought up to four seats by getting an addition from East Galway which, in turn, would get an addition from Clare or whether a Clare area should be <Col N="1176" /> added directly to West Galway thus reducing the overall amount of disturbance. That seemed to be the obvious solution and that is what we did.  In other words we have done a repair job on the Galway area.  The simplest, fairest and most straightforward arrangement lies in the facts of the situation.</P>
    <P>I cannot follow the arguments which have been put forward here by Fianna Fáil.  It appears today, as yesterday, that Fianna Fáil forget that it is not Kevin Boland who is here.  They feel that since he was carrying out their instructions for the purpose of, as he said himself, cementing Fianna Fáil in power&mdash;but the cement was wet and it dried up and it was no use; when it came into operation it fell to pieces, it did not hold&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Listening to you fellows you could not blame me.  Fianna Fáil seem to feel in some peculiar way that it is still the job of the Minister for Local Government, no matter who he is, to cement Fianna Fáil in power. As I said yesterday, God above cannot do that.  If He could not do it there is not a hope in the world of my being able to do it.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to take up the time of the House.  I want to give the Opposition every opportunity to make their case if they have one to make, but I should like to make two other comments. The amendments to the two Mayo constituencies would result in East Mayo being outside the permitted tolerance.  Maybe it is unfair of me to say this, but in view of all the people with a very high IQ in the Fianna Fáil benches it is not too much to ask that they should be able to count and know how many people would be required in order to fit into the tolerance.  This was not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I understand that Senator <Col N="1177" /> Yeats is one of the intellectuals of the Fianna Fáil Party and therefore he should be able to count and divide by the number of seats and he should know himself.  But he does know that one vote out of the tolerance would make it unconstitutional so there is no point in asking how many votes.  There are very many more than one vote.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of being insulting.  I am afraid that the Senator is very easily insulted if he feels it is an insult to suggest to him that he should have counted the number before he put in an amendment. It is as simple as that.  The result is that it is outside the tolerance and, therefore, it is contrary to the Constitution, contrary to the court decision and therefore it is not possible to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>As Senator Lenihan said, it is not important because he does not consider it is an important issue.  The issue is whether we should change the Clare and Galway areas.  I do not propose to accept that proposal for a number of reasons.  If somebody can persuade me with a better argument I will listen to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing about the Minister's speech is that he has shown <Col N="1178" /> all the marks of a guilty conscience in respect of this amendment.  He has, with the utmost deliberation, refrained from giving any kind of answer or even trying to give any kind of answer to the basic point, which is why was Clare made a three-seat constituency and West Galway a four-seat constituency instead of the other way around, which would have been the natural thing to do?</P>
      <P>In order to avoid doing this he has gone into all kinds of irrelevancies, gone into a variety of personalities, and he has refused even the simplest item of information.  We had an example of this just a few minutes ago when he suggested that he could not accept this amendment because East Mayo was outside the limit of tolerance allowed by the Constitution. I asked him how many votes were involved.  He refused quite blankly to answer.  He says he knows.  I cannot see why a Minister of State, who is supposed to be acting in a quasi-judicial capacity in a matter like this, who is coming in here to explain the Bill, to answer serious arguments in a serious way, should behave in this arrogant fashion.  I suspect that perhaps it is because the number involved is about 15 or so and he realises that his point is so small and futile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Senator has all the figures worked out for his amended Schedule.  Is he asking the House to accept a Schedule which would be unconstitutional?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not necessarily be illegal because it has never been decided by any court the exact limit of the tolerance.  We have been working on the basic tolerance of either 1,000 up or 1,000 down.  In any event, there would have been no difficulty if the Minister were prepared to consider amendments.  There would not have been any difficulty in making marginal alterations which might be required to deal with a matter of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1179" /> The Minister is trying to avoid the basic issue.  In his smart aleck way he asked how could there be four seats in Clare.  There are either enough voters for four seats or not. The Minister knows better than anybody else in this House that when one is working to a tolerance of approximately 1,000 up or 1,000 below the basic average of the country one cannot say that there should be three-seat constituencies or four- or five-seat constituencies.  It is not as simple as that.  Of all the constituencies in the country there are a relatively small number that could be classed as having either three or four seats, but the greater number of them obviously have too many for three or too few for four and they have to be topped up, as the Minister knows well, from adjoining constituencies and occasionally from adjoining counties in order to establish some basic number of Deputies for the constituency.</P>
    <P>In County Clare we had a position, as the Minister already pointed out, where the population in 1971 was 75,008.  The minimum number required, on the basis of the tolerance that the Minister has been using, for four seats could be 76,492 which is an extra 1,484 votes.  Yesterday, when the Minister was speaking about his neighbouring county of Louth he said, which I accept, that of course Louth had to be given four seats. They had not enough population for four seats but they were so close that they had to be given four seats. Louth, in the year 1971&mdash;the census year on which we are working&mdash;had a smaller population.  The Minister is right when he says that it is so close that the population required the four seats.  Of course, we had to keep the four seats.</P>
    <P>In the case of County Clare, he says that Clare is even closer than Louth to four seats.  Another 1,484 votes would give it four seats but we are to give it only three, and we will put a very large number of Clare people in an already large West Galway constituency. The reason for this is quite clear.  Because the Fianna Fáil vote in County Clare is in the region of <Col N="1180" /> 60 per cent or so, in a four-seat constituency it would be three-quarters. There would be a danger that perhaps Fianna Fáil might get three out of the four in Clare.  That 60 per cent in a three-seat constituency would give them two out of three and no more, and it would be difficult in the present circumstances in a four-seat West Galway that Fianna Fáil, even with a majority of the votes, would get more than two seats out of four.</P>
    <P>The Minister has several times said that I am inconsistent in that when he puts a four-seat constituency in one place I complain and when he does not I also complain.  I hope the Minister will listen to me carefully and I should be glad if he would answer my point.  The point I was making about Dún Laoghaire, to which he referred several times in his most recent intervention, was that there were eight four-seat constituencies in the Dublin area.  In seven of the eight Fianna Fáil had two seats out of four and in the eighth&mdash;Dún Laoghaire&mdash;they only had one.  Of all the eight four-seat constituencies in the Dublin area this was the one he selected to leave with four seats.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, when it comes to choosing a four-seat constituency in the West Galway-Clare areas, instead of going for the natural place, which is Clare as he admits himself on the basis of Louth, he puts the four-seater in West Galway where he hopes Fianna Fáil will get only two seats and that a party colleague of his may perhaps become a Member of the Dáil.  That is my complaint. I am not complaining that the Minister sets up four seats in one place.  I accept that in any distribution there might, inevitably, be four seats there.  My objection is not that the Minister is establishing four-seat constituencies, but at the totally selective and unfair way in which he has done it.  The Minister, in introducing this Bill on the Second Stage, concluded in his final paragraph at column 681 on 9th April of the Seanad Debates:</P>
    <P>In drawing up the proposals contained in this Bill my objective was to ensure fair and reasonable representations <Col N="1181" /> to the people of every area.  I endeavoured, as far as possible, to do that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention particularly to this:</P>
    <P>I endeavoured as far as possible to avoid breaching existing administrative boundaries and tried to ensure that natural communities were not split unnecessarily between different constituencies.  I hope I succeeded in these objectives and judging by the comments of impartial observers I believe my efforts have been successful.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister says that as far as possible he has tried to avoid breaching existing administrative boundaries.  As I understand that phrase, it ought to mean that where it is reasonably practicable to frame a constituency which will coincide so far as possible with an existing county boundary, that should be done, and he had the chance to do this in the county of Clare.  He has not done so. Instead of taking in maybe 1,500 or so people from County Galway he has dumped a very large number of Clare people, 13,000, into West Galway. He has brought this West Galway constituency down to within a couple of miles or so of the town of Ennis.  I would ask the Minister to tell us candidly: does he regard this as being a matter of avoiding breaching existing administrative boundaries?  It seems to me that that is a question he ought to answer.  If he says, as he did yesterday, that of course the County of Louth had to be made a four-seat constituency because it was almost at the level of population that required a four-seat constituency, in view of that clear, categorical and I think honest statement, why in the name of heaven did he not do the same with Clare which has even more people? He spoke of Fianna Fáil making Clare a three-seat constituency.  But of course he quite ignores the fact that due to the beneficial results of a Fianna Fáil Government, the population of Clare rose by some 1,500 between the census of 1966 and the census of 1971.  The fortunate position of that was in 1971 the county of Clare was considerably nearer to having <Col N="1182" /> the population required for four-seats than it was in 1966.</P>
    <P>We have the curious situation in these western constituencies covered by this amendment that in the areas where the population was rising the Minister has taken seats away from these areas.  In the areas where the population was falling the Minister has maintained the existing representation. In Galway, for example the population rose between 1966 and 1971 by some 883; in Clare it rose by 411, and the result of the Minister's redistribution was to take a seat away from these two combined counties. On the other hand, the county of Mayo fell by no less than 6,022 population between 1966 and 1971&mdash;the Minister and I have already agreed on an earlier stage of this Bill that he was right in this&mdash;and the Minister maintained the existing representation.  Of course he did this by bringing in very large sections of County Roscommon. In his glib way he spoke of Roscommon being included in the Galway constituency on the previous occasion where I gathered there was only one townland involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But you were doing better than that.  Look at your own amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>In East Mayo we now find that the following district electoral divisions of Roscommon have been included: Artagh North, Artagh South, Ballaghaderreen, Ballinlough, Buckhill, Cloonfower, Coolougher, Edmondstown, Kiltullagh, Loughglinn.  I have already said on this Bill that Mayo is a farflung county, thinly populated, and I am entirely in favour of maintaining the existing number of Deputies.  But the fact remains that the population had fallen by over 6,000 and the Minister, simply because the Fine Gael organisation is strong in Mayo, left their existing representation whereas in Galway and Clare, where the population did not fall by 6,000 but rose by a total of something over 2,300 there, he took away a Deputy because Fianna Fáil were strong.  In the same way in the other areas covered by these amendments we find that the population of Leitrim fell by <Col N="1183" /> 2,212; of Roscommon by 2,709, and of Sligo by 988, a total fall here of again some 6,000.  In these counties formed into two constituencies, the Minister has left the existing representation, again because these are areas in which Fine Gael are strong and indeed at the moment have four seats out of six.</P>
      <P>You have the same kind of pattern in the west, perhaps even more pronounced, but the same kind of pattern which you have in other parts of the country.  The Minister takes seats away where Fianna Fáil are strong and leaves them or even adds them where his own side are strong.  That is the burden of our complaint.  We are not asking the Minister, and indeed we would be very foolish to expect the Minister, to frame these constituencies in a way which will help Fianna Fáil.  The Minister has raised this point again and again.  He knows perfectly well that that is not the issue. He quoted Mr. Kevin Boland as having alleged that his redistribution was supposed to help Fianna Fáil and after all the Minister was gerrymandering now himself.  May I ask the Minister did he accept the statement of Mr. Boland?  I ask him again does he?  Is he coming in here now and saying: &ldquo;After all we objected to Bills that were introduced in previous years so we are giving you hell now&rdquo;?  Is that his point?  I should like to know.  Is the Minister now coming in and saying: &ldquo;I am now in office.  I am just arranging this in a way that which will do the utmost possible damage to Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  Is that in fact the Minister's aim?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am not saying that, and I should like to reassure Senator Yeats; but I know that Mr. Boland did say it and he got the support of the Fianna Fáil Party when he said it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister quoted Mr. Boland with some approval and I take it that if he quotes Mr. Boland with approval he accepts Mr. Boland's remarks about his own gerrymandering. We do not expect the Minister to help Fianna Fáil of course.  We do expect the Minister to live up to his <Col N="1184" /> own statement on the Second Reading of the Bill that his objective was to ensure fair and reasonable representation for the people of every area, and in particular we are entitled to ask him to justify the statement that so far as possible he had endeavoured to avoid breaching existing administrative boundaries.  Now we have not yet had an effort at an answer from him.  I would ask him quite seriously to give us a simple, coherent answer: why did he give only three seats to the county of Clare when its population was within 1,400 of being adequate for a four-seater, when its population is higher than that of the County Louth, the county of which he said, of course it had to be given four seats because it was so very, very near the number needed for four seats.  Now I would ask him simply to answer that basic, simple question. When Clare could have been made a four-seater by adding in 1,400 or 1,500 Galway people into the Clare constituency&mdash;a very minor breach in the county boundary&mdash;why did he not do that instead of making a totally unworkable type of constituency of West-Galway with some 13,000 Clare people.  It is a simple issue.  There were two things the Minister could have done in that western area.  He could have made West Galway a three-seater and Clare a four-seater or the other way round.</P>
      <P>I should like to have from the Minister, not based on what anyone did in the past or on what anybody else has said, a simple justification of this basic point in his own Bill.  The Minister is now a Minister of State. He is responsible for this Bill, not Kevin Boland or anyone else.  He has done this particular thing for some reason.  We are entitled to ask what the reason is.</P>

      <P>I want to deal specifically with the Clare and Galway position. I want to point out a fact, basing it on an argument which the Minister used.  He has used the argument consistently in this House on this Bill that he does not base his ideas of this Bill on what he believes are the wrongs of a previous Bill brought before the Houses.  He believes that the <Col N="1185" /> approaches applied to previous Bills should not be applied to this Bill because the others were wrong.  There are a few points to be made, in using the Minister's argument against himself.  I do not think the Minister will be able to make an honest reply to the argument.</P>

The Minister says he tried in earnest not to be too severe in splitting county boundaries.  He refers to the previous division in Clare-Galway.  The division in the Clare-Galway situation on the previous occasion was a more natural, geographical one.  After leaving the town of Gort, heading for Clare, you enter a mountainy region.  In the previous division, most of Clare which was in Clare-Galway had Gort for its market town.  Therefore the Minister was trying to integrate two different county peoples&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Clare is my neighbouring county and I know it well.  The Minister does not appear to know Clare-Galway or the west of Ireland <Col N="1190" /> very well.  Who has pumped all this information into the Minister?  He appears to have grasped the situation politically quite well as he has annihilated the people who are anti-Coalition and has promoted the interests of those who are pro-Coalition. Those facts go back some time.  With sarcasm and a grand smile on his face he admitted to this House that he knew very little about the west of Ireland, he knew very little about Clare-Galway, and he begged the pardon of the House, that he would use his notes to explain the situation.  Yet he gets up and states that Fianna Fáil acted wrongly in the Clare-Galway situation, as not alone did they bring in part of Clare, which I have tried to explain was geographically right, but they brought in part of Roscommon.  They got in the parish of Moore which has a population of 275 persons.  It is adjacent to Ballinasloe.  It is the odd part of Roscommon which is just in Galway.  If we were drawing county boundaries again Moore would be a Galway parish.</P>
      <P>Now for some unknown reason he starts at Innishbofin and takes in all of Connemara as a unit.  The city of Galway is a unit.  He comes down to the Clare-Galway border and proceeds to cross the border of Clare to put 13,000 Clare people from the point of Hags Head across through the parish of Inagh to within two miles of Ennis and back again up the western side of that part of Clare.  There is no justification for what the Minister has done in Clare no matter what anybody tells him.  As the Minister has said of Louth, Clare is even a more natural four-seater and I know the Minister will admit that himself.  In the whole country&mdash;the Minister can contradict me if I am wrong&mdash;the village of Newmarket, County Clare, had the highest percentage population rise of any town in rural Ireland.  The Minister almost went down to Newmarket.  I made a statement in this House on the last occasion when I pointed out to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator asked me about making the point in an eloquent way.  The Minister should use the logical conclusion he used in County Louth but with more in it.  We have put down an amendment concerning West <Col N="1192" /> Galway.  West Galway is a unit, and has always been a unit, of Connemara and Galway city.  We have asked for a three-seater for it and have given a logical amendment as was hinted, rather than suggested in the other House.  There the Minister hinted that maybe if an amendment was put down in the other House he would give it due consideration.  Here is the amendment. Has the Minister the power to accept those amendments?  That is what is lacking in this debate because I believe that the Minister has his hands tied.  The instruction coming to him from the Government was: &ldquo;Not an inch to any of them&rdquo;, even though they are the Government of consultation as was pointed out in their 14-point plan.  I can imagine the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien, telling them: &ldquo;Not an inch, Minister, when you go up to those Houses with this Bill.  We will do it our way.&rdquo;  It reminds me of the beautiful song.  I am sure the chorus was beautiful and that the encores were fantastic at that Government meeting.  When the Bill arrived here there was a sealing-off process on the opposite side of the House for two days.  Not one of them opened his mouth or was allowed to open his mouth.  They had to look at the Minister first before they even made a remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This week we came to the Committee Stage of the Bill.  We were abused and ballyragged for delaying the Bill.  All we did was to contribute in a responsible way.  In the other House the Minister said that if there had been a proper amendment concerning the Clare-Galway situation he might have considered it. Now he has the amendment but he cannot consider it.  He has not the gumption and the courage to say: &ldquo;I have been instructed that I cannot accept in any way or in any form from this House an amendment or even a portion of an amendment suggested by the Opposition.&rdquo;  On the basis of the argument used by the Minister in regard to Louth I have tried to make a case for Clare which is even more valid.  In suggesting a four-seater for Clare we ask that <Col N="1193" /> West Galway be made a three-seater not because it has always been a three-seater but because it is a natural three-seater with the city of Galway on one side and Connemara, tied to tourism in every way with Galway city, on the other.  There is no argument against that and if there is I should like to hear the Minister make it.</P>
    <P>We have asked for a five-seater in East Galway.  We suggested a progression into a portion of Roscommon most of which the Minister put in with East Mayo.  We asked in one of our amendments that that part of Roscommon be included in East Galway to make it a five-seater. I will give a logical reason for that too.  I shall start with Tuam.  Tuam is an agricultural town with an agricultural hinterland.  The same applies to Ballinasloe, Loughrea, Portumna and Dunmore.  There is something in common with all of that part of the five-seater in East Galway.  It is the agricultural area of the county and for that reason alone we have used it as a basis for a five-seater.</P>
    <P>I am aware, and I think everybody on both sides of this House is aware, that we may be talking to the wind. The wind is to our backs and it is blowing everything we say away for the reason that the Minister, just as the Government parties in this House are under an instruction not to look at us or suggest that we have proposed something proper for a change.  Without going through Mayo at all there is a far more logical thought behind our amendment concerning Clare and Galway than the Minister could even possibly dream of.  Clare is a natural four-seater with a portion of Portumna and Loughrea.  West Galway, for the reasons stated, tourist-wise and so on is a natural set-up for a three-seater As I explained before, East Galway, because of its good farming, because of its natural dependence on agriculture, is an ideal set-up for a five-seater, with the addition of portion of Roscommon, which the Minister has put in with Mayo.  He cannot say that we have taken a part of Roscommon to put it with Galway when he is taking, for <Col N="1194" /> the most part, the exact same part of Roscommon to put with Mayo.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I ask the Minister, before he dehydrates the thoughts of the people of the western seaboard and before he lets this continue, to bring it to a halt.  We have offered constructive, positive amendments, particularly in the case of Clare and Galway. Would he consider them?  Would he give them a chance for a logical reason which I tried to explain?  I have always assumed the Minister to be an independent man, a man who thinks for himself.  In order to make the amendments work the Minister could, if he so wished, make the case that I am making in regard to Clare and Galway on the same basis that the Minister has used in regard to Louth. At this late stage I ask, for the sake of the people of Clare and of Galway, not to separate them or annoy them more because they are being driven away from politics and politicians and they are not being helped.  They are not being taught to appreciate politics, constitutions or the work that public representatives try to do for them. People are being driven apart and they are not being helped in any way to amalgamate their thoughts.  There is no common traditional cultural link between the people of Inishbofin and those of Lahinch.  The Minister is advocating separatism and is dividing and throwing them apart.  He is annihilating anything good and decent that people may have thought about politicians by what he is doing to West Galway.  The Minister knows that the people of Inishbofin, Aran and the islands off Connemara are one unit and always have been.  If one went to Galway the first place to visit would be Connemara, then Aran and then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Yeats pointed out that there was no basic change in the <Col N="1195" /> constituency of Sligo-Leitrim <i>vis-à-vis</i> East and West Mayo from the point of view of the number of candidates. Why was this changed?  Would the Minister give me a reason for this terrible cut in the counties of Galway and Clare?  It is glaringly obvious to everybody that the Minister is doing this for political reasons.  I hate to accuse anyone in or out of this House of such a motive but it is wrong to utilise people in order to try to achieve something for a political reason.  We have given the Minister solid amendments. We have given him room to manoeuvre using the argument that he himself has used to justify Louth being a four-seater.  We have given him the same logical reasons for making Clare a four-seater.  We have given him a good, if not better, reason for leaving West Galway a three-seater and we have tried to give him a logical reason for making East Galway a five-seater.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister ask the Government to reconsider the amendments concerning those two counties?  I ask him not to drive a wedge between people but that is what he is doing here.  If we are wrong, we should be told where.  Our principle is right in its application.  Instead of smiling, the Minister should give us a reason other than a political one, because if he wants a political reason, I can assure him that the National Coalition have a better chance in Galway, with East Galway as a five-seater than they have with Clare as a three-seater.  I appeal to the Minister for the sake of the application of justice and for the betterment of the people to reconsider his proposals.</P>

      <P>A number of Senators have made the argument that we are depriving Clare and Galway of a seat. This is not so.  In fact, we are giving them 11 seats.  The population is 224,231 which would not give them 12 seats but it gives them 11 seats.  Therefore, we should not continue with that argument because it is not a valid one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Yeats asked me to give reasons for making Clare a three-seat constituency.  I am not sure if he was present all the time but I spent practically 20 minutes giving a very detailed <Col N="1196" /> reason why I considered that what I had done was correct.  During the Second Stage debate I referred to the fact that Senator Yeats was adopting an Alice in Wonderland attitude. He asked the questions but he also wanted to give the answers himself. When he asks a question he dismisses the answer before he gets it.  I do not propose to continue on that basis.  I have given the answers whether they are acceptable or not.  If they are not there is nothing I can do about it. Incidentally Senator Killilea did not get the words of the song right.  They are: &ldquo;I did it my way&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It is significant.  Senator Killilea and every other Senator who spoke on Clare-Galway referred to the question of why we are taking nearly 13,000 people out of Clare and putting them into Galway.  May I put on the record of this House the facts of this case?  In accordance with the existing constituencies under which the last general election was fought, the Clare-South Galway constituency had 14,287 Clare people in it.  My proposal would leave 12,277 Clare people in that constituency.  I do not know whether there is some kind of mental block which is preventing people from counting correctly or adding up or subtracting, but if someone can show me that 12,277 is greater than 14,287 I will listen to him.  This has been the argument which has been put up right along.  I hate going back to this but Fianna Fáil did have the chance of giving four seats to Galway.  Under this they had a better chance than I have but they did not do it.  Senator Killilea talks about the difference between the areas in Connemara, Galway city and the area of Clare.  There is a lot more in common with Connemara and the area of Clare in question than there is with Galway city but that is the way that God put it and there is nothing that I can do about it.  Do not let anybody try to tell me that Galway city has more in common with the islands&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Killilea made the argument for a five-seater for East Galway.  I do not blame him for that at all.  He made a very good argument according to his own lights for a five-seater in East Galway but it is a little bit off to talk about trying to give a seat to one of the Labour Party in Galway West where a four-seater is being put in when all of us know why Senator Killilea wants a five-seater in East Galway.  I will not go any further than that.  We do not want to indulge in personalities in this but in view of the fact that so many references were made to one side of it I think I should balance it off now by putting the weight on to the other side and showing exactly what the facts are.  I am not blaming Senator Killilea at all but at least when he talks about honesty and about giving the reasons as to why we do these things, let us have this out in the open.  According to him the thinking behind the Opposition amendment is more logical than anything the Minister has put forward or anything he could put forward.  That is a very fair summary of Fianna Fáil's attitude because the Senator said: &ldquo;Give us anything in Galway and Clare except what you have proposed and we will accept it&rdquo;.  Apparently what Fianna Fáil are saying is that it does not matter a lot.  They are saying: &ldquo;We wanted it our way but at least give us something different from what you want&rdquo;.  Why should I?  Why should I change it if I think it is right?  I think it is right and there is no argument which would convince me that it should be changed. We know that various types of cases have been put up for this, that and <Col N="1198" /> the other but it is only right that when we start talking about changing &mdash;and the boundaries of constituencies came up again and again&mdash;to point out that despite what Senator Killilea says about the 1969 constituency taking only one parish from Roscommon to put into Clare-South Galway, the fact is that 1,975 persons from Roscommon were put into the constituency which was made up of bits of three counties&mdash;Galway, Clare and Roscommon and, in addition, 7,938 Roscommon people were transferred into the constituency of NorthEast Galway.  I would suggest that it might help to soothe the tempers of the Fianna Fáil Senators if, when this House adjourns this evening, they would get the details of the constituency as it was drawn up the last time and the time before.  Let them go back on what happened and get the documents, which are fairly numerous, in the benches before them and compare them with what, in effect, was done in every case.</P>

      <P>It was proposed to wipe out some of the people who were listed as awkward in the Fianna Fáil Party.  I think it is a bit off for people to come in here suggesting that I should not have done what I did.  I have prepared this.  I think it was well done.  I will again point out that the suggestion made in one of the amendments puts it over the tolerance limit and, therefore, the whole lot would fall down because it could not be done under the present arrangements.  I do not propose, unless there is some other point made, to deal with this set of amendments again.  I have taken up a good deal of the time of the House but I think it is only fair that I should reply to the points made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried previously to get in on a few points.  The Minister may have dealt with some of them but I want to make it perfectly clear that it is the underlying principle regarding the whole Bill that annoys me most. When you tot up the number of people in Clare-Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo and Donegal and if you divide its value in the number allowed under the tolerance you would get 30 seats.  What I am worried about is that under the present arrangement the west will be losing two seats.  It was a point that should have been considered because the Minister has already breached <Col N="1200" /> county boundaries.  On the population figures it was impossible to divide the constituencies without doing that.  I will concede that to him.  He should have leaned towards the western area and towards the three counties in Ulster.  As it happens, we are losing two seats in Ulster as well.  This is frustrating and annoying to the people of rural areas.  We are not worried about who or what political party should gain the seats but Deputies and Senators of all parties will naturally lean towards their own areas and it will be for the benefit of those areas, which certainly need any little benefit that can come their way.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why the Minister makes a four-seater in County Louth.  He gave some reasons for it when he was dealing with the constituencies of Cavan, Monaghan, Meath and Louth.  One of his points was that Louth had a population of around 74,951 and that it was entitled to a four-seater.  If that argument were valid in that case and if the same argument were valid for making a four-seater out of County Meath, I ask the Minister to try to keep the three-seater in Cavan and in Monaghan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just making the comparison by asking the Minister, if he follows the same logic, why he now refuses to make a four-seater out of Clare.  He said the distance from Blacklion down to the other end of Cavan and Meath was too far and yet here there is the distance from Inishbofin down almost to rural districts in County Clare.  I should like to have this point answered because in all justice the people of Cavan and Monaghan would like to know why this has taken place in County Louth <Col N="1201" /> and yet the Minister will not let County Clare have a four-seater.  I suggest that this is certainly done for particular reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us that he does not intend to speak on the amendment again unless some new point is made.  This amounts to the fact that the Minister does not intend to deal with the very valid criticism which has been made of the arrangement which he has in the Bill. His last speech was really a masterpiece of avoiding points that were made and of dragging in a few red herrings.  He has again taken the skeleton out in relation to the plans that he has in the Department which he is threatening to show us.  He really should show them to us and get them out of the way, because they are only a red herring.  I do not think the Minister is being completely honest in continuing to make references to these.  The Minister knows very well that on any occasion when there is a revision of constituencies that there are probably hundreds of different proposals made as to how this could be approached.  To suggest that he has one or two which would be very unpopular with certain Fianna Fáil Deputies is a bit much.  Of course, he has quite a lot of proposals and some of them might not be acceptable to some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies any more than they would be acceptable to some Fine Gael or Labour Deputies. There are, I am sure, quite a lot of different drafts which the Minister could use and if he produces them selectively he might make a point about it.  It is an irrelevancy.  It is not answering any of the points which we made here.  If the Minister really thinks that he has some sort of a draft that will create a sensation then I think he should produce it and get it out of the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has in that way, and in various other ways, avoided answering the very valid arguments which have been made against the way in which he has organised the constituencies in Clare and Galway.  Instead of dealing with these arguments he keeps on telling us about the last Bill in 1969 and about how many Clare <Col N="1202" /> people were put into Galway then.  If there were more people put into Galway then than are being put in now, then that was wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister is supposed to be coming in here with an improvement, according to himself, on the previous Act.  He has on many occasions boasted that this is a much better arrangement and a big improvement, on what was done in 1969.  Let us forget about the Bill that he disapproves of so much.  Let us talk about the Bill he is bringing in and which he is standing over and which he says is a tremendous improvement on what happened in the past.</P>
    <P>We are talking about the Bill now before us.  Instead of dealing with arguments that are being made the Minister is suggesting that the very cogent arguments that were made by Senator Killilea have been made because the Senator has his own ambitions for County Galway.  Again, that may be a very smart political point but it is not answering the arguments which have been made.  Once again, it is avoiding the issue.  If the Minister will not give us an answer he will have to be prepared to listen to these points being made again and again to see if we could force him either to give an answer or else admit that this arrangement is being made for reasons which have no validity from the objective point of view as being a reasonable and fair division of the area in Galway and Clare.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, at column 674, Volume 77, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The constitutional requirements, the courts' decisions and the interpretations of them provide the framework within which a revision of constituencies must take place. It is desirable that within these basic rules account should also be taken, as far as possible, of certain other matters such as local administrative boundaries, particularly county boundaries, physical features, community of interest and the existing scheme of Dáil constituencies.</P>
    <P>Almost every single one of these boundaries has been breached in the</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> I said on Second Stage that I was a arrangement which he had made for Galway and Clare.  There cannot be the slightest question but that county boundaries have been breached in respect of Clare, and breached quite unnecessarily.  As far as community of interest is concerned it is quite clear that Connemara, West Galway, is a particular kind of area and to bring it down to Clare is to introduce a completely different element into that constituency, if community of interest means anything.</P>
    <P>little bit sceptical about this phrase &ldquo;community of interest&rdquo; for the very reason that it can be abused.  It can be used to prove anything because one person's view of community of interest might differ from that of another.  I said it was dangerous to rely on it as a reason for saying that the constituency should be a particular area.  If community of interest means anything Connemara in West Galway is an area which has a community of interest and it is an area which should have been left to itself. By bringing it into Clare there is a gross breach of that principle in so far as that principle means anything.  It is the Minister who introduced that as something to be used and something to be taken into consideration.  He brought it in and he should try to stick to it and leave some validity in the principle which he has created himself.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made no effort to explain why he interfered with Clare, except to say that in the previous Bill this was not done.  It was up to the Minister, if he thought the previous Bill was wrong, to undo the wrong that was done to Clare on the last occasion.  There was a great deal of talk and criticism of the previous Bill because of what was done to Clare. Why was this position not rectified? On the figures there is no answer to it.</P>
    <P>Louth has less people than Clare has but nevertheless the Minister said he had to give four seats to Louth. Meath has much less.  Meath has only 71,729 as compared with 75,000. Nevertheless, the Minister gave very plausible reasons why Meath should <Col N="1204" /> be a four-seater.  He made the case for Meath.  He made the case for Louth.  Both of them have fewer people than Clare, but for some extraordinary reason Clare was not given four seats.  It is indefensible.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not answered or attempted to answer the arguments which have been made about this point.  Certainly no impartial observer &mdash;to use a phrase which the Minister used himself in introducing the Second Stage&mdash;could possibly accept that it was objective, reasonable or fair in all the circumstances not to give four seats to Clare in view of the fact that this could be done and in view of the fact that the figures justify it.  The figures justify it in that case more than in at least two other cases where four seats were given.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of breaching county boundaries, of community of interest in West Galway in so far as that has a validity, and from the point of view of the community of interest in East Galway, which was very cogently argued by Senator Killilea, the arrangement proposed in this amendment certainly makes sense.  It is a very valid and objective suggestion as to how this area should be arranged.  It is quite clearly a preferable arrangement to the one which the Minister has in his Bill.  The Minister has completely failed to answer the arguments which have been made in favour of this amendment.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator Halligan is back because I was a little bit worried for a time during a critical part of this debate that something might have happened to the Constitution in his absence.  He was adopting the role of guardian of the Constitution for a while.  I am glad he is back to adopt that role again.  Of course, it is not certain that the arrangement which has been suggested in this amendment might infringe the Constitution but that can easily be rectified.  It can easily be rearranged if the Minister indicates that there is validity in our proposals and that the kind of arrangement which is suggested in the amendments is a better arrangement than the arrangement in the Bill.  It would be quite easy to make the <Col N="1205" /> necessary minor adjustments so as to bring this completely within the necessary tolerances.</P>
    <P>We could easily lay at rest Senator Halligan's scruples about the Constitution. I would not like him to be worried about this because he has shown deep concern about the Constitution. It is something which I am sure could be dealt with to his complete satisfaction.  If the Minister indicated&mdash;I am afraid he will not&mdash; that there was merit in this arrangement then the necessary adjustments could be made.  So far he has produced no argument that any impartial observer could possibly accept to justify the arrangement in the Bill as compared with the arrangement suggested in these amendments.  The Minister said he is not going to say any more about it.  The fact is, and this is quite clear, he cannot justify his own arrangement; at least he cannot justify it in a way that he is willing to admit.  It can only be justified on the basis of a special arrangement. A special constituency is being in the most extraordinary way, created for the benefit of somebody.  The whole of Galway and Clare is being distorted for that reason.  It is the only reason that can possibly explain what is being done.  If the Minister would get up and say that is why it is being done at least we would know where we stand and at least we could leave the matter at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I would not intervene unless there was something special said.  In fact, Senator E. Ryan then proceeded to challenge me to say something.  Now with your permission, Sir, I would like to take up his challenge.  Before doing so, however, I would like to refer to what Senator Ryan said on Second Reading about a natural community.  He said that this was a dangerous expression which could mean all things to all men.  Then he proceeded to take me to task for what he calls the natural community of Galway city. There is a difference in the way in which the Senator uses the expression and the way in which I use it.  If it is all things to all men I would pass it back to him.  In fact, I would say <Col N="1206" /> that it does not interfere with the natural community but simply adds to it.  I want to say also that west of the Shannon the total population of the area is 574,254.  When we divide this figure by the national average of 20,123 we get a figure of 28.5.  How then can it be said that we are being unfair when we give them 28 seats?  I was challenged by Senator E. Ryan who wanted to know if I had something to produce it.  With your permission, Madam, I would like to put it on the record of the House, which is the only way I can produce it here.</P>
      <P>I want to do this because I want to prove that the arguments being made by the Fianna Fáil Opposition here are arguments in which they do not believe.  The submission of amendments here is only being done in an effort to try to be obstructive.  They did not believe what they are now saying when they had the opportunity to do something.  If Fianna Fáil were in Government they would not do what they are now suggesting, and I should like to put this on record.  To come now to the proposals which my predecessor was working on&mdash;and there were, in fact, a number of proposals as Senator E. Ryan said&mdash;the counties of Clare and Galway, together with part&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We very much want it and are prepared to deal with it, because what the Minister, I anticipate, is going to refer to are proposals between officials and the Minister which are discussed in the preparation of every recommendation to a Government.  The Minister by now knows how Governments work.  No final proposals ever arrived on a Government table.  No final proposal was ever considered by the Minister for Local Government.  I would personally know about it if that was so.  The Minister is quoting from ordinary documents within the Department of Local Government where some officials put forward proposals and other officials put forward counter-proposals when the matter is in the melting-pot of decision-making.  If the Minister wants to go ahead with that he can do it.</P>

      <P>In case the Minister did not hear me the Minister was not in the process of preparing a Bill.  The Minister is now aware, after a year in Government, that Bills are considered in the form of memoranda to the Government from the relevant Ministers. No memorandum was ever prepared in the Department of Local Government by the Minister for Local Government for consideration by the Government.  The matter never came before the Government for their consideration. Therefore, no instruction as to the preparation of a Bill could have issued from the Government.  As the Minister is aware, no Minister on his own can order the preparation of a Bill without getting Government approval.  This matter never came to the Government.  That puts the matter in perspective.</P>

Representations <Col N="1214" /> seeking such facilities have been submitted from time to time in respect of such groups as commercial travellers, sailors, fishermen, invalids, persons who are abroad on business at election time, airline staffs, hospital patients, persons who have changed their address, persons who are away on holidays at the time an election is held, and old people and others who are unable to leave their homes because of illness or incapacity.</P>
    <P>In response to the representations, the extension of postal voting facilities, which are at present confined to members of the Garda Síochána and of the Defence Forces, was considered on a number of occasions by my predecessors as Minister for Local Government and by former Governments. It was also considered in 1960-61 by the Joint Committee on the Electoral Law.  However on each occasion the view was taken that the risk of abuse would be too great.  Administrative difficulties arising from the large numbers of electors likely to be involved were also taken into account.</P>
    <P>The risk of abuse and the administrative difficulties inherent in the operation of a system of postal voting for categories of electors other than members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces must be balanced against the fact that the lack of such a system has the effect of preventing some electors from exercising their right to vote.  In my view, the case for extending postal voting facilities is a very strong one and outweighs the risk of abuse and the administrative difficulties.  Accordingly I propose to make regulations, subject to the approval of each House of the Oireachtas, under which such facilities would be available at local elections commencing with the local elections next June.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum which has been circulated explains the provisions of the proposed regulations. Basically what is proposed is that a right to apply to vote by post at local elections should be granted to every elector who is unable, or is likely to be unable, to vote in person at his polling station by reason of the circumstances of his occupation, service or employment, <Col N="1215" /> absence from the address where he is registered, illness or physical disability or his employment by a returning officer in connection with an election.  The application procedure has been designed to facilitate electors as far as possible while at the same time maintaining safeguards against abuse.</P>
    <P>The operation of the system in relation to the forthcoming local elections will be kept under review with a view to establishing whether any changes may be necessary or desirable at future elections.  After the local elections I propose to introduce legislation to provide similar postal voting facilities at Dáil and Presidential elections and at referenda.</P>
    <P>The approval of the House is also sought to the draft of the Local Elections (Amendment) Regulations, 1974.  An Explanatory memorandum on these draft regulations has also been circulated and I do not therefore think it necessary to detain the House by elaborating on the details.  The draft regulations propose to amend the Local Elections Regulations, 1965, by making the changes required as a result of the reduction of the minimum voting age from 21 to 18 years; by increasing the safeguards to the secrecy of the ballot at local elections arising from the Supreme Court ruling in 1971 and by making some minor technical and procedural changes arising from experience at the local elections held in 1967.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been very critical of the Minister for Local Government during the past 48 hours, and some weeks ago.  In this case we have no objection to the proposed regulations. The only cautionary word or words I should like to make are that, in order to prevent chaos from the administration point of view, it is very important that the returning officers should be appraised fully and be properly staffed to cope with the problem.  There will be a very rushed situation, to put is mildly, initiating completely new procedures for returning officers under paragraph 7 of the regulations:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> The returning officer shall, not later than the twenty-eighth day before the polling day, arrange for the provision of application forms at such times and places as are specified in the notice under article 6 of these Regulations and an application form shall be supplied free of charge to any person applying therefor.</P>
    <P>That procedure starts 28 days before polling day.  The application forms have then to be filled up by the public, go back to the returning officer and then he issues ballot papers.  The people who receive these ballot papers cannot vote in person at their particular polling station.</P>
    <P>All this will place a very severe administrative strain, inaugurating a new system in a relatively short time. Care should be taken to avoid any administrative chaos between the 28 days before polling day and polling day, so that the polling is carried on &mdash;both in polling stations and by post &mdash;in a manner that does not give rise to any colour of abuse.  I am certain there will not be any abuse, but what I am afraid of is the chaos that might result from a rushed administrative procedure and the impression might get abroad that abuses have taken place.</P>
    <P>This is purely an administration matter and I am certain that the proper administration will be established to deal with it.  Where returning officers are bringing in new procedure, they will have to be properly staffed.  There is no point in issuing a regulation such as this and telling the returning officers to do what is incorporated in these regulations unless there is proper staffing to ensure that not alone will the regulations be implemented, not alone is postal voting granted on the basis and on the criteria proposed in paragraph 4, but that the actual implementation will be above suspicion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to welcome the two motions, particularly that in relation to postal voting. Taking the Local Elections (Amendment) Regulations first, there is only one point I should like to raise.  As I <Col N="1217" /> understand it, the only essential change made in paragraph 10 is that whereas up to now, schools and premises of that kind could be used for taking the poll, now they are to be used also, where required, for counting the votes.  That is a definite change and I am a bit dubious about it.  I hope that local returning officers will do their utmost to avoid any unnecessary interference with the work of schools.  Polling takes one complete day, and perhaps longer if there are problems over rearranging accommodation. Counting the votes in a local election is quite a long drawn out process and I should be very much afraid that some school activities might be interfered with, and I hope that this will be reduced to a minimum.</P>
      <P>I am interested also in another question.  I appreciate that this is not a change in the regulations but is an already existing provision.  The regulations provide that the poll can be taken now, the votes can be counted in any school receiving a grant out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas and also in any premises the expense of maintaining which is payable out of any rates.  This would cover a very wide field and I accept that the Minister is not making a change here: it has always been the position.  It covers a very wide field, including hospitals and so forth.  I should be interested to know if the Minister can give me any idea as to what type of premises are envisaged or have been used in the past.  It seems a rather wide scope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come to a more important regulation, that of postal voting, I think every reasonable effort has been made to avoid possible abuses.  However I would urge on the Minister the point that under these new regulations, from now on it will be essential more than ever that very great care should be taken with regard to the preparation of the register.  I take it that what the Minister has in mind essentially is that those who are genuinely living in this country, but who will be absent, either in Ireland or abroad, on election day, should be able to vote.  I presume that he does <Col N="1218" /> not intend to include those who have emigrated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The address of anybody abroad must be sent to somebody in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is quite clear, that nobody who is living abroad will be entitled to vote.  The essential thing is to ensure that no such people are included in the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It will have to be certified that they, themselves, applied for the vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no problem about that.  Take the case of, say, a man who is working in Birmingham. His family inadvertently, or advertently, entered his name on the form for inclusion on the register.  Then he is on the register.  Next he has to apply by letter for his postal vote.  He must have this completed by a member of the Garda Síochána, or a clergyman, or an official of the local authority.  He must return to Ireland on holiday or in some other temporary capacity to interview these people.  I understand that the people concerned will have the schedule of these rules and have no power to say that they will not accept the proposition because they know he is living abroad.  He is on the register.  In his application to vote he states that because he is working abroad he is unable to vote in the coming election. As I understand it, they must complete the certificate and the returning officer must accept this, in the absence of other evidence, and give him his vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The precaution that must be taken here is to make sure that those people are entered in the register.  I would therefore urge on the Minister that from now on it will be more important than ever to check the register to make certain that only those who are included on the register are genuinely living in this country, and to weed out as far as possible those who are working abroad, even though they may pay occasional visits home.  That is the essential precaution that the Minister should take.  Otherwise we are in <Col N="1219" /> complete agreement with the general principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to paragraph 9:</P>
      <P>As soon as practicable after the adjournment of an election for the purpose of taking a poll, the returning officer shall prepare in respect of each local electoral area a list (in these Regulations referred to as the supplementary postal voters list) in such form as may be directed by the Minister, containing the number (including polling district letter) and name (in each case as stated in the register) of each person from whom a valid application has been received by him and the address to which each such person's ballot paper is to be sent.</P>
      <P>As the names will already be on a register, it is not in the best interests of secrecy that a list of the postal voters should be supplied to candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this motion.  I cannot agree with Senator Lenihan that there will not be any abuse.  I can see that there can be abuse.  It is something that the Minister and his Department will have to look into.  First of all, according to the qualifications of those who may apply for a ballot paper for a postal vote, it looks as if anybody and everybody will qualify under the regulations that are laid down here.  In the next election on 18th June that might not happen because it is new, but in future elections when people find out <Col N="1220" /> about this I believe a lot of people will not bother their heads to go to the polls to vote.  They will look for a postal vote.  You might ask what is the difference.</P>
      <P>When it comes to the actual voting there can be abuse.  To get the postal vote you have to fill in an application form and make a declaration before somebody of importance such as a member of the Garda Síochána or a clergyman.  That part is all right, but when the ballot paper comes back to the house, who votes on the ballot paper then?  I have known of postal votes for other purposes and I know that candidates travel around after the postman.  As soon as the postman leaves in the ballot papers the ballot papers are collected again.  I should not like to see something like that happen in this case.</P>
      <P>If people are in hospital where will the ballot paper be sent&mdash;is it to the hospital or their own homes?  If it goes to their own homes, who has the right to see that it is the person concerned who actually votes?  I am sure that between the time a person applies for this ballot paper and the day of the poll, a number of people in hospital will have passed away.  Who will then use these ballot papers?  I have not seen provisions for problems of that kind made in the regulations.  I should like the Minister to take this into account because I am convinced that people living in the city do not know as much about postal voting as we do.  We have seen postal voting in some other organisations and we have seen the abuse that has occurred. I feel that as well as making a declaration when they are applying for the ballot paper people should have to make some sort of a declaration on the day the vote is cast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Though I agree with the fears expressed by Senator W. Ryan in relation to this it is, by and large, a new procedure.  I honestly think it is worth the risks that Senator Ryan has pointed out and that may have to be taken.  I am sure the Minister and the returning officers will make every effort to ensure that the abuses Senator Ryan fears will <Col N="1221" /> not take place.  Some of them will. There is no doubt about that, but even in our present system we have abuses.  We are all aware of that.  On how many occasions have people gone to the polling booth to vote to find that somebody had got there five minutes or five hours earlier and had taken away their vote?  There is an element of risk in it.</P>
      <P>A wide spectrum of people such as long-distance lorry drivers, commercial travellers and a number of people who are ill, perhaps in their own homes and not in hospitals, should have the right to vote.  After all, would it not be much better if these people could vote in a civilised way rather than to see occurring some of the things which have taken place in the past when you had queues of cars lined up outside institutions whipping people down to polling booths and convincing them as to who they should vote for?  If you get into this car or that car you are branded straightaway.  If we can eliminate some of that kind of thing, even though there is a certain amount of risk involved, it is worth it and it will ensure that an effort is being made to give people who, perhaps, for one reason or another could not utilise the franchise, the right to vote. If it does not work as well as we expect in the local elections then we can have another look at it.  I agree with Senator Lenihan when he says this is certainly well worth the risk, and the Minister should be complimented for introducing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express agreement with the motion.  It is a step in the right direction.  Our aim ought to be to ensure that every citizen over 18 years is entitled to vote and we should bend over backwards to provide facilities whereby he will be able to exercise the franchise.  It is the most democratic way in any institution of getting the opinion of the people by giving them this right. It is a fundamental right that all citizens equally should enjoy.  It is well known that because of working commitments and various other duties many people in the past have been absent from their regular polling <Col N="1222" /> booths and they were unable to exercise the franchise.</P>
      <P>The Minister has outlined many of the people who would be affected in that way.  Not alone should these facilities be extended to those who are sick but any citizen, irrespective of where he or she lives within the limits of this State, should have this facility available whereby they could exercise their vote on polling day. Now that the registers have been compiled, a fair number of people may have overlooked the fact and were unaware that these facilities were to be introduced.  Because of that they may have been careless in scrutinising the local registers to see if their names were on them.</P>
      <P>Some people, because of lack of employment in rural areas, came to the city and returned at the weekends. It could easily happen that their names may not be on their local register because usually the voting in all elections takes place on a Tuesday or a Wednesday and if they knew they would not be able to get there within the voting hour limits their names may not be on the register. This could cut both ways and I am not speaking on a political issue. Facilities should be included, if they are not already included, and I am sure abuses could be guarded against, to give those people a chance although their names may not now be on the register.  There is time to prepare a list of postal voters and some opportunity should be given to these people so that they could apply to have their names included on this voters' list.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senators who have already raised the possibility of abuses.  I suppose that is to be expected because it has happened in many organisations where postal votes were used.  At the same time I am sure the Minister and the local returning officers will be capable of devising some means whereby even though there may be some abuses at least they will be kept to a minimum and we will be giving these people the right to vote.  In doing that we will be giving a good service to the nation and to the electorate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this motion introducing these regulations because over the years we know that many people either through employment, commitments or illness had not the opportunity to give expression on election day through the ballot box.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to one area in which careful scrutiny should be maintained.  That is in respect of long-stay institutions and areas where the particular individuals are incapable of making application themselves.  It is the fundamental regulation in accordance with this that the person himself or herself must make application. What I should not like to see is some activist making application <i>en masse</i> in the names of substantial groups of people and then, one way or another getting those ballot papers voted on.</P>
      <P>This is a very desirable development. It has areas of danger, and I hope that these areas of danger will be fully supervised to ensure that this desirable project will be continued and that the abuses&mdash;and there will be certain areas of abuse&mdash;will not be such as to again terminate this very valuable right which every voter should have.</P>

      <P>I, too, would welcome this motion because when I was speaking on another motion previously I asked that something be done positively and immediately about this matter.  I am thankful that the Minister paid heed to what I had to say and has brought this to its final conclusion today.</P>
      <P>However I think Senator Ryan made a point that we must be aware of.  I, too, am aware that in other associations takeovers can be made. The postal vote system is probably technically a little different system, as this was proposed to be.  Senator Fitzgerald brought the point home about the abuses that can happen on an election day particularly regarding votes of invalids and of sick people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw a situation in Dublin some years ago in a by-election in the Dublin South-West area.  Labour had <Col N="1224" /> two candidates, Mr. Merrigan and Mrs. Dunne.  I saw on several occasions during that day where Mr. Merrigan's supporters had voted for Mrs. Dunne, and later in the day I saw that Mrs. Dunne's supporters had voted for people with cards&mdash;some system I did not understand.  I saw several rows during the day between the supporters of Mr. Merrigan and Mrs. Dunne.  I was amazed and bewildered that such a thing could happen.  I am delighted that Senator Fitzgerald made the point that abuses can take place.  In all my life I have never seen such carry-on as I saw on that day.  It was only on the part of the Labour Party.  I do not know which side Senator Fitzgerald was on at that time.  I know which side he is on now, but it was only among the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of people who at the age of 18 or 19 in the last two or three months have got employment in the Civil Service.  There are girls who have taken up positions in hospitals throughout the country and many others who have taken up positions elsewhere.  Are these people now entitled to make an application for a postal vote?  I should hope they can and I hope the Minister will clarify that point for me.</P>
    <P>I welcome the motion.  I was glad that the Minister responded to my claim here and that he immediately got down to business to bring this regulation in in order to adopt a suggestion to him from this part of the House.  If the Department are careful in their carrying out of this motion, this should work.  If the Labour Party, as I have instanced before, behave themselves in forthcoming elections we will probably have a very constructive use of this new system.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with other Senators in welcoming the extension of these regulations to the categories that are now included.  I will not join with Senator Killilea in claiming credit for the introduction of the legislation.  There is one point that the Minister made mention of that I should like to talk about.  He <Col N="1225" /> stated that it was not the intention to send ballot papers abroad.  I should like to be reassured that he does not intend to preclude, by what he said, the sending of ballot papers to members of the Defence Forces who are serving abroad.  I should be glad if the Minister would clarify that for me.  There are Senators who are afraid of abuses which might take place in the system of postal voting. As one who availed of the postal vote myself for many years during service in the Defence Forces, I think it is a very satisfactory system.  I am quite certain that any abuses that there may be will come to the surface during the forthcoming local elections and can be taken care of at a later date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>You learn something every day.  The regulations could mean quite a number of abuses. I accept that this is something new. This is a case of trial and error and from the experiences of the forthcoming local elections the Minister may consider it necessary to have a further look at the matter.</P>
      <P>There are a few points that I want to raise.  On page 3, paragraph 4(3), it is stated:</P>
      <P>If the polls at the election of members of two different local authorities are to be held together, an application to vote by post made by a person entitled to vote at both polls shall be treated as an application by the person to vote by post at both elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With urban councils, in particular, <Col N="1226" /> candidates and county council elections in the one day there is a situation where there are two different returning officers.  The secretary of the county council is the returning officer for the county council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The town clerk is only assistant to the actual returning officer, who is the county secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>The county secretary is the returning officer.  In my own county the county secretary is based in the town of Lifford.  If a person in Letterkenny applies to the town clerk for a postal vote, will he automatically issue a postal vote for the county council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>They all go direct. That is fair enough.  Another point&mdash; and I think it was the one to which Senator Hanafin was referring&mdash;concerns the list.  There would be a list of postal voters and obviously that must be taken from the list on the register; otherwise it would create problems.  Is there any way in which a person who applies for a postal vote could arrive at the polling station on the day of the election and get another vote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>But the signature is not.  And there is no proof of the signature, because here is where I feel that the abuse can be created. Senator Sanfey mentioned that in the Army it worked satisfactorily over the years, and this is true.  But now we will have old people, sick people, invalids, getting a postal vote.  Is there anything to stop the collection of <Col N="1227" /> these votes on the morning after they are issued by any particular individual, by any particular organisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They will sign a receipt that they have got the postal vote, that they are the persons to whom the postal vote is addressed, and there are severe penalties for dealing with it in any way except in the way set out in the regulations.  Therefore no more than in the Army or in the Garda, there are no other ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understandable that this would not be abused in the Army or in the Garda.  What I mean is those people who are not old; they know what they are doing and they are not going to surrender their vote.  But in the case of invalids and old people it could be abused.  From my own point of view there is a postal vote in different organisations. There happens to be one in my organisation as well on a certain election, which led to the tapping of my telephone and a subsequent court case. There is one objection I have to the copy of the application.  Why should clergymen be brought into everything? This is to be certified by a member of the Garda, a clergyman or an officer of the local authority. Before I saw this particular page and before I realised that it was there, I was picturing in my own mind all the abuses that could be created.  I remember a clergyman on one occasion &mdash;he is dead&mdash;when we were canvassing for a particular party, placing his stole on the shoulders of the people who had promised to vote for that particular candidate and making them promise that they would do as he asked.  He was a fanatical politician.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, he was not, but I was not going to say that unless I was asked.  Afterwards I can give Senator Sanfey his name and he can check it out, and he will find that what I am saying is true. It was in a by-election in 1948.  The point I am making is that there are many priests who are fanatically political on all sides and who would <Col N="1228" /> be convinced, who could convince themselves that by signing their names on this docket, they would be doing a service to their own political party and possibly to the nation.  It is very easy to convince people at times of this, although I know that if a clergyman or anybody else was caught doing this it would be considered a very serious offence.  But naturally it would be very hard to catch them because, if any of us went around and got 20 or 30 such votes and got someone to sign them, it naturally would be kept very secret and it would not become public knowledge.  I do feel that a member of the Garda and an officer of the local authority would suffice.  I myself have about five or six cousins clergymen in Donegal and I must have a talk with them when I go back to see what their feelings in this matter would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last point I want to refer to&mdash; and it was touched on by Senator Yeats&mdash;is the register.  I must say I was looking at the register the other day and I saw a very prominent Fine Gael supporter whose name is under Letterkenny on the register.  I never thought of these regulations.  He is abroad and has been abroad for some years.  He is married away from the town altogether.  I wondered what he was doing on the register.  He will have a postal vote now.  Now I am not going to make a charge that the Fine Gael Party or anybody else had tipped off their people to get them on the register because it would be unfair to base an argument on one isolated case, but I am going back to have another look at the register to see how many of these people may be on, and perhaps I will get an opportunity of expressing my views on it. This may be a coincidence, but just take it that on the next occasion&mdash; and this affects all political parties, not just one&mdash;particularly on the northwestern seaboard, where there has been emigration and there is still emigration, there will be applications made to have people on the registers. I know a politician who two years ago toured the Irish clubs in England getting the names of people to have them put on the register.  This is all <Col N="1229" /> right if the revision court is strict, and if there is a very careful examination made and a very careful study made of it.  But in rural Ireland again there are times when all political parties neglect this and people could be slipped on the register who should not be on it.  I presume that as regards the regulations we are discussing today, when the Minister sees how they work for the local elections, he will propose them for the general election.  There is the possibility that a lot of names could be slipped through the register in this manner and it is something that should be watched.  I must say that I think the Minister deserves congratulations for introducing these regulations, because we have always received complaints over the years from people who have been denied the use of their vote. While I feel there will be mistakes made we will be in a position to learn from those mistakes.</P>

      <P>Like the other Senators I, too, welcome the regulations subject, of course, to reservations and fears expressed, particularly in relation to institutions.  Patients in these institutions are usually aged, infirm and very often mentally incapacitated. They are particularly vulnerable to undue pressures, and these regulations will only worsen the situation. Instead of having feverish activity on one day, with these regulations you are going to increase the opportunity for canvassers, perhaps members of the staff in the institution to get at these gullible people who would be more amenable than the ordinary person.</P>
      <P>For that reason we must be very careful.  The local elections will be held in the month of June and steps should be taken to prevent these abuses which are inevitable in institutions. Would the Minister tell me if this facility is extended to electors living on islands off our coasts?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank the Senators for the way in which they dealt with these motions with the exception of a few people who wanted it and did not want it. Most of the people seemed to agree that this is a measure which is long overdue and I am glad that I had the opportunity of introducing it.</P>
      <P>Like everybody else here, I am no political neophyte and I know quite well that there may be abuses.  There are items in it which can be abused. There are items in the regulations we have at present which can and have been abused.  We all know this.  It is our job to try to prevent the abuses. As far as I can see, I am attempting to include in the regulations safeguards to prevent these abuses.  But I did not want to create a situation where the cure would be worse than the disease, by putting such tight regulations that people would not bother using them.  Nobody here would expect me to do that.  We have all heard about people who move from one area to a new housing area, particularly in the cities, and where somebody went around and collected the voting cards.  It was alleged that they had been voted on.  I cannot prove this, but it has been alleged against every party at every election. This abuse could be prevented by the motion before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that as a result of this motion many people who are entitled to vote and have not had the opportunity will now be able to do so.  If this motion achieves this objective everybody here will be satisfied.  If anybody suggests that it will change the political pattern, then they do not know much about politics.  The pattern will be exactly the same.  When the results come in there will be a percentage of votes of each of the parties and, indeed, of independents that will follow along the very same. But it will at least mean that people <Col N="1232" /> who are entitled to vote will have a vote.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the register of electors.  The register of electors is drawn and its compilation is not included in this Bill.  As it has been referred to, let me say that I sent out explicit instructions to have the register of electors drawn up more accurately than it had been.  I do not know who is at fault.  All of us know that over the years the most extraordinary errors, omissions and additions have occurred on the register of electors.  We found that people who had been on the register all their lives mysteriously disappeared when the register was compiled.  For that, again, people who had left an area for years appear on the register of electors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it has happened again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave instructions that if this matter was brought to my notice I would take a very serious view of it.  If any Senator knows of this happening, I should be glad if the particulars were given to me.</P>
      <P>I also pointed out that I issued to Deputies and Senators on two occasions a circular letter.  Whether we like to admit it or not, we, as politicians, have a vested interest in the correct compilation of the register of electors.  I issued the advice to them that they should in their own areas ensure that the register of electors was compiled as carefully as possible.  Most of the public representatives welcomed this reminder and very many of them went to great trouble to ensure that proper steps were taken to have a more accurate register of electors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the recommendations made in 1960, under a committee of the two Houses, anybody who leaves the country and says he will be back again in 18 months is entitled to be on the register of electors.  If he makes that declaration, he must be put on by the county registrar.  This recommendation was accepted at the time and it is still in existence.  Whether we should have another look at this recommendation as a result of what has been stated here is a matter we should <Col N="1233" /> consider.  This was the recommendation made and this is how we have compiled it.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats asked what premises would be used for the counting of votes.  At present, schools and local authority premises will be used.  It is not intended to use hospitals.  No change in the system is proposed.  I can assure Senator Yeats there is nothing extraordinary in the proposal. In regard to Article 10, I think Senator Yeats was a little off the point. Article 10 states:</P>
    <P>A returning officer at a local election has the right to use, free of charge, for the purpose of taking the poll, any room in any school which receives a grant out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of clarification this article indicates that a school in this context includes primary and post-primary schools and that schools may, if necessary, be used for counting of votes as well as for voting.  This is simply a matter of clarification.  No change in substance is involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats may have been looking at it from another angle.  There is no change proposed.  I am as anxious as Senator Yeats is to ensure that the schools are not closed for too long a period.  In most local authorities the closing of the schools is for one day.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of notifying the returning officers, we have already sent out advance notification to them of what it is proposed to do.  We are arranging for printing and other matters provided this goes through the two Houses quickly enough.  It is proposed to have a type of seminar or discussion with returning officers which will explain what is to be done.  There was a great temptation to leave this over to be dealt with later.  However, I decided that if a start had to be made it should be made as quickly as possible.  While it may appear rather rushed it is now intended to have it for the local elections on the 18th June next but the House may be assured that it is as accurate as possible and all necessary precautions have been taken.  Because we expected it would get a general <Col N="1234" /> welcome here and in the other House, we have taken certain steps with regard to printing forms and so on, which would not normally be taken until the motion had been passed.  I take Senator Lenihan's point that we must ensure that everybody knows as far as possible what is being done and what it is necessary to do.</P>
    <P>I referred to the question of those who are allowed to be on the register if they state they will be in their residence within 18 months.  This is the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Electoral Law, 1960-61.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Ryan, I agree that qualifications are very wide.  It would not be possible to list particular categories.  The cure could be worse than the disease.  By listing categories, we could leave out somebody who would normally be entitled to a vote. This would be a mistake.  There is a good deal of pressure by commercial travellers from whose association I have had a deputation.  The trade unions have mentioned lorry drivers and lighthouse keepers have been mentioned also.  Nobody made representation except an occasional public representative regarding sick people but if we are doing the job we should try to include as many people as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan suggested there might be abuse.  This could happen but I do not wish to tie it up so tight that it would mean that people would not look for a postal vote on account of the trouble involved.  There are fairly heavy penalties for electoral abuses such as the abuse of interfering with the postal vote or of the right to vote or how it is done.</P>
    <P>Senator McGlinchey, having five cousins in the priesthood, and could hardly be accused of attempting to traduce the clergy, spoke about a stole being put around a person's shoulders in an effort to force him to vote for a certain person.  I hope the Senator is not suggesting that that type of influence is not used at the present time, not necessarily among the clergy.  We have heard of cases where people are easily persuaded to vote for somebody they did not know.  Senator Fitzgerald spoke about cars being lined up to <Col N="1235" /> bring people from institutions to the polling booths while, perhaps, the people are left to walk home.  I saw patients being taken out of bed and wheeled down to vote.  It would be better to allow these people to vote independently.  I presume the matrons of hospitals would guard against any outside interference where patients might be threatened into voting in a way they did not wish.</P>
    <P>There may be people who are ill and their families will persuade them to vote in a particular way.  The pattern in this country has always been that the family votes for the same party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BobAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Usually.  If an old person is brought to the voting booth the presiding officer is usually told that the person needs assistance in casting his or her vote.  Nobody other than the person who marked the ballot paper knew what way it was marked even though the person who was actually voting might not want to vote in that particular way if given his freedom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making concerned the application for the vote.  One clergyman in every county who would be prepared to agree to a forgery could cause a great deal of trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree and I would prefer if Senator McGlinchey did not make that charge unless he can prove it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not able to prove it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If he finds out that it happens or if there is an electoral abuse such as he described earlier, there are ways of dealing with it and there are very heavy penalties for using undue influence.  It is dangerous to discuss this in a general way.  We <Col N="1236" /> must all ensure that as far as possible there are no abuses.</P>
      <P>Senator Hanafin stated it would be a breach of the secrecy of the ballot to give a supplemental postal list to candidates. There is no other way in which to decide.  The registers which will be included in the ballot box for the use of the officers at the polling station will have the postal votes marked off.  There must be some way in which the personating agents would know who are the postal voters.  The candidates are directly involved and there is no breach of the regulations by giving them shortly before the election a list to show who has already voted.  In the event of somebody applying for a postal vote and going to a booth and saying &ldquo;I did not receive a postal vote&rdquo; he is entitled in the same way as anybody else who claims a vote and is not on the list to swear or to affirm that he did not get the postal vote.  In that way he can cast his vote in the usual way.  If it is proved that the postal vote has been delivered and used he is in the same position as anyone else in that he is subject to the electoral penalties which apply.  This area is fairly well safeguarded.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with Senator Moynihan's question of institutions. Long-stay patients are registered at their home addresses so that their votes will be spread over a wide area. I do not think there will be such a tremendous number of people applying for postal votes.  I think it was Senator Dolan, or maybe it was Senator Aylward, who talked about people who were away from home&mdash; people who work away from home and return at weekends.  They will normally be on the register at their homes and, therefore, they will be entitled to apply for a postal vote which will be sent to the address at which they are staying, not their home address.  I think it is right that we should give these people their right to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point made by Senator Aylward was that it was possible that these people could be registered in Dublin, although they come from Meath or Cavan or some such place, and may be attempting to get a <Col N="1237" /> second vote; but I do not think this is a great danger.  I agree that if it turns out to be a big danger we will have to have a look at it again.  The local elections at least will give us an opportunity of seeing how it works.  I think we are lucky that it is being tried out in this way.  If it turns out that certain aspects of it are wrong we can change it after we see what happens.  This is one of the reasons, not the only reason, why the Bill to cover the whole matter is not being introduced now but will be introduced after the local elections.  Let me be quite honest about it, it is the time factor involved that has dictated that it be dealt with in this way.  It would not be possible to get a Bill through which would cover all the points in time to give notice of the local elections. This is a trial run which we can operate and if it turns out that any portion of it is wrong it will be easy to have it attended to when the Bill is being drawn up at a later stage.  If a person is on the register&mdash; it will require a change in the law to deal with this&mdash;and if he applies for a postal vote he will be entitled to vote.</P>
    <P>Senator Sanfey referred to the question of Army men who may be away from the country.  This does not refer at all to the Army because, as in the normal way, the ballot papers will be sent to GHQ, where they will be dealt with.  Perhaps I should make it clear that under these regulations it is not proposed to extend postal voting to, for instance, members of embassies abroad or to emigrants.  Whether those categories should be included at a later stage is something which can be considered in the next Bill because there are arguments for and against such a course.  Certainly an effort should be made if at all possible to ensure that people in embassies are entitled to vote.  It is not possible under this regulation to have them included. I want to make it clear lest anybody is in doubt; they are not included here.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Killilea, anyone who is absent from his address where he is registered can apply for a postal vote.  These include students and <Col N="1238" /> other categories mentioned by the Senator.  Senator McGlinchey spoke about clergymen, but I have already dealt with that.  Unless there are any other points of clarification which any Senator may wish to put, I think I have answered most of the questions raised.  I should like to thank the House for their attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The current register is issued and regardless of whether there are mistakes in it, the only procedure is to take it to the High Court. I believe it can be tested that way but it is not proposed to alter the existing current register from 14th April, 1974.</P>

      <P>They are in fact recommendations which were made by the former Minister and which were instructions given by him to civil servants and which I instructed my civil servants to put down in writing because of the fact that somebody might be inclined to say that this was not done.  It is on the file for Deputy Molloy to see.  I have offered it to him in the other House on a number of occasions.  If the House wants it I shall read it out.</P>

      <P>What I want to make clear is that the point I made, which precipitated this, was that there must have been numerous drafts of possible ways in which the constituencies could be arranged.  The Minister has hinted that he had particular arrangements in draft form which would be very embarrassing to Fianna Fáil.  I said that he had mentioned it so often that he should really produce them and get this thing out of the way.  I should like the Minister to produce these drafts provided he produces all the drafts and not a selective one which might be, from his point of view, interesting and perhaps embarrassing.  There must have been numerous drafts.  He either produces all the drafts or he does not produce any of them but he cannot produce one which might create a bit of a furore.</P>

      <P>The instruction I gave was that I wanted all the proposals which had been made and put down in writing, as they were put down, whether they are for or against my arguments.  They are here.  I give my word that those are correct, as given to me by the civil servants, who simply did what they were told.  I would be only too glad, because of the fact that there have been so many charges, if they were not in existence.  I would be glad of the opportunity to put them on the record of this House and I am quite prepared to do so.</P>

      <P>The Minister attempted to read the document without giving dates, reference numbers or indeed anything to tell us where this document originated.  It would be very easy for me to come in here with a document, to say that I picked it up from the floor of Leinster House and that in that document was contained the Minister's original plans for County Limerick or County Donegal before certain Deputies persuaded him to change it.</P>
      <P>It would be very easy for anyone to bring in a document that contains no signature, no reference number, no dates or anything else, and claim it was something that it was not.  Therefore, the threat by the Minister to expose a plan is cutting no ice with us.  However, I suppose he believes that if he can repeat it often enough, and if the newspapers pick it up and publish what he is saying, sufficient people will believe him.</P>

      <P>I should like to give a reference which may help Senator McGinchey.  It is: &ldquo;The Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1973: notes for inclusion in Committee Stage brief re previous Government proposals.&rdquo;  I should like to talk about the entry for Clare-Galway.  That is exactly as it is stated.  I explained how it was drawn up; there are pros and cons in it, but there are a number of points which would answer the charge which has been made against me, that is, that according to Opposition speakers, there should be a four-seater in Clare.  I want to show that this was never the idea of the party to which they belong up to as recently as before the last election.  Either they want it or they do not want it.  I should like to read it into the records of the House but there appears to be a strong objection to doing that.  We could waste a lot of time discussing it, without reading it in.  In case somebody would accuse me of wasting time, I should prefer to do either one thing or the other.</P>

      <P>If I may intervene to discuss this matter, the Minister now raises a very important principle.  This matter was put forward by the Minister in the other House as well as here, on the basis that there were certain proposals for legislation available in his Department which were drawn up by the former Minister.  Now it appears that he proposes to read something quite different.  As I understand what he says now, there are a number of proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not raising a point of order: I am speaking on Committee Stage on amendment No. 3, and in particular on the Minister's document that he wishes to read relating to amendment No. 3.  There is a matter of principle involved, not a matter regarding the procedure of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has, very rightly, complained about Senators, on occasions, making speeches in the guise of points of order.  If this is about a point of order, I shall raise it <Col N="1243" /> as such.  The point I wish to make is that, as I understand it, the Minister does not propose now to read written proposals made by a former Minister, but a sort of reconstruction of what may be in these proposals, made by some anonymous member of his Department&mdash;a civil servant.</P>
      <P>This seems to me to be a very dangerous precedent that the Minister is trying to create.  Confidential memoranda prepared by members of his Department&mdash;for the Minister himself in this case&mdash;are to be read in a House of Parliament.  In other words, the Minister has asked a civil servant: &ldquo;What went on between you and the former Minister?&rdquo;  The civil servant has said: &ldquo;I will get this in writing.&rdquo;  Now the Minister proposes to read this out. This seems to me to be an appalling breach of the confidentiality of the Civil Service.  We are rightly not allowed to discuss in this House any individual civil servant.  Here is a document prepared by a civil servant, at the Minister's request, on his memories of a previous Administration, and they are to be read out in this House.  It is an appalling breach of principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is prepared to rule on the point of order.  If at any time a Minister quotes from official documents he must be prepared to make the documents available to the House on formal request made by a Member of the House for him to do so.  There is nothing in the rules of order to prevent the Minister from quoting.  If any Senator thinks, having heard the quotation and having examined the nature of the document from which the quotation was made, that the Minister in any way offended against a principle of proper action, he can then by way of censure motion make his opinion known in regard to this, and seek appropriate action.</P>

      <P>The fellow who made that up cannot count too well.  I am stating categorically that there were proposals made by my predecessor to deal with constituencies and, in particular, to deal with the one we are discussing.  There were maps drawn but the original maps and the original documents were not in the Custom House when I arrived there.  They were given into the custody of my predecessor.  They were carbon copies and there were two copies of maps.  There was no breach of privilege and Senator Yeats will not get away on that horse.  There is no breach of privilege involved in this because I was entitled to find out what my predecessor proposed when I was drawing up a Constituencies Bill, and I have done so.  I was entitled to find out what he proposed.  He wasted Civil Service time if he did not propose it, but perhaps he was doodling then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get this matter into perspective.  A Chathaoirligh, you were not present before lunch: the Leas-Chathaoirleach was in the Chair, but I presume you have been fully informed about the nature of the document that has been mentioned by the Minister.  Apparently this is a document based on the recollection of officials in the Department of Local Government.  It was prepared after the Minister's advent to office by them on the basis of their recollection of ideas that the previous Minister was exchanging with them on the various options that he would incorporate in proposals&mdash;after he had come to a decision&mdash;to the Government in the form of a memorandum. On the basis of this the Government would be quite free to change, amend or reject, and the final product could go back to the Department of Local Government for incorporation, on foot of the Government decision, in a Bill for the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This type of confidential exchange of views lies at the very root of the whole Government system in any democracy.  A Minister teases matters out with his officials.  They get any number of options from him as to what can be done and what should be done.  There is total confidentiality and, indeed, the whole basis of the relationship between the Civil Service and a Minister in a democracy is founded on this total mutual trust and confidentiality.  The whole basis of preparing confidential memoranda for a Government is on the very secure foundation, well-established over the years, that the Minister and his relevant officials can have a completely candid exchange of views.  All sorts of views and all sorts of options are tossed about and exchanged from the point of view of debate and discussion <Col N="1246" /> takes place between the Minister and his officials before any memorandum is presented to the Government.</P>
    <P>On many memoranda presented to the Government the officials and the Minister concerned might think up four or five different ways in which the Government could act either in regard to one constituency, in regard to a group of constituencies, in regard to the whole of the country, or in regard to any other legislative matter being brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This applies in the preparation. This is the way legislation is prepared and the officials here present from the Department of Local Government, if the Minister is not aware of it, are well aware of it.</P>
    <P>Every Bill is processed in this way, starting on the foundation of either the Minister or the officials in his Department proposing that a certain course of action should be taken or that something should be done, whether it is in regard to constituencies, budgetary matters, a reform, an amendment, an improvement or a new policy development, whatever it is.  Right across the whole range of administration ideas start in that way by an exchange of views between the Minister and officials, either initiated in some cases by the Minister or, in other cases, initiated by the officials. After an exchange of views between them various options are often thrown up by both the Minister and his officials and often totally opposite points of view are expressed.  This happens in confidential discussion between the Minister and his officials. Views which are poles apart may be expressed and perhaps the Minister may depart from a particular attitude at first adopted.  The Minister may take the reverse attitude to what he initially thought was the correct one. Perhaps officials may take similarly reverse attitudes from a discussion with the Minister and with other officials and depart from their original stance.</P>
    <P>This is the way it works.  The whole system works on the basis of this free exchange of views.  There is certainly a very serious, damaging erosion of that principle if a new Minister <Col N="1247" /> comes in and extracts from his civil servants a <i>post hoc,</i> retrospective, recollection of what took place in a confidential exchange of views between the particular official and a previous Minister.  That applies even among Ministers of the same Government. That would apply in regard to some successor of the Fine Gael Party, representing the Labour Party, who might want to have a look at what the previous Minister for Local Government was doing.  If you start on this sort of slippery slope you are entering a very dangerous area.</P>
    <P>I want to say, finally, just to reject totally what the Minister has just stated that we in any way do not want this document revealed that I welcome the revelation of this document. The Minister has offered to reveal it and be it on the Minister's own head.  If he wants to reveal it let him do so.  I want to put the matter totally in perspective.  The perspective of the matter is that the Minister is revealing a hearsay document written down by an official as to his recollection of what took place. It was one of many options and many discussions that I am certain took place between the relevant official and his Minister.  It is, on the Minister's own admission, undated with no reference number and no signature to it.  Other than being a recollection by an official of the Department of Local Government as to a conversation that took place between that official and his Minister, I am sure it was one of a hundred such discussions and conversations that took place between officials and the Minister at that time as, indeed, take place prior to the preparation of every piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that the Minister is well aware now that any such proposal, after full discussion between Minister and officials, would come before the Government of the day in the form of a memorandum. The Government would consider that memorandum and then send the Minister back to his Department having told him to prepare a Bill along the lines on which the Government <Col N="1248" /> had decided.  Such a memorandum never came before the previous Government.  What the Minister is talking about now has nothing to do with the Minister's decision.  It has nothing to do with the Government's decision.  What the Minister is talking about is a recollection by an official of a discussion that he had with his then Minister.  That is what the Minister is quoting from at this stage. It is unsigned, undated, and has no reference number whatever.  The Minister is welcome to parade that type of document.  Be it on his own head for starting a very dangerous and a very serious precedent.</P>

      <P>This is the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1973; notes for inclusion in Committee Stage brief re previous Government proposals.  The reference is to Clare-Galway. It is the only document relating to this and it contains both pros and cons.</P>
      <P>The counties of Clare and Galway (together with parts of County Roscommon) are divided presently into four three-seat constituencies namely West Galway, North-East Galway, Clare-South Galway and Clare.  Three different approaches were considered in this area, each involving the continuance of the existing position viz., four three-seat constituencies.</P>
      <P>It was proposed (in August, 1972) that 2,960 persons from the Liscannor, Kilshanny, and Kilfenora districts of Clare be transferred from the existing constituency of Clare to Clare-South Galway.  To offset this, Clare-South Galway was to part with 2,000 persons from the Ballydangan, Cloonfad areas of County Roscommon who were to be transferred to Roscommon-Leitrim. North-East Galway was to receive 2,733 persons from the Oranmore, Claregalway, Annaghadown areas of Galway from West Galway and lose the district electoral divisions of Donamon, Athleague East and Lacken&mdash;total population 1,070&mdash;from County Roscommon to Roscommon-Leitrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicated in relation to the initial scheme submitted for the West that he did not want to have the Oranmore, Annaghadown areas removed from the West Galway constituency and that if <Col N="1252" /> possible the part of Oranmore town which is not contained in the district electoral division of Oranmore&mdash;the new Kilraine estate&mdash; should be added to the constituency. This new approach necessitated changes in most of the other constituencies in the West.</P>
    <P>In a revised scheme submitted in September, 1972 the townlands of Moneyduff and Oranhill&mdash;population 36&mdash;which include the Kilraine estate, from the district electoral division of Clarenbridge, were taken from Clare-South Galway and added to West Galway.</P>
    <P>In relation to North-East Galway it was proposed that that constituency would take a total of 2,286 persons from the Kilconnell area of Galway from the constituency of Clare-South Galway and give 617 persons&mdash;the district electoral division of Fuerty in Roscommon&mdash;to Roscommon-Leitrim.  It was proposed that Clare-South Galway to compensate it for the population being transferred to West Galway and North-East Galway would receive 3,204 persons from the Liscannor, Kilfenora area of Clare and the district electoral division of Dysart and Templemaley in Clare. The remainder of the constituency of Clare would form the final constituency.</P>
    <P>Further proposals (in December 1972) envisaged Clare as outlined above but proposed changes in relation to the other constituencies in the area.  Clare-South Galway was again to receive 3,204 persons from Clare and to give 2,286 persons to North-East Galway and 36 to West Galway.  In addition it was to give a further 170 persons from the district electoral division of Stradbally to North-East Galway.  North-East Galway it was proposed was to cede the district electoral division of Liscananaun&mdash;population 687&mdash;to West Galway.  West Galway it was proposed would give 2,184 persons from the Letter-brickaun, Cong and Cloonbur areas of Galway, to West Mayo.</P>

Am I right in defining it as a typewritten document, prepared by an official of the Department of Local Government on the Minister's instructions?  Am I right in saying that this typewritten document, without any file number or serial <Col N="1254" /> number or date is the recollection, by an official, of confidential discussions and proposals that were going back and forth between the previous Minister and that official or other officials in the Department?

      <P>Let us be quite clear.  The Chair has no control over any document other than the document from which the Minister has quoted.  I have already indicated that when this document is tabled it is open to any Senator to put down a motion in regard to the document&mdash;in regard to the circumstances surrounding its preparation and its tabling in the Library.  That is something which should be done after the tabling of the document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad for the elucidation of the position by the Cathaoirleach because we propose to put down such a motion on it.  We think there is an important public issue involved in this matter in putting <Col N="1255" /> forward a secondhand document of this kind without any signature, date or reference number based on some anonymous compilation of what is alleged to be an original document or a recollection on the part of that official.  Certainly, it is a highly undesirable development.  If that sort of matter can be paraded here in the House by a Minister or anybody with access to Civil Service files, then the whole basis of the confidentiality on which rests the whole relationship between the administration and the Government of the day is completely undermined.  That motion will be lodged with the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I would like to go back again to the matter under discussion.  Nothing that has emerged in this bit of paper in any way takes from the best logic in our point because, as a Member of a Government that brought in two of these Bills, I know that Bills of this kind concerning constituency rearrangements undoubtedly attract the interest of all Ministers in a particular Government.  Basically the ultimate Bill that has emerged and that we are discussing now was the subject of considerable discussion, I am sure, by Members of the present Government.  I am sure that there were many proposals put forward within the Minister's Department by himself and by his officials.  The proposals may have been rejected out of hand or amended, or adjusted by the present Government prior to the publication of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This shows the futility of the Minister's whole exercise in producing a document of this kind and in the futile pursuit of scoring a petty point he has sought to erode the very sensitive relationship that exists between any Minister and his Civil Service.  This has happened in the pursuit of a totally unnecessary point.  Of course, there are bound to be documents expressing contradictory views&mdash;as I said earlier on&mdash; in every Government Department prior to the preparation of every Bill.</P>

      <P>I am just coming to the point.  The point that I am going to make is that this particular typescript takes nothing from our fundamental point that is based on what would a judicial commission or commissioner or tribunal or some impartial body of that kind do faced with the situation in regard to Clare and East Galway.</P>
      <P>I will confine myself to those two amendments that are basic and fundamental to our position here. These two amendments are part of the group that we are here discussing.  I would like to emphasise these amendments&mdash;amendments Nos. 9 and 10.  I would take amendment No. 3 out of the group.  I do not propose now at this stage to delay the House by discussing the matter which we have criticised already in regard to the adjustments that have been made in Mayo, Sligo, Donegal, Leitrim, Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I will concentrate on Galway and Clare and in particular on West Galway and Clare.  I would like to put myself, this House and the Minister in the position of an impartial tribunal that would look at that situation. The situation in quite net and clear terms is that County Clare is a natural four-seat constituency.  We propose in our very sensible amendment here that it should be a four-seat constituency with the addition of a few small townlands adjacent to it in South County Galway.  There the territorial identity is preserved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certain that since 1969 the population of Clare rose substantially and that the population of County Clare as such by this year had reached the situation where the county itself practically merits a four-seat constituency.  In fact, County Louth and County Clare are practically identical in regard to population and the rise in population. In Louth and Clare there has been a substantial rise in population over the past three or four years, thanks be to God.  It is agreed that there has been a bigger rise in Louth than in Clare, <Col N="1257" /> but here are two counties with such an increase in poulation as to warrant on any mature consideration of this Bill in 1974 four seats for Louth and four seats for Clare but, while Louth has been given four seats, Clare has not.</P>
      <P>I am going to use these two counties as a real test of the Minister's <i>bona fides</i> and sincerity.  We will fight this out on Report Stage as well, if necessary on the principle enshrined in the adjustments made by the Minister and the Government in regard to the two counties.  By reason of a rise in population, due to our industrial development policy in the Shannon area which has led to an increase in jobs, County Clare now merits four seats just as County Louth merits four seats by reason of similar development and increased populations in Drogheda, Dundalk, Dunleer and Ardee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That argument was just as valid in 1969.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Halligan can check the figures.  They are there in the book of population statistics.  He can check on the figures in regard to Louth and Clare.  There is an identical parallel development.  There is a greater population rise in Louth. There is a population rise in Clare as well which almost brings it to four seats.  The population rise in Louth brings it to four seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two counties have received totally different treatment.  It would not be tolerated by any impartial commissioner who, looking at these two counties, would say: &ldquo;These are counties that constitutionally merit four seats by reason of the rise in population.  They fulfil the constitutional criterion of 20,000 people per representative with a tolerance of 1,000 either way.&rdquo;  As I said earlier what is implicit in the judgement of Mr. Justice Budd, taking constitutional criteria into consideration is that county boundaries should not be breached, but they can be breached if it is in accordance with the Constitution. In other words, the Judge based his judgment on the fact that <Col N="1258" /> there should be observance of the constitutional criteria but as far as possible county boundaries should be observed.</P>
    <P>Clare gets totally different treatment from Louth.  Louth has got a four-seater but Clare did not get a four-seater.  In spite of the overwhelming evidence that Clare should be a four-seater, there is added to West Galway from Clare over a third of the townlands set out in the Schedule right down to the town of Ennis itself.  That is more than halfway down in County Clare and is logically the capital and county town. There is taken out of County Clare the whole of north-west Clare down to the town of Ennis, over to Ennistymon, up to Lisdoonvarna and Ballyvaughan, and back into a West Galway constituency that stretches as far as Clifden.</P>

      <P>Indeed, Inishbofin, as I have been reminded by Senator Killilea, which is beyond Clifden again.  Here, again, not alone has violence been done to the County Clare when its natural administrative county merited four seats but also violence has been done to an area that can almost be regarded as a county because it is such a natural unit&mdash;the present constituency of West Galway. It has been a constituency, give or take a few townlands, for a number of years.  In fact, as long as West Galway has been a constituency it has always been based on a very simple balance of representation, population and geography in the sense that Galway city and its hinterland represented about half the constituency, Connemara representing the other half.  It was a completely natural three-seat constituency. You could not devise a more model three-seat constituency, with Galway city as the capital, its immediate hinterland representing one type of area and Connemara representing another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a natural community of interest, a natural association, a natural loyalty, and a natural unit in every sense of the word.  Violence has been <Col N="1259" /> done to this constituency on this occasion as well by importing into it a third of a county that has been raped in the process and relegated to a three-seat status.  Can the Minister answer the logic of this case&mdash;I have asked him to do so.</P>
    <P>There are seven seats in that area. We intend on Report Stage to put down an amendment that will bring this even clearer home to the Minister, his officials and this House.  A lot of trouble would be ended and the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We propose to put down an amendment on Report Stage, if the one that is down here is rejected, in relation to the County Clare area the administrative county area, and the natural unit area of Galway-West, as it now stands&mdash;Galway city and Connemara. You have a population that justifies seven seats.  The Minister has, in his endeavour to secure a distortion of the representation of that seven seats, raped the county of Clare and made three seats out of it and four seats out of a new West-Galway, NorthWest Clare constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That could be done far more logically, rationally, judicially and indeed, more in consonance, with public morality, by having East-Galway as a three-seater and Clare as a four-seater instead of the Minister's abortion of East-Galway as a four-seater <Col N="1260" /> and Clare as a three-seater. There is no answer to that.  Any impartial commissioner called on to adjudicate on how these constituencies should be rearranged would have to agree with my submission.  I suggest that the reason for this change is not so much in the relationship between West-Galway and Clare, because they represent two natural entities, but the purpose of this exercise is to deprive the East-Galway constituency of five seats to which it is entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this exercise is to make East-Galway a four-seat constituency, reducing it from its entitlement to five seats and thereby depriving a quota of people of their representation in the Dáil. The Minister is well aware from the election figures that in any rational distribution of an East-Galway constituency based on the towns of Gort, Loughrea, Athenry, Tuam, Dunmore, Mountbellew, Ballinasloe, Eyrecourt, Kilimer and Portumna and the rural hinterlands adjacent to them, that particular area is entitled to five seats. However, because of its loyalty to the Fianna Fáil organisation, that particular area would return three Fianna Fáil TDs to Dáil Éireann out of five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the purpose of all this convoluted reasoning in regard to East Galway and Clare.  I have refrained from saying it heretofore, and I have spoken a number of times on this Bill&mdash;I was seeking to get from the Minister some rational reason why he reversed the natural order of things and made an abortion of East-Galway and Clare in order to create a four-seat constituency in Galway and a three-seat constituency in Clare when it should be the exact reverse, on all the accepted norms of any impartial approach towards the adjustment&mdash;that I am driven to the conclusion that this was politically motivated in the interests of depriving East-Galway of the extra seat to which it was entitled and in particular of an extra seat which in all probability <Col N="1261" /> would be a Fianna Fáil seat. The natural five-seat constituency of Galway based on towns I have mentioned, all of which have a similar character and form, with additions from County Roscommon&mdash;I can tell the Minister these additions are very similar in type and character to the parts of County Galway to which they are adjacent&mdash;being deprived of its entitlement to five seats has resulted, in the absence of any rational explanation, in the rape of East-Galway and Clare by the Minister for the purpose of depriving 20,000 electors of their legitimate representation.</P>
    <P>The next election will prove my point, that if the Minister gets away through his steam-rolling majority with having four seats in East Galway, we in the Fianna Fáil organisation will get practically three quotas and will get only two seats out of four.  If that is not gerrymandering with a capital &ldquo;G&rdquo; on a large and massive scale, I do not know what it is.  The Minister knows from the election figures in that particular part of the country, not just in the last election or the previous election but since the formation of this State, that that part of the country has always been strongly loyal to our organisation.  That is not a crime yet in this country, despite the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and other people who might try to propagandise the people into the view that it is.</P>
    <P>These are very ordinary decent people living in the heart of a very decent county.  These people, who are representative of rural Ireland, are being deprived in their right to send three Deputies of their choice into the Dáil.  They are being gerrymandered out of the exercise of their rights in having a Deputy for practically 20,000 of their people.  They are being condemned, having practically three quotas, to have only two seats out of four&mdash;only 50 per cent of the representation when they are entitled to a clear majority of the representation. In the next election, in that constituency, mark my words, as sure as night follows day, that will happen. We will get practically three quotas. <Col N="1262" /> We might get the three seats out of four, too, even though it is a highly difficult operation.  In all justice we are entitled to be in a position to represent those people properly on behalf of our organisation.</P>
    <P>That is the purpose of the whole shabby exercise in regard to Clare and West-Galway.  That shabby exercise is the most blatant piece of gerrymandering ever engaged in and you will find nothing like it in the North of Ireland&mdash;nothing like what has been done in regard to West-Galway and Clare.</P>

      <P>There never was a suggestion from anybody in Fianna Fáil that there would be anything but three seats in Clare until the amendment came in.  The proof of that is there for anybody to see.  Secondly, who took the seat from Clare in the first place?  Did Fianna Fáil not take a seat away from us?  The reason they took it&mdash;blatant gerrymandering says Senator Lenihan. Do not forget the fourth seat in Clare at that time was a Labour seat.  Senator Lenihan is now terribly anxious to give Senator Killilea a seat in East-Galway. He would present him with five seats although all the documents which Fianna Fáil produced up until they left office was for three seats for East-Galway. Would you have a bit of <Col N="1263" /> sense, Senator Killilea, and not let them be codding you like that.  You are outside and they are trying to keep you outside.</P>
      <P>Poor Justice Budd, he has been misquoted and words have been put into his mouth by Senator Lenihan.  He misquoted him four times today.  It is only fair to the good man that I should put the facts straight.  At page 146, <i>Irish Reports,</i> 1961, this is a quotation which Senator Lenihan has not given. He has been misquoting all morning and for a period last night.  This is what he said:</P>
      <P>Here let me observe straightaway that although a system in the main based on counties has in fact been adopted, there is nothing in the the Constitution about constituencies being based on counties.  The Constitution does not say that in forming the constituencies according to the required ratio, that shall be done so far as is practicable having regard to county boundaries.  Even if it did, the Oireachtas or the appropriate Minister could alter county boundaries. No doubt it is convenient in many ways to use the existing administrative machinery: and there is nothing objectionable in a certain degree of adherence to the county basis of division provided that the dictates of the Constitution are observed.  But it should be understood that it is quite open to the Legislature to disregard county boundaries altogether and to formulate a scheme of constituencies on an entirely different basis if that be necessary to achieve the required ratio.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan has been misquoting the poor man all day.  This is exactly what he said.  I will give him the quotation and let him look it up if he feels like it, and not let us have another point of order.  We have had about 100 today.  I should be allowed to make a few comments without another one.</P>

There is no evidence anywhere that the idea of having anything except a three-seater for East Galway and a three-seater for Clare existed in anything produced by Fianna Fáil until now.  They know they have not a snowball's chance in hell of having it passed so therefore they put it in and perhaps tried to persuade Senator Killilea they were doing something for him.  They did not do it when they had the chance. I am satisfied that the constituencies drawn up in this area have been drawn up fairly.  Nothing stated here today has convinced anybody otherwise.  It is a waste of time debating them any further.</P>

According to what the Minister read in this House, Deputy Molloy proposed, according to this supposed document that we were to have, a three-seater in Clare, a three-seater in Clare-Galway, a three-seater in West Galway and a three-seater in North-East Galway.  I am referring specifically to the amendment concerning Clare-Galway to which the Minister has brought this debate.  Four threes are 12.</P>

      <P>I certainly should.  It is only now Senator Halligan and the Minister have clearly understood the principle of this alleged document.  I accept the document in a way, because it clears Deputy Molloy of any gerrymandering, <Col N="1266" /> as he was giving 12 seats to Clare-Galway.  The present Minister proposes to give them 11 seats.  We on this side of the House are not in a position to do anything about the situation except to try to arrange the constituencies of Clare-Galway on the basis of the 11 seats.  The Minister took that seat from us.</P>
      <P>We ask in this amendment to have Galway and Clare re-arranged in a better way than at present.  The Minister has admitted through his supposed document that Deputy Molloy had intended to give to Clare-Galway 12 Dáil seats.  The Minister for Local Government now proposes under this Bill to give them 11.  The Minister will state they were adding part of Clare to Clare-Galway.  This is true but they were adding it on the basis of a three-seater.  It was not towards Tipperary Deputy Molloy was going. He was remaining along the border of Clare and Galway in Liscannor.  The Minister stated Liscannor was to be added to the Clare-Galway constituency in order to bring it up.  For the Minister's information, Liscannor is about six miles from Galway city.</P>

      <P>To move to this situation where the Minister has now left Galway and Clare with only 11 seats and still proceeded further to gerrymander in a way which suited his own party, even at the expense of the Fine Gael Party in this instance, I will try as a last effort to persuade the Minister, having heard what Senator Lenihan said and what I said earlier today, that there is a natural four-seater in Clare with the addition of 1,400 votes, approximately, from South Galway. There we have the natural, physical and cultural background of Galway city with Connemara for a three-seater, plus the agricultural situation that prevails in the other part of County Galway to make it a five-seater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his efforts to explain to this House&mdash;some people would take offence at the way in which he stooped so low as to implicate people who cannot defend themselves in this House &mdash;has made a farce of the whole situation.  He has stated that Deputy Molloy, the previous Minister for Local Government, was giving to the counties of Galway and Clare 12 seats, giving back portion of Roscommon, and in addition was taking and adding to the original constituency of Clare-Galway another portion of Clare by and beside the Clare-Galway border, <Col N="1270" /> which is a natural progression.  Deputy Molloy is quite free of all these scurrilous allegations made by Deputy Tully and members of the National Coalition.  All those allegations are now finished.  Deputy Molloy was not as bad a boy as Deputy Tully thought he was but Deputy Tully forgot how to make up the simple sum of multiplying four by three.  It was the simplest of sums. He has forgotten so much that he forgot to do that simple sum.  Deputy Molloy was giving to Clare-Galway 12 Dáil seats, was in fact giving back to Roscommon portion of the Roscommon constituency to Roscommon-Leitrim&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He even quoted a place outside of Oranmore where there was a movement of only 35 people&mdash;the minimum movement of people, moving it into West Galway in order to maintain for the people of Connacht and particularly the people of Clare-Galway 12 Dáil seats.  Now he has admitted, through this document that was used as ammunition or threatened ammunition for the last six months, both inside and outside the Houses of the Oireachtas, that Deputy Molloy's intention was to have three seats in North-East Galway, three seats in West Galway, three seats in Clare-Galway and three seats in Clare.  That is exactly what Deputy Molloy proposed to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was talking about this terrible fellow, the former Minister for Local Government who, he said, did not even multiply 3 by 4, but now the Minister and his eastern Government have admitted publicly, for the first time, that they have deprived Galway and Clare of one Dáil seat.  They have tried to gerrymander the remaining portion of the new proposed constituency of West Galway, in addition to the insult offered to the people of Clare by not naming them in that constituency.  The Minister has called the people of Lahinch West Galway people and he now proposes to gerrymander the portion that is <Col N="1271" /> left in order to put his pals in the Labour Party in Dáil Éireann.  During the weekend I ascertained in Galway that there will be two Labour Parties in Galway city.  I am informed that Senator Noel Browne is going to contest a seat there.</P>

If the Minister thinks that we can continue to tolerate this situation, he is nailing his own coffin <Col N="1272" /> and nailing the coffin of the party of which he is a member and which are part of the National Coalition Government. He has come with a &ldquo;not-an-inch&rdquo; attitude and has been directed by the Government not to accept any amendment or recommendation of either House, which would help, in particular, the people of the counties of Clare and Galway, whom he has deprived of a Dáil seat, as now publicly stated.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister for the second time today to reconsider this situation.  There is now a glaring need for a reconsideration in view of the fact that he has publicly announced that there will be a seat less for those two counties.  He has tried by every means to tantalise the Opposition.  He has tried the old pro-British attitude of divide and conquer, but it has not worked.  All he has done is to declare to the public, by the document he read here today, that Deputy Molloy was giving four three-seat constituencies to Galway and to Clare counties. The Minister has deprived them of one seat.  I ask him again to reconsider the situation.</P>
      <P>We know quite well that there is a vast difference between the cultures of the people of Connemara and those of Lahinch.  There is also a complete difference between the culture of the people of Galway city and that of the people of Lahinch.  Now that we have brought this whole situation out into the open, will he again consider changing to our proposal of having four seats for Clare, and making West Galway a three-seater and East Galway a five-seater, in view of the allegation that Deputy Molloy has purported to connive at a peculiar situation in the revision of the constituencies, when, in fact, after reading the supposed document produced by officials in the Department and the Minister, Deputy Tully, we find that Deputy Molloy proposed to give us 12 seats when the Minister is giving only 11?</P>

      <P>While it does not appear that, as a result of this debate, we are going to be able to persuade the Minister to see some element of reason, and to accept at least some <Col N="1273" /> of our amendments, nonetheless I think that something has been accomplished, as a result of the debate.</P>
      <P>During the discussions in the Dáil, in the course of a number of interjections and interventions, the Minister dealt with this claim of his that he could show to anybody who was interested a variety of proposals by the former Minister which were contained in the Department with regard to the proposed redistribution of the constituencies.  Again last week the Minister came into this House on the 11th April with his somewhat aggressive opening speech.  As I mentioned at the time, in the class of Second Reading speeches made by the Ministers it was unique because of the aggressive, highly political, contentious way in which it was put before us. But at column 995, Volume 77, of the Seanad Debates the Minister said:</P>
      <P>Let me say something else.  With all the caterwauling from the Fianna Fáil benches&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>mark the pleasant, friendly, atmosphere that the Minister was generating even at that early stage.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is an extraordinary thing that for a couple of years both the right and the duty were there for Fianna Fáil to do this, but apart from the doodling which my predecessor did in the Custom House, and Senator Yeats was right, there was no Bill but there were reams of paper.  There were umpteen proposals and maps which I offered to Deputy Molloy if he wished to see.</P>
      <P>I offered to produce the physical evidence.  Despite what was taken away before I assumed office, the copies are there, and if some of the Senators and Deputies in Fianna Fáil saw some of the ideas which my predecessor had stored up for them they would have a fit.</P>
      <P>Here we have the Minister at the beginning of this debate talking about reams of paper and umpteen proposals which he said he would produce.  He was asked to produce them.</P>

What he produced in regard to Clare-Galway was not a proposal, let alone umpteen proposals, nor was it any part of a ream of paper left behind by the former Minister.  This, as I understand it, was a document prepared at the request of the present Minister during the period of office of the present Minister by some unnamed servant of the present Minister of his memories of what happened on a previous occasion. In other words, there was no proposal left behind by the former Minister.  There was no copy of a proposal left behind by the former Minister.  There was no part of any ream of paper left behind by the former Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Chair that I am going to leave this point now. It seems to me a highly unsatisfactory situation, but nonetheless, the basic point I wish to make is with regard to the specific position of Clare.  To be quite candid I do not care a hoot what the former Minister was going to do. The present Minister for Local Government is Deputy James Tully, who is coming before us with this item of legislation.  It is his Bill.  It is not Deputy Molloy's Bill.  It is not Deputy Blaney's Bill.  It is not Deputy Boland's Bill.  It is the Bill brought before us by the Minister who is present here today.  It is his responsibility. It is his duty to do what he believes to be right; and really what anybody else on any previous occasion in the course of reams of paper, or doodling, or umpteen proposals or whatever you may like to call them, may have done is of only very limited interest, at least as far as I am concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested, and I think we are all interested, in what the Minister himself is bringing before us.  Therefore when I ask the Minister for the reasons which impelled him to make a truncated county of Clare into a three-seat constituency instead of into a four-seat constituency, I do so in the hope that the Minister, in the carrying out of his personal responsibilities as a member of the present Government, will tell me what his thinking was, what impelled him to do this, not what impelled any previous Minister on a previous occasion to think of doing it in a particular way.  It is the Minister's responsibility.  The Minister, I admit, had the political misfortune to be in Opposition for a considerable number of years.  I think <Col N="1276" /> that now that he has been in office for something over a year it is time he realised that he is now in office, that he has responsibilities, that he cannot shift off his responsibilities by saying that somebody else would have done something different, or even done the same.  It is his responsibility.</P>
    <P>We all know that Clare originally had four seats.  As a result of falling population&mdash;and if the Minister cares to examine the census report he will find that I am right&mdash;particularly a fall of several thousand in the years before 1961, it became necessary to reduce Clare to three seats from four. Now we have the position that as a result of the increasing population shown by the census of 1971 the population of Clare is such that an additional 1,400 or so of population added to the county would enable a four-seat constituency to be set up almost exactly coinciding with the ordinary boundary of Clare, with a marginal number, an addition of perhaps 2 per cent, to the existing population of Clare, an addition made from County Galway in order to enable them to be made a four-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>As we have already pointed out, the county of Clare has a larger population than that of the county of Louth.  The Minister himself rightly told us that Louth had to be made a four-seater because it was so near to the constitutional margin that obviously you could do nothing else. He made his own constituency of Meath into a four-seater, although it had several thousand fewer population. These things are there on the record. I do think therefore that we are entitled to ask the Minister in the exercise of his personal responsibilities why, when he had the decision to make&mdash;and it was basically a decision to be made between West Galway and Clare, as to whether West Galway was to be a four-seater and Clare a three-seater, or Clare a four-seater and West Galway a three-seater&mdash;he did it in such a way that over 12,000 inhabitants of Clare were put into West Galway, whereas by taking it the other way he could have made West Galway into a three-seat constituency and Clare into a four by <Col N="1277" /> adding as a minimum 1,400 of the inhabitants of Galway in order to make Clare a relatively coherent county constituency of four seats.</P>
    <P>As between these two choices&mdash;and I accept that these were basically the choices before the Minister&mdash;there are only two things that could be done. I think we are entitled to ask the Minister to tell us why he made the particular choice that he made, why he chose to put 12,000 people from Clare into Galway rather than a mere 1,500 or 2,000 from Galway into Clare.  It is a simple question and I think we are entitled to a simple and honest answer.</P>
    <P>The attitude taken by the Minister in Louth was correct; in Meath it may have been correct, but neither of these showed any consistent pattern with his decision with regard to Clare. He told us on several occasions that he had endeavoured, in carrying out this distribution, to avoid as far as possible the breaching of county boundaries.  We all must accept that as a result of the entirely undesirable situation in which we are, with this extraordinarily narrow tolerance which, it is suggested the law required, which does not exist in any other country, it is impossible in many cases to avoid breaching county boundaries.  Presumably, the action taken by any Minister in dealing with a matter of this kind should be, while breaching county boundaries on perhaps many occasions, to endeavour to breach them as little as is reasonably possible.</P>
    <P>In Clare and West Galway there is this simple decision of a very small breach in boundaries with 1,500 or 2,000 taken in from Galway to Clare, or a very large scale one as the Minister has done.  It is simply impossible in the absence of an explanation by the Minister to conceive why the Minister has decided to take this particular decision.  Would he tell us why he did take this simple decision to make Clare a three-seater and Galway West a four-seater instead of the other way around which, from every possible viewpoint, seems a more coherent and sensible step?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been attempting and, I think, have succeeded in showing that we have complete and utter contempt for the manner in which the constituencies on the western seaboard have been drawn.  I think it has been pointed out very clearly that our primary aim is to ensure that counties on the western seaboard and in the northern part of the country do not lose seats.  It has been pointed out on many occasions that it has taken a greater number of people in rural Ireland and the western seaboard and in the northern provinces to elect a Deputy than it does in Dublin city.  This, to us, is very unfair.</P>
      <P>We were not at any time afraid of three-set constituencies in any part of Ireland.  Indeed, in the so-called documents that the Minister has produced, second-hand, Deputy Molloy, the former Minister for Local Government, was, according to the Minister making three-seaters in Clare and Galway.  The point I want to make, which could not be emphasised often enough, is that by doing that he was ensuring that between the counties of Galway and Clare there would be 12 seats.  Our amendment is aimed at the same thing.  We do not want to see that area losing a seat on that side of the Shannon.</P>
      <P>We suggested a four-seater in Clare because it has been said that there was a reluctance to breach county boundaries.  We also heard the Minister admit that in the case of County Louth, a county that was taken in the group belonging to my own constituency&mdash;Monaghan and Meath&mdash;it was entitled to four seats and that was the reason why he was taking a seat from Monaghan and Cavan and that he could not see his way to ensuring that there would be two three-seaters in that area because he was having a four-seater in County Louth.  Then he made a four-seater in County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can anyone explain why it would be right to do this in County Louth and wrong to do it as far as County Clare is concerned?  County Clare has the greater population.  It would need only a few thousand from Galway to bring it up to the required number of population <Col N="1279" /> as far as a four-seater is concerned. The amendment is a sensible one, and the suggestions made in it have not been refuted in any way so far by the Minister.  I have no hesitation in saying that the only conclusion that people in the Cavan-Monaghan area can come to is that the Minister was making sure that there would be a four-seater in County Meath at our expense so as to ensure that he would be elected.</P>

He did not make a safe seat for himself in dividing the constituencies on those occasions.  We certainly resent this division.  We feel that Clare should be entitled to a four-seater if Louth is entitled to it. I should like to see these arguments refuted.</P>

      <P>If he did it years ago, she did not bear fruit, other than a few good Fianna Fáil Deputies. In this morning's <i>Cork Examiner</i> I read where the Minister stated in this House yesterday that it was nonsense to suggest that this Government were arranging the constituencies on a geographical basis to keep themselves in power.  It is nonsense for the Minister or for any supporter of this Government to claim that any other intention was in their minds when the Constituencies Bill was being drafted, because in this area it is quite obvious even to the impartial observers that the Government are taking from the west two seats that could and should have been left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government speakers, both in this House and in Dáil Éireann, have attempted to justify their actions by repeatedly claiming that this was necessary because of the constitutional demands and because of the High Court action of 1961.  During the debate on Second Reading we proved conclusively that the 30 seats could have been retained in the west without any breach of the Constitution or the High Court ruling of 1961. I have repeatedly asked and failed to get an explanation from the Minister for the reason that the maximum population ratio per member was used <Col N="1281" /> in this area while the minimum was used in the east.</P>
    <P>Most people will appreciate that along the western seaboard it is much more difficult for the electorate and Deputies to come in contact with each other.  One would have imagined that if the Government had decided on any type of bias it should have been towards the western seaboard.  It is obvious that this was not politically opportune.  While Fianna Fáil on the last occasion admittedly lost two seats in this area this Government were not certain that this could be repeated on the next occasion.  Even the strongest supporters of the Government would have to admit that it was an accident that these two seats were lost to Fianna Fáil in 1973 and that there was every reason to believe that they would be won back in the next general election.  For that reason the Minister and his Government have deliberately gerrymandered the west and taken two seats from the west in the hope that this would be a contributory factor to their re-election next time around.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his enthusiasm to provide legislation which would protect his own Government, has produced legislation which to my mind could prove to be unconstitutional. The High Court ruling of 1961 suggested a population deviation of 1,000 people but it did not suggest that that deviation should be from census to census.  I would submit that since the census was taken in 1971 there has been a population explosion in the town of Sligo.  If one looks at the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim where the population ratio per Member is 21,013 people or 113 people less than what is allowed by the High Court directive, one finds that the population of Sligo has increased by 340 people since 1971, I am suggesting that the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim as outlined in this Schedule is unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>In the constituency of Roscommon-Leitrim the population ratio per Member is 21,119 or four people less than the maximum allowed by the High Court ruling.  The greatest number that could be allowed by the High <Col N="1282" /> Court in any constituency is 21,123. The Minister in order to perfect the greatest gerrymander adopted the figure of only four people fewer per Deputy so that if it can be established that since 1971, three years ago, the population of this constituency increased by 13 people, then I submit that the legislation before us, as far as the constituency of Roscommon-Leitrim is concerned, is unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of warning the Minister that he may be responsible for unconstitutional legislation.  I might point out that history could repeat itself, in that some people might do what one of the Minister's colleagues did in 1960.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">

      <P>I said: &ldquo;what the Minister's colleague did in 1960.&rdquo; The ruling was clear; there should not be a greater deviation than 1,000 from the national average.  The national average was 21,123.  I am convinced that in his anxiety to gerrymander constituencies in the west the Minister has constitutionally gone too far.  I would be very interested to see a repeat performance in the High Court to test that theory.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to accept the Minister's claim in this morning's <i>Cork Examiner</i> that this Government did not draw up the constituencies on a geographical basis in order to keep themselves in power.  We have accused the Minister and the Government of gerrymandering and we have the evidence to back up this accusation.  In two of the constituencies covered by this amendment, the deviation from the national average is at the maximum that could be used by the Minister in accordance with the 1971 census returns.  I have asked many times, since this debate began two weeks ago, for an explanation which I have never received.  I will repeat the question this evening. Why should it take 21,119 people in the constituency of Roscommon-Leitrim to elect a Deputy whereas in the constituency of Louth it takes only 19.149?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>In an effort to get a fourth seat in Louth and an extra seat for the Coalition Government, the Minister and this Government of the so-called talents&mdash;this Government that proclaimed their sense of justice so hysterically, are ensuring that it takes only 19,000 to elect a Deputy in that county whereas in Roscommon-Leitrim it takes 21,000 more.  That is 2,000 people per Deputy so that one might say that 6,000 people in the constituency of Roscommon-Leitrim have been disfranchised.</P>
      <P>In the same manner one could compare the constituency of Roscommon-Leitrim with Meath where for the same reasons a little over 19,000 people can elect a Deputy, but in Roscommon-Leitrim it takes 2,000 more voters.  The same comparisons can be made with quite a number of the Dublin city constituencies and the same applies also to the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, where it takes more than 21,000 people to elect a Deputy.</P>
      <P>Yet the Minister, with his hand on his heart, proclaims to the world &ldquo;We are not guilty of the charges made by these terrible people&rdquo;.  It will be difficult for the Minister and his Government and their supporters to persuade the ordinary people that what has been done in the west is not a deliberate gerrymander in order to ensure their re-election the next time out.  If the Minister had used the population per Member on the west coast in the same way as he did in County Meath, County Louth and Dublin South-East, Dublin (Clontarf), Dublin (Cabra), Dublin North-Central, North County Dublin, South-West Cork and South Kerry, it would not have been necessary to take two seats from this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot repeat often enough the claim made by supporters of this Government that it was constitutionally necessary to do this.  If the figures used in the counties and the constituencies I have just mentioned had been used in relation to the west coast, 30 Deputies could have been elected from that area.  If the Minister had used the minimum national average laid down by the High Court ruling there would <Col N="1284" /> have been a surplus of 5,362 people in County Clare, a surplus of 6,684 in East Galway, a surplus of 1,832 in West Galway, a surplus of 2,941 in West Mayo, a surplus of 447 in East Mayo, a surplus of 5,661 in Sligo-Leitrim and a surplus of 5,989 in Roscommon-Leitrim. All these added together and added to the figure of 9,894 in Donegal, which is not included in this amendment, would come to a grand total of 38,810 persons.  That is a surplus of 38,810 people on the west coast which is sufficient to elect two extra Deputies in this area.  This means that the 30 Deputies could have been retained and should have been retained in the west.</P>
    <P>It is sad that this Government, the vast majority of whom are based and live in Dublin city, have produced legislation that in the future the entire western coast will be represented by 28 people, whereas the city of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire between them will in the future elect 43 Deputies.  Therefore, Dublin and Dún Laoghaire in the future will elect 15 more people than the entire western portion of the country.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not appoint one single Minister from this western area. One is forced to ask oneself the question: &ldquo;Did this Government, with so much talent, believe that there was no talent at all in Fine Gael from Clare to Donegal?&rdquo;  As a result of the manipulation of the western seaboard we will in the future have a Parliament in this city of Dublin and a Government in this city of Dublin whose primary interest will be the city of Dublin.  The western portion of our land has not been given the fair and just representation to which it is entitled.</P>

      <P>No, I was thinking of the next Seanad election.  Before you came in, Sir, I gave statistics to justify the amendments that are before this House at the present time.  I contend that the reason why the Minister will not accept this amendment, or indeed any amendment, is because only a few minutes ago he told us we could like it or lump it.  He made it very clear that, as a Minister, he does not believe in accepting amendments. A few hours ago, in the Library, I was reading over some views expressed by him in other legislation and I noticed that he expressed very strong resentment, when he was an Opposition Deputy, that the then Minister was not kindly disposed towards accepting amendments.  He expressed his criticism in very strong language.</P>
      <P>I think, having watched his performance in this House in the last few days, that we too could express, as he expressed when in Opposition, our resentment at his failure to accept amendments in this legislation.  I believe that if he were to accept the amendments before this House at present he possibly might save himself a trip to the Four Courts in the not-too-distant future to explain or to attempt to explain a case that could be made and that I believe is entitled to be made, namely, that the provisions in this legislation for the constituencies of Roscommon-Leitrim and Sligo-Leitrim are unconstitutional.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak on this Bill but having listened to Senator McGlinchey for several hours, over and above the six hours and 20 minutes he gave us on the Second Stage, it is about time that some one of us said something about all the rubbish and repetition he has put across here.  He said that the Minister was arranging the constituencies to keep the National Coalition in power.  As a matter of <Col N="1286" /> fact, the Minister has no say whatsoever about the loss of the two seats in the west.  Fianna Fáil failed during their 32 years in power to do anything to increase the population in that area.  It has been laid down by our Constitution that we must have a specified number of people before we can return Deputies to Dáil Éireann. No Minister or no Government can do anything to keep those two seats in the west because of the decline in the population in that area.  The Constitution was given to us by the Fianna Fáil Party and is there to prevent us from putting more seats in the west than are there at the present time. For that reason I think the Minister has been most careful that he will not go to the High Court or the Supreme Court, as was done in the past, to prove that what was done in the arrangement of constituencies was unconstitutional.  That particular case was successful.  For that reason I do not think that the present Minister for Local Government has any notion of going to the High Court because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If that was not gerrymandering, there is no such word.  They talk about gerrymandering in Sligo-Leitrim. The Minister for Local Government <Col N="1287" /> has changed Sligo-Leitrim and Roscommon.  They should be delighted with the change because it was Sligo-Leitrim and Roscommon that changed the Government.  Senator McGlinchey said that the Roscommon and Leitrim constituencies were unconstitutional and that the Minister is responsible for unconstitutional legislation. It is up to Senator McGlinchey to go to the High Court to prove his point.  Let the Bill go through in its present form, and go to the High Court and I assure Senator McGlinchey <Col N="1288" /> that &ldquo;The Golden Grill&rdquo; will not keep him out of the bankruptcy court.</P>

      <P>I should like to restate our attitude in regard to the truncation and mutilation of the county administrative area of Clare, to emphasise once again that our strong view is that this paragraph to the Schedule should not stand as it is but should be in accordance with our amendment which has been rejected. I am sorry for putting the Seanad to the trouble of another vote.  We feel very strongly on this matter as a point of principle.  We will say no more about it because everything has been said that needs to be said.  We feel that we are on a strong rock of principle in regard to this matter.  For that reason we must oppose this paragraph of the Schedule which seeks to, in effect, mutilate and gerrymander County Clare in the nefarious interest of depriving the combined counties of Clare and Galway of a seat to which the people of those areas are entitled.  The whole purpose of the combined exercise, which we debated on our amendment, is to reduce the representation by one and to deprive the people in those two counties of the representation, and the particular paragraph here is designed <Col N="1289" /> to ensure that.  This paragraph which we must vote against is the paragraph that is the specific basis on which this nefarious edifice has been erected designed to deprive people of their proper representation to the extent of one seat stolen from the people of those two counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that basis and without any more ado from our side of the House, we <Col N="1290" /> wish to challenge a vote on the paragraph to the Schedule in the democratic interests of the people residing in the area and, indeed, in the democratic interests of the country as a whole who, I feel, should some day be entitled to some impartial form of dividing constituencies so that this sort of blatant gerrymandering does not occur.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this amendment is to call upon the Minister to maintain the <i>status quo</i> in Cork city and county and, in particular, to leave the city of Cork with its two three-seat constituencies rather than the five-seater proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am sure everybody in this House will agree that this proposal to change the city of Cork from two three-seaters to one five-seater has caused more comment, more criticism and more suspicion than any other proposed change in this Bill.  It is incomprehensible that the city of Cork should be treated differently from the city of Dublin.  Nobody has explained, and nobody can understand, why the same criterion, the same yardstick, should not be applied to the city of Cork as is applied to the city of Dublin.  If three-seater constituencies are appropriate to the city of Dublin why, I ask the Minister, are they not appropriate to the city of Cork?</P>
    <P>The feeling of the people of the city of Cork and, indeed, the county of Cork, and many others outside the city and county of Cork, is that this is a deliberate downgrading of the city of Cork.  This is an electoral insult. It is a cynical slur on the citizens of the second largest and probably the most progressive city in the State. Why, they ask, should Cork be different? Why should it be discriminated against in comparison with Dublin? Both cities have a great deal in common. They are both densely populated and highly industrialised.  They have many other features in common, including the benefits and the problems which inevitably flow from highly industrialised and highly populated areas.  They are both today, and have been for many years, rapidly expanding population-wise and industry-wise, but, I venture to say, the relative growth is greater in Cork than it is in Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> The prospects for Cork in the immediate future are certainly brighter than they are for the city of Dublin. Therefore, if a case can be made for three-seaters in Dublin, as good a case, if not a better one, can be made on the same basis for having the same arrangement in the city of Cork.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to have acknowledged this in another context. He introduced a Bill in this House some months ago in which provision was made for a very substantial increase to the National Building Agency.  In that Bill he made specific provision for the increased housing needs of Cork in the immediate future. He also made provisions in that Bill in regard to the Shannon estuary. I submit to the Minister that the argument I am adducing in favour of Cork is equally valid in relation to the amendment debated here before tea in relation to the county of Clare.</P>
    <P>The Shannon estuary and the lower harbour in Cork would appear to be the two areas where we will have most development and most growth in the immediate future and the Minister, who is conversant with the number of planning applications coming from these areas, should know that better than anybody else.  I should like the Minister to explain why he took cognisance of this impending growth in these two areas in his legislation in relation to the National Building Agency and why he ignored the same principle in connection with the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>As I say, this is a deliberate downgrading, a reduction in the status of the city of Cork, and I can assure the Minister that the people of Cork are very bitter about it.  There is a heavy onus on the Minister to explain, to the satisfaction of the citizens of Cork, his thinking in this matter. They are entitled to an explanation. He has been pressed on several occasions as to why he should distinguish and differentiate between Cork and Dublin.  An unworthy motive has been attributed to him.  It has been suggested that this is an effort on the part of the Minister to manufacture a seat for a political colleague.  That <Col N="1294" /> may be so; it may be an effort on the part of the Minister to resurrect and reconsolidate his own party in the city of Cork.  The Minister can tell us if that is so but, if he wishes to do that, he could do it much more effectively in the constituency in which I live in North-East Cork, where there was a representative of his party in the Dáil up to a short time after the second last election.  He could have done his own party a service and me a good turn if he had created a five-seater out of North-East Cork.</P>
    <P>Outside of the cities of Dublin and Cork it is probably the most highly industrialised area in the State.  The supporters and the members of the Minister's party in North-East Cork are not at all pleased with his failure to provide for them rather than for the city of Cork, where the chances, if I am correct about the alleged motive attributed to the Minister, of attempting to strengthen his own party in North-East Cork would have been much better.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when pressed on a number of occasions, stated that it was in deference to the former Taoiseach that he created a five-seater in the city of Cork.  I do not know whether the Minister was serious or whether he was indulging&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry, but my interpretation of what the Minister said was that he could have left the city of Cork as it was, but the impression he gave me, naïve as I am, was that it was in deference to the former Taoiseach that he created this five-seater.  The Minister could have put a four-seater where the former Taoiseach was.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, with the slightest bit of juggling with figures, that could have been done, and justifiably so.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that, if he wanted to pay a tribute to the former Taoiseach, he should have left Cork as it was, with two three-seaters, or else he could have made a four-seater of the constituency represented by the former Taoiseach.  That would have been a better expression of his admiration and respect for the former Taoiseach than what he has done in downgrading his city and his constituency.</P>
      <P>There is also the fact that in the city of Cork as it is at present, we the Opposition, have four Deputies.  With the proposed five-seater it is inevitable that we must lose a seat.  We have four Deputies at present and the Minister's proposal is a deliberate discrimination against the people of Cork city, the majority of whom are supporters of the Opposition.  Their representation in the Dáil is to be reduced from four to three by the juggling and the machinations of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister state if that was the motive which inspired him to reduce the number of seats in Cork city to five?  The most astonishing performance by the Minister in relation to the Cork constituency was the removal of a large area from Cork city and pushing it into Mid-Cork. I am referring to the area of Bishopstown. The number of votes involved is in the order of 18,000.  This area comprises some of the most historical and ancient parishes in Cork city. The Minister found it convenient to pull the people in that area up from their roots and throw them into a rural constituency.  Some of these people come from the centre of the city, such as Barrack Street and Western Road, the precincts of the college and they have nothing in common with the people in parts of the Mid-Cork constituency.</P>
      <P>If the Cathaoirleach was still living in Cork he would be transferred from Cork city into Mid-Cork.</P>

      <P>I wonder would he, electorally, if he was a member of our party, or had the good fortune to be a member of our party.  I come now to the proposed Mid-Cork constituency. This proposal is the most patent and blatant illustration of the failure of the Minister to abide by the lofty sentiments and to apply the lofty principles which he mentioned in his brief.  He was not inspired either by the letter or the spirt of the Constitution or by the decisions of the courts in interpreting the Constitution in relation to these matters.  He has repeated in this House that he was giving fair play to every area as far as he possibly could.  Does he really think he was giving fair play either to Cork city in making it a five-seater constituency or to Mid-Cork in making it a five-seater?</P>
      <P>The Minister has breached every local boundary, every electoral boundary and every county boundary, both in the city and in the constituency of Mid-Cork as it now stands.  He has criss-crossed it and has failed completely to take into account the matters which he has stated repeatedly should be taken into account in doing a job of this kind.  He has ignored the traditional and the cultural entities which exist as of now in these three constituencies&mdash;two in Cork City and one in Mid-Cork.  What have the people of The Lough and Togher in common with the people of the western part of the Mid-Cork constituency?  They are different in every way, even in regard to games.  In Cork City hurling is the popular game while in the constituency of Mid-Cork football is the popular game.  There are also the Gaeltacht areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest it is an issue.  I am merely illustrating the difference between the two communities. Am I not entitled to do that?  The people in Bishopstown&mdash;if I may again try to illustrate the difference between the types of people in the two communities&mdash;drink Murphy's and Beamish.  If you go back to the other end of the Mid-Cork constituency, the western end bordering on Kerry and Limerick, they drink Guinness.  If the Minister went down there and called for a drink he would get a &ldquo;Little Nora&rdquo; only and nothing else.  I am not trying to be facetious.  I am merely trying to illustrate the Minister's abysmal failure to take into account the principles which he said guided him and inspired him in carving out these three constituencies.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of tolerance, in the proposed constituency there is a plus of 695 which I suggest is for the city of Cork.  It is too much above the national average. In our proposal if the two three-seaters were retained, the figures in North-West Cork would be minus 967 and 293 in South-East Cork.  I submit to the Minister that these figures would be more realistic and more beneficial to the people of the city of Cork having regard to the inevitable expansion of Cork in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1298" /> I would agree that, where you have a rapidly expanding economy and society, the tolerance should be as much as possible in favour of such areas.</P>
    <P>Even though the Minister was not bound to do so, he should have taken into account the fact that, even since the figures on which he was working were ascertained, there has been a very large increase in the population of the city of Cork and its environs. The Minister, rather than having a plus of almost 700, would be doing a service to the people of Cork if he had adopted the figures which we suggest here, one below the national average and the other slightly above it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the third amendment, which deals with the removal of a number of small areas in the North-East Cork constituency, I do not think it is of great importance except that I would suggest to the Minister that he would have served his own party much better and, incidentally, myself if he had left these areas in the North Cork constituency.  With a little juggling of figures, he could have made it into a five-seater and restored the confidence of the people of North-East Cork who throughout the years returned a representative from the Minister's party to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to repeat what my colleagues on this side of the House have stated repeatedly.  This Bill can be described only as a piece of shameful gerrymandering.  I can assure the Minister that his fame or his infamy has gone far and wide and abroad on account of this piece of legislation.  I can tell him that I was at a meeting abroad last week, which was discussing discrimination and human rights and, when I complained about the situation in Northern Ireland with regard to gerrymandering on political and other grounds, I was told that I or anybody else from this part of the country should be the last to talk about gerrymandering because at this point in time we have a proposal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will accept that, during the course of these discussions, I have on several occasions told him that I recognise that he has had&mdash;and, indeed, any Minister must have had&mdash;considerable difficulties to face in framing a Bill of this kind.  No matter how you set about doing it, there are problems that arise, variations and adjustments to be made.  If you change one county another county falls to be changed also.  It is a very difficult task for any Minister to perform.  I accept this and, on several occasions I have told the Minister my views on this.  Anyone who examines the situation must concede that this county of Cork, with its five constituencies within its boundaries, was the easiest of all the areas in the country to deal with.  It <Col N="1300" /> need not have taken more than, perhaps, five minutes to settle the whole thing.  The Minister knows why and I shall stress the facts in order that they may be clear to Senators and go on the record.</P>
      <P>As regards the constituencies in County Cork, the figures of the census of 1971, on which we are working, show that Mid-Cork had 20,030 of population per seat, which is nearly 1,000 below the norm on which we are working, the maximum of 21,123. Therefore, Mid-Cork, taking it by itself, could have remained without adjustment.  North-East Cork had a population of 20,715 in 1971 per Deputy. This was 408 below the maximum that could be allowed and therefore it could have been left untouched. South-West Cork had a population of 19,790 per Deputy for each of its three seats, somewhat below the average required for the whole country, but well above the minimum that is allowable.  Therefore these three constituencies, taken on their own could be left untouched.  In Cork city, both constituencies were slightly too large. To be exact on this, Cork City North-West had a population of 704 more than the maximum to be allowed; Cork City South-East had 1,203 above the maximum.  The variation required, the number of population that had under the constitutional provisions on which we are working to be allotted to other parts of other constituencies in Cork, amounted to something under 2 per cent of the entire population of these two constituencies and of Cork city.</P>
      <P>All the Minister needed to do in order to settle the whole of Cork county was to take approximately 2,000 votes in total from these two constituencies and give them to adjoining constituencies and then, as he has done, to allot certain small areas to South Kerry in West Cork. The situation was that only marginal changes were needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to suggest that in framing a Bill of this kind, a Minister should, as a general rule, if circumstances allow, make as few changes as the variations in population allow.  The variations in population in Cork were <Col N="1301" /> small.  In Cork city and county combined there was a total increase of some 13,000 people which would have enabled the Minister, if he had seen fit, to give an extra seat somewhere in Cork.  However it was a legitimate decision of his not to do so: it was one of these marginal cases and he decided to leave them with the same number of seats.  I accept this as a legitimate exercise of his discretion.</P>
    <P>He told us, as he had told the Dáil earlier&mdash;and I quote from column 681 of the Seanad Official Report of 9th April, 1974.  He said:</P>
    <P>...I endeavoured, as far as possible, to avoid breaching existing administrative boundaries and tried to ensure that natural communities were not split, unnecessarily, between different constituencies....</P>
    <P>He was left in the happy position in Cork city and county that almost no variation was needed.  He would have had to breach&mdash;if that is the word&mdash;the boundary of Cork borough to a very limited extent in that at least 704 people from North-West had to be pushed into some adjoining constituency, and at least 1,203 from Cork City South-East.  That is all that was needed.  But what has he done?  He has eliminated these two Cork city constituencies, converted them into one five-seat constituency, driven an enormous wedge of rural Cork, Mid-Cork, up almost to the centre of Cork city, taking out of Cork city many of the most historic, traditional parishes of Cork city; taking out of Cork city almost all the corporation housing estates; taking out of Cork city the buildings of University College, Cork.  For what purpose?  In order to make the semirural area of Mid-Cork into a five-seat constituency and to take a seat away from Cork city.  Cork city had an increase in population in the five years from 1966 to 1971 and as a result, they find themselves with one seat taken away from them.</P>
    <P>The reasons for this would seem very clear in the absence of any alternative explanation from the Minister. The Labour Party Conference was held in Cork city last year and a report was <Col N="1302" /> circulated at that conference in which the fact was lamented that at present there was no Labour Deputy elected for Cork city.  The report went on to say that something must be done about it.  Apparently, &ldquo;the something&rdquo; is being done in this Bill.  The Minister feels, rightly or wrongly, that in a five-seat constituency it may be possible for some Labour candidate to get the necessary one-sixth of the votes in order to obtain a quota, and gain election to Dáil Éireann.  It is a legitimate aspiration, a legitimate ambition of the Minister, on behalf of his party colleagues, to hope that they will be elected to Dáil Éireann.  I would suggest that it is an unsavoury and rather unpleasant way of achieving this, to carry through on a gerrymander, as is set out in his Bill.  If the Minister had shown elsewhere in this Bill a feeling that, perhaps, in a city area five-seater constituencies were the thing, I could understand it.  If he had felt that, all things considered in an urban area the optimum form of constituency was a five-seater, one might still object to what he had done in Cork but at the same time it would show a certain consistency of thinking.</P>
    <P>In fact, in the only other major urban area in the country, the city of Dublin, the Minister has been at the greatest pains to divide this urban area into exclusively three-seat constituencies with the solitary exception of Dún Laoghaire, which we have discussed already and, I have no doubt, will again.  All the others are three-seaters. Therefore one would have thought that what was satisfactory and suitable, and what was in the Minister's mind as the correct thing to do in the urban area of Dublin would also be the correct thing to do in the urban area of Cork city.  The Minister has not done this.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading I asked the Minister if he would give a reason for this.  Some explanation is needed for these radical changes: the taking out of Cork city of 24,000 people who live in the borough of Cork, and bringing them into a totally new constituency. During the course of my speech on the Second Reading, I asked the Minister if he would tell us his reason.  As reported at column 915, Volume 77, of <Col N="1303" /> the Seanad Official Report for 10th April, 1974, I said:</P>
    <P>...In replying I would like the Minister to tell us openly and straightforwardly why he divided Cork borough and Cork county in this fashion?</P>
    <P>I went on to say, and I think I was justified in doing so:</P>
    <P>I do not want smart cracks or anything like that, or remarks about what anybody else did or could have done.  I would simply like an answer.</P>
    <P>In view of that, it is interesting to consider what answer I got.  In his reply, the Minister dealt with this matter.  At column 1025 he said:</P>
    <P>I should like to say to Senator Yeats&mdash;for whom I have a high regard&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I am happy naturally to hear this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that, as far as the question of the changes in Cork are concerned, the statement made here to the effect that I deliberately did this because the former Taoiseach lived in Cork is untrue.</P>
    <P>I said nothing about the former Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>But one thing is true and I want to put this on record, as I did in the other House, The natural change&mdash; my conscience has been troubling me a bit about this&mdash;should have been that I would take the area in which the former Taoiseach lives and put it into North Cork.  That is what I should have done....</P>
    <P>I cannot understand this.  I have already pointed out that what he should have done was to leave the two Cork constituencies almost unchanged. In the paragraph before this the Minister had made what I thought was an interesting comment.</P>
    <P>I do not want to follow Senator Yeats all around the country.  We can take his statement about the Cork area as a fair example of his attitude.  He asked me to explain why certain changes have been made in the Cork area.  Then he went on to tell me what answer I should give.  He said he would <Col N="1304" /> not accept any other answer.  This sounds very like Alice in Wonderland....</P>
    <P>It would sound like Alice in Wonderland if this were what I had said. I did not tell the Minister what he should tell me because I do not know what the Minister has to say.  I said I did not want smart cracks which, indeed, is what I got.  I did not want remarks about what anybody else might have proposed to do with constituencies. I said, and I say it again, I want to hear&mdash;and we are all entitled to hear&mdash;from the Minister exactly what impelled him to make this radical change in the existing state of affairs in Cork city and county and what impelled him to make this major breach in the existing administrative boundary of Cork.  He said&mdash;and this has been quoted over and over again, and it is worthwhile quoting it once more&mdash;in his opening speech in this House, as he also did in the Dáil many months earlier, at column 681:</P>
    <P>I endeavoured, as far as possible, to avoid breaching existing administrative boundaries....</P>
    <P>This is precisely what he has not done in Cork city.  He could have dealt with Cork city by a simple transfer of, perhaps, 2 per cent of the population, maybe a couple of thousand people. He has taken 24,000 out of Cork city and put them in Mid Cork.  This even the Minister must accept, is a very radical breach within an existing administrative boundary.  I do think we are entitled to be told why he did this.  Of course, his action is completely contrary to what is alleged to be Government policy.  We have, for example, reported in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of January 26th last a speech in Cork by the Minister for Finance.  He told the people of Cork:</P>
    <P>Dublin and Cork have long been rivals.  In a sense I am on Cork's side.  I assure you that I am perfectly sincere.  I am not being in the slightest degree disloyal to my native Dublin city.  I believe it is in Dublin's ultimate good and to the good of the country as a whole that Cork should thrive.</P>
    <P>Later on he states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> The Government are particularly conscious of the importance of Cork.  Cork is a great industrial and commercial centre, has always counterbalanced in the south the economic and social influence of Dublin.  Cork acts as a focal point of southern development, a role which benefits both the city and its hinterlands.</P>
    <P>That is what the Minister for Finance says.  His colleague, the Minister for Local Government, deals with this important second city of the Republic at a time when its population is increasing by removing one seat from it and handing over 24,000 people to the Limerick-Cork constituency.</P>
    <P>I would accept completely that this was a legitimate operation if the Minister would only tell us why he has done it.  On the face of it, it is a pure crude exercise in gerrymandering. But, perhaps, I am wrong.  It may be that the Minister has a reason but he has not, as yet, given any reason.  He gave no reason that I saw in the Dáil. He certainly has given no reason in the Seanad.  I do think that on a Bill of this importance dealing with a city of the importance and prestige of Cork and, in particular, considering the allegations which have been made naturally in Cork but also elsewhere, that this is a pure exercise on the Minister's part in gerrymandering.  He owes it to himself and, indeed, to the prestige and the reputation of Irish politics in general to give some explanation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Senator Yeats will admit that my reputation in Irish politics will stand up to that of anybody else, particularly anybody in his party.  That crack coming from him is just a little bit unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in the peculiar position here that if I attempt to give the reason for doing something it is not accepted. If I point out rather foolish things that have been said by the Opposition, I am being a smart aleck.  It is not my fault if some of the things which have been said by the Opposition here do draw retorts which are considered to be rather, as Senator Yeats said, smart aleck.  I do not want to do this but <Col N="1306" /> when I find people making some of the comments which have been made here, there is no other answer for them.  It just happens that way.</P>
    <P>Senator Brosnan asked why I was able to take cognisance of future developments in Cork in the case of the National Building Agency Bill but was not able to do it in relation to the present Bill.  Senator Brosnan again, as one of the intellectuals of the party, I am quite sure is well aware that it is not possible in this Bill to take cognisance of future developments.  I am stuck with the 1971 census.  Therefore, it was rather foolish to make a comment like that.  Those are the exact facts and I cannot get away from them.  Neither can Senator Brosnan nor anybody else.  Senator Brosnan repeated&mdash;and, indeed, Senator Yeats followed him along and I was rather surprised to find him do it&mdash;the old double-edged argument that we have heard so often here during this debate. He implied that the Bill creates a five-seater in Cork city to benefit the Labour Party.  Then he went on to say that if I was not a member of the Labour Party I should have concentrated on north-east Cork.  Senator Brosnan made&mdash;and Senator Yeats agrees with him&mdash;the suggestion that it was for the purpose of helping the Labour Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>O.K.  This is the sort of rather foolish statement which is being made by the Opposition.  I cannot be blamed if I point out that here are two contradictory statements. Senator Brosnan did add that it would also help him, and brought me back to the Sleeping Beauty who also made the same argument and felt it would help him, too, if we give an extra seat there.  Indeed, I would assure Senator Brosnan that at casual observance it would appear he need not fear about his seat the next time.  He should be very safe.  I do not know why he should worry.  Again, we had arguments here which just do not stand up.  For instance, under the present Bill in Dublin the average per seat is 20,142.  Under the Opposition <Col N="1307" /> amendment it was 20,776.</P>
      <P>In the rest of the country it is 20,116.  Under the Opposition amendment the average was 19,873.  In the Cork area under the Bill the average is 20,556.  Under the amendments which the Fianna Fáil Party have introduced it would be 19,414.  We got lectures in the other House and here about about the fact that city areas should have a much higher number to qualify than the country areas. Again there is the double-thinking. They say one thing as it suits here, and something entirely different if it suits somewhere else.  They just make up the rules of the game as we go along.  If they are not spotted that is all right.  That seems to be the way it goes.  Senator Brosnan asked what the people of The Lough and Togher had in common with the people in the western part of the Mid-Cork constituency. I ask him: &ldquo;Are they not all Corkmen?&rdquo;  It is not as if they were two different races or nations. They are all equally proud to call themselves Cork people.  If they were asked, they would claim that they had a lot of things in common.  This is the type of argument: whether they play football in Mid-Cork, or hurling in Cork city&mdash;they have good football teams also, including Gaelic and soccer&mdash; whether it is Guinness or Murphy that is drunk in a particular part has no relevance.  The Constitution or the High Court do not have regard to whether they drink Guinness or Murphy or whether they play hurling or football.  I have to draw up constituencies as they are.  The rules are laid down for me.  Bringing in things like this does not help, and they, perhaps, tempt the smart answer.  Perhaps, as Senator Yeats says, I should not fall for the temptation.</P>
      <P>Senator Brosnan also stressed the cultural difference between the people of Bishopstown and the people of County Cork.  I do not pretend to follow his argument on this.  His amendment transfers more of Bishopstown to Mid-Cork than my Bill does.  Let us have the facts and let us stand over them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> Senator Brosnan, in support of his argument for increased representation for Cork city, talked about the potentially big increase in the population in the future.  The other Opposition speakers did not take this line when dealing with the Dublin area.  In the other House I pointed out that we had evidence, not census evidence, of a tremendous increase in population in certain areas.  In Dublin, particularly, if we had census evidence we could have increased the number of seats. The Opposition said: &ldquo;Look, that is all right but the census says such and such.&rdquo;  The 1971 census laid it down for Cork as it did for Dublin and, therefore, whether there is this big increase or not, I could not take cognisance of it.  That is the situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Brosnan also said that where we had a rapidly expanding society tolerance should be given as much as possible in favour of such areas.  It is a pity the Senator did not make this point much earlier because it would absolutely refute the argument which had been made by his party against doing that in Dublin.  The argument was entirely opposite.</P>

      <P>Senator Yeats talked about the undesirability of making radical changes in constituency boundaries. As far as Cork city is concerned the bulk of the city was in one constituency until 1969.  Was it not a radical change then to split it in two or does Senator Yeats think it is only a radical change when somebody other than Fianna Fáil does it?  It was a two-constituency area in 1969 and the present Bill puts the great bulk of the city back into one constituency. Senator Yeats admitted that it was a legitimate decision not to increase the <Col N="1309" /> representation of Cork, so now we are beginning to make progress.  He also admitted that the boundary between the city and the county had to be breached.  The objective should be to make as few changes from the existing position as possible.  Apparently he has forgotten that the amendments he supported involved changing every constituency in the Cork area and the Bill he is condemning does not do that.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go on in this way but the facts seem to be that two speakers from the Fianna Fáil side have made arguments which in some cases are contrary.  In the main, however, the argument has been entirely contrary to what they have been saying since this Bill began to be debated in the House.  They just cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>I will point out something which Senator Yeats seemed to think was amusing when I said it the other day, and it is that everybody in Cork, both Cork City and Mid-Cork, after the next general election will have not three or four TDs whom they can turn to: they will have five representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>To say that this is reducing representation is something which beats me.  I do not want to draw the former Taoiseach into this because it was not I who mentioned it first.  I want to make that clear because Senator Brosnan obviously misunderstood what was said.  When it was suggested to me that it is in the northern end of Cork city I should have made the changes I said I was tempted to do it but that I did not do it because it is the area in which the former Taoiseach lives and I felt it would be unfair.  People would say that I had singled it out because of the former Taoiseach.  Not that it would matter much to him because I am quite sure he would be elected to head the poll in Cork no matter what happened.</P>

      <P>There is one thing about the former Taoiseach that I discovered after I had drawn up the boundaries, and I want to explain this because there may be misunderstanding about it.

I want to make it clear that I am satisfied from the amount of work which he does in his area that he is like Deputy Bill Loughnane who has two constituencies from which he can choose.</P>

The Minister has at no stage made any effort whatever to explain why he divided Cork city in the way he did.  The Minister went back to 1961 and said that in those days Cork city was a five-seat constituency. Of course it was.  The population was lower than now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has asked me to produce figures, so I might as well produce them.  In 1961 Cork County Borough had 112,317 people. In 1966 it had 122,146.  Now it has 128,645.  In other words going back to 1961 it had 112,317 people, which just about rated five seats.  The Minister has made no effort whatever to explain to us why he has dealt with the Cork city situation in the manner in which he has.  He raised the question of the former Taoiseach.  The question of the position of the Leader of the Opposition was not raised by a anyone on this side of the House nor I think by any Fianna Fáil Deputy in Dáil Éireann.  It was raised by a colleague of the Minister's in the Fine Gael Party, the Chief Government Whip in the Dáil, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy John Kelly.  We had Deputy Kelly for some years in this House and one of his salient characteristics was a vigour of speech coupled with a certain candour which is sometimes, I think, a little embarrassing for his political friends.  The Chief Government Whip in Dáil Éireann had this to say at column 2030; Volume 268, of the Dáil Official Report:</P>
      <P>The situation in relation to Cork is a special one because one would expect a good Fianna Fáil vote there by reason of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition comes from the constituency.</P>
      <P>This is how we come to this interesting discussion about the Leader of the Opposition, not through any Fianna Fáil speech but from Deputy Kelly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I cannot find the reference but I know it was referred to by one of the Ministers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, the only reason I ever raised this matter in this House was because of this interesting speech of Deputy Kelly's.  This is what makes <Col N="1313" /> Cork city a special case.  He goes on to say:</P>
      <P>In Cork in 1973 Fianna Fáil won four seats for which they paid 7,591 votes each.  Fine Gael won two seats at a cost of 8,071 votes each, while the Labour Party did not succeed in returning anyone to the Dáil although they succeeded in winning 4,715 first preference votes.</P>
      <P>He goes on to say</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government is not St. Francis of Assisi&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>How right he is.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it would be asking a superhuman virtue on his part to permit that situation to continue.</P>
      <P>So now we have it.  The Minister has refused consistently to offer any explanation why, when the only change needed in the whole of Cork city and Cork county was a minor 2 per cent shift in population out of Cork city, he has made these enormous changes; an almost static situation was all that was required.  We have it now from the Chief Government Whip in Dáil Éireann, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, that he had to do this because of the unfortunate fact that the Leader of the Opposition stood for Cork city, which made Cork city a special case.  A special case in the Minister's terminology of course means a case for Fianna Fáil.  This Bill is full of such special cases.  Cork city according to Deputy Kelly, the Parliamentary Secretary, is a special case because of the presence of Deputy Lynch.  Therefore it had to be dealt with in a special way.  Since the Minister, it goes without saying, is not St. Francis of Assisi, we have this curious situation in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>St. Francis would have boosted the former Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the basic point and no amount of smart cracks, no amount of suggestions, that so and so has said one thing and so and so has said another will enable the Minister to evade the basic issue that this situation in Cork city was a blatant gerrymander, an enormous change where a purely marginal change was all that was necessary.  It was done for one <Col N="1314" /> purpose.  It was not done really to deprive Fianna Fáil of a seat, because after all we will get three out of five in Cork City and three out of five in Mid-Cork.  It is not even as if Fianna Fáil stand to lose a seat.  It is done for the sole, specific, simple purpose of making room for one Labour Deputy in Cork City.  That is the crux of the matter.  That is the answer and unless the Minister is prepared to give us some other reason as to why he did this the world in general is going to go on believing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are back here to the basic question of principle. I made it emphatic in the discussions on the earlier groups of amendments that what we were concerned about here in a rational, deliberative assembly was to advance amendments to the Minister that would improve this Bill.  We recognise that the Minister has adopted a certain attitude and for that reason in the discussion on the first group of amendments we agreed that he should have his large number of three-seat constituencies in Dublin city and county but that he could improve the adjustment of constituencies in that area without breaching county boundaries, without doing violence to loyalties and to affinities and associations by keeping within Dublin city and county nine three-seat constituencies, two five-seat constituencies and a four-seat constituency. We were beaten on that. In regard to the group of amendments concerned with Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath, I acknowledge that the Minister had an equal case with our case and we said: &ldquo;Right the Minister's case may be as good as our case.&rdquo;  However, in regard to the first group of amendments we were on a straightforward point of principle: to preserve the territorial integrity of city and county of Dublin.  In regard to the third group of amendments, the amendments concerned with the west, and in particular with Clare and Galway, we advanced the same argument of principle.  We were again beaten by the votes on the other side against our very rational propositions in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same attitude of principle applies <Col N="1315" /> in regard to this group.  I want to identify this group concerning Cork city and Cork county rearrangements as being in the very same category as the argument that we advanced in regard to Dublin city and county and that we advanced in regard to the west, particularly in regard to Clare and Galway.  Here again we have violence done unnecessarily and totally without any basis to existing administrative borough, county and traditional arrangements of very long standing.</P>
    <P>Enough has been said already in regard to this aspect, but I want to bring the debate back to the fundamental point of principle.  Without any great degree of adjustment there were two three-seat constituencies in the borough area of Cork City.  Slight adjustments were necessary, but why the departure in regard to Cork compared to the principle adopted in regard to the metropolitan area of Dublin? This is the key question of principle that must be asked in this respect, particularly when one sees the net effect of the five-seat constituency proposal in regard to Cork city.  I leave aside North-East Cork as not being relevant to this argument because, basically&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant because it would have to be changed, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as the Minister is aware, what is involved is Cork city being changed from two three-seat constituencies.  Why was there a change from the metropolitan criterion adopted by the Minister for the principal city in the State&mdash;where every single constituency is a three-seat constituency&mdash;in regard to the other major city in the State, Cork city?  Why the change?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming back to a fundamental point of principle that we have adumbrated here, that any judicial tribunal or commission would take an impartial look at this matter and our amendments are ones <Col N="1316" /> that are seeking to bring in a judicial and impartial attitude into the rearrangement of these constituencies.</P>
      <P>The Minister resurrected, earlier in the day, various matters concerning what was being proposed and was not being proposed in regard to constituencies, the various arrangements made under previous Acts of this kind.  I am not concerned about this matter. What we have here is a series of amendments put down by our group in the Seanad with a view to improving the Minister's Bill.  We have not sought to eliminate the Minister's Bill or to adopt a holier-than-thou attitude.  We have said: &ldquo;Right, maybe there is some semblance of reality in what he proposes and we want to improve it.&rdquo;  We have been met right through this debate with a totally negative attitude.  The Minister must learn that that is not the purpose of having a Dáil or a Seanad.  That is not the purpose of Parliament.  There has not been one single yield by the Minister in regard to the tremendous yields we have given by acknowledging the broad scheme of his proposals but at the same time suggesting constructive amendments in regard to Dublin city and county, the Galway-Clare situation and the situation in Cork City and Mid-Cork.  I would largely confine my remarks to both Cork City and Mid-Cork in this context. With very little adjustment&mdash; it would not have required any great imagination&mdash;the Minister could have retained, as we suggest in the amendment, two three-seat constituencies in Cork City North-West and Cork City South-East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Mid-Cork we have the Minister's proposal of five seats.  I used very strong language earlier on in regard to the way in which Clare had been raped and the way an artificial constituency of West-Galway had been created.  That language would pale in comparison with the sort of language I could use in regard to the monstrosity of Mid-Cork.  I am not an expert on County Cork.  I was reasonably familiar with the townlands and the areas concerned when we were discussing the adjustments in the West.  But it does not require any expert knowledge from <Col N="1317" /> me or anybody here to realise what has happened in the new Mid-Cork five-seat constituency.  We know that a substantial part of the borough area of Cork city which has never been outside a Cork city constituency since the formation of the State has been taken out.</P>
    <P>Two three-seat constituencies could have been established in Cork city. Instead of that we have wards in the County Borough of Cork&mdash;Bishopstown, Gillabbey, Glasheen, Pouladuff, The Lough and Togher&mdash;hived away from the borough area of Cork city and incorporated in the administrative county of Cork which includes for other constituency purposes the Mid-Cork area ranging from there to the Kerry-Limerick border&mdash;an area that includes Newmarket, Kanturk and Charleville, areas totally unrelated to the needs of the people in the borough area of Cork.  If the Minister does not know sufficient about the county, I know a certain amount&mdash;although not as much as I should like to know.  I know that there is no relationship between the problems of Kanturk and Newmarket and the problems of the part of the borough of Cork which the Minister has linked in with Mid-Cork.</P>
    <P>The reality of the situation is that, assuming a reasonable and responsible attitude could have been adopted by the Minister, there was a situation where Cork city had two three-seat constituencies, constituencies such as the Minister has sought in Dublin city.  Surely the rational approach was to adopt what we have proposed here in amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 6 and make a proper organisation of the constituencies of Cork City, Mid-Cork and North-East Cork?  There would have to be, I agree, some impingement of Mid-Cork on Cork city but not anything like the total carve-up which the Minister has made in Cork city in order to achieve a five-seat situation in Mid-Cork.  The metropolitan principle which the Minister has established in Dublin should have been applied to Cork city and Mid-Cork and North-East Cork should then have been dealt with consequentially. I should like to hear from the Minister why that has not been done.</P>

I should like to point out that, although Senator Yeats said that we were making a very big change&mdash; and he wanted to know why&mdash;in 1923 Cork city was a five-seater; in 1935 a four-seater; in 1947, a five-seater; in 1961, a five-seater; in 1969, two three-seaters; and in 1974 a five-seater. Now we are accused of making a big change.  The change was made by Fianna Fáil and we are rectifying it.  There is a breach in the boundaries of the existing constituencies. If we are to talk about that, they must all be changed, according to the amendments put forward by Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>Could we have one consistent argument from Fianna Fáil?  We have not had two Senators making the same suggestion.  One argues one way and the next argues another way.  Then I am told I have not replied properly <Col N="1319" /> to these arguments.  I should like to tell Senator Lenihan that Cork was always a five-seater, with one exception when it went down to a four-seater.  We are going back to the five-seater constituency and everybody in Cork city, after the next general election, will have five Deputies to call upon.  Can I get that through to Fianna Fáil? Anybody who states I am reducing the representation in Cork city does not know what they are talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister speaks about being consistent in this matter. I should like to draw attention to the fact that he has gone all out for three-seat constituencies in Dublin.  He now refuses to give three-seat constituencies in a similar city.  Cork city has expanded over the last ten or 15 years, thanks to Fianna Fáil policy.  The population has increased and it is wrong to demote them at this stage by reducing the representation from six to five.  Cork people are nationally-minded and support their own industries; they are good citizens and take great pride in their city.  In the past the Cork people have been wise and have supported Fianna Fáil and the re-arranging of the constituencies appears to be for the purpose of gaining a seat for the Labour Party in Cork city.  The Minister also spoke about consistency in other fields.  If he were consistent he would not have allowed the comparative situation which exists between Louth and Clare to develop. The Minister should have accepted our amendments which were put down in all sincerity.  There has been no consistent argument on this Bill in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am beginning to understand why Fianna Fáil wanted to keep this debate going on for so long.  They put down a number of amendments which were grouped. When we started dealing with the first group of amendments there was a certain set of arguments being churned out by Fianna Fáil.  By keeping the debate going they hoped that by the time we reached this group of amendments the Minister and everyone else would be so weary that we would <Col N="1320" /> have forgotten about the arguments which were churned out on the first group of amendments.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go back over ground already covered, as was done by Senator Lenihan.  I should like to make this point, however.  We remember clearly the arguments presented in relation to Dublin city that in a large urban area there was no question of it mattering a thraneen what kind of constituency we are in, that we should have large constituencies and that this idea of three-seaters in Dublin city was a sinister plot of the Minister's.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed that out to Senator Eoin Ryan after he had made this argument.  Typically this was the argument which was churned out. But the amendments dealt with enlarging County Dublin and not Dublin city.  The argument was that where there is a large population with no particular local affiliations or loyalties there should be large constituencies. The Minister has created a large constituency in Cork city.  He has reverted to the historical and traditional situation in Cork city.  When my late father represented Cork city it was a five-seat constituency.</P>

We have now gone down south and there are such great differences between the people of Cork, whether they are south or north of the Lee, whether they are from Cork county or Cork city, that it must be looked at as closely and minutely as possible.  This was seriously put to the Minister.  It must be taken into account whether they play football or hurling.</P>

      <P>It must be taken into consideration whether they drink Guinness or drink Murphy. When one has conducted this kind of examination as between the people of Cork city and Cork county then one can get out one's drawing board and put on one side of the column &ldquo;These people drink Guinness, so they stay in Cork county&rdquo;; on the other side one puts &ldquo;These people drink Murphy, so they must go into Cork city&rdquo;.  Then one draws another line the other way and above the line states &ldquo;These people played hurling with Jack Lynch and must stay in a particular part of Cork&rdquo;.  Under the line one says &ldquo;These people played soccer, and must go somewhere else&rdquo;.  This is the kind of consideration the Minister is asked to give to the Cork constituencies.</P>
      <P>Do Fianna Fáil Senators realise how they must appear in the eyes of the public?  This is the first time for 51 years that the Fianna Fáil Party were not allowed to draw the constituencies and one after the other they are displaying their sores in public.  They do not know what to make of the present situation because every Constituencies Bill since 1923 was drawn by the Fianna Fáil Party. This is the first time for over half a century Fianna Fáil were not allowed to do as they wished when distributing seats and drawing constituencies.  That is what is wrong with them.  They cannot get accustomed to the fact that the Minister is not obliged to take every little whisper of advice or every little whimper of advice tendered to him by Fianna Fáil Senators in this debate.</P>
      <P>Cop yourselves on.  The people have their eyes on Fianna Fáil just as much as they have on the performance of the Government.  They see Fianna Fáil for what they are.  They see them whining and whinging in this Constituencies Bill.  They see the kind of arguments that are being put up.  They see the advice that is being solemnly tendered to the Minister as reasonable and right.  Fianna Fáil drew every Constituencies Bill for 51 years but their performance in this House leads me to believe that it will be 51 years more before they draw up another.</P>

      <P>I have had the pleasure &mdash;and I mean this&mdash;of being a Member of this House along with Senator Michael O'Higgins for some years now, and one thing I have always noticed is that when some matter comes up on which Senator O'Higgins feels he has absolutely no case he begins to bluster.  His performance just now, knowing Senator O'Higgins as well as I do, shows quite clearly that in his own mind he realises that the matters dealt with by this amendment are, from his point of view, indefensible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking on amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 6.  Senator O'Higgins was speaking on amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 6.  On amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 6 he has shown quite frequently that in his view the matters dealt with in these amendments are quite indefensible.  The blustering tone, and indeed the irrelevant tone, of his speech shows that without any doubt.  However we have had a kind of an answer at last from both the Minister and Senator Michael O'Higgins as to why this extraordinary butchering of Cork city was carried out.  They both say, in effect, that many years ago when Cork city had a population of some 80,000 it only had five seats.  In 1961 it had 112,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is right.  There is a certain awful consistency about the way in which he has divided the constituencies in this Bill.  It is very interesting.  One would expect, as a matter of course, that in areas of the country where the population was rising by and large where changes were necessary there would be more seats given and that in areas of the country where the population was falling by and large where changes were necessary there would be a loss of seats. The Minister has succeeded, admirably, in turning this simple law on its head.  We have had over and over again Cork city, Clare, Galway where the population is rising but where&mdash;<Col N="1323" /> and this is where the special cases come in&mdash;Fianna Fáil are strong and the number of seats comes down. In other areas such&mdash;for example, Mayo, Sligo, Roscomon and Leitrim &mdash;where the population is falling, and alas falling rapidly, but where the Coalition parties are strong the seats are maintained or where possible increased.  That is the basic reversal of the laws of nature that the Minister has succeeded in bringing about.</P>
      <P>The population of Cork city rose by some 6,000 people in the last census period but Cork city loses a seat.  If the Minister was all that interested in having a large constituency he could have even have made it a six-seater.  I was interested in the Minister's remark that, after all, in a five-seat constituency there were five Deputies to look after you instead of three.  I do not think it is a very good point but, for what it is worth, it is a point.  I will accept the Minister's sincerity that in an urban area, where after all constituencies are small, there may be potentially some advantage in having five Deputies to look after you instead of only three.  It means you can write to five people, if you are looking for something, instead of writing to only three.  But why did the Minister not adopt this curious doctrine in the city of Dublin?  It would have been very simple for him there if he had really believed that there was some basic advantage in having five seats.  If he really believed this he would have been able to bring in such constituencies in Dublin, but of course he did not believe it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Originally Cork had four seats or five seats when the population was much lower.  When the population rose it got six seats.  But when the population rose further, so that there were slightly too many votes for six seats, the Minister, following what he describes as the natural progression of things, takes a seat from them and 24,000 people are taken out of Cork city and put into an adjoining constituency.  One thing I am absolutely certain of is this.  In all the variations in Cork city, depending to a large extent on its gradual increase in population, there never has been <Col N="1324" /> a redistribution in which as many as 24,000 inhabitants of the borough of Cork were put into an adjoining constituency. The Minister knows very well that, despite what he may say about what happened in 1951 or 1961 or what may have happened in the days when Senator O'Higgins's father stood as a Deputy for Cork city, under present day conditions the natural, normal and indeed honest thing to have done with Cork city would have been to have left it with two three-seat constituencies.</P>

      <P>Before Senator Lenihan speaks I should like to reply to Senator Yeats.  He referred to the fact that Senator O'Higgins was blustering and that he had no case to make.  As I said earlier on a number of occasions, Senator Yeats is an intelligent man and he has adopted here a supercilious, patronising tone when he knows himself that what he is talking about is sheer, utter nonsense.  In order to give it the impression of being something which should be listened to he uses a tone which suggests: &ldquo;Here is the great master now talking.  Nobody else should have any say&rdquo; as if the Creator came down and had spoken and after that nobody else should interfere because Senator Yeats knows it all.  He has made many contradictory arguments since the start of this debate.  He was accusing me of not being able to answer his arguments.  I referred earlier to the &ldquo;pullapusha&rdquo; bird&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in raising little points like that.  We are here in a House of the Oireachtas considering specific amendments that have been put down.  I have granted the Minister's arguments in the case of some of our amendments.  We suggested a rearrangement that would grant him a large number of three-seat constituencies in Dublin&mdash;nine three-seat constituencies out of 12.  I asked him would he not consider an amendment that would involve two five-seaters and a four-seater for County Dublin, but it was rejected. We adopted the very same attitude in regard to Galway and Clare.  We propose to have another amendment on that basis for Report Stage, involving a simple exchange of the four and three between Clare and East Galway to give some reality to the situation there.</P>
      <P>Here again, I want to try to bring this debate on to a reasonable debating level.  Let us for a few moments, even if it involves a suspension in the Minister's intellect and in Senator O'Higgins's intellect, get down to a reasonable plane and get away from the idea of Senator O'Higgins and of the Minister that we are all engaged in a kind of black-and-white debate, an argy-bargy debate, without any constructive purpose.  We are concerned about a constructive purpose and there is no point in Senator O'Higgins or the Minister talking about Cork city's historic right to five seats, as if there was something sacrosanct about Cork city having had five seats in the twenties, and the Cork city that exists in 1974 being entitled to only five seats.  The facts of life change rapidly.  The population of Cork has gone up enormously.  Without any violence whatever to the borough of Cork, in the last rearrangement conducted in 1969, there were two three-seat constituencies: south-east and north-west.  By very little adjustment and rearrangement, the Minister could have continued with that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know why that situation was not continued.  This would have been the attitude of any impartial commissioner.  Any honest <Col N="1326" /> tribunal would have said: &ldquo;There is Cork borough.  It has enhanced its population due to economic development. It justifies six seats, broadly speaking, within the borough area.&rdquo; There are two three-seat constituencies there since 1969, dividing the city.  In addition to that, the Minister has adopted the very same principle in regard to the other major city in the country, the metropolitan area of Dublin.  In our amendments, we have not disputed this.  We have agreed with the nine three-seat constituencies in Dublin city.  We have proposed that there be two five-seaters and a four-seat constituency in the county council or rural area of County Dublin, so as to keep the territorial integrity of County Dublin.  We have granted the Minister's point and agreed that within the inner core of Dublin the argument is strong for nine three-seat constituencies.  We have suggested constructive amendments for County Dublin, which have been rejected, in order to preserve the territorial integrity of County Dublin.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise our consistency in this.  What the Minister and Senator O'Higgins should address their minds to here are our amendments.  What is under discussion here are the amendments which we have put forward. Irrespective of what was said in the Dáil, irrespective of what was said in regard to debates of this kind before, our amendments hang together as a consistent whole.  Viewed in the context of the amendments, we suggest that there is total consistency in having two three-seat constituencies in Cork city.  They have been there since 1969 and were established there by reason of the increase in population. This runs on parallel lines with the nine three-seat constituencies which we have admitted in our own amendments to be proper for the inner heart of Dublin city, for metropolitan Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Senator may not appreciate the point.  He is a little bit obtuse on this.  Our amendments Nos. 7 and 8 were deliberately argued together, by permission of the Chair, and were brought together in a group because of the need to keep Dublin city, Dún Laoghaire and Dublin county together as one group of amendments.  The whole debate last <Col N="1328" /> night was conducted on that basis. The Minister was a little obtuse at one stage, he did not quite get this point, which is that as far as the Chair's decision is concerned, County Dublin, Dún Laoghaire and metropolitan Dublin were all taken together for the one purpose.</P>
      <P>We acknowledged the right of the Minister to have as many three-seaters as possible in a city area.  Our amendments provided for two five-seaters and a four-seat constituency in the greater Dublin area.  We wanted to ensure the maximum number of three-seat constituencies for the benefit of the Minister and the preservation of the territorial identity of Dublin city and county.  Here, we are now passing into a very similar approach in principle.  I am making the point that we have been consistently arguing on principle right through this debate.  Our view is that to be consistent with what the Minister has done in regard to the metropolitan area of Dublin, he should do the same in regard to the second major metropolitan area in the country.  The two three-seat constituencies that existed there, with very minor adjustments, could have been preserved in that way.  Instead, 24,000 people were wrenched&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What I am talking about is the traditional Mid-Cork constituency that has varied in numbers over the years but that basically is a strong dairy-farming, mixed farming part of the country.  It has vigorous small country towns such as Newmarket, Kanturk, Macroom, Charleville and Bandon, which are typical of the Cork rural area, together with their own farming hinterlands.  There <Col N="1329" /> is no relationship, good, bad or indifferent, between that type of constituency and the very urban problems of the 24,000 or 25,000 people who have been wrenched from the city of Cork in order to establish a five-seat constituency there.  That might have been all right a generation ago, when Cork was a small town; now that Cork is a major thriving metropolitan city, with an expanding economy, it justifies receiving the same treatment as Dublin.  There is no justification for wrenching part of that city and throwing it holus-bolus, in an artificial manner, into a Mid-Cork rural constituency with an entirely different background and an entirely different environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to keep this debate in low key and on a sensible plane.  I should like to know from the Minister if he made any effort to try to retain Cork city in a two three-seat situation.  He could then have worked out the very minor adjustments that would have had to take place in regard to the Cork county constituency rearrangement both in regard to Mid-Cork and North-East Cork.  That very minor adjustment of boundaries between North-East Cork and Mid-Cork would have been necessitated by having two three-seat constituencies <Col N="1330" /> in Cork city and the minor readjustments would have taken place between constituencies that were exactly the same in character.</P>
    <P>Anybody who knows County Cork knows that as far as Mallow and Fermoy are concerned they are basically towns with the same sort of problems as those which Charleville, Newmarket or Kanturk would have, so that you are moving into an area where, with minor adjustment between the rural constituencies of County Cork, North-East Cork and Mid-Cork, the Minister could have settled his problem and kept the two urban constituencies of Cork city in a two three-seat situation.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister did he at any stage address his mind or the minds of his officials to the desirability of maintaining a situation that was working well where the population justified it, where all the loyalty, affinities and associations justified it, of maintaining the borough area of Cork which, due to an expanding population, justified two three-seat constituencies as its sister city of Dublin justified them?  Why was that not done?</P>

      <P>I can assure the House that I do not propose to spend any length of time on this.  We have discussed it even though we have not really obtained the kind of explanation the House is entitled to.  I would like to say something, particularly for the benefit of Senator M.J. O'Higgins who seemed to be a little confused about the historical situation in Cork City&mdash;for all it is worth, and I do not think that the historical details are of much importance.  In 1961 the population of Cork County Borough was 112,317 which is not enough for six seats.  Cork City had five seats. In 1966 Cork City had arisen in population by 10,000 to 122,144 which is just right for six seats, divided into two three-seat constituencies.  Now, with a further rise of some 6,000 the population of Cork is 138,845 more than it should be for six seats.  Therefore, you had a pattern, over the years, of a rising population resulting in an increased number of seats.  The population has now arisen still further and the Minister has taken a seat away from Cork City.  The Minister has said a couple of times in interjections that after all that all Cork men are Cork men and if 24,000 are to be taken out of Cork City, they are still in Cork.  That is true enough.  However, I would ask the Minister, in the light of his reiterated statement that in the framing of this Bill he has tried so far as possible to adhere to administrative boundaries, is the border of Cork City an administrative boundary or not?  It is of course.  I am taking the Minister at his own word.  The Minister, not in relation to Cork men but in relation to the country as a whole, said quite clearly and categorically in this House and in the other House, on a number of occasions, that in framing this Bill he had done his utmost to adhere to existing administrative boundaries. Now the boundary of Cork City is an existing administrative boundary. The Minister has quite deliberately violated this existing administrative boundary and taken 24,000 people <Col N="1332" /> out of Cork city and put them into Mid-Cork.  It is no use his saying that they are all Cork men.  We are all Irish men.  It was he himself who said it.  The Minister said that he had endeavoured to keep to existing administrative boundaries and this is a clear, simple and straightforward case in which he has done precisely the opposite.</P>

      <P>I do not want to hold up the House on this, but I think again I should point out how inconsistent Senator Yeats has been right through the debate.  Earlier he admitted that the city boundaries would have to be breached because both of the three-seaters had gone across the permitted number.  He can now stand up and attempt to try to put it across that in some peculiar way it would be possible not to breach the city boundaries, and that I should have kept them all within the city in some peculiar way.  I do not want to start another debate on this but I want to say that as far as I am concerned, No. 1, they are all Cork people and, No. 2, Fianna Fáil found no difficulty at all in Dublin.  The city boundaries did not seem to matter a whole lot as far as Dublin was concerned. They were prepared to trot over and back across the boundaries but in Cork, because they feel it would suit them in a different way, they want to change them.  I believe the Bill as I have drawn it up is better than what they propose and I am sticking to that.</P>

I want to refer to them again now because he has referred to Dublin and I do so more in patience than in anger.  We have, in our amendments, taken Dublin city, Dún Laoghaire and County Dublin.  The Minister and Senator Halligan can appreciate what we have done here in order to preserve the territorial and administrative integrity of that area and of the county.  We suggested, in a group of amendments, that they be nine three-seat constituencies in metropolitan Dublin, in County Dublin and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am following up the Minister's point.  In regard to Cork city we are following the very same consistent point of principle in which we seek to do as little damage as possible to existing administrative areas.  We adopted this principle in regard to Dublin city, Dublin county and Dún Laoghaire and we are adopting the same principle in regard to Cork city.  What we have suggested, in having the two three-seat constituencies in Cork city, is that the minimum amount of violence be done to the historic though administrative area of Cork city.  By having two three-seat constituencies&mdash;there is no point in talking about anything else except our amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Our amendment proposed that we preserve the administrative area of the county borough of Cork by having two three-seat constituencies.

      <P>I am talking about the county borough of Cork and the entry in the Schedule relating to Cork city.  That five-seat constituency has drawn 25,000 people away from the county borough of Cork to a Mid-Cork constituency to which they bear no relationship.  These citizens of the city of Cork have been removed from the <Col N="1334" /> Minister's five-seat constituency in the Schedule and consigned to a rural constituency with which they have no familiarity, no association and no basic affinity.  We deplore the way this particular part of Ireland has been violated in the naked interests of the present Government Administration.  No rational argument has been advanced against the other excellent amendments we have tabled to this Schedule.  We have sought to put forward logical arguments and, in the absence of any logical answer to our rational arguments, we are driven back to the reluctant belief that a Minister of State is introducing a grossly corrupt, in the political sense, legislative measure designed entirely for narrow party advantage.  Why Cork city should be reduced from six seats to five seats, while metropolitan Dublin has four three-seat constituencies, is something I find incomprehensible.</P>

I would comment in this respect that, in the Dáil, there was no opportunity given to devote any real time to what is the kernel of this matter and adequate discussion is what, with all due respect and thanks to the Chair, the <Col N="1335" /> Seanad ought to be enabled to have. It is imperative that we discuss the enormity of the gerrymander and the enormity of the political corruption involved in the Schedule to this Bill, particularly as the Dáil was deprived of engaging in democratic debate because of the Minister's guillotine.  Due to the Chair, and this House, and due to the responsible attitude adopted by the Leader of this House, we have been enabled to have a rational debate and we have been enabled to go through the Schedule without any attempted filibuster and through our own amendments, group by group.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I got my wife in Ballyshannon.  The original proposal made by the Minister for <Col N="1340" /> Local Government was to draw a line between the town of Ballintra and the town of Ballyshannon.  By so doing he was putting the Fine Gael Deputy who lives in Ballyshannon into the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I outlined Deputy White's reaction to this proposal.  It is not my intention to repeat it here tonight except to say that Deputy White made it crystal clear that he would not accept the original proposal of the Minister for Local Government. As a result it became necessary for the Minister to revise his plans.  In doing so he has put into the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim the townlands of Cavangarden, Cliff and Carrigboy in the former rural district of Ballyshannon.  They are areas that are much closer to the Donegal constituency than the town of Ballyshannon. On the last occasion I pointed out that when one leaves the town of Ballyshannon and drives to Donegal town for the first three miles one is in the Donegal constituency, for the next three miles one is in the Sligo-Leitrim constituency and for the remainder of the journey to Ballintra one is back in the Donegal constituency. But in the village of Ballintra one finds oneself a couple of hundred yards from Sligo-Leitrim.</P>
      <P>In his reply to the Second Stage debate the Minister tried to justify his actions when he said in Vol. 77, col. 1014 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>The boundaries of these areas were drawn up more than 100 years ago.  I can hardly be blamed if these boundaries happen to cross Ballintra road.  I did not draw up electoral division boundaries.  I was not alive 100 years ago.  I can assure Deputy McGlinchey that if he tries some time to get a motion or a resolution passed&mdash;I do not know what it would be exactly&mdash;to straighten out the boundaries of electoral divisions or if he succeeds in getting the Ballintra road moved or the electoral division moved over I certainly will not object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, of course, is complete and absolute nonsense.  The Minister knows in his heart of hearts, but he naturally will not admit it publicly, that in his <Col N="1341" /> initial plan this electoral division that he has put into Sligo-Leitrim was not included&mdash;that is the one I referred to in my amendment.  He knows and the people of Ballyshannon and South Donegal know and, indeed, the local newspaper that published an editorial knows that this zig-zag division was designed for one reason only and that was to keep the town of Ballyshannon in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>I agree that the town of Ballyshannon should be in Donegal but I do not agree that these electoral divisions of Bundoran rural, Carrigboy, Cavangarden, Cliff and the urban districts of Bundoran should be put out of Donegal.  I can assure the Minister that if he were to accept my amendment the person that he would please most of all would be Deputy White.  Any reasonable person would agree with me that the very townland surrounding his own home has been cut up but the position the Minister was in was either to cut Deputy White's throat or his main artery.  Faced with that choice he chose the main artery and he has thus produced a map for a constituency that of all the areas on this map&mdash;and I have studied this map and I have studied all the constituencies throughout the country on this map&mdash;we have nowhere a more blatant example of gerrymandering than here in this small area of South Donegal.</P>

      <P>If Senator Killilea would look at the map and see for himself the line that goes round the town of Ballyshannon crossing the main road as it does, he would have to admit that there is nowhere else in the west of Ireland one could find a more blatant example of gerrymandering than in this area.  It is gerrymandering such as this that could cause trouble in the future.  When I on Second Reading suggested that a bad electoral system such as we have in Sligo-Leitrim and Donegal would be rejected by the people on the streets in the years to come, the Minister tried to suggest that I had said something that I certainly did not say.  In <Col N="1342" /> Volume 77, column 1019 of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
      <P>...if Senator McGlinchey or anybody else thinks that they can upset the decision of Oireachtas Éireann by taking to the streets or using violence, then most certainly they will be condemned by me....</P>
      <P>Of course, the Minister deliberately misrepresented what I said, because I accept&mdash;whether I agree with this legislation or not&mdash;the democratic decision of this House, the democratic decision of a democratic parliament, elected by the Irish people.  However, if I need a lecture on good citizenship, I do not need it from the Minister.  I was not in the Mater Hospital trying to spring prisoners, like some of the Minister's Deputies who support him and his inept Government.  I would suggest to the Minister that if he wants to give a lecture on good citizenship, he should concentrate on his own colleagues in the Labour Party in Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>Never&mdash;that anyone should create a situation of violence in the Irish Republic.  In his reply the Minister stated about the Bally-shannon-Ballintra road that there was a side road used by some of my friends.  I do not know exactly what he meant because I am not aware of the side road.  He said that some friends of Senator McGlinchey used this side road quite a lot.  Around the Border, side roads are used for two purposes: smuggling, on the one hand, and illegal organisations on the other.  I take it that the Minister was referring to one of these two.  I wish to state clearly and categorically in this House that I have never had associations with either of the grouping that the Minister, I think, suggests could use this road.  He was possibly referring to something else.  I believe and have always believed that, no matter which Government are elected, it is the democratically elected government and they alone are responsible for law and order in this nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is trying to imply that I believe anything to the contrary, I want to assure him that he is wrong.  However, that is taking us away from the Ballintra road.  I will not go into the constituency of Donegal again at great length.  We have made our protest that it is wrong that a seat should be taken from that town.  Looking at the map of Ireland, one can see that it is one of the largest constituencies in the <Col N="1344" /> country&mdash;without a doubt, it has the largest acreage.  The action of the Minister and his Government in denying the people of Donegal their just representation will be looked upon by the people of that county as one of the most unjust and despicable acts of the present administration.  I feel sure that when the opportunity presents itself, they will not forget this foul act of the National Coalition Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. The effect of this amendment would be to make all of County Donegal a five-seat constituency.  The population of the county, 108,244, is too high for five seats and too low for six.  The constituency of Donegal as proposed by the Senator is not, therefore, within the permitted tolerance range. The maximum population for five seats would be 105,615.  The proposed figure is 108,244, which is 2,729 too high for a five-seat constituency and there is no point in discussing it further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister, in all seriousness, does he not admit to the House that he could have brought about the results that he now has without drawing a map like a dog's hind legs?  That is a crude way of expressing what he has done.  <i>The Donegal Democrat</i> published a front page blown-up photograph, and Senator McGlinchey referred to an editorial in that newspaper.  These are the people on the ground who are really embarrassed, being so close to Fermanagh.</P>
      <P>The people in Fermanagh and the people who have gerrymandered parts of the North for years are only in the infant class by comparison with what this Schedule demonstrates we are capable of doing in Donegal.  It will be the basis for any argument that the majority could put forward against gerrymandering in the North&mdash;we will have provided them with the basis to defeat the minority in any example of gerrymandering.  Any such argument will be closed up <i>in saecula sæculorum</i> by the very simple example that they have on their doorstep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is scandalous.  I do not think the Minister can sit there in all honesty <Col N="1345" /> and express justification for retaining boundaries as far as possible, putting forward good reasons as to why this was done and that was done in every constituency, and then hold up that map to anyone he expects to have the use of understanding.  It is the most ridiculous piece of draftsmanship.  I am sure he is embarrassed by even the officials who sit beside him.  I say with sincerity that it is a most disgraceful performance by a Minister of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that Senators who have spoken know quite well that there were a dozen different ways in which the line could be drawn. If the people in the North want an example of how gerrymandering could be carried out they do not have to look at this Bill.  They can go back to the Act of 1969.  There was not a darn thing I could do.  Though I have a lot of sympathy with Senator McGlinchey's suggestion that I should keep Donegal in one county it is not possible to do it.  It is as simple as that. Therefore, I do not propose to pursue it any further.</P>

      <P>It would be contrary to what has been laid down.  Senator Yeats made the point that perhaps sometime somebody should draw up a Bill that would be challenged in the High Court and we would find out whether the tolerance we have now is absolute.  I do not propose to be the Minister who will introduce something which I know myself is contrary to what it should be.  Therefore, I do not propose to do this.  I had to take away a portion of Donegal in order to bring it within the tolerance range.  Though Senator McGowan may be right, in saying that it may look ugly, I am sorry if I have upset <i>The Donegal Democrat</i> editor.  The fact is, I had to take a certain number of people out of that constituency.  I did that.  These are the facts.  I say that the amendment is not in order.  It could not be accepted as it is.

      <P>I rise very briefly to oppose this entry.  I do not propose to go over the arguments we have stated already.  I should like, however, to say that this was one of eight four-seat constituencies in the Dublin area, the only one where the Coalition had a majority, the one selected to remain a four-seater, although the sensible thing to have done would have been to make it a five-seater because the population of Dún Laoghaire as it now stands is 98,000, which is exactly right for a five-seater.  But the decision about the four-seat constituency was simply in accordance with the Minister's prevailing practice of arranging of the number of representatives for the constituency in order to suit his own side first.  It is another piece of the general gerrymandering in this Bill, so we propose to oppose this entry in respect of this constituency.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 10, in the second column of the entry relating to the constituency of North Tipperary, to delete all words after &ldquo;district electoral divisions of:&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Graystown, Clonulty East, Gaile, Killenaule, Clogher in the former Rural District of Cashel;</P>
      <P>Buolick, Fenner, Kilcooly, New Birmingham, Poyntstown, Farranrory, Ballyphilip, Crohane in the former Rural District of Slievardagh;</P>
      <P>Curraheen, Glangar, Cappagh in the former Rural District of Tipperary No. 1.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At this late stage I do not propose to detain Senators.  I intend to withdraw amendment No. 20 and deal with amendment No. 19.  After so many other amendments, this amendment may appear to be of little importance but it is of importance to the people of County Tipperary.  There are two county councils in County Tipperary, north and south.  We regard them as the boundaries between Tipperary and Kilkenny and Tipperary and Limerick.  In the last census, the population of the South Riding was 69,228, and of the North Riding 54,337.  In an Electoral Bill some years ago a portion of South Tipperary was transferred to North Tipperary with approximately 5,043 persons.  This brought our population down from 69,000 to 64,185 and increased the population in North Tipperary from 54,000 to 59,380.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has now decided to take a further part of South Tipperary, namely, Farranrory, Ballyphilip, Ballingarry, Modeshil, Crohane, Killenaule, Graystown and Ballysheehan. This amounts to 4,245 in population. By taking these 4,000 from South Tipperary you reduce the population there from 64,185 to 59,940 and you increase the population in North Tipperary to 63,625.  This is merely juggling with an area and makes no difference.  We are suggesting that another small portion of South Tipperary <Col N="1354" /> could be transferred instead to balance the vote more evenly between the two counties.  This would bring Glengar and Cappagh into North Tipperary.  The Minister dug into the heart of South Tipperary; he has come into Cashel and within eight miles of Clonmel.  This is most unfair, in our opinion.  If the Cappagh and Glengar areas were transferred to North Tipperary it would mean 1,448 people, which would give South Tipperary 62,737 and North Tipperary 60,828.  Both constituencies would then have a more even division of population for three Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Minister could state there are three Deputies in North Tipperary and only two in South Tipperary excluding the Ceann Comhairle.  If the Ceann Comhairle came from any other constituency South Tipperary would not be a three-seater; it would be left as a four-seater because otherwise the Labour Party would suffer.</P>

      <P>No matter what changes take place somebody will bring pressure to bear on public representatives to make representations to have other changes.  Senator W. Ryan referred to juggling with figures and areas.  He is doing the same thing. I am not blaming him for this as there was probably pressure from people who did not like being moved, although they are still within County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>His last remarks stating that if the Ceann Comhairle were not from South Tipperary it would be a four-seater constituency surprised me.  As far as I remember, the Ceann Comhairle headed the poll in the last general election.  He would then get the first seat and it would not worry him who got the fourth.</P>

      <P>He headed the poll and that cannot be taken away from him. Everybody in Tipperary should be pleased that they have their own area now and that the portion of Waterford which was stuck on has been taken away.  Only a fool tries to please everybody.</P>
