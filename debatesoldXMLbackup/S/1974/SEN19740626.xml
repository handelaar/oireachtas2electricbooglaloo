      <P>I have notice from Senator West that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House tonight, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The shortage of taxis in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I am accepting that notice and the matter will be taken from 9.30 p.m. to 10 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the matter of Motion No. 13 concerning Northern Ireland.  I raised this same point on the Order of Business on the last two occasions the House met.  I hope that the Leader of the House will arrange to take this motion in the near future and particularly now that the debate is taking place this afternoon in the other House.  I feel, as I said on the previous two occasions, that we are failing in our duty if we fail to take this motion in the very near future and I should like the Leader of the House if he possibly can to give us a date on which this motion could definitely be taken.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to give a date.  I think I should say in all honesty that it seems to me that the fact that the debate is taking place in the other House today would militate against a debate here rather than enhance the prospects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not develop it but it does seem to me that the most generally held view would be that the popularly elected House is discussing it and that is the proper place to discuss questions of this sort. I feel myself that if the Dáil were not discussing the motion on Northern Ireland today there would be a better prospect of an early discussion here.  I have no intimation from the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs that this would weigh against holding a debate here&mdash;I am merely expressing my own view on it.</P>

      <P>I must point out that Senator M.J. O'Higgins was concluding the discussion and while it is possible to put a short question to him it is not in order to continue this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I wish to put is in relation to this absurd idea that because the Dáil is discussing this question the Seanad should not.  This is presuming the idea is that there is no need for the Seanad.  Virtually all legislation is discussed by the two Houses.  This is a new principle which is being introduced: that because a subject of great importance is being discussed by one House it should not be discussed by the other House. There seems to me to be a case here for discussing it rather than not discussing it.  It was discussed in Westminster, in the Assembly, in the Dáil. Why not discuss it here?  For the Leader of the House to take this view is to accept a very considerable and <Col N="531" /> inexplicable demotion of the responsibilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I will be more careful in future about expressing my personal views.  There is no new principle being established. I made it quite clear that I was expressing a personal view which, in deference to Senator Browne's own view, I think is a sensible view.  I do not want to see this House merely becoming a debating society, and to argue that merely because a thing has been discussed elsewhere we are failing in our duty in not discussing it here seems to me to rank this House merely as a debating society.  This House deals with legislation.  It is entitled also to deal with motions.  I do not accept for a moment the argument that because some topic is discussed here, there or anywhere else, it immediately imposes a duty on this House to jump in and discuss it in a kind of debating society atmosphere.</P>

      <P>It is not possible. The position is that the Order of Business is debated by way of proposition and amendment with one speech by each Senator and a conclusion by the Leader of the House or a Senator acting for him.

Whether he gets notice or not he is doing exactly the same as the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach did on another occasion.

      <P>With respect.  Sir, I say you are unfair to Senator West and to Senator Browne.  I intend to question further, in support of Senator West, the motion on Northern Ireland.  Senator West expected the Leader of the House to answer his question before he pursued it further. You encouraged the Leader of the House to make a closing speech on it. This deprived Senators West and Browne and other Senators, including myself, of the chance to debate the motion on Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>It is the duty of this House to uphold the authority of the Chair.  It is regrettable that Senator Browne has adopted this attitude. The Chair waited, as I did, to see if there were any other Senators wishing to contribute to the discussion on the Order of Business before the Chair called on me to conclude.  After pausing and giving every Senator an opportunity to contribute, the Chair called on me to conclude.  I did so and the Chair was not only in order but obliged by the duties of his office to regard the debate as being concluded then.  This is as simple as A, B and C.  It is not correct for Senator Browne or any other Senator to make this sort of accusation against the Chair.  It is to be regretted and I and most Senators would have greater respect for Senator Browne if he withdraws the charge he has made.  If he does not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to make one point.  I do not agree with Senator Browne that you, Sir, were unfair in your attitude.  According to procedure you acted correctly.  The problem has not been caused by you but by the Leader of the House in his unsatisfactory reply to my reasonable request which I had made on two previous occasions.  On one occasion, so far as I can remember, he stated that he was not opposed to holding a debate on the North but that the situation was too critical.  The problem has been caused because the Leader of the House has dismissed what I felt was quite a reasonable request in such a way.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to those major improvements in social welfare which were provided for in the budget in line with the Government's commitment to social reform.</P>
      <P>The Bill includes provisions for increases in rates of assistance and benefits and for significant new schemes designed to broaden the scope and effectiveness of our system of social protection.  These advances represent another stage in the implementation of the Government's undertaking made in the statement of intent, to bring &ldquo;immediate assistance to those in need and lay the foundations of long-term policy that will root out the causes of low income...&rdquo;.  They also continue the work begun in last year's budget and Social Welfare Act in giving effect to the commitment &ldquo;to deal with the plight of the aged, deprived children, the widowed, orphaned and deserted&rdquo; and other groups in need.</P>
      <P>The Government are working systematically towards their declared goal of introducing a truly comprehensive system of social security covering all members of the community. The proposals contained in this Bill thus form part of a coherent programme of reform of the social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This task is a long-term one, in volving as it does review and reform of a vast and complex system which will be charged in the year ahead with the expenditure of almost £300 million and which provides coverage of one kind or another for the great bulk of the population.  I see the provisions of this Bill as a most significant and positive contribution to the <Col N="536" /> evolution of our welfare system, strengthening the foundations upon which the Government can build the necessary structures for the future.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer first of all to the non-contributory old age pensions scheme which caters for so many of our senior citizens and also for blind persons.  The budget proposals included a number of provisions to improve this scheme&mdash;substantial increases in rates of payment, further easing of the means test, the further reduction of the qualifying age for pension from 69 to 68 years and, an important innovation, the payment of allowances for adult dependants who are not themselves entitled to pension.</P>
    <P>Hitherto a pensioner whose wife was not old enough to qualify in her own right for pension did not receive any allowance for her in his pension and many thus suffered a severe drop in income on ceasing to be entitled to unemployment assistance when they reached pensionable age.  The maximum weekly rate of this allowance for an adult dependant will be £3.65. The maximum weekly personal rate of non-contributory old age pension is being increased from £6.15 to £7.30 for persons under age 80 and from £6.65 to £7.85 for those aged 80 and over.  Thus the overall weekly payment for a non-contributory pensioner with a dependent spouse will, at the maximum rates, go up from £6.15 to £10.95 a week, or if the pensioner is 80 or more, from £6.65 to £11.50 a week.</P>
    <P>The further easing of the means test by disregarding the first £5 of assessed weekly means instead of the first £4 as at present will again improve the position of all existing pensioners who have less than the maximum pension and will enable many persons who are at present debarred on grounds of means to qualify for pension.  In addition the reduction in qualifying age from 69 to 68 will bring over 10,000 new pensioners into the scheme.  Blind persons who are not affected by the reduction in pensionable age will benefit from the new rates of pension, the easing of the means test and the new allowance for adult dependants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> Non-contributory widows' pensions are also being improved; the maximum weekly personal rate of pension will be increased from £6.15 to £7.30 and the weekly increases for qualified children are being raised to £2.40. Taken in conjunction with the amounts of a widow's earnings which may already be disregarded in assessing her means, the ignoring of the first £5 of weekly income will further improve the position of a widow who supplements her income by working.</P>
    <P>The new weekly rates and the easing of the means test in the case of widows' non-contributory pensions will apply also to the allowances for deserted wives and unmarried mothers.</P>
    <P>Orphans' non-contributory pensions are also being increased under the Bill&mdash;the increase being 75p which will bring the maximum weekly rate for an orphan up to £4.75.</P>
    <P>The maximum weekly rates of unemployment assistance for persons in urban and rural areas are being increased by £1 per week in the personal rate, with a further 70p where there is an adult dependant.  This will raise the maximum rate for a single person to £6.35 in an urban area and to £6.05 elsewhere: the rate for a married couple will go up to £10.95 in an urban area and to £10.55 elsewhere. The rates for children go up to £1.95 for each of the first two and to £1.50 for each additional child.</P>
    <P>Following the very substantial improvements last year in the general children's allowance scheme we have found it possible this year to make a further improvement.  The rates payable for each qualified child are being increased by 30p a month.  This will bring them up to £2.30 per month for the first child, £3.30 for the second and £4.05 for each additional child. The new monthly rates will therefore be £2.30 for a one-child family, £9.65 for a three-child family and £17.75 for a five-child family.  These rates compare very favourably with the rates payable under the general family allowance scheme in Britain and Northern Ireland, where nothing is paid for a one-child family, £8.23 per <Col N="538" /> month is paid for a three-child family and £16.90 for a five-child family.</P>
    <P>I come to increases in the rates of pensions and short-term benefits under the social insurance system which are set out in some detail in the Bill and the explanatory memorandum. I will refer briefly to some of the main items.  The personal rates of retirement and old age contributory pension for persons under age 80 go up by £1.30 a week to £8.50 and by £1.40 a week to £9.10 for persons aged 80 or over.  The rates of widow's contributory pension, deserted wife's benefit, maternity allowance, flat-rate unemployment and disability benefits and invalidity pension are all being increased by £1.20 a week.  In the case of a recipient of widow's contributory pension who is aged 80 or over the increase will be £1.30 a week.</P>
    <P>The allowances paid with pensions and other benefits in respect of adult dependants and qualified children are being increased also.  Thus a married couple with four children will get £20.80 a week by way of flat-rate unemployment and disability benefit compared with £17.50 at present while a widow with four qualified children will get £18.00 as against £15.20 at present.</P>
    <P>In the case of retirement pensions and contributory old age pensions, a married couple both of whom are aged over 68 will get £15.00 by way of weekly pension or £15.60 if, in addition, the pensioner is aged 80 or over, as against £12.35 and £12.85 respectively at present.</P>
    <P>Pensionable age under the social insurance system is being reduced to 68 years.  This affects not only the qualifying age for old age contributory pension but also the maximum age up to which the short-term benefits such as disability and unemployment benefit can be paid.  Liability for payment of social insurance contributions will, of course, also cease at 68 years instead of 69 as at present.  Because of this the reduction in pensionable age could have undesirable repercussions on some contributory pensions. In order to prevent these there are some special provisions in section 11 <Col N="539" /> of the Bill, including a number of &ldquo;saver&rdquo; clauses, to protect the position of existing pensioners and persons approaching the age of 69 years.</P>
    <P>The extra cost of the improvements in the social insurance services provided for in this Bill must be met by the Social Insurance Fund, which is financed by contributions from employers and insured persons with the Exchequer meeting the annual deficit.  It will be necessary to increase the rates of social insurance contributions payable by employers and insured persons to meet their share of the extra cost.  As announced by the Minister for Finance in his budget statement, employers are being asked as last year to bear a higher proportion of the cost of improvements in view of the further relief which they are getting in their rates liability on industrial and commercial premises.</P>
    <P>A total increase of 60p in the rates of social insurance contributions, which cover all benefits of the social insurance system, is necessary.  I propose in the Bill that the employer should bear 40p of this and the employee 20p.  Increases of less than 60p will be applied to those rates of social insurance contribution which do not cover all the benefits of the system.</P>
    <P>The ordinary rates of social insurance contribution, including the occupational injuries contribution, will thus be increased to £2.98 for men, of which the employer will pay £1.74 and the employee £1.24.  For women the new ordinary rate will be £2.87, of which the employer will pay £1.69 and the employee £1.18.  These rates do not include the health contribution of 15p where that is payable.  Neither do they include the redundancy contributions which are 13p for men and 12p for women, of which the employer pays 10p in each case.</P>
    <P>In line with the improvements in the general social insurance system the Bill also provides for increases in the rates of benefits payable under the occupational injuries scheme.  The increases in weekly rates will broadly be in line with those provided in the <Col N="540" /> general social insurance benefits.  It is not proposed on this occasion to increase the weekly contributions which are payable by employers only to the Occupational Injuries Fund from which the cost of occupational injuries benefits is met.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to make provision in this Bill also for three new schemes to widen and improve the income maintenance services.  The first of these is a scheme of allowances for single women who have attained the age of 58 years.  Many of these women have never been in wage-earning employment because they remained at home as housekeepers and they can no longer be regarded as having a reasonable prospect of securing employment.  Thus they cannot hope to come within the scope of the various social insurance schemes.  The new scheme will be non-contributory and subject to a means test and the allowance will be paid in the form of a pension, the maximum rate being the same as the urban rate of unemployment assistance.  The means test to be applied will be broadly on the same lines as for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The second new scheme will provide a social assistance allowance for the wives of prisoners serving sentences of not less than six months. This scheme will be parallel to the schemes of allowances for deserted wives and unmarried mothers.  The rate of allowance payable to a prisoner's wife will be the same as the rate of widow's non-contributory pension which would be payable to her if she were a widow and there will be appropriate increases in respect of qualified children.</P>
    <P>The third new scheme is designed to help the family of a social welfare beneficiary who dies leaving an adult dependant.  Inevitably in such cases there is an immediate drop in the family income and thus the stress and hardship which are occasioned by a family bereavement are aggravated. To alleviate the plight of the dependants in these cases it is proposed that, where a person who is receiving benefit, including an increase in respect of an adult dependant, dies, payment of <Col N="541" /> the benefit will continue to be made for six weeks to the surviving adult&mdash; normally the widow.  As a corollary to this proposal it is also proposed that title to the appropriate widow's or orphan's pension which would be payable to the survivor will not commence until after the six-week period has expired, but regulations may modify this to save an individual from loss where the appropriate pension is greater than the benefit paid.</P>
    <P>Detailed conditions of these new schemes will be prescribed in regulations.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes provision for a number of miscellaneous improvements in the social welfare code.  The first relates to widows of retirement pensioners.  At present the widow of an old age contributory pensioner is awarded a widow's contributory pension on the death of her husband without further reference to insurance records and I propose to extend this provision to the widows of retirement pensioners.  This automatic entitlement will simplify procedure and expedite the award of pension to these widows.</P>
    <P>In last year's Act widows, deserted wives and unmarried mothers who were receiving pensions or allowances as such under one or other of the Department's schemes were relieved of the liability to pay the employee's share of the social insurance contribution when working.  I propose in the Bill to extend this concession to working widows receiving widow's pension under the occupational injuries benefit scheme or from a member state of the EEC.</P>
    <P>Provision is included in the Bill for some improvements in the scheme of deserted wife's benefit which are designed to bring it more closely into line with the widow's contributory pension scheme on which it is based. The first of these will enable a prescribed relative allowance to be paid to an incapacitated recipient of deserted wife's benefit who is over pensionable age and requires full-time care and attention.  The second improvement will allow a person who can qualify for both deserted wife's benefit and non-contributory old age <Col N="542" /> pension to draw only the deserted wife's benefit except where the rate of non-contributory old age pension is greater, in which event the pension only will be paid.  The third is concerned with the contribution conditions for deserted wife's benefit which are somewhat more stringent than those for widow's (contributory) pension. I propose to bring the contribution conditions of both schemes into line and, as a result of this change, a deserted wife will have a better chance of qualifying for the maximum benefit.</P>
    <P>There are some minor provisions in the Bill, one to relax the waiting days requirement for unemployment assistance in certain cases and the others of a technical nature to clarify the position arising out of the introduction of pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>All the improvements proposed in the Bill are to come into operation at the beginning of July next or on the first pay-day in July.  The substantial nature of these improvements can to a certain extent be measured by their cost.  On the social assistance side, which includes children's allowances, it is estimated that the increase in cost to the Exchequer will be £26.23 million in a full year and £13.12 million in the current financial year up to the end of December, 1974.  On the social insurance side, the gross increase in expenditure from the social insurance fund is estimated at £21.93 million in a full year, of which £17.92 million will be met by increased contribution income leaving just over £4 million to be borne by the Exchequer in a full year and some £2 million in the current year.  The total cost for the full year will therefore be £48.16 million.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure, therefore, in recommending the Bill to Seanad Éireann for speedy and favourable consideration.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar an gcéad dul síos fáiltiú roimh an mBille seo ar son na ndaoine ar an dtaobh seo den Tí.  Tá athas orainn go bhfuil dul chun cinn déanta ann.  Tuigtear dom gur fadó a thosaigh an Pharlaimint seo chun feabhas a chur ar slí bheatha na ndaoine a bhí breoithe, gortaithe <Col N="543" /> nó aosta.  Do dhein gach Aire iarracht an rud sin a chur chun cinn agus a leanúint go dtí go mbeidh sort cothroime againn idir na daoine go bhfuil an sláinte go maith acu agus na daoine nach bhfuil ar fónamh, na daoine nach bhfuil ábalta obair a fháil agus obair a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is good legislation. People who enjoy good health always welcome any measure which is designed to help those who do not enjoy good health, whether through incapacitation, old age or extreme youth.  A Government should ensure, no matter where they get the money, that people who are unable to fend for themselves are assisted so that they have a reasonable standard of living. All social legislation should be designed with that aim in view.</P>
      <P>Because of our improved health services and the reduction in the qualifying age limit we will have an even greater number of old age pensioners.  Eventually the qualifying age will be 65.  People who have given service to the community but who were not insured in their employment should not be in want in their old age.  In the past Governments have tried to provide them with some little sustenance which would make them independent in their later years.  Very many old people find themselves in hospitals, homes and other institutions. While they have every facility as regards health services there, their existence can be lonely.  They should have some money of their own which they could spend in whatever way pleased them.  The Government should ensure that the old age pension will not be taken from them.  These people have worked hard during their lives. They may be able to derive some consolation by spending their old age pensions as they like.  It is unfair that in order to maintain institutions old people should be made give up their pensions.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to convey this request to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem which was mentioned was that of unemployment assistance.  Principally because of our <Col N="544" /> geographical situation, the areas of greatest employment are along the east and south coasts.  Consequently in many other areas the people must depend on unemployment assistance.  These people are not happy with the situation.  They have welcomed schemes which were designed to bring industrialists to the western seaboard and so provide employment.  It is difficult for a Government to persuade industrialists to set up industries in places where it may not be profitable to do so.  Increased incentives should be made available. The largest cities and ports are on the east coast.  It is difficult to get industrialists to set up elsewhere but the situation has been remedied gradually at Shannon and in the south.  Any measure which will help to reduce the number of people receiving unemployment assistance would be beneficial both to the individual and to the nation as a whole.  This assistance is regarded as a social stigma.  The people in receipt of this assistance would much prefer to have a job.</P>
    <P>The problems of widows were also mentioned.  Very often women are widowed early in life.  They may have large families.  We should give them whatever financial assistance we can.</P>
    <P>Children's allowances were also mentioned. These terms have become household words over the last nine or ten years.  I remember a time when there was no social benefits in existence except the old age pension.  That was followed by unemployment assistance. The introduction of these other benefits is a step in the right direction.  The introduction of children's allowances was important.  If there is no incentive to parents to rear families there will be no people in the country.</P>
    <P>We should all do our best to ensure that our young people have all possible facilities.  They are the men of the future, the builders of our nation and the people we look to to carry on where we have left off.  We should try to ensure that they have better houses, roads and educational facilities.  Governments should be concerned about the financial state of people who have large families in this country.  It would be deplorable if the nation did not recognise that schools, colleges or other <Col N="545" /> institutions would be unnecessary if there were not young people coming along.  It is only right that the nation should try to give to these people as liberally as our finances will allow to ensure they will get a good start in life.</P>
    <P>In the past many children have been both mentally and physically handicapped to such an extent that it has cost the nation a great deal of money to have them maintained in institutions and hospitals in an effort to remedy defects which possibly could have been remedied when the children were young had the finances been available at that time.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made here, too, to ensure that these general allowances will be paid to the mother or to the father.  It is important that the role of the mother should be recognised in the family.  As we all know, the mothers of Ireland have a very hard life.  They have to devote many of their years to rearing children.  There is no substitute for the mother in the home.  This has been proved time and again where mothers have gone out to work and employed somebody else to look after the children.  It is not fair to deprive children of their mother at an early age.</P>
    <P>In most cases the mother should receive the children's allowance.  She spends most of her time with the children.  They are more influenced by the mother than by the father. The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world.  The mother plays a tremendously important part in the home. It would be degrading and wrong if a Government insisted on paying the children's allowance to the father rather than to the mother.</P>
    <P>These are small administrative difficulties that may have arisen in the past.  It is only right that they should be tidied up now, especially when we so recently had a discussion on the rights of women in general in society and in the world.</P>
    <P>Senators on all sides of the House will certainly welcome everything that the Government, the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have been doing to broaden and strengthen our social welfare fabric.  At the same time I respectfully submit that it is not enough.  When we compare the <Col N="546" /> increases which have been given now with the realities of the situation in this country at present we find, without doing any elaborate addition or subtraction, without a degree in higher mathematics, that the cost of living immediately eats up anything that has been granted.  I do not mean any disrespect to the Parliamentary Secretary. Since the value-added tax was introduced money is flowing into the Exchequer.  The higher the price the greater is the return to the Exchequer. No effort has been made to stem the increase that has taken place in the price of every single commodity that goes into the home at present.</P>
    <P>I would be the first to admit that no Government has any particular control over the price of oil, rubber and a few commodities which are imported. I would be fair in an argument such as that and say they did their best in the circumstances.  In the case of food, for instance, the loaf has been made smaller and dearer. The price of clothing is going beyond the reach of most people at present. When we have reached the situation where a suit of clothes is costing more than a fat bullock it is time for somebody to sit back and find out what is the real benefit of this well-intentioned legislation.  When we look at what the housewife has to pay for sugar, tea, soap and various things like that, which have to be bought every day in homes in Ireland where there are families, and even where old age pensioners are living by themselves, I cannot see that any benefit whatever can be derived from any of these social welfare increases.  Were they fortunate enough to break even in many of these cases these families would find that whatever little they had left over would go towards ESB bills.  Some improvements are being made.  People are being converted to the idea of a social welfare code which any developing nation should have to assist its less fortunate citizens.  A much greater effort will have to be made if we are to convince any of our people who are receiving these allowances that there is really any benefit whatever in the increases that have been granted.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for people on this <Col N="547" /> side of the House to criticise.  Those who are sitting on the far side have already learned that to their regret. At one time they were very vocal regarding prices and the ability of Government to change these things overnight, and so on.  I am sure that as a result of being in office for a while they have found out that it is not as easy to do these things as they said then.  I do not want to make anything more difficult for them.  I only want to state the bare facts which are known to everybody in this country from Cork to Donegal.  The price of cattle here has slumped completely. Yet the housewife has to buy meat at three times the price it was some years ago.  There are not any parades up and down the city now about the price of meat.  I remember the time when housewives were marching as far as Leinster House in Dublin city with flags raised.  The situation is much worse today and there does not seem to be a word about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is dwelling rather too much on details in regard to prices.  They are certainly relevant in so far as they affect the person's benefiting under the Bill but it would not be appropriate to develop the debate into a full-scale debate on prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was quite relevant to mention prices in passing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely pointing out that prices are very relevant to any increases in social welfare benefits. We know that these benefits are being paid.  We know that to many of them the recipients themselves have to make a contribution.  That is true in regard to unemployment benefit. In all cases the people who receive benefits have to make a contribution to general taxation.  Consequently when prices increase it is bringing in more money.  It means that whatever cheque a man is getting is less attractive and of less value.  Every time that money decreases in value it affects the social welfare recipient. <Col N="548" /> I am afraid that there are far too many people in this country at present in various spheres of life who have not even yet realised that we are thinking in terms of the old penny. We should realise that there are now only 100 pennies in the pound instead of 240.  When we talk of increases in the prices of food or clothing by a few pence we must realise that each of these pence is the one-hundredth part of a pound note and that there is a very big difference today in the meaning of the word &ldquo;penny&rdquo; compared with some years ago.</P>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, on all occasions leaned over backwards to try to improve the social legislation and the social benefits that would go to those who were in need of them. We pioneered a whole series of social welfare legislation.  There may have been some tidying up operations to do subsequently but we provided the finances for this.</P>
      <P>I know and all of us know that money is flowing in to the Exchequer without any effort whatever.  Some of it came in last year from savings that resulted from our membership of the EEC and it has been flowing in this year because of VAT.  In other words, the tap is all the time turned on. Consequently it should be our aim to try to make these figures more realistic. I am not blaming the Parliamentary Secretary because when he drafted this Bill these figures might have been realistic but they are now changing from day to day.  What might look very attractive today may by tomorrow be completely eroded by a new increase in some very essential commodity to some of the widows or old age pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I should like to raise is the matter of persons who are taking care of old age pensioners. When the provision to make available an allowance to these people was introduced it was necessary for the person getting an allowance to be a female relative in order to qualify. Perhaps this has been amended in some way since.  I should like to see this scheme re-examined again if at all possible.  I know of cases in <Col N="549" /> my constituency and in other areas where people are reluctant to go into institutions.  There may be a lot of talk about psychiatric units and various other types of homes for aged people.  I do not think that these places constitute the best environment for these people.  I know it is not possible for all people to stay at home but there are many people who would like to stay in their own homes and in their own surroundings.  Indeed, many of them are doing so, although they are suffering because of this.  But they do not wish to go into these institutions.</P>
    <P>This is not any reflection on the people who run the institutions.  They are very good people who do tremendous work.  The hospitals and institutions are clean and well kept and the staff working there are efficient and courteous but there is always some loneliness involved for a person who is taken from his own surroundings and moved to some other area.  He finds himself in another world completely. While everything may be good there, the most essential thing is lacking: the bit of homeliness which cannot be substituted no matter what is done or what is given to him.  The best place to keep him, if he is willing to stay, is in his own home.  I expect this would be a little more costly.  I admit that we would have to keep the other institutions in operation, that such facilities as central heating would have to be provided and that staff would have to be paid.  It would be a problem for the Minister to try to get around this in some way and to try to help these people and their relatives who would be willing to take care of them.  The local nurse may be willing to help but it would be necessary to have somebody residing with them.  There is some difficulty regarding the insurance of a relative engaged in taking care of an aged person but this could be ironed out.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has been working hard and has increased benefits across the board but these increases are being eroded because of increases in the cost of living.  That is a problem for the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is difficult to <Col N="550" /> criticise.  It contains many aids to help the family.  It could well be considered a pilot project towards the elimination of poverty.  At least, it is geared towards building structures that would eventually lead to the elimination of poverty.</P>
      <P>I am not naive enough to think that this would solve a lot of the problems of poverty.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary would be amused if I even suggested that.  At the same time, you cannot take one area in isolation and say that something extra could have been given there.</P>
      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, the Government have made the decision to introduce a truly comprehensive system of social services. This Bill is a step in the right direction.  One cannot just dip into the purse and take exactly what is needed under one specific heading at the expense of something else.  When there is a range of subjects of family aids such as we have here one must be conscious of how much can be given. The Parliamentary Secretary must work within the terms of the budget, for his Department.  The extension here of the social services is to be lauded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, realising that people sometimes have difficulty in ascertaining what are their entitlements, have decided to support the establishment and operation of the citizens advice bureaux, where information offices similar to those now in operation in the Department of Social Welfare can help to ensure that each citizen will not be deprived of his rights.  This is important when one is dealing with legislation like this because I have had many cases&mdash; any other representative around my place will verify it&mdash;of people who come to me who do not know exactly what they are entitled to or what their rights are.  When we have a Bill like this, where the range of things it covers is set out, we can be of greater assistance.  When somebody says a Social Welfare Bill has been introduced or has been passed, you can definitely say it is a Social Welfare <Col N="551" /> Bill because of the range of family aids it contains.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on one or two of the sections.  Section 2 deals with old age pensions&mdash;new rates, extension of means limits and new allowances for adult dependants.  I wish to cover one particular point on this. I do not know whether it is relevant to this particular section but I will be guided by the Chair.  The age of qualification for old age pensions has been dropped to 68 years.  I refer to people who were in outside employment, where their pension was made up by having so much from the company and then built up to two-thirds with the social welfare benefit. When the money loses its value the person who might be making some sort of gain is, in fact, at a bit of a loss on balance, depending on the type of pension system he is working within.  I am not making a case for somebody who has a good pension system with automatic adjustments and no abatement. I am speaking directly about the effect of abatement on pensions under that particular section.  I do not know if there is any way you can tell an employer that he cannot abate State benefit, particularly in the case of non-contributory pension.  It is something worth thinking about.</P>
    <P>The other point I wish to discuss is the widows' non-contributory pension. This has been a great social evil for many years.  Through negligence on the part of the husband, indifference on the part of the family in general, ignorance on the part of the woman involved, many people have suffered for years.  I have experience of many people being in the position where they had to have things explained to them. They could never understand why somebody who lived on the other side of the house could get the widows' contributory pension while they were getting none.  Again this is where the citizens advice bureau comes in.  This is a great thing not only in the sense that somebody can advise them well on their problems and that they have somewhere to go, but also in the sense that it has a recognised value now.  It is something of a right to the person. <Col N="552" /> Section 6 deals with the question of children's allowances.  The idea of making it payable to the wife was a stroke of genius.  Speaking as an ordinary guy, there was a very funny name put on this allowance on the occasion that a fellow was short of a few bob.  When he thought it was coming round to the time for the allowance he was generally able to say &ldquo;Well, I will have a few bob tonight.&rdquo;  The husband by and large laid claim to this allowance and many of the wives did not benefit from it.  It is very good not only to see it converted into the wife's name but also to see the additional improvement in it.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with old age (care) allowance.  Here there was a question of pride, where people would not ask for assistance.  This allowance, linked with the citizens advice bureau, can eliminate the pride that made people suffer.  They will begin to recognise their rights.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the single woman's allowance.  Here again&mdash;in a strike situation, for example&mdash;the single person very often had no income. Many people had husbands working or they had some income from some member of the family.  But many single women, who had gone on a bit and were not looking towards marriage, very often had nothing to look forward to.  They had no widows' pension or no dependant allowances.  This is a very good piece of social legislation.</P>
    <P>In section 9 we see another step in the evolution of the welfare system. The wife to a great extent was placed in the situation that her husband was punished but the actual nature of the punishment her husband got became punitive on the family, apart from the stigma.  They were placed in a position where they had no right to an allowance or it was not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>With regard to the new rates of occupational injuries benefit, a lot of people were in employment where they were afraid to take action against their employers.  I am not giving the present Government the credit for the introduction of this particular provision. I am just drawing attention to it and pointing out that there is an <Col N="553" /> evolving situation here.  The benefit is growing and the value of that benefit is growing.  The position was that when people had an accident at work they were afraid to take an action against their employers.  They were afraid they would be dismissed or it would place their job in jeopardy. Many people are maimed or incapacitated to some degree.  For total incapacity there is some sort of redress, but where a man has lost a finger or the joint of a thumb and where it has placed him in a position where he has to take on a lesser job, or a job where there is a diminution of the responsibility which he previously had, he was afraid to take an action.  With this new occupational injuries benefit not only is he safe enough, but even after he resumes work he can still obtain the occupational injuries benefit. This is of great value.  He is still in a position which does not debar him from taking action against his employer.</P>
    <P>There was a time when an employer could not be sued if an employee was involved in an accident.  The Fianna Fáil Government introduced legislation in which there was another obstacle.  As there was no occupational injuries benefit there was a problem in that an employee might be afraid to take action against a company for fear of involving a fellow-worker.</P>
    <P>Not only is this scheme directed towards helping the family but it includes other aspects of working life. I should like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for introducing this legislation.  It is a great step towards a proper social welfare system, particularly in view of the need for developing towards EEC conditions.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary in his reply to give some particulars on the question of pensions.</P>
    <P>The waiting period for unemployment assistance caused much hardship in the past.  I am pleased that that situation has been eased.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to welcome the Bill.  While we would like to see greater improvements, we <Col N="554" /> are all conscious of the high cost involved. The bill presented by the Minister for improvements this year is £48 million, of which £30 million is contributed by the State.  The improvements effected in the Bill amount to approximately a 20 per cent increase.  Inflation during the year has been running at 13 per cent and this leaves a 5 per cent or 6 per cent real increase in the social welfare system.  While accepting that many of us would like to see more done on this, this is a case where specially designated taxation could make a real contribution.  We have in mind the growing drink problem, with the high expenditure of £130 million.  All would join in supporting the Government if there were special taxes on drink to make specific contributions towards improving the social welfare code over and above the relatively pedestrian increases we can make out of existing funds.</P>
      <P>This would contribute in some way towards putting a curb on the spending on drink and on other similar expenditure. We have suggested this in the past, and the Parliamentary Secretary may be able in future legislation to see if specific increased taxation of this kind could be introduced to cover the improvements which would be made in the social welfare system.  The increase for an old age pensioner with a dependent spouse from £6.15 up to £10.95 is substantial, yet with increased prices the position where two elderly people are living on less than £11.00 per week is not enviable.  The increase which has been made in that connection this year should be continued in the years ahead.  Our senior citizens must have their burdens eased and life made more pleasant for them in their declining years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government could do more in easing the means test.  The easing which has been done&mdash;£4 to £5 per week&mdash;does little more than keep pace with the devaluation of money.  A substantial easement could be made there.  Even if a couple have £10 per week between them on that limit, added to the £10 that is given, it does not make it a princely income per <Col N="555" /> week.  I should like to see in the coming year a spectacular improvement in that figure.</P>
    <P>There should be instructions given to those investigating means and so on that they should not be over-rigorous in their pursuit of those concerned. This has a psychological effect on people and the investigation should be as humane as possible.  At that stage elderly people are not in a position to cope with an in-depth investigation and are frightened.  Even if this means that some elderly couples will get away with a few pounds per week on the means test, so what.  We should not spend State funds in trying to prevent that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increases which have been granted in unemployment reliefs. I should like to know if there is any way of accepting partial employment &mdash;in other words one day's work per week.  It would encourage the unemployed to do certain jobs if it were accepted that up to a certain level those jobs would not count.  That might be difficult to administer, but it may be worth bearing in mind.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that these increased payments will commence from 1st July this year.  Many times in the past we have complained about the fact that these payments commenced from the 1st August, whereas the better off and more privileged sections usually get wage increases from 1st June and earlier in many cases.</P>
    <P>We have been told that the increased payments cannot be made earlier because of administrative difficulties but I have asked in the past and I ask again now that the concept of lump sum back payments be brought in.  I accept that the machinery may not permit making a payment before 1st July&mdash;indeed, I do not mind if it is as late as 1st August&mdash;but the increases should be backdated to some earlier time, say, 1st June or earlier and, in addition to getting the small increase in the allowance in the first week, the old age pensioner would get a very welcome lump sum.  It would be a lump sum that a person in that category would not be able to gather together from his or her own resources. <Col N="556" /> In the case of a pensioner who would get a £4.50 increase, if the increase was backdated for two months, it would amount to £40 and £40 means a great deal to an old age pensioner. I would ask that in future&mdash;it would not be necessary to strain the administrative system in trying to cope with the increase on 1st July&mdash;the increase would date from 1st June and a small lump sum would be given with it. Let that become a feature of all our social welfare payments.  That would be a very humane and very worthwhile addition.</P>
    <P>I welcome what has been done.  I know, irrespective of what Government are in power, that the impetus to provide better social welfare payments will continue and will have the support of all citizens.  The real support we can give is to contribute through taxes on luxury goods to making positive increases under this heading.</P>

      <P>I think it would be very remiss of us on this side of the House if we were not to welcome this Bill constituting, as it does, the embodiment of the Government's commitment to the alleviation of poverty which was given such prominence in their statement of intent.  It would particularly ill become Members of this party if we were not to pay tribute to the Government as a whole, particularly to the Tánaiste and his Parliamentary Secretary.  The response last weekend to the Parliamentary Secretary's speech in the Dáil adequately puts his own personal commitment and that of the Government on the poverty question in a proper light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the fact that we are in a situation of continuing high inflation, and in some respects hyper-inflation, this should not permit us, even from the point of view of being critical, to hide the point that the increases in social welfare payments in general contribute a real increase in economic terms.  Speaking from memory, I think the increases ranged on average from 27 per cent to 37 per cent.  Even taking the last 12 months, the rise in the consumer price index has been in the region of 16 per cent.  In real <Col N="557" /> terms the increases in social welfare payments have not only compensated but have added as much again.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, when giving a Press conference on this matter subsequent to the budget, gave us the benefit of a comparison of the various percentage increases with the consumer price index.  Perhaps he might wish to do so again in view of some of the remarks that were made earlier.  I should like to comment very briefly on three of the new provisions that have been introduced in this Bill and which characterise the sensitivity and imagination which has been so evident in social welfare legislation over the past 15 months.  It has given particular pleasure to many people to see included for the first time the category of the single woman, who will now be given a pension which will become operative at a period of ten years less than the old age pension.  I presume the age limit for that category will keep in step with the diminution of the qualification age for old age pensions.</P>
    <P>I welcome, too, the inclusion for the first time of the wives of long-term prisoners and their children.  It is a remarkable thing that we are now beginning to develop a philosophy of the right of the wife to an income from the State whenever the husband, for one reason or another, is not in a position to look after her welfare and the welfare of the children. Clearly in the cases of widowhood, unemployment, desertion and here also in the case of the husband being unable to provide for his wife because of imprisonment, we have enlarged significantly on this philosophy. In the case of desertion we have made it something against which insurance is taken out by virtue of the fact that a deserted wife can get the equivalent of the contribution benefit.  I welcome this extension to include the wives and children of prisoners.  Lastly, we have the inclusion for the first time of the adult dependants of non-contributory old age pensioners who are themselves not of pensionable age.</P>
    <P>As a central feature of this Bill we have also the continuation of the <Col N="558" /> Government's commitment to lower the old age pension age to 65 years by bringing it down by one more year this year to 68.  However I wonder if, in bringing the age down eventually to 65 and taking it in conjunction with the introduction of pay-related social welfare benefits, we are approaching the point where serious consideration will have to be given to the fully comprehensive social security system which has been mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary, particularly in relation to pay-related pensions.  That may be some distance away in the future but it is obviously a question that is beginning to loom very large now in the context of the pattern and network of social security benefits which we have now evolved.  We are reaching the point where the more obvious gaps have been closed by the sensitive and imaginative approach of the last two budgets and where we begin to see that the existing structure is in itself not sufficient and must be replaced with a structure that is more fully comprehensive.</P>
    <P>The means test has been eased somewhat further but it is the only point on which I would direct with some trepidation a modest criticism in the direction of the Parliamentary Secretary.  The increase from £4 to £5 more or less keeps pace with rises in wages and salaries.  It is, in fact, an increase of 25 per cent and constitutes a slight improvement.  I know the difficulty here is the lack of statistics and one does not know precisely how many people would come within the net if one increases the means test up to £7, £8, £9 or £10 a week.  It was a very courageous lead in the dark in the first instance to go from zero to £4 a week.  It would not only be of interest but of great sociological value if we could have pushed the means test that bit further up the income ladder.  Perhaps in the next budget it might be given more prominence in terms of improvement than was the case in the last budget and in this Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the central features of last year's Bill and of this Bill has been its concern for children.  In last year's <Col N="559" /> Social Welfare Act there was the commitment to giving the child dependants larger allowances for the one-parent family.  Again on this occasion there are increases in children's allowances: I think it is the first time in the history of the State that children's allowances have been increased in two Acts.  Perhaps greater emphasis and consideration could be given to the problem of the large family.  Poverty to a great extent is concentrated not only in low-income families but also in families of large size, even where the income is of average or mid-average level.  It might be possible to direct increases for the child dependants specifically to the children beyond the third and, even if that were not financially possible at this stage, ultimately to the fourth and fifth subsequent children so as to take into account the very real problems that exist in larger families.  This should apply not only to children's allowances but also right across the board to all other benefits and allowances for which children are eligible.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary at one stage quite correctly pointed out that the rates to which he was referring were flat rate benefits.  It brought to my mind his very welcome reference last week to a possible reform of the home assistance scheme.  There is a possibility therefore that in some future Bill we shall see the full development and embodiment of a family income supplement scheme.  In any system such as this it is inevitable that there can be rigidities which may be born of bureaucratic necessity.  I am not criticising or disputing that; it is necessary to be very careful when one is disbursing public moneys.  However we all recognise that there are occasions when speed, sensitivity to the needs of an individual or of a family, call for something above and beyond what is laid down and which can be applied without a great deal of imagination.  A projected reform of home assistance offers us this hope that what is required in certain circumstances in terms of humanity will be done quickly and speedily. <Col N="560" /> In that regard I should like to add my voice to that of Senator Harte, who spoke about the importance of information centres.  The Parliamentary Secretary himself has been responsible for getting across the point that it is not sufficient for people to have rights: they must also be made aware of them. I agree with him not only in terms of their importance but in an appeal that these information centres should constitute a new departure in Government architecture and in the whole approach to the use of governmental offices, by being sited in places amongst the most important of any town or city.  They should not be placed in the existing complexes of Government buildings, in side streets, or in inaccessible places. In fact they should be placed right in the very heart of our cities and towns and should be imaginatively planned, attractive in themselves and should in no way interfere with or minimise the dignity of the people entering those places because they are getting their just desserts and what society has laid out for them.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I should like to welcome the new trend, which is again embodied in this Bill, of greater contribution coming from the employer to the social insurance fund.  It has been a feature of our social insurance system and that of the British that the State made a contribution far above and beyond what was commonplace on the Continent. Of course this was with the corollary that our social welfare benefits were much less than what they are on the Continent and in other developed Western countries.  Therefore this particular development of the ratio of two to one is to be encouraged. I hope that it will be explored even further in view of the fact that businesses, industrial and commercial, have been relieved of a very substantial body of costs by the continued removal of the health and housing subsidies from the rates.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, this Bill is the embodiment of the Government's commitment to the elimination of poverty.  It is a subject that does not generate a great deal of public interest or of political interest.  The attendance in this House is in itself <Col N="561" /> evidence of that.  We could all easily bring to mind other subjects that would evoke larger audiences and more contributions.  Yet we are talking of approximately one quarter of our population who suffer real deprivation every single day.  We are trying to create attitudes whereby all of us make a contribution to the diminution of that evil.  It is not simply the supposed 5 per cent who dispose of, or own, three-quarters of our wealth who are called upon to make the contribution: the other 70 per cent and the middle, too, have to make it through taxation.</P>
    <P>In this Bill and in the general framework of the budget we have begun to see political expression of what I hope will be a much wider public commitment now to make a real and genuine effort to eliminate poverty, to admit that it is there, to admit that one has a personal responsibility to end it, and to admit too that one has a responsibility, irrespective of one's political outlook, to support any Government initiative or any Government measure such as this that will go some distance towards eliminating it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally when anything concerned with social welfare comes before the Houses of the Oireachtas it brings an awareness to a public representative of the thoughts he should have in regard to the underprivileged and the poorer sections of the community.  When increases are brought about in benefits in the social welfare code itself, naturally they are to be applauded.  On the other hand, particularly in regard to the increases that have been brought about through this legislation, we have to compare the increases with what benefit they will bring to the individuals concerned. We are all well aware of the very high inflation at present.  Indeed since those increases were announced there has been a steady growth in inflation and in the cost of living.  We must, therefore, relate that situation to the benefits that will accrue to the recipients of those increases.  The figures given here today for the percentage increase in social welfare <Col N="562" /> benefits against the percentage increase in the cost of living cannot be reconciled in the present situation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increase but I should like to know what real benefit will accrue to social welfare recipients through this particular Bill&mdash;it will be very small.  With the continuing increase in the cost of living further increases will be required in 12 months' time.</P>
      <P>We are well aware that there was £30 million available to the Government for the provision of those social welfare increases.  This was wisely spent in trying to improve the lot of the underprivileged.  In this budget the increases given are not in line with the increases given last year.  The recipients will not benefit as much as they did previously because there was not as much money made available for social welfare increases.</P>
      <P>When we speak of social welfare beneficiaries we think of old age pensioners along with all the other categories. The reduction in the qualifying age is welcome.  From now on we will have more contributory pensioners. Non-contributory pensioners will be decreasing.  I do not like nor can I understand why there is the discrepancy between contributory and non-contributory pensions in an overall sense.  A non-contributory pensioner should get the same amount as a contributory pensioner.  Those involved in public life should endeavour to have the distinction between contributory and non-contributory categories abolished.  Social welfare recipients should be on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>This discrepancy exists also in unemployment assistance, where there is the social welfare benefit versus the social welfare assistance.  The person who qualifies for social welfare assistance is more underprivileged than the person who qualifies for social welfare benefit.  The allowances should be equal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, in regard to widow's pensions, there is also a variation.  Most women qualify for a non-contributory pension but very few, especially in rural areas, qualify for a contributory pension.  Widows who have non-contributory <Col N="563" /> pensions are being deprived of their benefits.  The Government should introduce legislation to make contributory and non-contributory widows' pensions equal.</P>
    <P>The increases in children's allowances in this Bill are very insignificant. The underprivileged are again being neglected in this category.  The increase is in the region of 7½ new pence and in 1974 this is very insignificant. The Minister could have done much better.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has made some new additions to the scope of social welfare such as the single woman's allowance.  A single woman qualifies at 58 years of age for this benefit.  The woman who would qualify for this allowance would have been entitled to a home assistance previously.  Home assistance allowances should be abolished and the beneficiaries brought within the scope of the social welfare code. It is the very poor people who qualify for home assistance.  They have to queue up and wait for the office to give them a very small amount of money which is supposed to keep them going from week to week.  The fact that the Parliamentary Secretary has introduced this scheme to help the single woman who does not have much money to qualify for social welfare allowance is a step in the right direction.  Eventually, I hope the home assistance allowance can be the same as the social welfare benefit. I would sincerely ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this matter and arrange for these benefits to be paid by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>We cannot give deserted wives too much help.  I know of one particular case and when I got in touch with the Department it seemed that such a person did not qualify for the deserted wife's allowance until a six-month period had elapsed and proof had come before the Department that the woman was actually a deserted wife. In the meantime the poor woman who finds herself in that position has to settle for a very small sum of money. <Col N="564" /> Naturally the home assistance officer comes to her aid.  Some arrangement could be brought about to quicken the payment to such a woman.  It is something the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary could look into very deeply.  The home assistance allowance is very much more than what the same woman would qualify for as a deserted wife's allowance.</P>
    <P>Extension of the means allowance for widows' pensions and for non-contributory old age pensions is to be welcomed, but here again the extension of the means limit is very insignificant when we take into consideration the present inflationary period we are going through.  I doubt very much if the extension given is enough.  I would hope that whichever Minister for Social Welfare will be in power when the next budget comes before the Dáil will see to it that by degrees he will do away with this means test in regard to widows' pensions and non-contributory old age pensions.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I welcome the increase but I doubt very much if the recipients will benefit from them.  This is the big problem and it is a problem that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will have to take into account.  When increases are made we always look at the past year in regard to increases and say what those increases can do. When we look at the past year we can see the steep increases in the cost of living and the inflation that has taken place and is taking place at the present time and more than likely will take place during the coming 12 months.  The allowances as they stand even at present will be of very little use to those people at the end of this year.  I conclude on the note that while I welcome the increases I doubt very much if the underprivileged, the poorer sections of the community, have benefited much from the proposals in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak briefly on this Bill.  In common with the other Members of the House, I welcome the principle behind it, which is to increase the rates of benefits for people who are due for social welfare <Col N="565" /> and also to widen the categories of those who qualify.  I think we have something to be proud of in that through our own efforts and with making use of our increased prosperity in this part of the country we have managed to raise our social welfare benefits more or less to the level of those in Northern Ireland.  Nothing is more effective in our efforts to come together with people in the North than to show that our social security system is on a par with theirs. If, as I believe, in the ultimate&mdash;may it not be a far away goal&mdash;we will join with the people of Northern Ireland it is a feather in our caps that the economy in this part of the country is so developed that we can bring our social security system into line and on a par with that which is financed in Northern Ireland mainly through the British Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to some of the categories for which provision is made in this Bill.  I welcome the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary has made a considerable improvement in the condition of single women who are not or who have never been in wage earning employment.  This was a category of people who particularly in rural areas had worked at home as housekeepers or indeed people who had been employed domestically but who never had cards stamped or who never had come into the categories of those in wage earning employment.  It is encouraging to see that something is being done for them.  The fact that their allowance is being granted at an earlier age than in the case of some other contributors is also to be welcomed because they are a group of people who have suffered and for whom the State has done little.  It is a very important step forward and is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme for helping wives of prisoners is another very welcome one.  The Parliamentary Secretary and his Department are to be complimented on doing something for wives of prisoners serving sentences of not less than six months.  I take it that this applies across the board to all types of prisoners&mdash;it is a pity that we have to have categories of prisoners; there <Col N="566" /> seems to be class distinction in our prisons just as there is outside.  Some people wish to categorise themselves differently.  However, I think they should all be treated similarly.  The scheme giving allowances to their wives and the fact that it is in parallel with the scheme for deserted wives and unmarried mothers is certainly to be welcomed.  I take it there is no case for making special social assistance allowances for husbands whose wives have been imprisoned.  I am not sure what proportion of women in our prisons today are married.  I imagine that the people who are in difficulty really in this situation are the unmarried women in prison.  Their problems really relate to the problem of employment when they emerge.  I presume that single women in prison are eligible for the normal unemployment benefits when they emerge in the normal course of events.  So at least they would be covered.</P>
    <P>There is one further group of people whose problems I raised with the Parliamentary Secretary when I mentioned them in the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, 1973.  I should like to raise it with him again.  Perhaps something has already been decided in their case.  I am not sure what the present position is but I know that the Department were investigating the situation.  It concerns the categorisation as far as social welfare is concerned, of the clergy.  They were categorised as being self-employed.  The problems are different for the Protestant clergy and the Roman Catholic clergy because most Protestant clergy are married and, I regret to say, receive ridiculously small salaries.  However, as they are being categorised as being self-employed they are debarred from the main benefits of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>I know that representation has been made to the Department that these people who are married and who have families and who have very small salaries by present day standards should be eligible and should be able to have cards and have them stamped and therefore qualify for the normal benefits for which people who have employers normally qualify.  When the <Col N="567" /> Parliamentary Secretary is replying perhaps he could indicate what is the position of the clergy, particularly of the Protestant married clergy, as far as social welfare is concerned and what steps have been taken in the Department to deal with their problems in the field of social welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnan" hpid="Mr. Brosnan Mr. Brosnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first opportunity I have had of doing so and I rise rather to welcome the Parliamentary Secretary than to praise the Bill.  We are all aware of the sincerity, the dedication and commitment of Deputy Cluskey to the amelioration of the plight of the sick, widowed and the other needy and deprived categories of persons.  Anything he does&mdash; unfortunately, he does precious little in this Bill&mdash;towards that desirable goal will be welcomed by this House, certainly by this side of the House.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a few brief comments on the Bill itself.  Like Senator West and Senator Halligan, I should like to welcome the innovations, which are in the right direction.  There is the new scheme for payment of benefit to single women reaching the age of 58 years.  That age may be a little too high.  These women usually are persons who dedicated most of their lives to working in the home, very often looking after sick parents or sick members of other families.</P>
      <P>The second scheme, in regard to prisoners' wives is also very welcome. I think that the time at which the payment of benefit should commence should be the date of the commencement of the sentence.  At the very least it should be reduced from six months to something like two or three weeks. The first six months of a prisoner's sentence is the most difficult for the unfortunate widow and other dependants of the prisoner.  For that reason I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider reducing the waiting period to something less than six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the third innovation, which is also very welcome, I think the period of the payment of benefit which is proposed to be extended to six weeks, should be extended further. <Col N="568" /> It should be extended to such time as bereaved persons become entitled to whatever benefit they are entitled. Very often the period of waiting for the payment of this benefit is extended to six months and sometimes it may be even longer.  During that period there is great hardship to these unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by asking the Parliamentary Secretary if he could do anything at all&mdash;there may be administrative difficulties&mdash;about the expediting of the payment of all social welfare benefits.  I am sure he is aware from his experience as a public representative dealing with constituents that these delays cause more complaints and very often more hardship also to public representatives than any other feature of the social welfare code.  If some changes could be made in the regulations governing the payment of all benefits I would be pleased.</P>
    <P>Senator Cowan mentioned that unfortunately the benefits, welcome as they were, were being more than eroded by the increased cost of living. That, unfortunately, is true and it is my opinion that the Parliamentary Secretary and Senator Halligan, who tried to make the case that that was not so, have found out otherwise while they were canvassing during the recent local election.  I wish the Parliamentary Secretary every success in his very important and onerous position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers, I welcome the Bill.  While I agree that there have been considerable benefits given in the Bill, I feel, as others have said here, that as a result of the huge increases in the cost of living the proposed benefits given are now useless.  Unless the Government are prepared to do something about the cost of living the only alternative is to increase these benefits. At this stage it might not be too easy for the Parliamentary Secretary to do that, but I just want to make one or two suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year when we had a mountain of butter it was decided that a pound of cheap butter would be given <Col N="569" /> to old age pensioners in the non-contributory bracket.  I do not know why a pound of butter was not also given to the contributory section.  It looked to be very unfair.  I know of a case in my own area where a person on a contributory pension and living in a cottage did not get the pound of butter, whereas a farmer's wife who was living with her son who had about 50 cows got a pound of butter.  To the man in the cottage it looked very unjust.  I think that a pound of butter should have been given to every person in receipt of the old age pension, whether contributory or non-contributory.</P>
    <P>Last year we had a mountain of butter.  This year we have a mountain of beef.  We are told that we are saving £30 million in subsidies to agriculture since we entered the EEC. Perhaps something could be done for the less well-off by giving them a voucher or something of that kind to get meat.  In that way it might help in a small way to reduce this mountain of beef that we have at the present time.  It might help the farmers to get an increased price for their cattle.  I suggest that the Minister would look into that.</P>
    <P>We are told that the means test will be abolished completely.  Some of the politicians on the opposite side told us that before the last general election.  We know that the means test has been reduced somewhat but I feel that social welfare officers when they are going around, to farmers in particular, assessing income are not inclined to take the present cost of living into account.  In the case of a farmer who may have five or six cows, they take the value of his milk into account which today is much greater than what it was years ago. This reacts unfavourably against that man when his income is taken into account for the old age pension.  The sooner that a means test is done away with the better as far as old age pensioners are concerned.  All people when they reach the age limit to get the old age pension.</P>
    <P>We have a lot of old people in hospitals and that is costing the State quite a lot of money.  I suppose it is <Col N="570" /> costing at least £30 a week per person. The question is asked why are they in hospitals.  The reason is that a lot of them have nobody to look after them at home.  They cannot expect their relatives to stay at home.  We all know that in recent times people who are in employment and give up the job to go home to look after their relatives get some compensation. There is also the case of young people of maybe 17 or 18 years of age who have just finished school. If they stay at home to look after their father or mother they do not get any benefits.  This is something that should apply to that section also.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like again to bring to the Minister's notice&mdash;and I am sure he has heard this fairly often&mdash; the delay in payments, especially sick benefits and unemployment assistance. Anybody who applies for those benefits has to wait at least six, seven or maybe ten weeks before he gets the benefits.  I cannot understand this delay unless it is due to understaffing.  Perhaps it is.  If understaffing is the cause of this delay, then I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to make this right as soon as possible because it is most unfair to the person who has to go on unemployment assistance or on sick benefit to find that he is ten weeks waiting for anything from the Department.  He has to go to his local home assistance officer and he will give him a few pounds which he will take back the very minute the man gets the social assistance, something I do not agree with either.</P>
    <P>While I agree that old age pension committees should be there, I feel that they may be holding up old age pensions to a certain extent by reason of the fact that a decision has to be made by that committee before a person gets a non-contributory pension. Those pension committees often meet only every two or three months.  I feel that the only purpose of the old age pension committees is when there is a dispute between the social welfare officer and the person applying for the pension.  In all cases where there is no dispute and the person is entitled to the full pension, that pension should be granted straightforward without <Col N="571" /> waiting for a decision from the old age pension committee.  The old age pension committee should only be there for the purpose of deciding cases where there is no agreement between those concerned.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say on the Bill.  I welcome the Bill but I regret that the benefits which were awarded are of so little use at the moment due to the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatBrowne" hpid="Mr. P. Browne Mr. P. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a brief contribution.  I raised the same thing a couple of weeks ago and I was ruled out of order, and rightly so.  I admit that now.  I concur with what my colleagues have said and wish to add my own comments. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will bear with me for a few minutes while I make my point clear.  The position is that if a male employee leaves his employment on his own accord automatically he is out of benefit for six weeks whereas if a female leaves because she wishes to look after her parents and she does not come back, she is not recognised. A female is never recognised the way the male is.  I think that is terrible.</P>
      <P>I know of one particular case&mdash; the reason I am on my feet now is to make it known to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;where a lady with nine years' service who left her employment to look after a parent was debarred from benefit and not even allowed to sign on at the labour exchange. That is very wrong.  This is something that should have been rectified long before now.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will take this into consideration.  Just imagine a poor unfortunate creature with nine years in employment who left her position to look after a parent and for that simple reason she was debarred. All she could get was £1 a week home assistance.  That is disgraceful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I suggest that the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Welfare should have an understanding in regard to the matter I now wish to raise.  In the area I <Col N="572" /> represent there is no chance whatsoever of getting into hospital.  There is a waiting list for the hospitals there. They give very good care and attention but there is no chance of people getting into them.  Take, for example, the case of one individual whom I know.  If an understanding could be reached between the Departments to say to this man: &ldquo;We will give you £10 or £12 per week to remain at home&rdquo; would that not be better than having him in hospital where it would cost £25 to £30 per week to keep him?</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to bring this point to the notice of the Minister.  I am not wrong in this.  As I know in Waterford city and county, one would have to get knocked down by a car to get into hospital.  If the Minister suggested giving £10 or £12 per week there would be plenty of room in hospitals.  Too many old people are left in hospitals. Under existing conditions they have no chance.  Nobody wants them and they must remain in hospital.  If their relatives at home were given £10 or £12 per week for their upkeep they could be taken home.  It costs £30 to keep them in hospital.</P>

      <P>I wish to endorse the opinions of previous speakers.  I am a councillor, as are most of the other Senators.  Every day there are people approaching me for £1, £2 or £3.  It has been stated on television that one will receive £3.50 for caring for an elderly couple.  In my county of Kilkenny one might get £1 after six months for taking care of an elderly parent or relative.  If it is the rule that they should receive £3.50 why do they have to fight to get it?  We are told by the Minister that this is law and they should receive it.  Why has the home assistance officer the right to decide the amount to be given?  In Kilkenny some people receive £3.50 for caring for one person and others receive £1 per week for caring for two persons.</P>

      <P>What Department deals with this?  A payment to a disabled person comes under the Department of Social Welfare.  We are all interested in the plight of those who are confined to hospital because they have nobody to look after them.  I know a woman who has ten children and is looking after her father and mother aged 90 and 85 years respectively.  She receives nothing for this.  When I spoke on their behalf they got £1 after six months and she received £2 after six months.  They should have got £3.50 from the beginning. I am not speaking about the present Government only.  Ministers in the previous Government stated that is the law and it should be paid.  We, as councillors cannot get it for the people. Everyone should be treated equally in this.</P>

      <P>This is a most important Bill and a most welcome one.  A most important feature of the Bill, and of the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary, is a significant and positive contribution to the evolution of our welfare system.  There is an admission there that our present system is not adequate, not equitable and not complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not criticising but we must hammer away at inequity.  The improved unemployment benefit, for instance, is £7.75 for a single man without dependants.  This gives him approximately £1.10 per day.  It is impossible to live on this amount. It would not provide sufficient food not to speak of clothing, rent, fuel and so on.  I have just come from a meeting of the Joint Restaurant Committee in this House.  There was a discussion on the menu provided and the cost of the food.  I suggest that £1.10 per day would not provide lunch for a Senator or Deputy.  The same applies to the other improved benefits.  The widows' benefit is increased to £7.30.  The same benefit applies to wives of prisoners.  It is costing the State a great deal more than that to support the prisoner.  I do not mention these facts through criticism.  The present Government with this Bill have done more to improve social welfare and to extend and expand it than previous Governments <Col N="574" /> did during three or four years.</P>
    <P>I do not hold previous Governments responsible for the situation in which we find ourselves in respect of social welfare.  We are all responsible as we have permitted this situation to develop down through the years.  The same may apply in most other countries.  I wish to make the point that if we are not to become complacent we must hammer away and point out that our social welfare scheme is not adequate and does not permit any member of the community receiving welfare benefit of any kind to lead what might be described as a decent life.  The social welfare benefit for the blind, the ill, the aged and the unemployed does not permit that person, man or woman, to lead what we might describe as a decent life.</P>
    <P>We should aim at two levels in the future in respect of social welfare.  The first level is to increase and to continue to improve benefits to the stage where we can claim that the individual in receipt of social welfare benefit may lead a decent standard of life.  The second level is to continue to improve on that standard of decent living from time to time.</P>
    <P>In saying what I have said I did so not as criticism of this Bill or of the actions taken by the Government in this field but because public attention must continue to be focussed on this major question affecting us all.  If that is not done, we may sink into complacency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senators for their contributions on this Bill, which were quite constructive.  A number of issues were raised.  Some of them overlapped.  I will very briefly try to deal with some of the matters raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dolan, in opening the discussion, spoke of the question of children's allowances.  He indicated that it was very important that children's allowances be maintained because they had been proved to be a tremendous source of help to large families.  I agree with the Senator in this.  It is true to say that this is the first time there have been two consecutive Social Welfare <Col N="575" /> Bills which provided for an increase in children's allowances.  Senator Dolan also mentioned the right of the mother to receive children's allowances.  As the Senator is aware, we were happy some three weeks ago to bring before the Seanad a Bill which enabled the children's allowance to be payable as of right to the mother.  That Bill was, in my opinion, long overdue.</P>
    <P>Senator Dolan also spoke about the cost of unemployment assistance and mentioned a few facts.  I should like to relate this to something that was said by Senator Ryan.  The cost of unemployment assistance in the present financial year&mdash;that is a nine-month year&mdash;including the increases provided for under this Bill is in the region of £19.2 million.  I think all will agree that that is a fairly considerable sum of money.  I am sure no Senator would seek a reduction in that sum if we were satisfied in our own minds that it was going to people who truly needed that type of assistance, but I wonder are we so satisfied?</P>
    <P>It seems from some of the remarks made by Senator Ryan that some Members of the Seanad have doubts as to how that money is being spent. He mentioned the EEC cheap butter and seemed to be under the impresion that the scheme was administered by the Department of Social Welfare. That is not the case.  The question of cheap butter is one that can only be dealt with under fairly strict regulations laid down by the EEC.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are the responsible Department. The Department of Social Welfare only administer that scheme on behalf of that Department.  It is confined solely to people who are in receipt of assistance, not benefit.  A man signing for unemployment benefit would not be eligible for cheap butter but a man who is signing for unemployment assistance would be eligible for vouchers.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan was not very happy about this situation.  He pointed out that he knew of an agricultural worker living in a small cottage who was not eligible for vouchers but this man felt very aggrieved because his <Col N="576" /> neighbour, who is sending the milk of 50 cows to the creamery, was eligible. With the amount of money, which is fairly limited, that we have available, in the field of social welfare elected representatives and all of us who have a responsibility should ensure that whatever money is available is spent in the most effective way to relieve need.  I think all Senators will agree that £19.2 million is a fair sum.  Our resources are limited and there is great need.  There is social injustice in this country at present.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte raised the question of poverty.  He elaborated on the need for more activity in that field.  The Government undertook to do two things in the field of social welfare in the 14-point programme put before the electorate.  One was to alleviate poverty and the other was to eliminate poverty.</P>
    <P>This Bill undoubtedly will not eliminate poverty, but we hope that it will in some measure alleviate poverty in our society.  More sweeping and broader measures will be necessary if we are to achieve the other goal of eliminating poverty in our society.  The commitment this Government have given and the evidence of the last two budgets, as well as other activities, have left me in no doubt that the Government have the political will to achieve these very desirable ends over a period of time. No one claimed that that could be done in the short term but I am confident that with the support of the more fortunate members of our society&mdash;that 80 per cent who do not come into the poverty category&mdash;it can be achieved.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte also had some queries regarding the lowering of the pension age and its effect upon private pension schemes operating within industry.  I have an idea that Deputy Harte had a particular industry in mind.  If he had an informal chat with one of his fellow-Members of the Seanad he might be able to achieve more than I could in that direction.  It would be a matter between individual employers and their employees, preferably through their trade union representatives.  It would <Col N="577" /> not be a matter that could be regulated by the Department as I understand the problem.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan raised some interesting points.  He wanted to know if it would be possible to pay social welfare benefits from 1st June or earlier.  After the introduction of a budget, the earlier one can possibly pay the increases to the recipients of social welfare benefits the better. However, there is a limit and, as Senator Quinlan mentioned, there are administrative and other difficulties. A very significant advance has been made.  Payment is now being made from 1st July this year as opposed to 1st October in previous years.  As the Senator suggests, we should aim towards advancing the date somewhat further.  If it is only an administrative difficulty, perhaps the suggestion of paying a lump might be taken into consideration.  However, this would have to be considered against the background of our limited resources.</P>
    <P>The question of the means test was raised by a number of Senators.  They deplored the fact that it had only been changed from £4 to £5.  This point was raised on both sides of the House.  Frankly it is a criticism that I do not accept from anybody, when one considers that 18 months ago if one's means were not &ldquo;nil&rdquo; one did not qualify for full benefit.  Within 18 months we have succeeded in introducing two Social Welfare Bills to bring about the situation where a person can have an income of £5 and still benefit.  I am not suggesting for one moment that £5 is the ultimate and that it meets all the problems. But I am suggesting that from the figure that existed 18 months ago of &ldquo;nil&rdquo; means to one of £5 is reasonable progress.  I look forward to the situation being eased further in the coming years.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the question of the cost-of-living.  Senators Dolan and Cowen went so far as to say that no benefit whatsoever would accrue to people in receipt of social welfare benefit or assistance because of inflation.  That is totally unacceptable to me.  I am not suggesting that inflation is not a problem, nor am <Col N="578" /> I trying to pretend that inflation is not a major consideration.  But I do not think Senators or any public representatives are doing a service to the people who have to depend on social welfare payments by undermining their confidence by overstating and misrepresenting the facts.  There is no doubt that the amounts of increases that will be paid are not as beneficial as one might have hoped. But to suggest that no advance has been made in this area and that the plight of the old age pensioners and similar persons will be even worsened in the coming months is not doing a service to anyone.  The only way to make any advance in this area is to be objective about our criticisms. There are enough things to be objectively critical about without having to take off into the realm of fantasy on the question of the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I am happy with the discussion that took place on the Bill.  Some progress is being made in the whole field of social welfare.  However, Senator Kennedy's remarks summed up my attitude.  We are a long way from where we should want to go.  It can only be done if there is a full realisation of the inadequacies that exist in our social welfare system as it has existed up to the present.  There is a greater awareness in the public mind not only of the desirability of achieving our aim but of the necssity for achieving them in the coming years. feel confident that a reasonable start has been made in that direction and this has been contributed to by the introduction of this Bill.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to repeal, with effect from 6th April, 1974, the 20-year tax exemption for profits arising from the mining of scheduled minerals and to replace the exemption, with effect from that date, by a scheme of tax allowances specially designed to meet the needs of the Irish mining industry and generally comparable with mining taxation systems in other countries.</P>
      <P>The decision to withdraw the 20-year tax exemption and to replace it with a new scheme of tax allowances was taken by the Government only after a comprehensive study of mining fiscal policy in other countries.  As Senators are already aware, an interdepartmental committee was set up in 1971 to review the taxation and royalty arrangements in relation to the exploitation of our mineral resources. It was envisaged that this review would assist in the formulation of a sound long-term fiscal policy for mineral exploitation which would give the State an equitable share of profits and which would at the same time be sufficiently attractive to mining companies to ensure the continued development of our mineral resources in an orderly and efficient manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following this study the Government concluded that the 20-year tax exemption was unduly generous by reference to comparable concessions <Col N="581" /> elsewhere and that it was no longer appropriate in the light of the present state of development of the mining industry in this country.</P>
    <P>As a general principle, all profits arising in the State should be subject to taxation.  Where the concept of neutrality in the taxation of income is contravened the cost of foregoing the revenue must be commensurate with the resulting benefit to the community and must be recognised as such.  Senators will agree that any tax concessions given to an industry should be subject to the overriding criterion of optimum development of our national resources.  Application of this principle implies that the fruits of exploiting our mineral resources which are wasting assets should be applied to the greatest extent possible for the economic and social development of our country.  The retention of the 20-year exemption would not give rise to any benefits to the economy which would not accrue in its absence and there would be no offset to the cost of living of foregoing the revenue involved.  In these circumstances the Government were duty-bound to act by recasting the tax concessions available in respect of non-bedded minerals in order to ensure that the fruits of exploiting our mineral resources would be applied to the greatest extent possible for the economic and social development of the country.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that worldwide changes have occurred in recent years in the climate of public opinion and in the framework of Government policies within which the mining industry has to operate.  Regardless of the terms of fiscal legislation when investments were first initiated many countries have subsequently taken steps to increase their revenue from mining, even to the extent in some cases of expropriation or nationalisation in order to meet national objectives.  The mining industry, though multi-national in its organisation and outlook, is nevertheless a closely-knit one.  All mining companies are conscious that the industry is operating in a highly sensitive area in exploiting the natural resources of host countries.  It is clear from the <Col N="582" /> mining Press and journals that the industry recognises the universal character of these new attitudes and has in fact come to terms with them and, with necessary adjustments in its programmes and methods, is working in a reasonably satisfied way in new conditions.</P>
    <P>Apart from international changes in attitudes to the exploitation of natural resources the difficulty in meeting sharply rising demand for base metals has led prices to rise to record levels, with commensurate increases in mining companies' profits, which in Ireland have been completely free of tax up to now.  World demand for base metals, the discovery of the Navan mine, which promises to be one of the largest of its kind in the world, and other mining developments and possibilities in Ireland have fundamentally altered the mining situation in this country and made a realistic reappraisal of the 20-year tax exemption imperative.  It was inevitable in these circumstances that Irish public opinion should strongly react against the continued exemption from taxation of profits arising from the mining of non-bedded minerals.  In the light of such circumstances, it was imperative that the mining industry, having reached its present state of development, should make an equitable and suitable contribution towards the ever increasing cost of promoting national development.</P>
    <P>It must also be pointed out that taxation is but one of the many considerations to be taken into account by companies in deciding the allocation of resources between different countries.  It is clear that the tax exemption was not the only factor which led to the growth of the Irish mining industry in recent years.  This development was due also to relatively favourable and well documented geology, improvements in technology, good mineral legislation and the impetus given by the Tynagh discovery in 1961.  It is indeed significant that all the mining companies which have made exploitable discoveries here were engaged in mineral exploration before the 20-year tax exemption was introduced. <Col N="583" /> Special considerations attach to mining tax concessions which relate to the exploitation of irreplaceable national resources and therefore they differ fundamentally from the tax incentives available for manufacturing industry which is intended to be permanent.  A mine is a wasting asset and must be taxed while it exists or it will pay no tax at all. Manufacturing industry will pay tax when reliefs, such as those for exports, are exhausted and will confer a continuing benefit on the community.  I wish to emphasise that the special circumstances which necessitated a change in the Government's fiscal policy as respects non-bedded minerals do not apply to industry in general, particularly manufacturing industry.  The changes in mining fiscal policy do not of course imply any intentions whatsoever to change the tax relief in respect of export sales by manufacturing industry.  Every Government since 1956 has continued the reliefs for manufacturing industry and there will be no change in policy in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Government were anxious that the scope of the new scheme of tax allowances should not be finally determined until mining interests had an opportunity to submit their views on the matter.  I received a number of submissions which I discussed with interested parties during the course of a series of meetings in recent months. I appreciate very much the constructive matter in which these consultations were held.  Following consideration of these representations the scheme proposed last October was modified in some respects.  In addition to the tax reliefs already announced it was decided that certain allowances should also be provided in respect of abortive exploration expenditure and the cost of acquiring scheduled mineral assets.  The revised scheme of allowances is now set out in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 1 sets out definitions.  The Bill is concerned only with the treatment of profits from the mining of minerals specified in Schedule 13 to the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> Under section 2 of the Bill an immediate allowance is provided against any mining profits of a person from working a qualifying mine for the full amount of exploration and development expenditure as it is incurred on or after 6th April, 1974, in any part of the State.  Senators will note that all exploration expenditure whether successful or abortive will qualify for immediate relief against mining profits.  Where abortive expenditure is incurred on or after 6th April, 1974, relief will be limited to abortive expenditure incurred within ten years prior to the commencement of mining.  It had been intended that a seven-year restriction should apply. This period was extended to ten years by a Report Stage amendment to the Bill in Dáil Éireann.  In addition to these reliefs special provision is also made, in section 2, to enable companies already carrying on mining operations before the withdrawal of the tax exemption to claim an immediate allowance of any unallowed balance of exploration and development expenditure incurred before 6th April, 1974, which qualified for relief under existing law.  Section 7 accords similar relief in respect of any unallowed balance of capital expenditure incurred on plant and machinery brought into use before 6th April last.</P>
    <P>Section 3 will enable abortive exploration expenditure incurred before 6th April, 1974, but not earlier than 6th April, 1967, also to be set against mining profits.  An amendment to the Bill on the Report Stage in Dáil Éireann extended from seven to ten years the general period over which abortive exploration expenditure may be accumulated for set-off against profits from a successful mine provided that expenditure was incurred on or after 6th April, 1967.  Since the 20-year tax exemption commenced on 6th April, 1967, it is considered that this date would be an appropriate starting point for this allowance.  Provision is also made in section 3 to prevent persons arranging matters so that successful mining companies would take over unsuccessful exploration companies in order to set their abortive expenditure against the taxable mining profits of the successful companies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> Section 4 is designed to cover the case where exploration expenditure is incurred by one company in a group of wholly-owned subsidiaries and mining profits are earned by the parent company or other subsidiary in the group.  In such cases the exploration company may elect to have its exploration expenditure, whether successful or abortive, attributed to any subsidiary in the group or to the parent company so that the exploration expenditure may be set-off against mining profits wherever they arise within the group.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides relief for exploration expenditure incurred by a person who finds a scheduled mineral deposit and then sells the asset to another person who develops and works the mine.  In such a case the latter will be able to claim in respect of the exploration expenditure incurred in connection with the mine.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for &ldquo;free depreciation&rdquo; of new plant and machinery, other than road vehicles, brought into use on or after 6th April, 1974, in the working of a qualifying mine.  Furthermore, as an encouragement to higher investment in new plant and machinery by the mining industry, provision is also made in section 7 of the Bill which will, in effect, allow a further 20 per cent of that expenditure, making 120 per cent in all, to be set-off as it is incurred against mining profits.  The relief in question will apply to expenditure incurred on or after 6th April, 1974, on new plant and machinery used in connection with the mining of scheduled non-bedded minerals in any part of the country.  As a further incentive to encourage exploration for non-bedded minerals, section 6 provides for a special investment allowance of 20 per cent of expenditure on exploration incurred on or after 6th April, 1974.  This is in addition to the 100 per cent allowance for exploration expenditure allowed under section 2, to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>Because investment in mining is highly speculative and generally subject to greater risks than investment in most other industries, there is a case for allowing all pre-production <Col N="586" /> expenditure.  It is also desirable to make an allowance for the cost of acquiring mineral deposits.</P>
    <P>Section 8 enables the cost of acquiring deposits of scheduled minerals, where incurred after 31st March, 1974, to be spread over the life of the mine or 20 years if shorter.  It would however be invidious to allow sums received from sales of scheduled minerals to escape income taxation because the owners elected not to work the deposit but to dispose of their interest.  Consequently, section 11 imposes a charge to income tax, and section 12 imposes a charge to corporation profits tax in the case of a company, on the proceeds of sales of scheduled mineral deposits occurring after 31st March, 1974.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 and 17 terminate, with effect from 6th April, 1974, the exemption from income tax and corporation profits tax, respectively, of profits from the mining of scheduled minerals.</P>
    <P>Section 16 gives an option to anyone carrying on the trade of working a qualifying mine to elect to be charged to income tax for 1974-75 by reference to the actual profits of that year instead of on the basis of profits of the preceding year.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for tax relief for marginal mines.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 and 14 which relate to the tax treatment of dividends paid on profits previously entitled to exemption, are consequential on the repeal of the exemption.  In particular provision is being made to ensure that dividends paid after the repeal of the tax exemption but out of profits which fell within the exemption period will carry the benefit of the income tax exemption.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new scheme of tax allowances provided for by this Bill, together with the other advantages of operating in Ireland, will afford adequate incentive to further prospecting and exploration so as to ensure the continuation of a satisfactory level of development of the country's mineral resources.  Because of the generous allowances now being provided, the gain in revenue to the <Col N="587" /> Exchequer in the next few years may not be significant, but over the next 20 years it is estimated that the tax yield on 1973 figures will be some £125 million.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

My criticism of the Government in their approach to mining is not, as a number of Government speakers have suggested, that I or the party to which I belong, object in any way to the community getting more from the mines.  On the contrary, Fianna Fáil's approach was to encourage development of our mineral resources and get the greatest possible return for the community.</P>
      <P>One of the most important reasons on which I would base my criticism is the Government's attitude in regard to the cancellation of the statutory exemption of existing mines, as distinct from new mines, from income tax.  I believe that in relation to existing mines which were benefiting from this exemption cancellation is damaging to our hard-won reputation in the field of industrial development. When bargains or deals are made they should be kept.  When we were in Government and endeavouring to work out the maximum amount that could be recovered for the community from new mines, consistent with encouraging mining in Ireland, that was one matter.  It is a quite different and serious matter when one is taking away from existing mines a concession granted to them by both Houses of the Oireachtas, which one might say is solemnly enshrined in legislation, and then trying to reassure people, as the Minister has done here this evening, in relation to industrial development itself that investors in industry in this country need have no concern.</P>
      <P>It is significant that the Minister has said here tonight:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that the special circumstances which necessitated <Col N="588" /> the change in the Government's fiscal policy as respects non-bedded minerals do not apply to industry in general, particularly manufacturing industry.  The changes in mining policy do not, of course, imply any intentions whatsoever to change the tax relief in respect of export sales by manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister feel that he must stress that point once again? He has done so in the other House and members of his Cabinet have spoken on similar lines in other places. I can only assume, as one must assume when one hears it being said so often, that it has affected would-be investors in this country: it has deterred them from setting up industry here.  Otherwise why should the Minister or members of his Cabinet feel that it is necessary on so many occasions to emphasise this point?</P>
    <P>I may be forgiven for assuming that it is still necessary to emphasise this point because if there were no inquiries relating to the possibility of bargains being broken in that particular field of industry why should the Minister mention it again?  I do not know if it would even be desirable or in the national interest for the Minister to reply to me on that question.  I sincerely hope such inquiries did not arise.  We all know that credibility is the greatest asset an individual has and, most certainly, that a Government has, and once a Government loses credibility it is forever distrusted.  There is no surer way of losing your credibility than by breaking a sealed bargain, a bargain that was solemnly enshrined in legislation by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>If I may look back on the mining industry in this country over the past number of years, it must be remembered that up to a short while ago all the experts and, indeed, the books in the school that I attended, very definitely stated that there was no mineral wealth in Ireland.  A State company was formed here for the purpose of exploring for mineral deposits &mdash;Mianraí Teoranta.  This operation, although it cost a lot of money, was not successful.  There were many complaints at that time about the money <Col N="589" /> being spent on Mianraí Teoranta and had the Government of the time continued with this policy on the bigger scale which, looking back would appear now to have been necessary, there would have been an outcry in possibly both Houses of the Oireachtas. Perhaps, leading members of the Cabinet now might then have been leading the outcry and claiming that they were being asked to vote money each year for nothing else but digging holes in the ground.  It might be said also that the State could have bought the latest technical know-how to improve exploration methods.  This is all right in theory but in practice it is difficult and may well be impossible to bring about.</P>
    <P>As a result of the experience in dealing in mining and exploration through the State company the Government decided to offer inducements to private enterprise to explore for and develop our mineral resources. This policy was highly successful in that it succeeded in enticing people with expertise to come here.  They were successful in locating substantial finds of minerals and similar finds are likely in the future.  That fact is well-known and accepted.  It is, and must be, of some significance that in this small island we on this side of the Border succeeded in developing our mining industry to the extent that it has now been developed.  It is surely ridiculous to think that we were so blessed on this side of the Border that we had vast amounts of mineral wealth and those at the far side of the Border had none.  I mention this because it is the positive indication of how successful and wise the Government were at the time in offering these inducements and attractive benefits to knowledgeable people in the mining industry to come to this country.  It is only very recently, I think, that they had any successful mining operation of any size in the North of Ireland and I think they were encouraged by the success of the efforts on the part of our Government at the time to attract experts from other shores.</P>
    <P>There are people in this country who I am quite sure believe in what they say who want our mineral resources <Col N="590" /> nationalised.  I am not sure if there are many such people but every so often we hear these demands.  They were not many or loud when the State company was exploring for mineral wealth in this country.  I do not recall many of these people making demands at that time.  What I think they are now advocating is that private enterprise, having done the work and risked their capital, should have the fruits of their labours and investments confiscated.  It is now apparently forgotten that a number of companies spent a great deal of money on exploration and drilling with no success.  If one were to accept the proposition that we should nationalise the mines at this stage, one must face the fact that large amounts of capital would be required and that the amount of capital available to the State at present for other purposes, such as the building of houses, schools, factories, hospitals and so on, is very limited.</P>
    <P>Consequently if we were to nationalise the mines we would have to cut back on capital which is now being used in the type of projects I have mentioned.  We have to try to attract capital from abroad to invest it in our nationalised mines.  To succeed, if one were to attempt this&mdash;I hope the Minister would not ever think on those lines&mdash;we would have to offer considerable inducements and financial returns, and the net effect of this, though it might be called nationalisation, would not be very different from the present position in that a great deal of the profit would be going to outside interests who had invested capital in our mining enterprise.</P>
    <P>When these inducements were originally offered there existed a situation where the mining prospects were poor.  As the mining finds developed the State's bargaining position improved so that it is now possible to get greater returns for the State from mining and to give smaller inducements than were necessary in the past.  It is unrealistic to compare the present situation with that which obtained when the mining inducements were first introduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> It is clear that the Fianna Fáil Government, when they originally tried using a State company and found that that did not work and when they changed policy and offered inducements to private enterprise, found that this policy was successful.  When this success put us in a better bargaining position the Fianna Fáil Government were preparing to extract the maximum benefit from that bargaining position.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the points raised in the Minister's speech and the other speeches which have been made reassuring us that the same thing will not happen to them.  I sincerely hope this is true.  I believe, in the interests of equity and of the economy, that this exemption should not be removed from existing mines.  I emphasise existing mines as distinct from new mines which can be treated on a different basis.  There is no obligation on anybody to treat them in the same way as existing mines.  This is an important point.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the implications of what he is proposing to do in this Bill in relation to existing mines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The way in which the debate was handled in the Dáil mystified me as it is a debate about an important subject, which is how the community, through the Minister, through the Cabinet, are to fight their way through a period of economic stress probably unprecedented in the lifetime of our State.  There is no doubt in anybody's mind, and one is not being partisan when one states that the economic future of these countries, Britain and Ireland, is sliding rapidly to an uncontrollable financial situation partly because of their inefficiency, partly because uncontrollable outside influences leading to inflation.  We have the failure of the Common Market and the truly disastrous state of the British economy, which clearly is most unlikely to recover within the next decade no matter who is in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances any significant source of wealth in Ireland should <Col N="592" /> be examined with scrupulous care by a responsible Government to try to see how much money they can take out of these mines, out of this property which I emphasise we own, because by a remarkable piece of good fortune we do happen to own the property, and what is likely to face the Government are the financial conditions in which they will lease it to a company in order to mine it, that is assuming they do not set up a State company and do it themselves.</P>
    <P>One of our difficulties is that none of us is completely certain about precisely what figures we are discussing here tonight.  All we have from the Minister is one figure, and that is the key figure. I think he must try to build on that figure for the rest of us here and in the country because there is considerable interest in this problem, very much more interest outside this House or the other House.  There is very much more interest outside among responsible people about this question: What are the facts about the position in relation to mining and, of course, gas and oil? Tonight one of the evening papers has as its headline: &ldquo;We are going to export oil&rdquo;.  Is it this kind of periodic euphoria which grips the leader writers every so often?  They are not to be blamed for this because reasonably well-substantiated figures have been produced by conscientious people who are non-partisan and not the slightest bit interested in party politics as we know it.</P>
    <P>On the basis of these figures there appears to be enormous, newly-discovered, newly-realised resources of mineral wealth as well as the gas and oil, but particularly mineral wealth which we are dealing with here and of which we were not aware ourselves.  I remember when we were in Government we got a report on mining and it made the statement that we should be written off as a country of any significant mineral resources.  Now apparently that has all changed and this is where I have been perplexed, in reading the Dáil debate and listening to the comments by the working politicians, by their extraordinary indifference, apathy, apparent unconcern.  There is the extraordinary remark by the Taoiseach&mdash;I <Col N="593" /> referred to this before about a year ago&mdash;in which he said we have no significant mineral resources.  I am sure he does not believe that now. That, I suppose, was a left-over idea which he had from so much of what was said in the past about our mineral resources, but I think he had a responsibility to know more about it than he appeared to know then.  He certainly has a responsibility to know more about it, to have learned everything he can about it, since that time.</P>
    <P>I can only assume from the reference in the Minister's speech that the figures are based on more reliable information available both here and everywhere else&mdash;his decision in relation to the fiscal policy.  I would ask the Minister to let us have an end to the speculation, the wild euphoria&mdash; or is it reality?  Is it true?  Is it not wild at all?  Is it well founded?  Have we suddenly come into enormous wealth in this country and all we have to do is to set up organisations, either our own or pay an organisation to establish itself, and all our problems are over&mdash;problems in relation to the great subjects that concern us all, the provision of housing, health, hospitals, care of old people, education, communications, which all of us profess to want to find the funds for? These funds at present are greatly limited, there is no doubt about that, and they will become more limited, I would imagine, if the present deterioration in our economic circumstances continues.</P>
    <P>Is it true that this money is there and that the only thing between us and that money is a decision on the part of the Government to follow a slightly more radical policy than their predecessors but, at the same time, an essentially very conservative policy of allowing this money to be taken out of the ground by private <i>entrepreneurs</i> for their own use, their own aggrandisement?  The 5 per cent who own the 74 per cent are apparently to continue to retain their position, privilege, wealth and all that wealth can buy in our kind of society. Is that the position?</P>
    <P>The previous speaker, the Fianna Fáil spokesman on this question, to <Col N="594" /> some extent defended the 20 year taxation relief.  It is really indefensible. I do not think anybody could defend the idea.  Even to the simplest mind, there could be no defence of a principle to give taxation relief to what is, as the Minister said, a completely wasting asset.  There will be nothing there to tax at the end of 20 years and therefore what the Government are doing is handing over the money and taking a small tax on profits, 9 per cent, giving them 91 per cent.  Therefore there is no doubt in the world that this outrageous proposal should be stopped without any delay.</P>
    <P>The case has already been explained to Deputies that there is no comparison between taxation relief in relation to capital investment, an industry or a factory, and this kind of thing because at the end they may decide to get out. I do not approve of any of these taxation reliefs at all.  As you probably know, I believe the State should have its own enterprises.  However, accepting that you believe in the private enterprise system and you support these people in the early days of their establishment of industries by giving taxation reliefs, they at least have to leave the factory and machinery behind them, and even if they are a failure you still have those assets, so there is no comparison whatever between this idea in regard to mines and taxation relief for industries, and there never was.  There was never any confusion in the minds of the people who mattered most, these were the mining speculators.  As the Minister points out, since this completely unnecessary row over the changing taxation system, the interest in mining in Ireland has increased rather than diminished.  This is a defence of a totally indefensible position.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the point made by the previous speaker on nationalisation and his hope that this would not happen.  In the first instance, we already own this property and there is no question of nationalising because it already belongs to the State in strict terms of nationalisation.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I am always astonished when I hear our politicians deprecating the idea of nationalisation, because of <Col N="595" /> course one of the few remarkably successful manifestations of native Irish Governments since the State was formed has been the various State capitalistic type nationalised industries &mdash;not nationalised in the true socialist sense, but certainly State-owned and operated: Bord na Móna, the ESB, even CIE, Aer Lingus, Irish Steel Holdings, and so on.  Anyone who wants to quarrel can, because I know their predecessors, private enterprises, were extraordinarily inefficient.</P>
    <P>First of all, they are mostly extremely efficient and very well run and we should be proud of these and, as I say, I am always astonished when I hear speakers deprecating this idea because all around them they see the remarkable success achieved by these organisations during the 40 or 50 years of native Government.  Secondly, all of these are the tough industries&mdash;the ones that private enterprise would have taken if they could have made money out of them, but they could not.  They are the public utilities, so therefore there is no money in them and private enterprise did not go into them.  But we found the capital, enormous capital.  If you relate the capital to present terms, the capital found for these many industries would be quite astronomical now, yet successive Governments, antipathetic to the idea of State enterprise but forced by the disinterest of private enterprise in these areas, went and looked for and got the capital and invested it and created these on the whole magnificent State industries.</P>
    <P>Another intinn sclábhaíochta sort of attitude that these people have, positively frightening to me, is this idea that we have not got the experts, we have not got the technical knowhow&mdash;this kind of thinking as if we were a totally illiterate society.  I can understand that in some of the Third World countries where the poor things, through imperialism and colonialism, have not got any significant educational systems.  It is not true here.  In fact all our State industries have found the experts and the technicians and they are mostly the product of our own universities and schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> Therefore I do not think that that speaker made any case whatever against nationalisation, even if the Minister was proposing that, which I am quite certain he is not.  I do not think it is a valid point and people should not go on making it.  It is thoughtless and does not relate to the facts.  We have been able to get people to do these things, so that should not hinder us in whatever decision we take about how to get the most money out of this kind of enterprise.  We have never had any difficulty in getting capital and of course it is obvious that when you have resources of that kind you will not have a real shortage of a very essential raw material.  There should not be this difficulty.</P>
    <P>I digressed to deal with that statement because it is important coming from the leading Opposition party.  I really believe that it should be discounted by the Minister in his consideration and his approach to this problem.  Through a relative ignorance, we only know what is available to us as ordinary working politicians doing our best to find out the truth with the very limited resources available to us.  Could the Minister give us the precise work-up on the figures, £125 million, £120 million over a 20-year period?  What is that assumption based on?  Is he in a position to say that there is this alleged enormous wealth in, for instance, the Navan mine?</P>
    <P>We all know that enormous sums appear to be made by people other than our own people.  As I said in my introductory remarks, we are a very poor nation as we are at the moment and we simply cannot afford a penny piece to go out of this country. We can use our powers as a sovereign Government to control the exploitation of this raw wealth or material wealth, and if it is true that vast sums are being made on the international money markets out of Irish mining because those people believe they are going to get a clear run from the Government and that the Government are going to take only minimal profits rather like their predecessors, then that is an extraordinary scandal.  If there is this great wealth and if there <Col N="597" /> is at the same time&mdash;and there certainly is&mdash;this great need in every single Department of State concerned with social, educational and other matters, then it seems to me to be a great scandal that the Government are not acting with greater decisiveness by putting an end to this speculation and money-making at the people's expense.  Recently we saw as a result of one deal that Mr. Tony O'Reilly made an enormous sum by buying and selling out shares.</P>
    <P>One figure which appears&mdash;it is a figure at any rate mentioned&mdash;in regard to the mineral zinc lead ore is of course extremely important. This is only one mine, the Navan mine, which has been given as something between 70 million and 80 million tons.  It has been worked out from that that this could equal, when mined, a total of £3,000 million.  These are such staggering figures that it is very hard to credit them.  If they are true, it is a wonderful development for the State.  If they are not true, we should be told.  This is where the Minister's tax policies are going to bite.  How much?  What is the size of that bite?  How much is he going to take from those people?  If there is that enormous wealth there, this figure of £120 million over a 20-year period is, of course, absurdly inadequate.</P>
    <P>Some say that the figure of £3,000 million may be too high and that the figure may be £2,000 million or £1,000 million.  This figure has been worked out by an accountant basing his assessments on the price of zinc and lead at a particular time.  It fluctuates, but mostly it fluctuates upwards.  Prices have gone up because the minerals are essential raw materials and mostly they have fluctuated upwards.  This wealth has this marvellous reality about it that the longer it is left there the more there should be.  Zinc, whatever about other mineral resources, is practically a continually valuable raw material.  If one studies the international financial Press in New York, Canada, Toronto and Britain, it would appear that there is some substance in this <Col N="598" /> claim to that astronomical figure of wealth in the Navan mines.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said in his opening speech&mdash;and the Minister for Foreign Affairs also subscribed to this view&mdash;because of the continued increased interest in mining in Ireland, there appears to be good grounds for believing that there is real money in enormous sums in the ground.  If that is true, this figure of the Minister's is a paltry sum to be taking out for our people over the next 20 years at a time when we need money so badly.</P>
    <P>I have not the slightest pity now, I could not care less about how much we take off these mining speculators, whether they are involved in mining, gas or oil, when I think of the enormous wealth made by exploitation of shortage of essential goods. The inflation which is threatening the whole of the western world at the present time can be traced back to the inordinate greed of these people in exploiting shortage of mineral wealth such as oil, gas and so on.</P>
    <P>For anybody to ask us here to have pity on these poor unfortunate mining speculators or oil speculators or gas people is an extraordinary exercise in absurdity when one thinks that we are at the same time responsible, both here and in the Dáil, for trying to provide a properly-structured social organisation with social justice in our society.  Money is the key to that and the money happens to be there.  There can be no priority given to these people over the needs of the sick, the illiterate, the aged and the homeless in our society.  We apparently have moved into that wonderful, unique, special, happy band which happens to have great mineral wealth. We are establishing no precedent when we turn on these people and tell them to get off our backs and that we will not be exploited by them any more.  The oil-producing OPEC countries, the Middle Eastern countries, have done so.  Kaunda has taken over the mines and taken virtually the total output from these mines for the betterment of his people.</P>
    <P>The acceptance of such a tiny figure by the Members of the Dáil&mdash;and it <Col N="599" /> would look as if it is likely to happen in the Seanad as well&mdash;is quite astonishing to me.  I cannot understand it.  On the very little evidence given in the Minister's opening speech we have no reason whatever for believing that he is making any serious attempt to get the optimum amount of wealth from this great, new, raw material. In fact&mdash;in this respect I agree with the Fianna Fáil speaker&mdash;it is a window-dressing affair, attempting to conceal the total betrayal by the Labour Party, who are committed to total public ownership and so on, of their stated political principles.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister had an opportunity, on behalf of the Government, of telling the various people who have worked on this subject, and those of us who have been concerned, that we were grossly over-optimistic and that our talk about this great new wealth in the heart of the country was not justified.  He could have told us that our enthusiasm was misplaced and that we were misleading the people.  Why has he not done this? Why has he not given us more detailed facts to go on as a basis for his £120 million over 20 years?  We have had this figure of £77 million made up of the amount of wealth it would mean when mined.  That is the Tara mining people's own figure.  Therefore this does not appear to be an extravagant figure.</P>
    <P>When then does this £120 million in 20 years come in, in the light of the Minister's great need for wealth in practically every Department with which he deals?  Even more important to me is why there has been practically total silence on the part of Deputies and the working politician over the years in the Opposition and even in the very short time of a year or year-and-a-half in which we have known about these facts.  Why have we had this conspiracy of silence about this wealth which is said to exist?</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that this is a multi-million type industry.  Enormous sums are at stake for a handful of people.  When these people, whether they are involved in oil, gas, or mines, <Col N="600" /> move in they use all their power to confuse, to mislead, to suppress, to bribe, to cajole and to influence the people making the decisions and the people helping the people to make decisions.  We have seen the present controversy in relation to the relatively trivial sums involved in recent local government activities compared to this and the way these people operate in a situation like this.  I am not saying that that is the reason for the conspiracy of silence, but I believe Deputies and Senators have a responsibility to examine a proposition of this kind in much greater detail than it has been examined up to now.</P>
    <P>I can see no basis whatever put forward by the Minister.  He has not even tried to deal with another very important factor arising out of the mining industry: what is going to happen to this raw material?  Is it going to be smelted in Ireland?  Both the Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to it in passing in the Dáil.  It is vital to know what is going to happen about the smelting of this raw material.  Is it going to happen here?  Are they going to establish a smelter here in Ireland or are they not?  Who gave the Tara Mines people the authority to make contracts with eight different Belgian smelting companies to smelt this raw material?  Why did they do that?  It is an extraordinarily arrogant use of authority.</P>
    <P>It must be obvious to all the Senators that the real wealth is in the smelting.  If the Minister is simply sticking to tax on profits of mines, of course, as an expert on tax matters himself he must know that this is open to the most unlimited armamentarium of tax fiddles organised by these terribly wealthy mining organisations who have, pay and suborn talented accountants to fiddle the tax returns.  One has the extremes of a company in Tipperary which sells to an offshore company.  They sell at $1 and return that as the profit made on a ton of the output.  They sell it then in an offshore island company at something like $50 a ton.  The tax return is completely fraudulent.  Even much more important are the recent <Col N="601" /> discoveries by a House of Commons Committee on the oil industry, the North Sea oil industry, which showed that the British tax people were done out of £1,500 million by the fiddling of the Esso oil company.  I think they are the crowd who have just made the discovery in Cork.  These are the people we are asked to worry about here by the Fianna Fáil Party and to some extent by the Minister's party. Spare your tears.  There are plenty of other people in this country who are more deserving of them.</P>
    <P>What is the position about the smelter?  Are we getting a smelter? Is the mineral wealth going to be smelted in Ireland?  It is when the smelted raw metal is sold that the real money is made.  It is sold on the world markets.  That is where the real money lies.  Is the Minister going after that money?  If he is not, why not?  This is real wealth and they know it.  Tara, Cominco, Oppenheimer, Tony O'Reilly, Mogul and Silver-mines all know that.  All of these people know well that that is where the money is.</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister not going after that money?  What is the reason? Where is his loyalty?  Where is the Cabinet's loyalty?  The Minister for Health is complaining that he cannot pay the doctors enough to give us a good service.  The Government can only provide so many houses.  We can only build so many schools, universities and secondary schools.  There is a need for more roads.  There is not a single Department of State which do not say they cannot fulfil their commitments because it has not got enough money.</P>
    <P>The truth of the matter is that this is an enormously wealthy society. Deputy FitzGerald goes to the EEC looking for more money from the Social Fund and the Regional Development Fund.  It is time we were finished with all this kind of begging-bowl activity.  For heaven's sake, we should learn to give up.  We are one of the wealthiest countries in Europe apparently.  I believe it is totally irresponsible of the Minister, the Cabinet and the Government if these basic facts I have put here are true <Col N="602" /> and if they have not contradicted them.  It is effectively irresponsible of these Houses of the Oireachtas that they should have taken this pitiful figure of £120 million over a 20-year period as the optimum gain from the exploration and use of this new wealth, if anything we hear about that wealth is true.</P>
    <P>Of course, these things interest me. The Minister should understand I am not criticising the Fine Gael Party because, as I think I have said many times, they are acting as they always professed to believe they should act: as a right wing conservative political party which believe that one should conserve society as it is and not change it and should preserve the position of the wealthy privileged minority and keep the others quiet by periodic handouts.</P>
    <P>I am puzzled.  I am less puzzled now, but I am puzzled still by the silence of our friend, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on his failure to produce his White Paper which he promised to the trade union movement, and to us at our Labour Party Conference when he dismissed my plea for information and for verification or refutation of the points of the statement that I have made. &ldquo;Heady stuff&rdquo; he called it.  Apparently if what we read is true, it is not so heady at all.  But, the Minister for Industry and Commerce was able to survive his conference and the meeting with the trade unions by saying that we would get more information. Yet we have not got more information. Now we have this Bill with no information whatever.  As to the true state of this new development in relation to mining wealth, I might tell Senators that an estimate given&mdash;and the Minister can refute this if he wants to&mdash;is the basic one that I mentioned earlier, that is, £3,000 million.  If processed and made into industries based on this raw material it increases in wealth again. It is then multiplied by six or seven if processed into end products and consumer goods, to bring it to something around £14,000 million or £15,000 million.  The Minister will understand my puzzlement when I was given these figures.  They have <Col N="603" /> been stated on many occasions and have never been refuted by either the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Why do we agree to let any more of this wealth go than we have to? Why should we support the Belgian smelting company?  What is the position in relation to smelting?  Is the Minister's figure of £120 million over 20 years based on taxation of the raw material exported to Belgium, the provision of a smelter and then taxation on the sale of the zinc and lead from that smelter?  Is the Minister's assessment made on a very much more far-sighted and enlightened decision to carry on from the stage of creating the raw material and using the method at present being adopted by the Norwegians in their exploitation of their oil&mdash;a very gradual development and release of this raw material to industries based on this precious commodity? Is that what the Minister assessed his figures on?  If that is what he assessed his figures on&mdash;£120 million in 20 years&mdash;something is obviously very askew and somebody is getting away with enormous sums of money at our expense.</P>
    <P>We heard from the Fianna Fáil speaker about how much money is spent on this particular project.  The work was initiated by an unpublished geophysical soil survey by An Foras Talúntais.  I do not know enough about the intricacies of the stock market to understand what has happened since the initial finding of this great strike.  There seems to be something terribly obscene about the way our Government have stood idly by while these people carve up this enormous wealth with the help of their local Irish support organisations of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>Where people go into this business here or abroad speculating in mining &mdash;the Hughes and all these others&mdash; I do not think that they can be blamed for doing this kind of thing.  This is their nature.  They believe in this kind of thing.  They believe in accumulating enormous amounts of wealth for God only knows what reason&mdash;but <Col N="604" /> they do that only tf given the authority of the State or the society in which they operate.  If they have these crude and insensitive and, in my view, essentially unchristian attitudes to society, which allows exploitation for their own need and greed, that is something which society should and can curb.  There are many precedents for it.  As in the emerging countries&mdash; Kuanda and the Middle East&mdash;there are many precedents for it.  There is no reason why the State should stand by and allow these people to indulge themselves in their selfishness.</P>
    <P>In attacking these people we are criticising the wrong people because it is the Minister, as he shows here in this Bill, who can decide on the degree of wealth which he will concede to these people.  Quite obviously I believe that in order to increase the outturn from the mines there should be two forms of taxation&mdash;a taxation in form of royalties of anything up to 90 per cent to 91 per cent &mdash;giving them a take-out of 9 per cent, which would be perfectly adequate for them instead of the absurd amount being suggested here by the Minister.  That figure may sound outrageous.</P>
    <P>It is rather like in wartime when one found it very difficult to understand how 1,000 people could have been killed in a bombing raid.  Equally, it is very hard to take these things in. I honestly believe that many Deputies and probably some Senators do not still understand what has happened in this country, that this extraordinary thing has taken place.  There is no longer the need for this pauperised attitude that, with certain justification, we have had in the past.</P>
    <P>We should try to understand that this wealth exists and that the safest way is to collect in the form of royalties for the mined ore body, zinc and lead, at so much per ton to be taken for the State.  The rate I suggested is 90 per cent to 91 per cent. Off the west coast of America this was done in the case of a very right-wing state.  The oil was offered for sale.  The state was able to take 95 per cent and the speculators were quite happy to <Col N="605" /> take what appeared to be a negligible 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The reality is that we are dealing with sums of such astronomical proportions at the present time that 5 per cent to a company of private individuals is still an enormous sum of money.  This suggestion of 90 per cent to 91 per cent on royalties is still not an outrageous figure.  On top of that there should be a heavy tax on operating profits.</P>
    <P>A tremendously powerful programme is being operated at the present time by these companies to deflect the inquisitive public representative from finding out the truth.  I do not think it is right for the Government to connive at this manipulation of various things.  Everybody is involved so far as I can see.  Everybody must be involved whether they be the Press, television, radio or politicians, but in various ways they are all involved whether by laziness, refusing to bother with the problem, taking the PRO'S hand-out, or submitting to misleading information by people similar to those referred to in the present inquiries in local government in north Dublin.  This kind of thing is in operation while perfectly honourable, honest Deputies and Senators do not bother to examine the information given to them nor find out whether the information supplied from the other side has any basis in fact.  Neither do they insist that their Government examine any such information.  What has happened to the Labour Party in this present situation?</P>
    <P>Why was all this tolerated by this party which are so committed and whose Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Keating, is the key Minister in this situation?  Is this the price of office&mdash;£2,000 million for three or four Cabinet seats?  They are expensive, and not worth it, if one takes into consideration the achievements to date in relation to prices, health, housing, education, agriculture. Where was the gain for this united front, national coalition?  On top of those failures&mdash;failure of price control, failure of the EEC&mdash;probably the greatest betrayal of all that I know of is this silence just now on <Col N="606" /> this very important issue.  There is no doubt in anybody's mind as to whether any of the parties are serious about their protestations of wishing to have the money to do various things in these different aspects of the organisations of the State.  It appears that money is there and because of their obsessional commitment to doctrinaire conservative attitudes, they are siding with the oil, gas and mining speculators against the people, against the sick, against the homeless, against the illiterate, against the aged.  It seems to me an extraordinary truth to have to accept in our society 50 years after it was formed.  But the most unpalatable part of all of that truth is the role in all this of the Labour Party, a party established by James Connolly to create a socialist society, to create social justice for our people and for which the poor man gave his life in the process.  That seems to me to be the greatest single betrayal of all of that party since they took office in this benighted Government.  This is not being said from hindsight.  About a year ago I postulated the inevitability of this kind of a betrayal by the Labour Party when they took their decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little reluctant to contribute to this debate because I think every Senator here knows I have what might be called a vested interest in the mining industry. At least, I can claim a degree of knowledge of the industry. That is something that was patently missing from the two contributions so far in this debate.  Some people seem to think that the mining industry began about ten or 12 years ago.  The first speaker, Senator Hanafin, was obviously under the impression that there are only two significant dates in the mining industry in Ireland: the establishment of Mianraí Teoranta in the early 1940s and the introduction of the 20-year tax free concession in 1967.  I do not know whether Senator Hanafin is ignorant of the mining industry before the 1940s or completely oblivious to what happened between 1940 and 1967, so perhaps a few comments on the industry during <Col N="607" /> a number of years may be useful and possibly illuminating.  I will deal with Senator Browne's contribution in a few moments.</P>
      <P>Mining in Ireland goes back, I suppose, a thousand years and I think there is certainly evidence existing that there was active mining in the country four or five centuries ago.  It has been suggested, with I think some degree of likelihood, that the eighth century Ardagh Chalice&mdash;found, as most Senators will possibly know, in a bog in County Limerick&mdash;was mined from silver recovered from the Silver-mines Mine in County Tipperary, a fact of which I am sure Senators Hanafin and W. O'Brien would have some knowledge.  Mining here has a long, interesting and, on the whole, unfortunate history.  It is only within comparatively few years that mining in Ireland has become a profitable enterprise.  I mention these facts because, listening to some of the latter-day saints talking about the enormous potential wealth to be recovered from Ireland, I think it is just as well to have a look back over the lean years.  I can speak as one who has had some experience of those lean years.  I can remember mining in Ireland in the 1940s and 1950s and indeed in the early 1960s when there were no profits and very considerable losses.  I have the sad memory of standing in a parish hall on the side of a Tipperary hill in the early 1950s and having to tell more than 200 workers that the mine was closing down and that I could see no hope of its ever opening up again.  So far as I can recall Senator Noel Browne was a member of the Dáil in those days.  I do not recall him standing out in opposition to that disaster.  I do not remember him taking up the cudgels on behalf of the miners.  Neither do I remember him enunciating any policy that would help a revival of mining in the country.  In fact, unless I am gravely mistaken.  Senator Browne was very conspicuous by the fact that he did not open his mouth on the mining industry until two or three years ago and then only when the apparently affluent years came into the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="608" /> It is very easy to divide the &ldquo;lolly&rdquo; when there is &ldquo;lolly&rdquo; to be divided.  There is no question about that, but anybody who has any experience of business of any kind&mdash; manufacturing or mining or whatever it happens to be&mdash;would agree that there are bad years as well as good. I suppose the theoreticians tend to forget the bad years and dwell only on the good and on how the profits of the good years should be divided. Mining is different from all other types of industries.  Mining is a high risk, high cost industry.  I think anybody who knows anything about it will agree with that statement.  Every Senator and every Deputy would agree that we should strive to ensure that the largest possible reward from mining or the exploitation of any of our natural resources goes to our own people.  The Minister has given evidence that this is his line of thinking and the line of thinking of the present Government.</P>
    <P>Certain people must get a fair reward if we are to exploit our natural resources to the best benefit of the country.  In the mining and oil industries there are a number of different types of individuals and concerns who play a part.  The speculator has been referred to disparagingly by Senator Browne.  It is usually small companies who take the risk of trying to find some natural resources.  We have all heard of the days of the famous Klondyke goldrush in which the men who found the mines did not belong to large mining companies in Toronto, San Francisco, New York or London.  These men suffered untold hardships in discovering the source of gold which attracted people from every country to North America.</P>
    <P>The people who take the risks are usually people who have not large amounts of capital, but who have the urge to discover and become wealthy. They are a natural part of the process of finding and developing resources in every country in the world. They must get their reward.  Capital must be provided and this cannot be done unless it is acquired by taxation or some other means.  The substantial capital required for mining can only <Col N="609" /> be acquired from people who expect some reward.</P>
    <P>The State must get the maximum reward possible from the exploitation of the natural resources of this or any other country.  But it must be done in such a way as to encourage people to take the risk which is an indivisible part of the search for and exploitation of natural resources. People are prepared to take the risk in the initial stages by putting up some capital and taking the risk of finding nothing.  The odds against finding a mine or an oil well are enormous.  The figures quoted in the Dáil&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;are that out of something over 2,000 prospecting licences issued so far only five viable mines have been discovered and developed. Two of those are in perilous condition. Except for the discovery of the Navan mine our mining discovery would be very limited and none of them would be in operation a decade from now.  Whereas we are a comparatively wealthy country in terms of non-bedded minerals, zinc, lead and to a lesser extent copper, these discoveries without the apparent bonanza of the Tara mine would be comparatively modest.</P>
    <P>I, as an Irishman, have always tried to do something to develop the mining industry and other industries. I can recall when mining restarted after the war&mdash;in the late 1940s and early 1950s&mdash;being unable to get an Irishman to put a shilling into an Irish mine.  They preferred to back a dog or a horse but were not prepared to put money into a hole in the ground.  It is easy to do it now when mining is in vogue and millions are being talked about in the way of profits. I can recall the time when only foreigners would take the risk and that is why they are in the country now exploiting our natural resources.</P>
    <P>Senator Hanafin did not mention this, but the first step to encourage the exploitation of our mineral resources was made in 1956 when the late Gerald Sweetman introduced what is now known as the &ldquo;four-plus-four&rdquo; taxation incentive&mdash;four years at 100 per cent tax-free and <Col N="610" /> four years at 50 per cent tax-free.  I do not recall if Senator Noel Browne was a Member of the Dáil in those days.  If he was, presumably he accepted that.  There is no statement on record that he objected to assisting the miners, who were all foreigners in those days, to come in and exploit our natural resources and to give them these tax incentives.  I do not think Senator Browne opened his mouth at that time.</P>
    <P>The whole situation in mining as in the exploitation of natural resources has changed in recent years.  There may be objections to the decision of the present Government to withdraw the 20 years tax-free allowance.  They can be criticised on the grounds that this was brought in by the previous Government and should not have been withdrawn.  The climate regarding the systems of companies exploiting natural resources has changed during the last decade.  More modern methods of detecting the source of minerals have been found.  The risk is not so great as it was a decade ago and it is obvious that some change was due in the relief in taxation for mines.  The Government had a difficult decision to make but in the ultimate it should prove to be the right one.  I make that statement as a person who might have some grounds for criticism.</P>
    <P>I do not know of any mining company who asked the previous Government to introduce the 20 years tax-free concession.  I have associations with various mining companies, as is generally known, and I have yet to find a company which have asked for that to be introduced.  If it was brought in it was on the initiative of the then Government and Minister and without any pressure from the then existing mining companies.  It is inevitable that a degree of encouragement will have to be given to individuals and companies, and I would hope a growing number of Irish companies would take part in the search for and the development of our natural resources.  The finding of natural resources should be left to private enterprise.  The State should not take the initiative in that regard. <Col N="611" /> The role of the State should come in when the minerals have been discovered and costly steps have been taken to develop them and then negotiations should take place between the companies concerned and the Ministers concerned to decide what reward the State should receive and on what terms a mining lease and other leases should be granted.</P>
    <P>The State then has a right and a duty to step in and to make the best bargain on behalf of the Irish nation. I should like to see the State participating in mining and other natural resource enterprises.  I should like to see the State participating in the equity and the capital of such companies. I should like to see the State representatives sitting on the boards of Irish mining companies.  This would be good for the companies and for the State.  They would realise and appreciate that mining and the exploitation of natural resources is not as easy as some people make it sound. You do not get them by waving a magic wand.  There is hard work involved and years of failure, and the rewards are tiny compared with the effort which must be put into it.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne is right in stating that there has been exploitation.  This exploitation has gone on for far too long.  Some companies have done unduly well out of the exploitation of the natural resources of other countries and some individuals have made vast profits, but people who have been in the industry for a long time and who remember the difficult years can say without contradiction that mining and the ancillary industries do not very often bring the type of rewards that are now being talked of.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister going a step further in encouraging not only exploration in this country and the development of mineral resources but encouraging Irish mining interests, <i>entrepreneurs</i>, to go outside this country and develop natural resources in other countries.  We are so used to sitting tight in this country and watching people coming in from outside to not only exploit our own resources but even to participate to <Col N="612" /> a very substantial degree in our whole industrial fabric that the idea of going abroad as <i>entrepreneurs</i> ourselves and doing it seems sometimes to be lost in us.  The merchanting spirit seems to be dead within us at times.</P>
    <P>Now is the time, particularly since we have become members of the EEC, when we should be thinking not alone of retaining the biggest possible proportion of and getting the greatest possible reward from our own mining, manufacturing and other enterprises but going out and doing the same thing in other countries.  I should like to see this spirit of initiative and enterprise encouraged.  The Americans have been doing this for years.  They managed to look after and conserve their own resources by encouraging their nationals to go abroad and exploit and develop resources in other countries.  I am not saying that was necessarily a good thing.  In fact it was abused, as we all know.  But I think our people should be encouraged to look outward as well as inward.  I hope the Minister and the Government at some future date will consider giving encouragement to Irish mining and other interests to do that.</P>
    <P>Millions have been tossed around in regard to the future reward from mines but the whole history of mining over many years&mdash;these are not my words; they are the words of other people who know much more about it than I do&mdash;has been an up-and-down history.  While the Minister is estimating that during the next 20 years the Irish economy will benefit to the extent of £125 million, it could be substantially greater.  As we know, in the past five or six years the price of mining metal, lead, zinc and copper, has gone up to astronomical heights but so also have other commodities. That does not go on forever and if there is a downturn in the price of metals mines existing in potential could find their profits drastically squeezed. One thing is certain: costs are not going to come down.  Any estimate made by the Minister or his Department or anybody else is based on current costs and, obviously, on the current prices of metals.  The price of metals could change.  In fact they are <Col N="613" /> already changing.  The prices of some base metals has gone down by at least 40 per cent to 50 per cent and may go lower.  Whereas you have the enormous profits being made on the upswing you could make equally substantial losses on the downswing.  I hope that will not happen to the Irish mining industries but I must point out that this is what has happened during 100 years or more in retrospect in the history of mining.  Indeed the mine with which I am associated closed down for that reason, because in the early 1950s the price of base metals dropped to such a level that the mine could not operate profitably and it had to close down. Nobody got any reward out of it, either the people who put up the capital to develop the mine nor the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made, again by Senator Browne, of the establishment of a smelter.  Here I agree completely with him.  However, there is no good in talking about establishing a smelter unless it is an economic proposition. I believe that, with the discovery of Tara and Navan with its enormous potential, and even allowing for certain disagreements about what exactly the ore reserves are there, it would now seem that the situation has been reached when the establishment of a smelter would be an economic proposition.</P>
    <P>Here again I should like to reiterate my own personal views.  I should like to see the Irish Government participating substantially in such a development.  Smelting does not always pay either.  We get all this talk about rosy profits from processing the ore to the ultimate, but it does not always happen that way.  Smelters have lost money, too, believe it or not, just the same as mining companies. But I think this country should be in a position to process its ores, whatever type of ores they may be, to the ultimate, provided it is an economic proposition.  Even if it were to be a very marginal proposition I would still be in favour of it.  I think it would be a good thing economically for this country to have its own smelter.  I hope the examination of this possibility will not be left entirely to outside <Col N="614" /> interests.  We have all read recently where certain of the big Canadian mining companies are looking at the project again.  If there is to be any further looking at the project I should like to see the Irish Government in on it and in on the participation when that comes about.</P>
    <P>With regard to Mianraí Teoranta, they could have done all the things we are talking about doing now 20 years ago&mdash;I will not say if they wanted to do it; I am sure there were individuals then as there are now in Mianraí Teoranta who would love to have been associated with the finding and development of Irish mines&mdash;but Mianraí Teoranta were set up in 1940 or 1942, were given no funds and given no personnel.  They were set up to explore for minerals.  They had the power to exploit minerals if they so desired, but they never did anything. It was willy-nilly left to private enterprise to develop the mining industry in this country for better or, as some people apparently think, for worse.</P>
    <P>Those are the facts of the case.  I think there is a part to play for an Irish mining company set up by the State, but the pity is that that company did not engage in exploration over the years.  In how much stronger a position would an Irish Government today or even 20 years ago have been if a proper and effective survey had been done for minerals in this country. Then we would have been in a strong bargaining position.  We left ourselves&mdash;and successive Governments must take the blame for this&mdash; in the position that you either had foreigners coming in to do the exploitation or it was not exploited at all.  If it were to come to a choice between leaving this natural wealth unexploited in the ground and suffering continuing emigration, most of us would rather have anybody from outside come in and exploit the minerals and keep our people working at home. It is a poor consolation to have mineral wealth 100 feet or 200 feet or 500 feet underground and Irish men out in Toronto or in Texas working other mines.</P>
    <P>When it comes down to a choice over the past&mdash;I am talking about <Col N="615" /> giving credit where credit is due to successive Governments in this regard &mdash;the policy was right to encourage people to come in to open up the mines to develop them and to give employment.  An enormous amount of highly-paid employment has been given.  In the process we are training technicians in an active mining industry, which is the important thing. It is easy to talk as if the State can raise the money.  There are growing numbers of people and technicians who are interested in manning the mines but they were not available 20 or even ten years ago.  We did not have a mining industry; we did not have a school of mining; we did not have technicians; the capital was not available.</P>
    <P>This situation is changing now.  I hope, and certainly it is my fondest wish, that as the years go on the Irish people, either through private enterprise or through State participation in addition, will take a greater grip on the development of their own natural resources.  They will not do it by making airy-fairy speeches in the Houses of Parliament; they will do it by putting their hands in their own pockets and by training their own people to do these things.  I do not know of any other answer than that. Some people may have theoretical ideas of how it can be done, but in the final analysis those who try succeed, and they are generally the fellows who work and those who put their hands in their pockets.  That has been my experience over many years.  They are not the theoreticians who make airy-fairy speeches about things of which they know little or nothing.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say very much about the Bill.  I would cavil at one or two sections, although the proper time to do so would be on the Committee Stage.  I am not at all satisfied&mdash;the Minister knows this&mdash;that despite his declared intention, profits prior to 6th April this year will be free of tax.  It is a complete matter. I know that the introduction of corporation tax this year on top of income tax complicates the situation <Col N="616" /> still more.  However I still feel that there is an element of retrospective taxation in regard to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am also sorry that in a section of the Bill where he allows subsidiary companies in a group of companies to set off abortive or any other exploration expenses incurred against the parent company or other companies in the group, this is only permitted where the subsidiary is 100 per cent owned by the parent company.  I read the Dáil debate and the Minister talked about 25 per cent of a hole in the ground or something. It was an illustration, although one I find hard to follow.  I do not think you can buy 25 per cent of holes in the ground, It is a very difficult thing to do.  A subsidiary should qualify; what is normally regarded as a subsidiary company in ordinary commercial practice should be also so regarded in the case of mining.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also decided that abortive expenditure after ten years will not apply.  You cannot set off expenses of any kind, for abortive exploration expenditure or anything else, unless you make a profit.  The State therefore would not lose any revenue unless profits were made in this case by the parent company.  Perhaps the Minister could not write everything into the Bill or please everyone.  He has done a reasonable job in trying to meet various representations made to him.  He is also in a difficult situation in regard to the whole question of mining and the rewards that should be given to the various interested parties.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope that this Bill will continue to give encouragement to people and companies, preferably native companies, to continue the search for natural resources in this country either on land or off our shores.  It can only be done if we, ourselves, are prepared to show the necessary initiative, take the necessary risks and put up the necessary capital. Human nature being what it is, nobody will do this unless satisfied he will get a fair reward comparable to the risks taken.  I do not believe in giving out easy rewards to speculators <Col N="617" /> of any kind: I am totally opposed to them.  I believe that the men of enterprise should be rewarded.  Not only are they doing good for themselves; they are doing a good job for the community.  It is the Minister's job to ensure that profits which accrue from such enterprises are fairly divided with the lion's share going to our own people.</P>
    <P>Here again I find myself in agreement with Senator Dr. Browne.  We have a lot of leeway to make up in regard to the provision of houses, adequate health services and so on for our own people.  It is right that we should use the development of our own natural resources to provide the capital for these developments.  However you will not do it unless you encourage the type of people who are prepared to take that risk, do the work and put up the capital, unless you give them a fair crack of the whip.  How that is done is a matter for the Government of the day.  The present Government are on the whole doing the best job they can in difficult circumstances.  The Minister knows my views on certain sections of this Bill.  I think that the Bill would be improved by accepting my views: that is a personal view; probably the Minister has other ideas.  The mining industry in this country is in a healthy state and I believe that other mines will be found.  We must ensure that the tempo is maintained.  The greatest potential probably lies in offshore oil and gas.  At this stage nobody can say, but we must give a fair opportunity to the men who are prepared to take the risk: give them a fair reward and then ensure that our people get the largest possible slice of the cake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long but I have a few short observations to make which occurred to me while listening to the Minister's opening speech and remarks made by other speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In years gone by there was scant recognition in school geographies of mineral potential in our country.  The few lines given positively stated that there were practically no mineral <Col N="618" /> resources within the limits of our island, but that our neighbouring island of England was very rich in deposits of coal and iron and other minerals.  We had to learn by heart the names of the many British coal-mines and where the iron industries were situated.  For much of our lives we were led to believe that there did not appear to be anything of any interest in Ireland underneath the ground.  It was only when war broke out that the Government decided to exploit what was visible, the turf resources, and to use water for generating electricity.</P>
    <P>For thousands of years there has been a certain amount of mineral exploration despite the fact that the geographies in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries seemed to ignore it completely.  History tells us that thousands of years ago mines were in operation.  We also know that during the rising of 1641 iron was mined in many parts.  In 1948, I remember coal mines being operated in my own county.  This industry nearly collapsed overnight.  Were it not for the fact that the Government provided a coal-burning station at Arigna, the mining industry in that area would also have collapsed.</P>
    <P>This illustrates that, as the previous speaker said, there is a great element of risk involved in mining.  Until very recently it was a field that the individual or private enterprise could not enter.  There was always the danger that all the money would go down the drain.  I know some people who did speculate in the coalmining industry and they lost their entire resources.</P>
    <P>When mining was established, thanks to men such as Mr. Hughes &mdash;a Fermanagh man and a neighbour of my own who gained experience in Toronto&mdash;and other men, who used the latest devices and techniques, the most important strike was made in Tynagh in County Galway.  People then became very conscious about mining and the wealth it offered both for individuals and for the nation as a whole.  I remember the time when I was in the Dáil when it was necessary for the Government to vote a <Col N="619" /> very large sum of taxpayers' money to salvage the copper mines in County Wicklow.  Copper prices on the international market had fallen.  Some time prior to that the experts had said there was no danger whatever.  As an individual, I can see the tremendous risk envisaged in the copper mines in Wicklow and in coal mining in other parts of the country.  For that reason we must admit that those who invest their money in this gamble are taking a risk.  It was events such as these that prompted the previous Government to provide more incentive for people to invest their capital in exploration in this country.</P>
    <P>When the explorations were successful there was an immediate outcry to ensure that the speculators did not get away with vast profits.  It was only by using the latest techniques and equipment that these natural resources were brought nearer the surface.  I remember the Ambassador Oil Company exploring for oil and gas in my own county.  During that drilling they also discovered some gypsum in the area.  I have yet to see any effort being made to develop any gypsum in that area.  The company also discovered gas but in very small quantities. That was back in the period 1961 to 1963.  Since then techniques have improved immensely.  We are all delighted with the news of oil down in Cork.  Up north we may envy these Cork people; they seem to get the best on every occasion and we certainly wish them luck if they have actually discovered oil and gas because it will be of tremendous advantage to the country.</P>
    <P>No outsider could blame us if, in the event of oil or gas being discovered, the Government tried to cash in on that effort.  After all we have witnessed in the past 12 months what other well-established companies have done in the Middle East.  They have trebled the price of oil coming into this country.  If we discovered oil nobody could say we were unreasonable if the Government took a large slice of the profits to ensure a better standard of living for our people.</P>
    <P>The 20-year concession of tax <Col N="620" /> eexemption was made a few years ago when there did not seem to be any great possibility of finding oil or gas and when oil was not as valuable as it is now.  If the present Government feel like changing the law for the benefit of the people I would not oppose it.</P>
    <P>Criticism was made of the Government for not setting up State companies to exploit these minerals for the benefit of the nation.  The State companies which have operated up to now have done a great job, but they have been operating on the surface where it is comparatively easy to assess what is at stake.  Anybody will agree that when you explore under the earth you are taking a financial risk.  If somebody takes a risk with their own money that is their own business.  If a State company were to take a financial risk with a large amount of money contributed by the taxpayers, there would be criticism from those who had advocated the operation in the beginning.  If it was a success they would take the credit but it was a failure the company would be blamed for investing the taxpayers' money in a white elephant.  We have seen this happen in other operations.</P>
    <P>I should like to see excessive profits taxed.  We are only a developing country and not very long established. During that period, irrespective of what Government was in office, we had to build up the country, something which the present generation do not fully realise.  We did not inherit very much from the British Government except a legacy of bad housing and roads.  It is to our credit that without a penny from any other country we have progressed so far.  We should then expect that if speculators come into this country they stand to gain immensely.  However, the Government should take a reasonable profit in order to improve our social services.</P>
    <P>There has been talk for many years of the establishment of a smelter and there have been many discussions in the papers as to its location.  I do not know the cost of it or what materials would be available for it when established.  The Minister should consider the matter if there is an employment <Col N="621" /> potential in it for our people or for people in areas where there are many unemployed at present.  Unfortunately, we still have a large proportion of our people unemployed. We may be on the eve of a breakthrough. We do not want to do anything that would discourage any firm with capital from coming to Ireland. We do not want to tax them out of existence.  But we do know from profits and accounts published that mining and smelting is a very profitable game if you come out on the lucky side.  If that happens there should be some method whereby we could charge them on a tonnage basis on what they are producing or adopt some method whereby the Government would benefit from such an operation.  There must be a marked gain in revenue so as to provide good living standards for our people from any enterprise which eventually turns out to be very successful and makes a great profit.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I am not an expert on mining or on stocks and shares.  I am an ordinary man who takes a look around me and sees what is happening.  I know from experience that mining is a very difficult, hazardous and unpredictable occupation.  There will always be people who will venture in&mdash;fools often venture in where wise men fear to tread.  I know many people have taken a risk and have been ruined financially.  There are others whom this risk will not deter.  If they come to Ireland we will treat them reasonably well.  They could not expect us to hand everything over to them and allow them to go off with all the profits.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill as a limited measure to improve the way in which we are developing the natural resources of this country or allowing them to be developed for the benefit of the people.  I welcome it because it will repeal the 20-year tax exemption which was granted in the Income Tax Act of 1967, for profits arising from the mining of scheduled minerals; and because it will replace this with a system of tax allowances dating from April of this year.  I believe, <Col N="622" /> however, that this is a very limited measure which reflects thinking which may have been relevant a few years ago.  Indeed, the Minister said it was based on the recommendations of an interdepartmental committee set up in 1971.  It is my view however that this Bill is not sufficiently related to the context of 1974 and to the immediate future crisis over the next few years: it does not take into account the vastly-changed world situation, particularly in relation to the availability of energy and raw materials or the very serious balance of payments problem which the countries of western Europe and countries of the world are going to have because of the increased costs, particularly of oil and also of food, fertilisers and the sort of base metals which we are discussing in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I would also submit that the debate itself does not reflect the radical change in world circumstances, in which we should be examining the natural resources which we are fortunate enough to possess.  It is in this context we should look at the way in which we can safeguard these raw materials, the way in which we can get sufficient expert advice on how to cope with serious problems over the next couple of years.  We need a coherent policy on the way in which we can benefit ourselves, first of all. As the old cliché says, charity must begin at home.  But we must also play our part in the international effort to assist the developing countries; the &ldquo;fourth world countries&rdquo; as they are now called, who do not have any natural resources at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I propose to set this particular Bill in a challenging framework which I believe we have not examined with sufficient seriousness. I welcome the opportunity to look at this whole question of the exploitation of our natural resources.  The Minister mentioned an inter-departmental committee which was set up in 1971. He also made reference to previous attempts to exploit our own natural resources, and Senator Russell also made reference to these previous attempts: Yet, this past experience has no bearing on the immediate <Col N="623" /> present and the situation from now on, because there has been a radical change in the balance of power in the world and the consequent attitude towards resources and raw materials. I should like to have some indication from the Minister that this is not the end of governmental control but a very preliminary step in a series of measures which will allow us to adjust to this radical, new situation, which will allow us to benefit as much as possible from the fortunate circumstances that we have this mineral wealth.</P>
    <P>We shall have to face up to a situation in which we must meet very serious balance of payments problems which we and other countries will encounter in the next few years to pay for the increase in oil prices.  I would welcome some information or indication from the Minister of the degree to which there is a concerted study by the Government, being conducted in the light of this change in world circumstances, which is the context in which we must assess this particular measure.  I join with those Senators who have urged the development of a smelter here and the processing in so far as possible in this country of the raw materials and mineral wealth which is found beneath the soil of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The old problems of getting capital to do this no longer exist and we would get the capital, the expertise and any other assistance necessary to a small country.  I think we can now call the tune on this because of the vastly changed world circumstances. I should like an assurance from the Minister that a genuine attempt is being made to exploit the feasibility of establishing a smelter to process mineral wealth in this country with the vastly greater benefits entailed for this country.  Those who feel that any international mining concerns might express either anger or irritation at the attitude of a poor country like Ireland are being totally unrealistic in present world circumstances. We can in fact call a very considerable tune now, because of the urgent need for precisely this mineral wealth and raw materials.  The Government <Col N="624" /> should be sharply aware of just how limited a measure the removal of a 20-year tax exemption is, instead of congratulating themselves on it.</P>
    <P>We must assess this problem in the light of the immense efforts that will be necessary over the next few years to exploit the existing resources, to try to find new sources of energy and new sources of raw material in areas where they have not been found before, preferably in areas such as western Europe where the political problems are not as evident as they are in the Middel East, for example.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I feel that a great deal of the debate here and in the other House on this subject is out of date. It does not take into account the vastly changed world circumstances in this area, it does not take into account the urgent need of multi-national companies and of governments to find and exploit the raw materials that we have, the minerals that we have, as part of an ever-increasing demand and as necessary in order to compensate for the attitude of the OPEC countries or the raw material producing countries in other parts of the world&mdash;for example in Latin America where they are calling a much stronger tune than we would ever want to or be advised to call on raw materials.</P>
    <P>What I would fear is that our thinking would not adjust to this new circumstance. I would fear that we would not have the expertise at the time when it is needed and I would fear that we would not even have the imagination to use the expertise to call in assistance when it is required. There would be no difficulty in getting the capital to exploit and process in this country our own raw materials. By doing so we would benefit ourselves most substantially from this exploitation.</P>
    <P>The way in which I believe this could be done to maximum advantage would be by substantial Government participation in this exploitation and processing in our own country of the raw materials and, of course, of the energy sources which become available in the country.  We must not look at this problem even from last year's <Col N="625" /> perspective.  We must relate it to the predictions and the evidence of a totally changed situation and of the very real problems which will face the countries not only of western Europe but of the world in general because of a totally changing situation.  Anybody who thinks that I am exaggerating has only to look at the estimates of the World Bank about the named deprived developing countries who do not have any leverage because they do not have any energy sources or any raw materials of their own and who are on the brink of starvation. The larger the number of people one talks about the less real the problem seems.  The World Bank prediction is of one billion people on the brink of starvation unless there is an emergency fund of $3 billion this year and probably $4 billion or $5 billion in the next couple of years as concessionary aid to rescue them from disaster and death.</P>
    <P>This, then is the dimension at a world level of the problem in which we see ourselves as a small country, very dependent on energy resources from outside&mdash;very dependent on imports of oil and other materials&mdash; with a vastly worsening balance of payments situation in that respect. What have we got?  Where can we look at the moment as a small still largely agricultural country in an attempt to redress this balance except to the fortunate awareness that we have now found raw materials in the form of mineral wealth and of the potential for oil and gas exploration around the coast.</P>
    <P>I do not think I would be able to assess the technical and expert information on this but I have a political awareness of the dimension of the problems which we are facing and which other countries in western Europe are facing.  There is a good deal of doubt as to whether democracies are flexible enough to cope with the particular problems which we will be facing.  I should like reassurance from the Minister on several points.  I hope this is not the last measure we will see in relation to our own raw materials in the current year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a problem which is so well known to the citizens of Dublin that it does not need much background, and that is the problem of a shortage of taxis in the city of Dublin.  I am not raising it because it has been brought home to the public during the bus strike. This is a perennial problem which has been with us for a certain time. After 11.30 every evening it is as if there were no bus strike.  People who do not have their own private cars, such as myself, and who wish to travel any distance in the city experience considerable difficulty in getting taxis either by going to a rank or by ringing one of the radio cab phones.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise to the Minister the general disquiet at the difficulty in obtaining taxis.  This hits one section of the community more than the others.  The section of the community it hits are the poorer people&mdash;the people who do not own cars and particularly those people who work late in the city and who finish their occupations after 11.30 p.m. when the buses have ceased, if they are running normally &mdash;people such as waitresses, hotel porters, barmen and the staff in Leinster House.  Every night we sit until 10 o'clock they do not get off until 11 o'clock.  I was talking to one of the staff this afternoon who said that sometimes they had to wait for an hour or an hour and a half to get a taxi home.  Where there is a shortage of a commodity, the worse off section of the community are those who are made to feel this shortage the most.  Members of the Oireachtas probably drive in and out to Leinster House so they will not be faced with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This situation is to some extent attributable to the Minister for Local Government and his Department because he has some power to make regulations which would regularise the taxi service in the city.  Another group of people who suffer considerably from taxi shortage are tourists. Tourists come to Ireland generally without their own cars: only a very <Col N="627" /> small proportion of our tourists bring cars with them.  They arrive, stay in the hotels and to move around they generally use taxis.  There are frequent complaints from tourists and indeed from the people in hotels who have to obtatin taxis for them and who get the brunt of their complaints. Therefore, the shortage of taxis in the city of Dublin has a very unfortunate effect on our tourist trade.  I have met a number of visitors here who say they are not prepared to come back and certainly not stay in the city of Dublin if the taxi situation does not improve because it has such an inhibiting effect on their movements.</P>
    <P>I have travelled a certain amount myself in other European cities and cities in North America and I would say that our taxi service ranks among the worst in any of the major cities I know.  Not only are the taxis difficult to obtain but they are also not uniform in their standard of condition of the vehicle, the cleanliness of the vehicle. Generally there is a lack of uniformity, there is a lack of standardisation and there is a lack of service.  There is too much of a lackadaisical attitude about our taximen and I feel that anything that could be done by means of public pressure, by means of complaints, by means of action by the Minister to regularise the situation, to improve the standards and the availability of the cars or, in fact, the standards of the cars themselves, the general cleanliness, the general spirit in which the taximen operate, would be worth doing.</P>
    <P>Under section 82 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, the Minister for Local Government is empowered to make regulations governing the basic running of the taxi service.  At present in Dublin all taxis are driver owned.  In other words, the driver owns the taxis and then a central service is provided&mdash;a radio control is provided which people can ring and the radio control contacts the taxi in the area and send it out to the specific address.  All but one of the radio control companies are co-ops, in other words, operated by the taximen themselves.  Some years ago there were a number of privately owned firms but they have all left the business and <Col N="628" /> the taxi owners, the co-ops, run the radio control in all except one case.</P>
    <P>My contention is that, as governed by regulations made by the Minister for Local Government, the situation has been made too favourable to taximen and, as a result of the lack of competition and of the deterioration in standard owing to taximen only taking the road at certain times when is suits them, the service has declined.  The provision of taxis in the city is an important facility.  Like the position of hotel staff, taximen cannot just expect to work the present popular hours and not to be available at other times of the day, particularly the early morning. There must be some availability if we are to have a service.</P>
    <P>The Minister has power to grant licences.  He regulates the granting of licences to taximen.  There are two licences.  You must have a public service licence to drive the vehicle and then the vehicle itself must be licenced.  The issuing of these licences is governed by regulations which are made by the Minister under the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  Prior to 1970, applications for taxi licences could be made at any time of the year and in Statutory Instrument 138, 1970, applications for a taxi licence could be made only four times in the year, once in each quarter.  In Statutory Instrument 225, 1973, this was restricted to the period of one fortnight in the year.  This was done by the present Minister for Local Government and it has meant that it is not as easy to get a licence as it was before&mdash;the period for licensing is restricted.  Certain other regulations have been made.  Applicants who have not held licences before have to pay a considerably larger fee &mdash;something like £30 as compared to £3 which is the fee for people who have held licences for a number of years.  New applicants for taxi licences must have cars of less than two years of age.  There is some point in the final regulation because it is an attempt to improve the standard of the car that is being used, but the effect of these Statutory Instruments and the effect of the limitation on the time at which licences can be applied for has been a decrease in the <Col N="629" /> number of applicants and consolidation of a system which is already inefficient.</P>
    <P>One of the ways of rectifying the taxi situation in Dublin is to open it more to private enterprise rather than closing it down.  I do not wish to see a change away from the private enterprise system that operates in Dublin, but if one is to have private enterprise why not have the benefits of private enterprise?  Private enterprise produces efficient taxi systems in other cities.  Why cannot it do the same here?  The private enterprise system will be governed by the Minister for Local Government.  He is going to make the regulations which will control the system and there is no reason why the regulations under which taximen operate should not be stiffer.  For example there could be staggered periods.  There is no reason to grant a completely open licence for operation.  Taximen could use a sticker and they could operate, say, staggered hours from midnight to 8 p.m. on certain days, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on other days, 4 p.m. to midnight on other days of the week.  By working a rota system like this and insisting that taxi drivers work certain unpopular hours it would help to cover the hours at which it is difficult to obtain taxis.  This sticker system is used successfully in other cities.  There is also the familiar scene in other cities where taxis have either a standard appearance or a standard colour.</P>
    <P>One of the problems facing the Minister and his Department in attempting to make regulations governing our taxis is that persons take out a taxi licence, operate for a short time and then drop out.  Licences could be made more easy to obtain and could be more readily available, provided certain minimum standards were met and if there was some way of ensuring that the people who operated taxis were full-time taximen.  For example, one could either say: &ldquo;O.K., if you are going to operate taxis you must paint your car a specific colour,&rdquo; such as yellow in New York.  This has several advantages.  It makes it easier for the people who are trying to pick up taxis in the street.  The yellow cab <Col N="630" /> can be picked out a long distance from the intending hire passenger.</P>
    <P>In London there is the special type of car which is used as a taxi.  It has another advantage in that it is driven on cheaper fuel, as it is a diesel burning vehicle rather than petrol.  The diesel fuel means that taxi prices are lower than they would be if the car were running on petrol fuel.  There is also more mileage.  There is an advantage in having this standardised type of cab and there should be no objection to paying a reasonable fare.  The fares are set by regulation.  The service should be reasonably available. I am not stating that if one goes out at 4 o'clock in the morning and calls for a taxi that one should immediately appear, but in a capital city such as Dublin and which has a large number of visitors we should be able to lay on a 24-hour taxi service.</P>
    <P>It is illegal for a taximan to pick up more than one fare on the same journey if the first fare does not wish. He is not permitted to charge two people the same fare for going the same distance.  It is being done consistently right across the board.  Four people get into a taxi, they are all charged the same fare, and this is illegal as the law stands.  There is no reason why a taximan should not be entitled to charge people a fare and split it over the whole cost.  Fares can only be raised if we are getting a proper service.  The Minister has it in his power to make regulations.  He makes regulations as regards the handing out of licences.  That is the crucial matter, and our taxi service is far below standard.  It would be worth opening the system more to private enterprise and allowing more taxis on to the street provided the minimum restrictions were observed.  Then we might provide a better service than the present poor one.</P>

      <P>Although Senator West stated the present bus strike did not influence him in putting down this motion, subconsciously I feel this is the reason why it was put down.  At the present time people who never use a taxi feel there should be taxis waiting for them every time they want <Col N="631" /> one.  Senator West wants to have it both ways.  I will attempt to show this in the few minutes I have at my disposal. I am amused at the fellow who comes out of a house anywhere in this city at 3 o'clock in the morning, maybe once a month, puts up his hand and then complains when a taxi does not appear in five minutes.  There are a few people like Senator West who complain about the bad taxi service here as compared with the other cities which he has visited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been using one for the past 18 months.  Before that I used my own car and before that I used the bus because I could not afford to use a taxi.  I am surprised that Senator West does not know that working people do not as a rule use a taxi because they cannot afford them. They will only use a taxi late at night.  I would be interested if Senator West would let me know the person in this House who was working late and had to wait an hour and a half for a taxi.  This kind of complaint made by one working man against another working man is most unfair. Senator West stated I had power to make regulations governing the operation of taxis.  I have no such power.  I can make regulations governing the standards but not governing the operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me explain it.  The licensing period has not reduced the number of taxis&mdash;the number of new entrants is as many as before, when it scattered over the year.  The difference is that people coming in now stay in the business.  Before, a person could come in, pick the cream of the business for a couple of months and get out again and the people who were trying to make a living out of it were left without their living for the rest of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has had 20 minutes.  Please permit me to make my reply.  Senator West talked about the rota system.  I have no power to tell a taximan when he should work. I am amused at the suggestion that it is a private enterprise but that the State should have the right to tell them what to do.  State intervention is not welcomed by private enterprise.  I have no power to regulate the time taximen work.</P>
      <P>I will give figures of the numbers of taxis here.  They endeavour to operate when they make the most money.  A taximan is entitled to have a decent living just as much as a Member of this House.  The taximan who is operating and giving a good service should be encouraged and we should not encourage others to enter that service who will not be prepared to carry out the minimum regulations which are laid down.  Until the regulations were put in by my predecessor and continued by me, the standard of taxi service which was being given was not as good as it now is.  The type of taxi which is being introduced now into the business must be not more than two years old.  The old rattle-trap which was to be seen in the streets of Dublin some time ago is gone.</P>
      <P>The standard of cleanliness is laid down by my Department but it is the Garda who are responsible for insisting on this being carried out.  If complaints are made they should be made to the Garda.  Regarding the question of complaints in general, there are not so many of these.  Complaints sometimes come from tourists. Complaints very often come from hotels, for instance, but it could happen that the people who are running the taxi service at the hotel had an arrangement, as they have in practically every city in the world, with a taxi or taxi service.  If that taxi was not available they might not be very keen on going to a lot of trouble to look for another taxi elsewhere.  This may be one of the causes of complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of the co-op service, I am delighted to see the taximen forming more co-ops and running their own service.  I do not <Col N="633" /> see any reason at all why a third party should sit back and pick up the cream and pay as little as he can get away with to those who are operating the taxi service.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a misunderstand-about the number of taxis in operation, and in fairness I should give the figures to the House.  Dublin, which has a population of 750,000 approximately, has 1,437 taxis&mdash;522 persons per taxi.  Glasgow has 1,000 persons per taxi&mdash;there is no question of a set figure with which one can compare&mdash; Leeds has 3,249 persons per taxi; Sheffield has 2,185 per taxi; Antwerp, 3,116; Stockholm, 625; Gottenburg, 956; Toronto, 1,000; Winnipeg, 625; London has 800 persons per taxi. Senator West referred to the good taxi service in London compared with here. There are 800 persons per taxi in London and 522 in Dublin.  Birmingham has 5,476 persons per taxi; Liverpool, 1,812; Manchester, 1,686; Nottingham, 1,268; Belfast, 1,464 and Derry, 960 persons per taxi.  In fact there are more taxis in Dublin in proportion to the population than in all of the other cities I have read out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>But is the service as good?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This again is the type of thinking; if you go abroad everything is better but if you come back to Ireland the services are worse.  This is the sort of thinking with which I do not agree and I cannot agree.  I think from my limited experience that the taxi service in Dublin is as good as can be expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing which is causing a certain amount of trouble&mdash;again the Garda are doing their best to cope with it&mdash;and which has become too prevalent. A person may go out with a taxi at night with his day's takings in his <Col N="634" /> pocket, some bright boy will hire the taxi, bring him a little bit outside the city and take it from him.  Then we hear people say: &ldquo;Why do we not have taxis available all night?  Why does every taximan in Dublin not line up in O'Connell Street even though he may get only one fare?&rdquo; I cannot introduce a regulation which will say that taxis should ply between this hour and that hour&mdash;even if I could I would be very slow to do it&mdash;because it could mean that somebody with a taxi would get a stint which would turn up two fares for him and he would not stay very long in the business.</P>
    <P>I know that the Dublin taxi service is not perfect.  At the present time because of the big demand on it there is naturally more criticism of it.  The ordinary reasonable person would agree that it would be a mistake to go back to the days when anybody who felt he would like to have a fling at it entered the taxi service, stayed in it for a while, got what he could out of it and then disappeared. There was no way of saying that there was a set number of taxis.</P>
    <P>I share with Senator West the desire to have a good taxi service in this city but I believe every effort is being made by the very decent people who are operating the taxi service in this country&mdash;and that includes the co-op people&mdash;to produce the best possible service.  I think they are doing reasonably well.  I would ask those who are complaining about it to realise that if they were put in the same position they would probably not be inclined to do the things which the taximen have to do to give that service.</P>
