      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive.  If the Appropriation Bill comes from the Dáil&mdash;we anticipate that we will get it at about 5 o'clock&mdash;it is proposed to add it after No. 9.  Then No. 11 will be taken, although it is unlikely that No. 11 will be reached if we get the Appropriation Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to propose a slight amendment to the Order of Business.  It is that item No. 18&mdash; motion:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the McKinsey Report on &ldquo;Defining the Role of Public Transport in a Changing Environment&rdquo; laid before the Seanad on 30th September, 1971.</P>
      <P>in the names of myself and Senator O'Brien, be taken jointly with item No. 8, the Transport (No. 2) Bill, 1974.</P>

      <P>We are not objecting to the Order of Business, except that these matters have come to us from the Dáil and we are more than willing to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However one must enter a protest about the way the Government have not been ordering their legislative business.  As we know&mdash;and we have been criticised for it&mdash;this House has been idle since last July.  A couple of days ago, in a radio broadcast, a Government Deputy had what I can only describe as the greatest impudence <Col N="192" /> to complain about the lack of business in the Seanad.  The reason for the lack of business was that the Government have been totally unable to produce any kind of legislative programme. Now, in the week before Christmas, we have been given a number of Bills, none of which is of fundamental importance. None of them has anything to do with the real national crisis that faces us.  They are all minor matters of routine business which clearly were known to have been necessary months ago and could have been brought in then.  It is typical of the utter incompetence of the way in which legislation has been carried out by this Government that we are now given these perfectly routine Bills in the week before Christmas at a time when there is no legislation of any importance to deal with the state of the country.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Senator West's request.  There is an extraordinary number of motions on today's Order Paper which may never be taken, judging by the speed at which business is being done and the frequency at which we meet.  It would be a step in the right direction if the McKinsey Report, which is profoundly relevant, could be taken with the Transport Bill.  In this way, we would get one motion off the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>I have not had an opportunity this morning of discussing Senator West's proposals with the Minister.  I know the Minister has expressed himself as perfectly willing to have this motion taken early, and I am sure he would have no objection to having it discussed with the Transport Bill.  I am, therefore, prepared to agree to that amendment.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to provide a means whereby any particular class of ministers of religion who are engaged on pastoral duties may be covered by the social insurance scheme as employed contributors when the appropriate authority or body acting on their behalf has sought their admission to that scheme. I trust that the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill will assist Senators to understand more readily the somewhat technical provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Under existing legislation all persons in religion whether doing pastoral or other duties are specifically excluded from participation in the social insurance scheme.  The reasons for their exclusion are complex but broadly speaking stem from the fact that such persons are not employees in the commonly accepted sense even though some are paid by fixed stipend or salary.</P>
      <P>While there was no evidence of dissatisfaction in the past with the exclusion of clergy from the social insurance scheme, the Representative Body of the Church of Ireland has in recent years been pressing for the admission to that scheme of their ministers of religion who are engaged on pastoral duties.  I am satisfied that the continued exclusion from social insurance of such clergymen, many of whom are married with family responsibilities, can no longer be justified.</P>
      <P>Normally the admission of an excluded class of persons to the social insurance scheme is a fairly straightforward matter.  The inclusion is effected by adding the employment of the class to the statutory list of insurable employments.  The adoption of this procedure in relation to the admission to insurance of a specific class of ministers of religion has not however been possible.  Such a step would create difficulties in view of Article 44.2.3º of the Constitution, which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination <Col N="195" /> on the ground of religious profession, belief or status.</P>
    <P>In any event it is not intended that the Bill should provide that only one class of ministers of religion would be enabled to join the social insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>The Bill therefore proposes to remove the barrier standing in the way of any class of ministers of religion engaged on pastoral duties in respect of whom the appropriate church authority makes representations that they should be insured.  This method, which I am advised is free from constitutional defect, will permit the relevant authority of any religious denomination to seek to have its ministers of religion brought within the social insurance scheme if it so desires.</P>
    <P>Any class of ministers of religion which may become insured under the provisions of this Bill will be covered for all the usual benefits except unemployment benefit and occupational injuries benefit, and accordingly the rate of insurance contribution payable is being appropriately reduced.</P>
    <P>I have much pleasure in recommending the Bill to Seanad Éireann for favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a small but important Bill for those covered by it. We, on this side of the House, welcome it.  This is a routine Bill.  It is hardly worthwhile complaining about a Bill of this kind being introduced in the week before Christmas, when one assumes it has been lying around for a considerable time in the files of the Department and could have been produced much earlier.  Nevertheless, it is welcome.  I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on dealing with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to say something about the extreme complexity of this Bill, which deals with a relatively simple matter.  I know that for some reason &mdash;I am not at all clear why&mdash;it seems to be necessary in any amendment of the social welfare legislation to produce Bills of this kind.  It seems to be almost impossible to make any amendment in social welfare <Col N="196" /> legislation without getting involved in the most extraordinarily complex and, to a large extent, unintelligible legislation.  One would wish that it were possible to bring in some kind of codification which would enable all the social welfare legislation under all the different Acts to be brought into one Act, so that future amendments would refer to one Principal Act.  Even allowing for the inevitable complexity of this kind of legislation&mdash;one certainly cannot blame the Parliamentary Secretary for this because he is obviously in the hands of his parliamentary draftsman&mdash;this Bill is unnecessarily complicated and, in particular, provides unnecessary difficulty for those who try to make out what is in it.</P>
    <P>Section 3 amends section 12 of the Principal Act.  The whole section, as it now stands, is set out.  One can congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on this, because in answer to complaints made in previous years that sections of Acts were being amended by the addition of one small subsection, and nobody ever quite knew how the Act now read, the practice has been adopted recently&mdash; it is a good one and to be commended&mdash;of setting out the entire section being amended.  In that way, one at least knows the present position. However, it could be done better.  If one looks up section 12 of the Principal Act of 1952, one will realise that it bears very little relationship to section 12 of the Principal Act, as set out in this Bill.  All kinds of additions have been made in recent years whether by other Acts, by ministerial order or by a combination of both.  I really do not know.  It is misleading, even though it may be in accordance with the rules of the parliamentary draftsman, to set out in a Bill of this kind what is described as section 12 of the Principal Act, whereas in fact it was section 12 as amended on frequent occasions by various means.  We have paragraphs (bb), (dd), (cc) and so on, which have been added at different times.  If it is not possible in the side note of this Bill to say just what is happening to section 12 of the Principal Act, it <Col N="197" /> ought to be possible to state it in the explanatory memorandum.  One very small amendment has been made to paragraph (a) and all the others have really no relationship to this Bill.  It is nice to see them here, but it would be better if amendments made in previous years were set out precisely. It should not be described, misleadingly, as section 12 of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Parliamentary Secretary is in the hands of his draftsman in this matter.  However, the Parliamentary Secretary ought to insist as a matter of some urgency that the codification process, which I hope is going on, should be speeded up.  This Bill, which deals with a very simple matter, is extraordinarily complex. In the interests of all those concerned with the social welfare law, some effort should be made as soon as possible to codify this law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary in bringing it before us.  I do not think it could have been brought in at a more appropriate time than just before Christmas.  I am sure this House will not delay the necessary legislation.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary one or two questions which he might deal with in his reply.</P>
      <P>This Bill removes disabilities against people in religion, and very necessarily so.  However, the Parliamentary Secretary stated in his speech:</P>
      <P>Any class of ministers of religion which may become insured under the provisions of this Bill will be covered for all the usual benefits except unemployment benefit and occupational injuries benefit, and accordingly the rate of insurance contribution payable is being appropriately reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are bringing legislation of this kind, why cannot all benefits be included, or are they included under some other legislation?  We would all like to feel that in religion people of either sex, who work and carry out the same duties as the lay man or lay woman, should be covered for the <Col N="198" /> normal hazards of their occupation. In this day and age it is rightly accepted that discrimination of any kind on the grounds of religion should be excluded from our legislation.  This measure is to be welcomed.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to clear up this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I give this Bill a very warm welcome, as someone who has made representations over a considerable period to the Parliamentary Secretary to rectify the anomaly in our social welfare legislation by which all ministers of religion were excluded from paying into our social insurance scheme and therefore excluded from claiming the benefits which accrue to people under this scheme.</P>
      <P>There was a technical difficulty, as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, in putting this scheme into operation, because there is basically a distinction between the two main groups of clergy in the country&mdash;the Protestant clergy, taking all the denominations, and the Roman Catholic clergy. The Protestant clergy are generally married and the Roman Catholic clergy are always single.  The benefits from social insurance schemes appeal much more to people who are married and have families.  That is mainly the problem we are dealing with.  While Protestant clergy, particularly the Church of Ireland clergy who make up the bulk of Protestant clergy in the Republic, wished to enter the scheme, it was not so clear that Roman Catholic clergy were as interested because they would have to make quite a contribution from their salary. Therefore it was not clear that the two groups of clergy had the same interest. It is also not clear to me if in the future the Catholic Church might not consider having married clergy.  It is not my problem, but I think from what I read in the liberal Press favoured by Senator Halligan, that it might happen any day now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this is a pressing problem for the married clergy.  Under Article 44 of the Constitution the State is not allowed to discriminate between people of differing religion on the ground of their profession.  That was <Col N="199" /> the difficulty facing the Parliamentary Secretary.  He has got over this problem in a very successful way in that any particular church involved can make representations on behalf of its clergy.  If the church makes a representation to the Parliamentary Secretary, then he will include the clergy of that church under the social welfare scheme.  They will be eligible to pay insurance and eligible to receive the benefits.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to put on the record that when I first approached the Parliamentary Secretary some time ago he outlined the difficulties in this respect.  He said that this was being considered and that they were seeing what could be done.  When we got the matter a little further on and pressed our inquiries further, he promised that the legislation would be forthcoming in a very short time&mdash;in fact, in this session.  I am particularly pleased to see that promise honoured.  It is greatly to the credit of the Parliamentary Secretary that the Bill is with us before Christmas as he promised.  It is not often that a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary is able to honour such a promise because of the exigencies of political life.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of small points I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary about.  Perhaps he would outline the main benefits to which the clergy who pay into this scheme will be entitled to now which they did not have before.</P>
    <P>At what date will this Bill come into operation and what will be the mode of operation of the Bill?  It is not quite clear from section 2 whether the benefits of the Bill come into operation after representation has been made by the specific church.  In section 2, where the amendment is being made to the First Schedule of the Principal Act, these are two categories&mdash;category (a) a clergyman who is remunerated by stipend or salary or similar payment; and category (b), a clergyman on behalf of whom the church authority makes a representation to the Minister.  Are these distinct categories or are they the same?  Could the Act come into operation immediately for all those who have <Col N="200" /> a salary, or must the church make a specific representation?</P>
    <P>One of the problems for the Church of Ireland clergy is that, although they receive a regular salary&mdash;and everybody knows what their salary is&mdash; nowadays that salary is pretty small, relatively speaking.  A man with a family is often hard pressed to give them a decent standard of living.  He is not technically employed by the bishop, who does not have the right to fire him as an employer would have, except for very unusual reasons.  I do not know the legal position, but technically the bishop is not his employer. One cannot say that the Almighty is his employer: he must have a physical employer down here if he wants to qualify for the Bill.</P>
    <P>However, on behalf of the Church of Ireland, I give this Bill a very hearty welcome.  We are delighted to see that the anomaly has been removed and hope that other denominations will feel that they can avail of the very important benefits that accrue to people in the social insurance scheme.  I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on having it before us on time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator West from his own experience has given us some idea of the complexities behind this Bill, which though a minor Bill is nonetheless an important one which had to circumvent and then overcome quite complex problems.  I am sorry that the spirit of Christmas has not yet affected Senator Yeats.  When it does he might be a little more generous towards the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I specifically said I did not blame the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary again on a very imaginative approach to the whole area of social welfare. This, along with his obvious sense of compassion, is his greatest characteristic. I will not embarrass him any further beyond saying that he is embarking piece by piece on a programme of reform necessitated not only by the social conditions under <Col N="201" /> which we live, and presumably will continue to live under for quite some time, but also by the lack of imagination so evident in the previous 16 years.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Yeats in one regard: I would support his plea for a codification of social welfare legislation. I have no hesitation in putting on the record of the House that as a Member of it I have not really come to grips with this relatively simple piece of legislation.  I cannot find my way through it as well as I would want.  I am sure that the problem must be equally difficult for those who are professionally engaged in the field of social welfare, whether voluntarily or statutorily.  Accordingly, I would support the plea that has been made for a codification and simplification of the whole field of social welfare legislation.</P>
      <P>I am happy that the Bill has been phrased in such a way, as is required by the Constitution, that it does not make a specific reference to any one religion or another, although it was occasioned by the economic necessities of one particular group of clergymen. I am glad therefore that the Bill is more ecumenical than it might otherwise have been.  I am glad also it is so far sighted that if what Senator West prophesises occurs&mdash;that the major Christian denomination in this country does have married clergy&mdash; it will not be necessary for the Parliamentary Secretary to come back and seek an amendment to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have just one query. Perhaps I am speaking out of total ignorance and am making an inquiry which may be totally unnecessary. The Bill refers to &ldquo;a minister of religion&rdquo;. Am I correct in assuming that we are dealing only with the masculine gender?  Do nuns come under the provisions of the Bill?  They, too, are people employed full-time in religion.  Many of them are remunerated and I wonder whether or not they are included also?  Do I take it that ministers of religion only are included when they are being remunerated in one way or another?  Is that leaving out of the scope of the Bill those who are enjoined by vows <Col N="202" /> of poverty not to receive financial remuneration one way or another? Perhaps there is provision for the inclusion of monks within the terms of the Bill.  There is a possibility, under section 2 (2), where it states &ldquo;or a person living in a religious community as a member thereof,&rdquo; that they are covered there.</P>
    <P>I should like to again congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on closing this loophole in the social welfare legislation and to expressing the hope that his obvious energy, determination and dedication to this particular area of government will result, within the not too distant future, of the complete codification and simplification of the social welfare legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWalsh" hpid="Miss Walsh Miss Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to qualify my opening remarks by saying that, while I have not actually studied the legal ramifications of the Bill&mdash;I have just read the memorandum&mdash;I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on this innovation of his and I welcome it.  As a member of a local authority I have been in the embarrassing situation of having been approached on two different occasions by ministers of religion who had to come to me to find out if they could have a medical card.  This is a deplorable situation in any allegedly Christian country.  The humblest person is entitled to a medical card.  Yet ministers of religion are precluded because they wear clerical garb.  In some instances that clerical garb covers a multitude, a multitude of necessity.  There are ministers of religion working hard for their cause who are living on a mere pittance, who are on the bread line, so to speak.  It is about time we took such people into consideration.  In this day and age, with the rising cost of living, this is one section of the community who have been totally ignored.</P>
      <P>I should like to join with Senator Halligan in asking if the female members of religion, the nuns in our society and particularly the nuns who have returned from service in the foreign mission fields, are included in this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like again to compliment <Col N="203" /> the Parliamentary Secretary.  This Bill has my wholehearted support for the reasons I have stated.  It must be an embarrassment for any person wearing clerical garb to have to seek the assistance of a health board to get a medical card.  The time is well overdue for them to be entitled to some form of social welfare insurance.  It should be automatic, without them having to go on bended knees to public representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to thank all sides of the House for the welcome they have given to the Bill. There was clearly a recognition by Senators of the great need for this Bill and the difficulties and hardships that some clergymen were suffering because they were excluded.  I do not think we recognise fully that these people not only serve their own congregations, their own communities, but they perform a very valuable and dedicated service to our society as a whole&mdash;and for very little material reward in the vast majority of cases. This has led to considerable hardship not only for themselves but for their families also.  I hope that this Bill will remove some of the causes of this hardship.</P>
      <P>I shall try and deal with a number of queries.  Senator Yeats mentioned two points.  The first was that it was regrettable that the Bill was not brought in before Christmas.  I can assure him and the House that I made every effort to have the Bill passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.  I was very conscious of the need for such a provision. As I explained in my opening remarks, there were certain constitutional difficulties which delayed the preparation of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Yeats and Halligan mentioned the complexity of what should be a relatively simple measure.  I agree with these remarks.  It is possible to get bogged down in even the most minor regulation or Bill dealing with social welfare.  I accept fully that there is a great need for an updating of <Col N="204" /> social welfare legislation.  I appreciate this presents great difficulties to Members of both Houses and also for myself when I must sort out what is and is not relevant.  The people who suffer most from this difficulty are those Senator Halligan mentioned, the staff of the Department, who must do a tremendous amount of work to get relatively small results&mdash;this is due to the complexity of the present legislation&mdash;and, also those people engaged in social work and voluntary organisations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I have begun the initial stages of preparing an updated Social Welfare Bill but because of the complexities involved it will not come before either House in the immediate future.  I assure the House however that I am aware of this problem and that I hope to rectify the situation as soon as it is possible to do so.</P>
    <P>Senator West was very active in promoting thinking along the lines which resulted in the present Bill.  He pursued the matter very vigorously at least during my period of office and I do not know for how long before that. The Senator raised a number of points.  He wanted to know what benefits would accrue and how the Bill would become operative.  As the House is aware, when the President signs the Bill it becomes law.  When the church authorities make representations to the Minister, the ministers of religion concerned will become eligible for social welfare insurance.  I do not envisage any delay in the Bill becoming operative.  However they must accumulate the normal number of contributions before they become eligible for the various benefits.</P>
    <P>Senator West also asked for a list of the benefits.  They are: disability benefit, widows' and orphans' pensions, retirement pensions, old-age contributory pensions, death grants, maternity grants, deserted wives benefit and invalidity pension.</P>
    <P>Senator West also mentioned the exclusion of clergymen from unemployment benefit and occupational injuries.  Senator Russell was more concerned that churchmen were being discriminated against because of their particular calling.  This is a normal <Col N="205" /> provision, which already applies to a number of lay people who qualify for limited eligibility.  The reasons for this are that, as regards unemployment benefit, the possibility of these people ever needing unemployment benefit is very remote.  As Senator West pointed out just as in the case of Deputies and Senators, it is very difficult to sack them.</P>

      <P>Senators Halligan and Walsh raised the question of whether there was any question of sex.  There is no discrimination whatsoever on sex, in so far as there are religions which have ordained female ministers.  Quite obviously these people would be as eligible as any male minister in the same category.  It does not however include nuns, because in the normal accepted sense of the words a nun is not an &ldquo;ordained minister&rdquo;. Nuns are professed in their religion. If there was any sort of interest shown by other religious categories to become eligible, I would not rule out the possibility of bringing them into the social insurance scheme.  I have expressed the view before that the social insurance system should be as comprehensive and as all-embracing as possible.  This may be a small step in relation to the number of people involved, but it is a significant one and quite progressive in the direction of making social welfare as comprehensive as possible.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary about the amendment to the 1952 Act.  Section 2 (2) refers to employment as a minister where the person gets a salary or stipend and is a member of a class in respect of which the Minister is satisfied that an appropriate church body has made representation to him. Therefore the church involved must make representation to the Minister to have its people included.  Is this the same representation here or is this just to certify that the man is a minister of that particular church?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say something about the form of section 3.  This section has five subsections. <Col N="207" /> As far as I am concerned, each is of almost equal incomprehensibility.  I will limit myself to subsection (1), which sets out what it describes as section 12 of the Principal Act with 11 subparagraphs&mdash;(a) to (h) with various additions such as (bb), (cc) and so on.</P>
      <P>The section 12 of the Principal Act which appears here is not the section 12 that one will find if one refers back to the Principal Act.  The difficulty is that in this, as in all other social legislation, the parliamentary draftsman uses a kind of obscure code of his own, which is incomprehensible to almost everybody except those who spend their lives dealing with this type of legislation.  I can assure Senator Halligan that I am not blaming the Parliamentary Secretary for this.  I think there is quite a bit of the Christmas spirit in this Bill, unlike the Bill that is to follow it.  I am not blaming the Parliamentary Secretary, although I know that, on strict parliamentary order, one has to hold him responsible.  I accept, however, that he had no choice in this matter.</P>
      <P>Something ought to be done to try to ease the task of those who try to interpret such legislation.  In the explanatory memorandum we are given, a kind of translation of what this Bill means.  I have no doubt but that the Parliamentary Secretary's translation is correct.  Nonetheless it is not satisfactory that one should be legislating essentially on the basis of the explanatory memorandum.  We all read the explanatory memorandum and we have to accept that this is, in fact, what the Bill does; but how is one to know?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking subsection (1) of section 3, which of these 11 subparagraphs are being amended?  I think it is one figure in subparagraph (a).  The remaining ten paragraphs were not apparently amended.  They might be, but how is one to find out?  The Principal Act was passed 23 years ago. Each year since then there has been at least one Social Welfare Act.  This is the third in this year.  The total is about 50 or 60.  You could go through all these Acts to find out where these <Col N="208" /> various subparagraphs came from and whether they are now being amended. Even that would not be sufficient. You would have to dig through all the ministerial orders made with regard to social welfare in the past 22 years to see whether they ought to have added something to section 12 of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>It seems very unsatisfactory that we should be enacting sections like this that we really do not understand. Taking the Parliamentary Secretary at his word, I have no doubt but that the explanatory memorandum is correct in stating that: &ldquo;Subsection (1) provides that the application of the Acts to insured ministers of religion may be modified by regulations&rdquo;. I have no doubt that is what it does.  For all we know it could do a lot of other things as well.  Where an entire section is set out in the Bill as it is here&mdash;it is a good development and I should like to see more of it in more Bills&mdash;perhaps the parts being amended could be underlined.  At the very least the explanatory memorandum should say in some kind of an appendix exactly what amendment is being made.  In this case I think it is one figure in subparagraph (a).  I might be wrong on that.  If one could be told the exact amendment one could be saved a lot of trouble in trying to find out exactly where we are going.  It would also be a great easement of the work in future years of social workers and lawyers of all kinds in trying to find out in the case of each of these Bills precisely what they are doing.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health Contributions Act, 1971, <Col N="209" /> provided that health contributions are to be paid by persons with limited eligibility for health services. The explanatory memorandum which has been circulated gives information regarding the categories of persons who have limited eligibility for health services, the services to which they are entitled, the rates of contributions fixed by the Act of 1971 and the revised rates of contributions which it is proposed should operate from the beginning of January, 1975.</P>
      <P>Since the contribution rates were fixed in 1971 there has been a substantial increase in the cost of providing health services&mdash;from £86 millions in the financial year 1971-72 to an annual rate of approximately £166 millions at present.  About £120 millions of this latter sum will be spent this year on the particular services to which persons with limited eligibility are entitled, namely, hospital in-patient and out-patient services, maternity and infant care services and the drugs subsidy scheme, compared with a figure of about £63 millions in 1971-72.  At the level of charges fixed in 1971, health contributions were estimated to raise about £5 millions or about 8 per cent of the total cost of the limited eligibility services.  At the proposed new rates, the income is expected to be about £8½ millions or about 7 per cent of the present total cost of those services. Health contributions therefore, even with the proposed new rates, will contribute less towards the cost of the services next year than they did in 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Exchequer contribution towards the cost of the health services has been increasing significantly in recent years.  In 1975 it will amount to about 90 per cent of the total cost, not taking into account the allocations made for capital expenditure and payments made from the agricultural grant. This trend has been accentuated by the phasing out of health charges on rates, a policy to which this Government is fully committed.  The rates contribution in 1972-73 was £36 millions, the last budget year of the previous Administration.  In the period April-December, 1974, it stood at £13½ millions.  In 1975 it will have <Col N="210" /> been reduced to about £9 millions.</P>
    <P>Only about 10 per cent of the estimated cost of providing services next year for persons with limited eligibility, and their dependants, will be met by way of health contributions at the increased rates proposed in the Bill.  As I mentioned earlier, by far the major part of health expenditure must be met from the Exchequer.  This creates problems that are only too well known to you all, but, as other and richer countries than ours have discovered, there seems to be no easy solution to the difficulties created by the ever-increasing cost of health care. All countries have difficulty financing their health services and we in Ireland are no exception.  I said in the Dáil that I am not enamoured by the system of health contributions.  In this regard I propose to have a review carried out of the present system of financing our health and social welfare systems generally to see if there is a better system.  The scheme of health contributions will of course be examined as part of that review.</P>
    <P>It was made clear when the 1971 Act was being debated that the level of health contributions then proposed would hardly remain static.  This Bill is designed to revise the rates fixed in 1971 to an extent appropriate to present-day conditions, without prejudice to the outcome of the review which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Dáil debate on the Bill it was mentioned that some farmers are not meeting their obligations in so far as payment of health contributions is concerned.  Health boards have in fact been experiencing difficulty in collecting contributions from some farmers who are liable to pay.  As I explained in the course of the Dáil debate, the position in this regard is that persons who are liable to pay are under a statutory obligation to do so.  Those who fail to contribute may have proceedings initiated against them for the recovery of any amounts due.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind of course that there may be circumstances which in individual cases might make it difficult for people to make payments at the appropriate <Col N="211" /> time.  It would be reasonable in such cases for health boards to accept payment in instalments.  I expect them to do so.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out at this point that the Act or the amending Bill do not cover persons with full eligibility for health services.  Any person who can establish entitlement to full eligibility will not be required to pay health contributions.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind Senators also that apart from persons with full eligibility health contributions will not be payable by agricultural labourers, female domestics or female employees in receipt of widows' pensions, deserted wives benefit or unmarried mothers' allowances.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in the Dáil that there are two particular anomalies in the present entitlement provisions for limited eligibility for health services which need to be rectified.  Firstly, there are at present differing upper income limits for eligibility for different groups of people.  The upper income limit for insured non-manual workers at present is £2,250 per annum, whereas for non-insured persons other than farmers it is £1,600 per annum.  This is an anomaly which must be removed as soon as possible so that the upper income limit is the same for the two groups.</P>
    <P>The second anomaly is the existence of any upper income limit to entitlement to limited eligibility services. As I said in the Dáil, it is the policy of this Government to abolish income limits entirely, and I initiated talks with the medical organisations in that connection.  As soon as the review body which I established has issued its recommendations, discussions with the medical organisations will recommence.</P>
    <P>I trust that I have explained the need to have revised rates of contributions provided for, and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>My first function this morning is to welcome the Tánaiste to this House on the occasion of his first visit here as Minister for Health.  Perhaps after 20 months of <Col N="212" /> Coalition Government it is significant, to say the least, that this is the first occasion on which a Minister for Health of that Government should bring legislation to this House.</P>
      <P>For the last 12 months the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been running around Europe trying to extract from the EEC Regional Fund a sufficient amount of money for this nation.  The climax was reached last week when the Taoiseach went to Paris and managed to get the sum of £8 million for this country for the year 1975. One would get the impression from Government Ministers, and indeed from some sections of the media, that they had achieved something worthwhile. But when one compares this sum of £8 million with the amount of money being raised by colleagues of the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the Exchequer one realises it is a mere pittance.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs managed during the year to get for the Exchequer a considerable amount of money by increasing the cost of telephone calls, postage and televisions licences.  With a stroke of his pen the Minister for Finance, by placing a 15p tax on every gallon of petrol, managed to secure for the Exchequer a sum varying from £27½ million to £35 million.  By another stroke of the pen the Government managed to get for the Exchequer the sum of £2.4 million by withdrawing the subsidy from butter and by increasing the price of butter to the Irish people by 4p per lb.</P>
      <P>This morning we reach the final straw by the visit to this House of the Minister for Health and the Leader of the Labour Party who is asking us to give to the Exchequer the sum of £3½ million by taxing the workers, small farmers and small businessmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand the attitude of this Government, composed of socialists on the one hand and advocates of the just society on the other. Throughout their years in opposition, members of this Government scoffed at the 5 per cent in this country who between them enjoyed the maximum share of the nation's wealth.  That 5 per cent do not suffer unduly because <Col N="213" /> of increases in the cost of petrol, stamps, TV licences, phones or buses. That 5 per cent do not suffer this morning by this Bill.  Robin Hood robbed the rich to help the poor.  The policy of the National Coalition Government, the socialist just society, appears to be the reverse of the philosophy of Robin Hood.  They robbed the poor to help the rich.</P>
    <P>In this measure before the House the Minister is asking the workers to provide £3½ million in order that the Government can give free hospitalisation to the 5 per cent who control the nation's wealth.  I cannot understand how any member of the Labour Party could subscribe to this philosophy.  We have in the Government today a Robin Hood in reverse.  We have a Government who believe that the worker should be taxed in order to provide free hospitalisation to a section of this community who can well afford to provide it for themselves.  We have been told that a considerable amount of money is being provided for the health services at present.  We have been told that it has increased from £86 million in the financial year 1971-72 to £166 million.  We have also been told that the figure for next year is £40 million more than was provided last year.</P>
    <P>That could convey the impression that the health services will be vastly improved in the coming year.  If we study the breakdown of this £40.5 million we shall discover that there is absolutely no new thinking on an extension to the medical services.  A breakdown of the £40.5 million shows us that £20 million will be spent on pay increases and price increases and £9 million will be spent on the relief of rates.  Thus the amount of money spent on new services will be relatively small; £1.3 million will be spent on the extra cost of increases in rates of allowances and in expenditure on new allowances for domiciliary care of handicapped children provided in the last budget; £1.2 million will be spent on increases in the rates of allowance; £4.5 million will be spent on general and psychiatric hospitals, including new units and improving staffing and services standards; £1.5 <Col N="214" /> million will be spent on extra places in homes for mentally handicapped persons and new welfare homes for old people; £1.3 million will be spent on development under the general medical services scheme, and £1.7 million on improvements in community care services.</P>
    <P>If we deduct what will be spent on paying increases, on price increases and the money provided for the relief of rates, we shall discover that only £11 million extra is being devoted to actual health matters in the coming year.  Of that sum there is only one item that is the brainchild of the present Government, that is, the very welcome new allowances for domiciliary care for handicapped children. That covers a sum of £1.3 million.</P>
    <P>The rest of the money is being devoted to the continuation of the schemes provided by Fianna Fáil.  If we examine them closely we will see that the amount provided for these services is a miserable pittance at a time when practically every county is crying out for an improvement to general and psychiatric hospitals. Surely we must agree that the extra sum of £4.5 million for this purpose is very small indeed.  According to the capital budget for 1975, £10 million is being allotted for capital purposes for health for the coming year as against £7.35 million in the nine-month period of 1974.  When one turns that into a 12-month period we see that the Government are providing a miserable sum of £200,000 extra for capital purposes for the health service in the year that lies ahead.</P>
    <P>No consideration has been given to galloping inflation, to the weekly price rises which are occurring.  I would have thought that if the Government were really serious in this matter they would have provided at least double the sum of money for the development of our hospital services in the coming year.  Of the £40.5 million increase for 1975 we see that £9 million is for the relief of rates. This was one of the carrots dangled by the National Coalition Government before the Irish electorate in February of 1973.  This was one of the ways in which they bought themselves into <Col N="215" /> office.  I would submit this morning that, in making the promise to the electorate that they would take health services off the rates, this Government were not honest with the people.  They should have told the people that, while the big ratepayers would no longer have to pay rates on health, the workers, the small farmers and the small business people would be asked to subsidise the big ratepayers.  On the one hand, the relief of rates on health charges in 1975 will save the ratepayers £9 million.  The workers and others are now being asked to pay £3½ million of this amount.  The workers must realise that they were codded and fooled by this Government in their 14-point plan.  They were codded in other ways as well.  They were codded in a much more serious way, in that the balance of this £9 million is being obtained by slowing up the health services.  In the 1970 Health Act Fianna Fáil gave the people a blueprint to the finest health services that could be provided. Fianna Fáil gave the green light to the Irish people and to the health boards to provide the people with an excellent health service.</P>
    <P>A few months after the arrival of the National Coalition Government, that green light turned to amber and was very quickly followed by red&mdash; red for stop.  For almost 18 months those lights have been red: stop to the expansion of the health services in the way that they should have expanded; stop to the development of our hospitals both general and psychiatric in the way that they should have developed; stop to the provision of long staying units and welfare homes as envisaged by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The Government applied the red light to compensate for the money they had to provide for the relief of rates.  The Government brought their way into office by making this promise to the people. In the health board of which I am a member, the estimate was cut by almost £1 million.  If one is to assume that a similar cut took place in other regions, it is very easy to explain how this Government could provide relief of rates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> On the other hand, Fianna Fáil believe that only the occupants of private dwellings should have such relief.  Fianna Fáil would not play Robin Hood&mdash;we would not ask the workers of Ireland, as the Minister is doing, to subsidise the 5 per cent of the Irish nation who control the vast majority of this nation's wealth.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil last week I listened to the amusing contribution made on this Bill by the Labour Deputy from Limerick.  I was particularly amused when at column 1516, volume 276, on 11th December, 1974, the Labour Deputy stated as follows:</P>
    <P>We have given the people a health service Fianna Fáil could never have provided for them.</P>
    <P>I naturally asked myself which party were in office when the Health Bill, 1970, was introduced.  I wondered if that Deputy was making a mistake or was he doing something that most Government supporters like to do, that is, to give the people the impression that the National Coalition Government are responsible for many of the tremendous schemes initiated by Fianna Fáil?</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister, spelled out in his speech that the free hospitalisation for insured workers was initiated as a result of the Health Contributions Bill, 1971.  That was a Bill pioneered and introduced by Fianna Fáil.  Some Deputies who support the National Coalition Government go around the country trying to give the impression that this measure was introduced by that Government since their election in 1973.  I should like to read a short extract from the <i>Donegal Democrat</i> of 26th January, 1974.  It reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim White, speaking in Fintown, told the meeting that as from January 1st the following increases in means for medical cards had come into operation: persons whose incomes do not exceed the following limits are eligible:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and he proceeded to give the limits.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;Mr. White said that he was glad that this long overdue increase in means was taking place as there were very many people in Donegal <Col N="217" /> who should have got medical cards, but were turned down due to the very small means test.  He said that he had kept in constant touch with the Department to have the means increased&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and he advised people to apply for it.</P>
    <P>Mr. White also stated that this change was part of the Government policy to see that the weaker sections of the community get the maximum amount of assistance.</P>
    <P>Then we go on to the main point.</P>
    <P>Deputy White went on to speak about the £7 contribution under the Health Acts, whereby everyone in the country in the scheme would be entitled to &ldquo;free&rdquo; hospitalisation from&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>When?</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;April, 1974.  This contribution covered a married man, his wife and family for full maintenance in a public ward, &ldquo;free&rdquo; doctors and surgeon's attention in hospital; &ldquo;free&rdquo; drugs and X-rays and, indeed, all hospital services.  These two schemes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>the Deputy said</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;showed a big step forward in health services and proved that this Government was doing something constructive with the problems that face the weaker sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Here we have a Deputy supporting the Government going into a small village and no doubt hoping that none of his listeners had to have hospitalisation for three years before and hoping that they would accept from him the message that he was trying to convey&mdash; that this Government were responsible for providing free hospitalisation for insured workers.  They even tried to tell them in January, 1974, that free hospitalisation would not be introduced until the following April, whereas we all know that this came about as a result of Fianna Fáil's Health Contribution Act, 1971, and that it commenced on 1st October of that year.</P>
    <P>Here we have a situation where a Labour Deputy from Limerick and a Fine Gael Deputy from Donegal are <Col N="218" /> attempting to give to this Government credit for the health services that they do not deserve.  When this Government assumed office, Fianna Fáil had left them excellent health legislation that would have improved the lot of the people if this Government had continued to have the same interest in health matters as the last Government.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's record was so good that in 1970 there were 12 doctors in this country per 10,000 of the population as against 12.3 in England and Wales.  We had 2.2 dentists per 10,000 of the population as against 2.7 in England and Wales and we had 64.7 nurses per 10,000 of the population as against 42.7 in England and Wales.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil pioneered the health services and set up a service which has provided tremendous improvements in the lot of the people who could not afford to do it for themselves.  They provided free medicines, free nursing services, a dental service for medical card holders, an eye service, an ear service, a chiropody service, free medical appliances, walking aids, wheelchairs and so on.  They provided a hospital service, free milk for mothers with children under five and gave special consideration to travelling allowances for people who could not afford to visit relatives in hospital.  They provided social workers, home helps, blind welfare, set up local social service councils and gave them considerable grants to provide coal and other vital necessities for the needy.  We have a record in the field of medicine of which we have every reason to feel proud.</P>
    <P>After 20 months of Coalition Government&mdash;a Government of socialists-cum-advocates of the just society&mdash;we are entitled to ask what has been their contribution to the health services. The only contribution they appear to have made is the legislation before this House today.  It is legislation to extract from the workers, from the small farmers and small businessmen, the sum of £3½ million.  If we were told that this money would be used to provide better hospitalisation or the extra staff that have been demanded and denied in every hospital in this land, or if we were told that this £3½ million would be spent on increasing <Col N="219" /> allowances under the Disabled Persons' Maintenance Scheme; or, better still, if the money was to be spent to provide for dependants of applicants for disabled person's maintenance allowances; or if we were told that this was being spent to provide more social workers or more home helps or to increase the hours home helps give to the needy&mdash;because two hours a day, while useful, is not enough&mdash;or if we were told that this £3½ million would go to committees looking after the aged, then possibly we would welcome this legislation this morning and we would have to admit that it was being spent in a very important and useful manner.  But this money is not going to any of these schemes.</P>
    <P>These excellent schemes, introduced and pioneered by Fianna Fáil, have not been making the progress in the last two years that they should, because the Government are not providing the money that they should. Because the Government bought their way into office by reducing the rates contribution to the health services, they had to reduce the amount of money being spent on the needy by the amount of money they have to pay out in rates relief.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil adopted the report on the care of the aged presented by the inter-departmental committee set up in 1968 and agreed that institutional care should be provided by general hospitals, geriatric assessment units, long-stay units and welfare homes.</P>
    <P>Terms were drawn up to ensure that these recommendations would be given effect.  I submit that the present Government are deliberately holding up the provision of this accommodation for as many years as they can in order to save them making the investment in health that they should be making.</P>
    <P>It is two-and-a-half years since the North-Western Health Board took a decision to provide welfare homes in the towns of Ramelton and Falcarragh in County Donegal.  After two-and-a-half years of planning, postponement and so on, the Department of Health are still examining the cost&mdash;two-and-a-half years spent on postponement because the Government have to pay out <Col N="220" /> £9 million or £10 million extra per year on relief of rates to keep their election promise, and they had to find this money by slowing up the health services.</P>
    <P>This Government have no reason whatsoever to feel proud of their record.  It is easy for the Minister for Health to stand up and say that so many extra millions are being spent now than was spent two years ago. The Government have to spend this extra money on the schemes that were introduced by Fianna Fáil.  The standards for full eligibility under the general medical services was provided for in section 45 of the Health Act. Each year the chief executive officers review the guidelines, and only on Monday last the board of which I am a member were told that the income limit had been increased from £20 to £24.50 for a husband and wife, with an allowance of £2.25 per child under the age of 16, as against £1.75; £14.75 for a single person living with his family and £17 per week for single persons living alone.</P>
    <P>This would cost the health services more money and that was envisaged by Fianna Fáil when the Health Bill of 1970 was introduced.  That was provided for by Fianna Fáil in that section of the Bill which stated that adult persons unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants would be entitled to free general medical services.</P>
    <P>If the amount of money allocated to health is growing, there is only one reason for it and that is that the schemes initiated by Fianna Fáil will have to continue or be stopped by this Government.  The only contribution that this Government have made to the health services has been the provision of a domiciliary care allowance. After 20 or 21 months of Government, it is a very poor record indeed.  It demonstrates clearly to me, having studied the record of Fianna Fáil in this field and compared it with the record of this Government, that Fianna Fáil had and have a social conscience.</P>
    <P>Nowhere in the workings of this Government during the last two years <Col N="221" /> can we find evidence of a social conscience. Over the last three years, many people whose incomes far exceeded the limit received demands for the health contributions.  This may apply only in the north-western region, or, indeed, only to Donegal, but it has happened many times.  A businessman whose taxable income exceeds the limits laid down has a small farm. He receives a demand for his contribution and, believing that this would give free hospitalisation for himself and his children, pays the £7 each year.  He does not read the small print in the demand.  As far as I remember this clearly states that, if the income exceeds the maximum, even though a person may have his £7 receipt that person is not entitled to the health service.</P>
    <P>These demand notices are sent out by using the rate book.  A few weeks ago I had a woman in with me whose brother has been living in England for 30 years and who has not been home since.  He owns a small mountain bog farm.  This lady received a final demand note from the health board for this brother.  If I owned a small farm the health board officials would simply see my name in a rate book and issue me with this demand.  If a number of people who year by year pay this contribution were to challenge their claim to medical services they would find they were not entitled to the service for which they are paying.  I know of one consultant who, even though handed a receipt by a lady, claimed that the family were not entitled to the service. He presented his bill and was paid.</P>
    <P>Something will have to be done about this.  Now that the demand is for £12 per year, the health services, the Department and the health boards will be subject to considerable criticism from people who even though year by year they pay the demand, may be later denied the service. I realise that this is provided for in the small print but I do not think that this is good enough. People should be told that, if their income limit is in excess, they will be stricken off.  I do not consider that this is a Health Bill.</P>
    <P>This morning I read over some of <Col N="222" /> the speeches made in this House on the Bill in 1971 by Fine Gael Senators, who then claimed that that was not a health measure but another measure to increase taxation.  In 1971 the Government were introducing a new service, tremendous facility for Irish workers and small business people.  Today, in asking the workers of Ireland to pay 80 per cent more, the Government are not providing an improvement in this service.  They are doing nothing new.  The time has come for the National Coalition Government to stop playing the role of robbing the poor to subsidise the rich.  It is time they began, if they have a social conscience at all, to emulate Robin Hood's work in the past.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Tánaiste on the tremendous work he is doing as Minister for Health.  I could not agree with Senator McGlinchey and especially with the note on which he finished.  The Minister has done a very good job in spite of difficulties placed in his way by vested interests. I hope he will continue the battle to have the medical services extended and improved.  He has the backing of the general public, if not of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>We should all like to see extensions to the medical service but, unfortunately, because of economic reasons this is not possible.  For instance, we should like to see the present income limits for medical card holders increased so that the vast majority, especially all working class people, could have medical cards.  We look forward to the day when this can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the choice of doctor scheme, I should like the people whose doctor has opted out of the scheme to get more generous consideration.  There are many cases where an outstanding doctor has opted out of this scheme and as a result his patients do not benefit from the free health scheme. People have individual attitudes towards medicine.  If they have a doctor they feel can help them, under no circumstances will they change.  It is <Col N="223" /> unfortunate that the health scheme, as it stands, does not cater for these people in a better way.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the regional health boards have been a failure.  The degree of representation which local representatives have on these boards is far too limited.  I would prefer if we reverted to the old system of health authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is more than a Health Bill, it is a taxation bill.  It imposes further taxation on a section of the community who can least afford it.  For some unknown reason the Minister has not increased the maximum figure of £1,600.  This amount has remained the same since 1972 despite the increases in petrol, postage and so on.  It amazes me that this aspect of the Bill seems to have been passed over by the Press.  It leaves one wondering if this has been another Press gag by the Government.</P>
      <P>During the last three weeks we have had the imposition of tax on petrol to the tune of £28 million, on butter to the tune of £2.4 million, and in this Bill a further taxation of £3.5 million &mdash;taxation totalling in all £33 million. That is an average of £11 million per week by this socialist Government and represents twice the amount of taxation levied on this country by Cromwell.  We all know how bad Cromwell was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the true position, but it has been glossed over.  I wanted to make this point in case anybody might have missed it.  The cruellest blow of all is that it is hitting a section of the community unable to pay.  The workers have to pay the tax.  The Taoiseach has said we must tighten our belts and that workers must not make undue demands on the Exchequer in the coming months.  Yet this is approximately <Col N="224" /> an 80 per cent increase on the working classes, some of whom are on short-time.  This is undeniable.  It has been publicly stated by Ministers.</P>
    <P>At the Labour Party Conference in Galway the workers were asked not complain about having to pay the price of providing health services for those who are not working.  Yet three weeks later we have an imposition of an average of £11 million per week on the working classes.</P>
    <P>The farmer who is asked to pay this new rate has been and is continuing, to suffer by the mismanagement and the miscalculation of the Government in regard to Agriculture and Fisheries. He has not got the fodder to feed his stock.  I learned yesterday that the Government failed to honour a commitment given in the Dáil a fortnight ago.  Yet today in this House that farmer is asked to increase his levy from £7 to £12.  Have the Government any moral conscience?  They had trouble trying to collect the £7, but, in the circumstances prevailing in agriculture today how can the farmers afford to pay an increase to £12?</P>
    <P>Only last week the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries gave a promise to allow £30 under a voucher scheme to help those farmers feed their stock.  That amount was cut in half because the Government were unable to pay.  Yet the Minister for Health asks those farmers to increase their health contribution from £7 to £12.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister comes from an area which includes both sections of the community.  If he talks to his constituents, he will learn, that it is the people in these two sections who are asked to pay the extra £3.5 million under this Bill.  I do not know why the limit of £1,600 was not raised to £2,000 or even to £2,400 or £2,500. The figure of £1,600 is ridiculous.  I am sure the Minister will agree that today £1,600 is no use to a man trying to rear three or four children in a city, country town or rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister reviewed the enormous expenses of the health boards in the past two years?  Have they given the services they were intended to give?  If they have not, why <Col N="225" /> not?  I am not a member of the Western Health Board, but I am not blind.  I believe that, for a number of reasons, that health board has been a failure.  Yesterday the Minister received deputations from two hospitals in the Western Health Board region &mdash;Roscommon Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe.  It is only in the last two years that those two hospitals have been in trouble.  There are others the Minister has not heard about yet.</P>
    <P>The hospital in Tuam is run privately by nuns.  I fail to understand how they have survived so long without help.  They must have a wonderful management and organisation.  On the other hand, the Western Health Board got a loan of £4 million for the first quarter of next year.  If they need £4 million for the first quarter, I assume&mdash;and I am sure the public assume&mdash;they will need £4 million for the other quarters, bringing the total to £16 million.  Has the Minister or the Department vetted the demands of that health board and of every other health board?  The last decent act of the Galway County Council, in their capacity as a health authority before the health boards, was the opening of a hospital in Clifden.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to find out where the £3.5 million in this Bill will go and how it will be spent in order to give a better service to the people who are paying for it.  I am trying to illustrate the point by referring to the Western Health Board, who, I assume, will get a portion of this money.  To date the people in the community in which I live have not seen much result from this great investment of public moneys.  The Western Health Board have not added one extra bed. No extension has been made to the Galway Regional Hospital, which is a central hospital.  In the maternity section of that hospital a woman holding a medical card will be kept in that <Col N="226" /> hospital for three days only.  After that she and her baby will be thrown out.</P>
      <P>A university student with a medical card wanted to have a foot operation during the Christmas holidays.  She was told by the authorities in the Galway Regional Hospital that she would have to wait three months before she could have her operation. It is a scandal that she should have to write asking me to intervene for her. There is a failure to provide under the health services proper hospital care for such cases.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister met deputations from Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, and Roscommon Hospital, two fine hospitals to see what could be done to keep these hospitals open. All this does not seem logical to me or to the ratepayers, the people being asked to supply £3.5 million extra under this Bill.  I am asking the Minister to examine the health boards' expenditure.  The health boards have done quite a lot of good, but they have cost an enormous amount of money.</P>
      <P>I feel that if the Galway County Council were operating the health services and getting one-third the amount of money the Western Health Board are getting, we would have a programme of expanding health services. Every sick person in that area would be well cared for, and the Minister would not have to come here to ask for an extra £3.5 million.  There would be no need for this Bill, which is imposing extra taxation on the poorest and the hardest hit section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am being fair in my criticism. There are instances in my county that would shock this House and the nation.  I know of a poor person who sought admission to St. Brigid's Hospital, Loughrea, but who could only be accommodated in the Mental Hospital, Ballinasloe.  That is the type of situation which arises in the Western Health Board area because of a lack of money to provide sufficient beds. The money needed seems to have disappeared somewhere quietly, because we have not seen it.  We have not got it on the health charge.  There is an <Col N="227" /> increase of £1.2 in respect of the general health charges in our county. Where has this money gone?  This is the question being asked by the people in the Western Health Board area. More questions will be asked when they receive demands to pay a further £3.5 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to lunch I was endeavouring to get an answer from the Minister about the manner in which millions of pounds in health contributions are being spent.  Are the people who are paying these health contributions getting a fair return? Will the people who are being asked to pay a further £3.5 million get proper health services for the extra taxation and the extra levies being imposed?</P>
      <P>Taking into account the millions of pounds that were spent in the Western Health Board area, there has been no extra accommodation made available since the health board was established. I have been trying to find out where the £4 million allocated for the first quarter has been spent.  Accommodation in the regional hospitals is not to the satisfaction of the general public.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, we have hospitals such as Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe, Roscommon Hospital and also Ballina District Hospital.  I have read of the many attempts by Deputy Calleary to upgrade Ballina District Hospital.  A stroke of the pen from the Minister would create further bed space, which could be utilised to improve the general health services.  In the Western Health Board area also Castlebar Hospital has been seeking training nursing status but that has not been accorded it.  There has been no intimation how this £3.5 million will be spent.</P>
      <P>There is clamour in the Regional Hospital, Galway, for girls of good education to be trained as nurses.  On the other hand, Castlebar Hospital always had the reputation of being a good hospital.  We are demanding training facilities for nurses; yet the Minister sits idly by and does nothing about it.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> In the Dáil last week Deputy Coughlan, who is a member of the same party as the Tánaiste and Minister for Health, painted a very bright and prosperous picture regarding bed space and expenditure of public funds in his health board area.  On the other hand, we had another loyal and faithful friend of the Labour Party, Deputy John O'Connell, condemning the situation regarding the expenditure of public funds in general.  I quote from column 1520 of the Dáil Official Report for 11th December, 1974:</P>
    <P>I would be dishonest to the House, and to the public, if I spoke out and condemned the Health Contributions Bill in 1971 and now fully endorsed it.  If I did so I would be a hypocrite and that I will not be.  When I decide to be a hypocrite I will quit this House.</P>
    <P>What that man was saying to his party Leader was that either he was a hypocrite or that the Leader of the party was a hypocrite.  That is how I read it.  Deputy O'Connell definitely said that he was not a hypocrite, so there is an inference there from one of the leading lights in the Labour Party, a man who got one of the highest votes in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell also stated at column 1521 of the same date:</P>
    <P>I am astonished that consideration has not been given to this aspect because Labour Party policy is that taxation, or the Exchequer, take over more of the burden of the health services.  We should not be asking this section of the community to bear this burden; we should be asking the entire community to bear it, particularly those best able to do so.  It would have been more desirable to ask the Exchequer to bear this.</P>
    <P>Here is a member of the Labour Party saying precisely what I am saying.  He said that he was not a hypocrite and that Labour Party policy was being thrown to the wind.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there was evidence of that in the recent North-East Cork bye-election when the labour section of the electorate ran away in hoards <Col N="230" /> from the Labour Party.  They did not all come to Fianna Fáil I know, but we lost only 82 votes whereas the Labour Party lost approximately 7 per cent.  Deputy O'Connell, a respected member of the Labour Party, a respected Member of the other House, is saying that the Leader of the Labour Party is not carrying out Labour Party policy.  What Deputy O'Connell said is factual.  We are spending millions of pounds in all the health boards areas and the people who are paying are not getting from the health services what they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>We can read in <i>The Irish Independent</i> of Thursday, 12th December, 1974, a leading article by Mr. Arnold headed &ldquo;Sharp Jabs and Treacle for Big Brendan&rdquo;.  I would not refer to the Minister in those terms but I am quoting the heading of the article. Deputy O'Connell could have headed his contribution in the other House: &ldquo;Sharp Jabs and Treacle for Big Bad Brendan&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This morning, we heard Senator McGlinchey saying that they had not increased the income limit.  When I was sitting on that side of the House I understood when the then Minister &mdash;the late Mr. Erskine Childers&mdash; brought in his Bill, that it was meant for the lower income group and I assumed it would include county council workers.  Now we find that county council workers are not eligible for medical cards.  With their miserable pay they are being asked in this Bill to be the first section of the community&mdash;I think everyone in this House will agree that they are the weakest section&mdash;to increase their health contributions by 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be fairminded. It appears in this situation he is not, when he maintains £1,600 as the income limit.  Some people have suggested £4,000 as a time limit.  Here, at the other end of the stick, is the county council worker who is not well paid, and indeed the farm labourer, too, who cannot be included in the free medical card service. The two weakest sections of the community are being crucified by being asked to increase their health subscriptions by 80 per cent, and <Col N="231" /> without a murmur.  It is being glossed over by the Press.  Is is one of the most cruel pieces of legislation that I have seen introduced in the Seanad. I know of an instance in my own area where a medical card was taken from a man and his wife, who were receiving a small farmer's pension of £9 a week.  I appealed against it and was successful, but it was because I thumped on the table, and for no other reason.  In the first instance, he should not have been considered for review because anyone should know that when the State has to pay a pension to a man because he has a poor living it has a responsibility to that man, and to others like him.</P>
    <P>During the course of the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; on television last Saturday some people made a big song and dance about this.  If they had to live in circumstances similar to this man, they would not speak in such manner. Yet officials of the health board take the medical card from that man, while the Minister for Social Welfare was granting him £9 a week in order to try to enable him to survive.</P>
    <P>We are talking about public funds. That man should not have to come to me.  He should be included in this Bill.  I know of an old age pensioner with no other income, who was sent a review form in connection with his medical card.  I should like to ask the Minister if that was correct.  Is it a fair application of the health services? If that man had not come to me, in all probability he might have been refused a medical card.  I am not saying I got it for him, but I am sure every Deputy and councillor in my area could give similar instances.  I am giving this instance as an example of how our health boards are working. I should like the Minister, in honesty, to bear out those facts.</P>
    <P>I could give instances of children suffering from certain rare diseases, where the mothers of these children got nothing for caring for them.  The Minister straightened out those cases. I know of a child who is suffering from a rare disease but because his father is accumulating about £2,300 a year, that child is not entitled to a <Col N="232" /> medical card.  I do not understand why a child with a rare disease will not qualify for a medical card.  It is hard to believe some of the cases that are brought to my knowledge.  In my county we are collecting £3.5 million, and already spending £4 million for the first quarter of next year but we have not one extra bed in the county. We are downgrading two good hospitals. We will not upgrade another good hospital and we will not give status to still another one.  I am sure that Senator O'Toole will understand what I am talking about in the Ballina instance.

I ask the Minister, in conscience, is it right that we are spending £4 million in one quarter in 1974 and collecting a further £3.5 million, in the Western Health Board area?  It is not all the fault of the Western Health Board. They cannot do the job if they do not get the money.  I do not think that any health board was set up to freeze health in this manner.</P>
      <P>I stand over every statement I made in this House, although I may be abused at home when my words are heard.  The millions of pounds being poured into the health services are not being properly spent.  The people who are paying for them and who are in possession of medical cards are the hardest hit, because they are the people who are on the waiting lists for operations and for other services from the national grid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying, in relation to policy and the introduction of the 15p specific charge in respect of the national health fund, that that represented a very considerable charge at that time on the insured worker.  It was an innovation for them and also was an innovation in respect of the agricultural community.  At that time this country was spending £86 million on health services.  Today the Government and Minister for Health are expending £116 million.  This is a very substantial increase in the volume of expenditure for which the Minister and his Department are responsible. Having regard to the tremendous escalation of hospital costs, the vast majority of people that come within the limited eligibility section of the community can be assured of free hospitalisation, free specialist services, free maternity services and limited relief from drug expenses for themselves and their dependants.  They are, I would consider, extremely lucky.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the average family to be five, which is the statistical evaluation of Irish family size, it works out at a State fee in excess of 5p per week for coverage for that section of the community. I would remind Senator <Col N="234" /> Killilea that at the time it was 15p on the insured worker and £7 for the agricultural community, the rates bore a very substantial portion of the cost of the health services which the Minister and his Government have removed. In the last year of service of the previous Administration the contribution through these same taxpayers &mdash;because a very substantial volume of insured workers and the agricultural community are ratepayers also&mdash; was £36 million.  Through the decision of the National Coalition Government this has been reduced to £13½ million, which is a very substantial saving for those people.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with medical cards.  Medical cards since their introduction have been a problem.  But credit is due to the Minister for, despite the fact he is not yet two years in office, making an effort to introduce uniformity by bringing the health boards and their chief executive officers together and seeking a proper standard of eligibility for medical cards.  What was the position before the Minister took over?  I never saw a guideline on medical cards.  In fact, political influence played a great part in eligibility before the Minister got the chief executive officers and the health boards to endeavour to establish national standards and to have those eligibility standards well publicised for single people, married people and have specific allowances for children.</P>
    <P>These are important aspects and I believe the Minister deserves credit for his efforts.  We will have an opportunity, perhaps at a later stage, of dealing with the wider aspects of the health services.  The aspects on which criticism has been levelled at the Minister here this afternoon are mainly the responsibility of the health boards, who have direct responsibility for the operation of the health services.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for ensuring that the health services will continue to expand.  In this wide, comprehensive contribution scheme, no unreasonable hardship is being imposed on those on whom he is calling. Senator Killilea mentioned farm labourers.  If he had read the preamble <Col N="235" /> to this Bill he would have seen that the Minister and the Government have excluded farm labourers, among others, from this extra contribution.</P>

      <P>My contribution on this Bill will be very brief as I have a bad cold and my voice is not too good this afternoon.  I feel it important for me to comment on this Bill because it deals with the raising of increased revenue to finance the activities of the various health boards which have been established throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I am one who was never overenthusiastic about health boards.  I felt that the work could have been more effectively carried out by each local authority, as was the case previously. However, the health boards are now established.  They are functioning and I do not know if anyone has any intention, either now or in the near future, of changing the system.  I would ask the Minister, in view of the enormous cost of maintaining the health boards, to examine the administration of the health boards and examine their methods of administering the various headings under which staff officers, personnel officers and so on are appointed, because we have groups who are all lieutenants with very, very few privates under their control.  The Minister should seriously consider&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope not.  This Bill has become necessary to provide the Department of Health with further finances to service the activities of the various health boards.  Like every other Bill that calls for new taxation, this Bill is unwelcome now because many people feel they are already being overtaxed and that the proposed increases will add further to their difficulties.  Therefore, it is important that the Minister ensures that the best possible value will be obtained from the money he hopes to raise by the further increases mentioned in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that there is no provision in the Bill for the extension of hospital services.  Throughout the country the hue and cry is for the extension of hospital services.  I live in the Midland Health Board area and I live in the biggest county in that area. Mullingar town is crying out for hospital extensions.  They are crying out for a major regional hospital, and I am anxious to know if any of the money being raised for those further increases will be channeled towards the provision of hospital services in Mullingar or even towards the provision of a children's ward.  The Minister is fully aware, from receiving deputations and so on, of the need for a regional hospital and for a children's ward.  We are dealing with the hospital which was first erected in 1938 and which has had very very few extensions since then, despite the fact that there has been expansions in the health services and that many new aids have been introduced into our hospitalisation programme.  Therefore, I would like the Minister, to spell out the new items to which he proposes to allocate some of this increased expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greater flexibility should be exercised <Col N="237" /> by the CEOs of the various health boards in the implementation of the health services.  I refer now, of course, to the borderline cases.  There are the cases where the old £7 contribution covered farmers with up to £60 valuation.  On a £61 valuation you may have a man who is in more difficulty than a man with a £40 valuation or a medical card holder who has had long periods of illness within the family, invalidity, disease and so on.  Those people should be considered under this scheme.  The qualifying valuation limit should be increased mainly because of the falling-off in farm incomes and because of the falling-off in the value of agricultural land in general.  If the Minister decided to increase the valuation to £65 for the new £12 eligibility, he would be catering for the section of the community that has suffered a great deal since the implementation of the present £7.</P>
    <P>The instances of hardship in that category of people are many and their problems have become difficult. In many cases people have been unable to avail of hospital treatment or expensive drugs because of the prohibitive costs of the services involved. Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister to endeavour to increase the valuation limit to £65.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to improve and extend the services dealing with the treatment of alcoholics.  It is a tragedy in this day and age that alcoholism has become a real and pressing problem.  It is a problem that has attracted the attention of many people and one which has caused ruin in many homes.  I would like the Minister to establish within each health board area a special unit or special ward solely for the treatment of alcoholics.</P>

      <P>The Senator need not go into any detail in explaining. I am merely asking him to deal with a point which would be more relevant to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am appealing to the Minister to allow the CEOs of the various health boards to exercise greater flexibility in determining the qualifying incomes for the issue of medical cards.  Somebody mentioned old age pensioners being asked to have medical cards reviewed.  Under existing regulations all old age pensioners qualify automatically for medical cards, and therefore I do not know how any health board should ask that the income of any old age pensioner should be reinvestigated.</P>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the problem which has arisen in the past with regard to farmers with land valuation and the demand for £7.  I have evidence that people have paid the £7 and the following year they have got a demand for £14, and the third year they have got a demand for £21, despite the fact that they have had in their possession receipts for each contribution for the particular years.  These errors were due to there being no proper accounting system.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that problem does not occur again, because people feel very annoyed when they receive a final notice and read the small print that they are liable to a fine not exceeding £100 if that £21 is not paid, despite the fact that the individual concerned holds already receipts for the £7 each year.  This should not happen.  The Minister should impress on the various health boards the importance of keeping a proper record of all contributions from people within the various categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer now to one item in our hospitalisation services which is lacking, facilities for the training of nurses.  It is a tragedy that our girls have to go to England to train and come home then and seek employment as qualified nurses.  I know the Cathaoirleach will check me again for wandering away <Col N="239" /> from the terms of the Bill, but we lack adequate training facilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the difficult job that any Minister for Health has to perform.  I readily admit that he has to be a dedicated person and that he must have a great concern for the health of the nation as a whole. In saying that, I am not implying that the present Minister is any different from any other Minister for Health we have had.  I freely admit, too, that to give the best service that can be given it is necessary to get the funds because without the funds the services cannot be provided.  Those of us who are on health boards, on county health committees or connected with services like that appreciate the enormous amount of money it takes to carry out even slight improvements in these health services.  Consequently, one can understand why a Minister for Health has to come in here and look for an extra £3½ million.  I find no fault with that, but I do find fault with the method by which it is being done.</P>
      <P>This idea of giving people a budgetary injection every two or three weeks is not the best way of doing it. An annual budget is an annual budget, and people should try to budget for the service of the nation for the year ahead. When we take into consideration that £27 million was raised in taxation recently on petrol, £2.5 million subsidy on butter, that is a total of over £40 million and is a very big mini-budget. The people who are asked to pay this are, in my opinion, people who can least afford to pay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that the value of money has depreciated considerably since this was first introduced, and I am quite sure that any one will say that £7 three or four years ago would be equivalent <Col N="240" /> to £12 now.  For that reason I would agree with this increase because of inflation, but the people who are being asked to pay this now are the farming community, that section of them who have been hit very badly in 1974.  This year will go down in history as a disastrous year for the small farmers.  Indeed, it will go down as the year when the great exodus of these people from rural districts was started and augmented. When these people pull up the roots and decide to go, it does not matter what type of health services or what type of schools we have, Ireland will be losing the best part of its people.</P>
    <P>I do not want people to stay in places like that and live in poverty. The people who were living on these small farms were hard working industrious people who made a wonderful contribution to this nation.  They were the people who brought in the milk to the creameries and ensured that thousands of our workers were kept in jobs in milk powder factories, making butter and cheese, and in various other industries based on agricultural produce. The day we lose that we will lose something of great value.</P>
    <P>There is another section who will find that their contribution increased from £16 up to £26.  It is easy for other people to say that that increase is only the price of a packet of cigarettes, but all these things add up.  The natural question any of these would pose is, if it is necessary to provide all this money, why was the Minister for Health suggesting that we should have a free-for-all health service up to the very top of the scale.  Why was that being contemplated when at that time thousands of people were quite satisfied to join the voluntary health and were able to pay for their own services? The people we have to keep an eye on are, of course, those people who are sick and, in particular, those who have not the means to pay for their medical attention.  You will find these people are in the lower income bracket and these are the people for whom we should cater.  We could not try now to saddle an overburdened rural community, in particular, small farmers and these workers, with this extra taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> In the dental service there is ample room for improvement.  There must be something wrong with our health services and our whole approach if in 1974 young people have to have teeth removed and find that when they come to 20 years of age they have to get artificial teeth.  There is something wrong with our food and our health services and things in general.  Prevention would be far better than cure and some body should be set up to study this, because it certainly tied up very closely with the health services. There is another discrimination that is often made, and that is in dental services for children who are over 12 years of age&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I must intervene.  The Senator is talking in detail about particular aspects of the health services.  This is not a debate on the health services; it is a debate on health contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just making the point that children who leave national schools at 12 years and go to a secondary or a vocational school are caught between two stools and they have no dental services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I would like to mention, although I suppose it has been flogged often enough, is our hospitalisation services.  In my county of Cavan over the years various bodies have made representations for the new hospital there.  I am a member of the health committee and I am a member of the health board; I am also a member of the Dublin Hospitals Board, and they have all cleared this up along the line to have this hospital built in Cavan where there is need for it, due to fire hazard, inadequate equipment, and a danger that the staff would become depleted.  I would appeal to the Minister&mdash;he is a reasonable man&mdash; to make his decision on this and to press the Minister for Finance to provide the finances.  We have to accept our geographical position in the northwest, but when we see that already three hospitals have been sanctioned for Dublin city, we up in the northwest feel we have been left out.  We would not be asking to have this done except that it is needed for the patients <Col N="242" /> in that area and that it is long overdue. I am quite confident the Minister will make the best possible provision for us.</P>
    <P>There is another point, which may not be a matter for the Minister, but I have often felt that in setting these various guidelines for giving medical cards or giving other benefits this practice of providing for valuations of up to £20 and then probably from £20 to £35 and £35 to £50 is antiquated, and there should be a sliding scale.  It might be difficult to administer but it would be better for the individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment very briefly on what has been said here already and on the health services in general.  Firstly, on the introduction of the health boards many people had misgivings in varying degrees about the new board's ability and capacity to give a service to the public.  The old system, worked on the county basis, had been there for many years and the attempt to rationalise a system through the introduction of health boards covering wider areas was looked on with a certain amount of apprehension at the time.  But after some years in operation we are now in a position to look back and assess to what degree the health boards have been successful in giving us this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will have to wait for another occasion on which to make that assessment.  The organisation of the health services is not relevant to the Second Stage debate on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason the Minister has to ask for an increased contribution is that the yield from the local authority rate has been diminishing since the Minister took office.  We now find ourselves reaching a situation whereby the total dependence of the health scheme will be on the Exchequer. We all know that we are living in a period of inflation and in <Col N="243" /> order even to mark time we must provide extra finance which must come from somewhere.  When the Minister and Government decided to take the health costs from the rates the only other source of income for the Exchequer was from increased taxation.</P>
      <P>This increase of £3½ million has been mentioned by Senator Killilea as being a vast one.  I would not quibble with figures but I would quibble with his use of the English language.  He mentioned &ldquo;vast&rdquo; and repeated it a few times.  Three and a half million pounds on a total expenditure of £166 million could not be regarded as a vast expenditure.  It is a very small percentage of the total outlay.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to taxation increases, we know, is that it will hit many people who are ill-prepared to pay the extra cost.  However, there is real hope for the future in what the Minister has said, in that he is prepared and has under active consideration the whole review of the financing of the health scheme.  This is something for which we should be very grateful.  Before I conclude I should like to point out that the Western Health Board have been mentioned here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that in upgrading and downgrading of hospitals it is a function of the health boards to make representations to Comhairle na Ospidéal who decide what kind of grading a hospital should get.  I would suggest to the Minister that Comhairle na nOspidéal are made up of faceless people, that they have not been elected.  They have great influence and authority.  Because of their make-up they have too much authority and the Minister should look carefully at this situation to see if the administration of the type of hospitals we want is not placed in the hands of people who must not face the public and must not stand over their actions. The Minister is being used by Comhairle na Ospidéal as a man who must face the public to carry the can for them.  This is unfair.  The present <Col N="244" /> format under which we all work was introduced by the last Government. The Minister is now trying to see in which way this can be improved and he is to be complimented for this effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because, as you have pointed out, much of the debate on health matters is not relevant to the Bill.  This Bill is basically a taxation Bill.  It is concerned with how to raise moneys so as to continue the existing level of health services.  The whole principle involved in raising money in this way is regressive rather than progressive.  The Minister admitted in the Dáil that that was a view that many people held.  There is not much merit in relieving the rates on one hand&mdash;rates relief is a regressive form of taxation&mdash;and on the other seeking to increase payments of this kind which are basically taxation payments on a fixed headage basis.  The fixed payment basis in regard to mature persons now rises to 26p per week and in regard to farmers of under £60 valuation to £12 per annum, an increase of 80 per cent in each case. These measures are just as regressive in the form of payments to revenue as rates, and they have the weakness in contrast to rates that&mdash;we made this point consistently in the argument against the manner in which the rates were relieved by the Government after the last general election&mdash;by applying that relief right across the board, many people, not just those in the middle income or the limited eligibility groups but those at very high rateable valuation levels, in the private, industrial and administrative areas, were relieved of rates in respect of health contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been our consistent criticism. We are now going back to a regressive form of taxation but it is limited to people who cannot afford it.  Under the redrafted regressive taxation system of rates relief in regard to health charges, people above the social welfare insurance category and the £60 valuation&mdash;firms, insurance companies, banks and so on&mdash;were relieved of their liability to pay rates in respect of health charges.  I concede that the Minister and the Government were in <Col N="245" /> the straitjacket of an election promise, which was very inadvisable.  They will now have to reconsider it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has rightly set up a comprehensive review in the whole financing of rates and social welfare. What will emerge in that review is some form of differential within the rate relief system so as to ensure that ratepayers in the very high income category are not relieved of liability in respect of health charges while at the same time introducing an 80 per cent increase in the form of regressive payments per head by people who are social welfare contributors and farmers under £60 valuation.</P>
    <P>This is a retrograde step.  I appreciate the Minister's situation.  He is faced, as he said in his statement, with a bill in respect of health services which cannot but create alarm, a jump from £86 million in 1971-72 to an annual amount of £166 million.  I thought that in the Dáil, by implication, the Minister was quite frank in implying, without saying it specifically, that this presented very serious problems to the Exchequer.  The Minister said specifically, when he referred to the problem, that during the next two years there would be serious Exchequer implications particularly in regard to the growth of revenue.  This holds problems in finding sources for the financing of the health services.</P>
    <P>This is why&mdash;I am being very critical here&mdash;I feel that the Government have got themselves into a straitjacket over their pre-election promises in regard to rates.  By reason of that they are depriving themselves of a source of finance in the very top income and ratepaying bracket.  That source of finance would be available to them only for the blanket nature of the pre-election promise which meant that they were cut away from a very fruitful source of revenue that would lie in the area of very high income ratepayers.</P>
    <P>They now find themselves in the situation that in order to get a mere £3.5 million they are bringing in an 80 per cent increase for the very category whom the health services should now be designed to assist to a greater degree, the limited eligibility category <Col N="246" /> who, by reason of the galloping inflation in which we live, are now in the category that should be within the segment of the general medical services. The people who are now being hit with an 80 per cent increase are people many of whom, by reason of the present cost of living and the inflation situation, are being included in the category of general medical services.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed very frankly the difficulties that health boards are finding in raising the present annual sum from the farming community. I feel that in the straitened financial situation which we have one aspect that should be supported is that of reconsidering the rates relief which is given to the very wealthy ratepayers. The second aspect which will have to be explored&mdash;the Minister can get away with it at a Labour Party conference or through the Labour Party&mdash;is the question of pursuing the free for all health and medical scheme in our present circumstances.  The Minister is well aware that it is just not on in the present financial situation. We do not have the hospitals and there is no sign of the capital being available to provide the hospitals; we do not have the facilities or the capital to provide the facilities; we do not have the personnel on the medical and nursing side to provide for such a free-for-all scheme.  All we are doing by following a doctrinaire approach rather than a pragmatic approach is bringing in again the wealthy category that could be well serviced through the voluntary health scheme. I feel the logical way to do this is to expand the voluntary health scheme for that category, and within the middle and the lower income category to improve the services considerably in these two areas.</P>
    <P>The two areas that I think should be improved enormously are the dental services and the people who are suffering from permanent illness. We should gradually blend the general medical service category&mdash;the lower income group&mdash;into the middle income group by taking a greater share of the middle income group into the free medical services net.  From the <Col N="247" /> viewpoint of pragmatic improvement and in the period of scarce resources that will be with us for the next two years&mdash;the Minister mentioned this&mdash; we should be concerned about allocating revenue for health purposes in the most effective manner possible.  We should not waste money in an area where it is not required.  I am talking about the upper income category.  If we do not have the hospitals, facilities and the personnel to do it, why do it? In an era of scarce resources we should devote the resources to where they are required, the areas of people in the middle and lower categories. We should devise taxation methods that will burden those two categories as little as possible.</P>
    <P>This measure burdens one of those categories totally.  The only people affected here are the people in the middle income category who are being asked to pay an 80 per cent increase for health services while at the same time the Minister is planning to have a radical change in the health services. He is going to bring in a wealthy category that will burden everybody to a greater degree, while at the same time people in the higher rate paying category are being relieved of the obligation to pay health charges.</P>
    <P>I make those few remarks because I think they are relevant to the Minister's problem.  I know his problems are part of the overall Government problems in the present situation.  I think that in any review of the financing of the health services the two attitudes I mentioned will have to be borne in mind.  Regarding the Health Bill we are now being presented with, the doctrinaire scheme that was announced by the Minister at the Labour Party Conference is just not on.  The Minister would get far more credit from the community if he was straight with them.</P>
    <P>My implication arising from his speeches in the Dáil and in the Seanad on the very frank picture of the revenue situation, is that it is not on.  A comprehensive scheme to include all the people including the wealthy category is not possible in our present situation.  We should concentrate <Col N="248" /> on the areas of real need.  In that situation the financing should bear as lightly as possible on the people who are in real need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I will also be brief.  I think it is necessary to stress again&mdash; it has been stressed by Senator Lenihan&mdash;that this is essentially not a Health Bill but a taxing Bill.  It is part of the general pre-budget activity on the part of the Government designed apparently to load as much pre-budget taxation as possible on the community in order to lighten, or seem to lighten, the ultimate effect of the budget itself.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that one of his problems is that there is a considerable shortfall this year in receipts from these contributions.  The figure he is short is £500,000 due mainly to the fact that farmers, in particular, have done very badly this year.  Owing to the extreme economic problems that they have been suffering they have been unable or unwilling to pay this £7 per week.  Therefore, the Minister is short a half million pounds.  It seems an extraordinary time for any Minister, particularly a Minister who always claimed to be progressive, to come in here and load a still further demand on those who have already shown that they are unable to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave very little hope for these farmers and others who have been unable this year to pay their contributions.  He said he accepted that there would be circumstances which in individual cases might make it difficult for people to make payments at the appropriate time and that it would be reasonable in such cases for health boards to accept payment in instalments.  He expects the health boards to do so.  I would have thought that a better way to do it would be to suggest that health boards, where satisfied that the individuals were unable because of economic circumstances to make these payments, should remit them.  There is no question of that: the Minister makes it clear that the money must be paid but that he expects the health boards to accept payment in instalments.  The <Col N="249" /> Minister admits that people are unable to pay but he further stresses that people who do not pay may have proceedings initiated against them for the recovery of the amount due.  In this very difficult situation he put an increase of 70 to 80 per cent on the contribution.  As Senator Lenihan said, of all the systems of taxation that could be devised, this is the most regressive. It is worse than the rating system itself because the rating system is, in a crude kind of way, geared to the rateable valuations of the people involved whereas these contributions are blanket sums that do not depend in any way on the size of a man's farm or the size of his income.  It is a most regressive form of taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech in the Dáil&mdash;he was wise to omit it from his speech here today&mdash;took the opportunity to stress the need for all concerned to moderate their demands for increases in incomes.  How can anyone expect people to moderate their demands for increases in incomes when the Government are simultaneously taking steps which have the direct effect of reducing their incomes? This is part of a general pattern of Government policy in advance of the budget.  It is, of course, one of measures of this kind.</P>
    <P>A month or two ago we had the extraordinary onslaught on the public by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in loading some £13 million extra on postal and telephone charges to meet a situation where the deficit in his Department was a mere £3 million or £4 million, but the extra £10 million or so was added.  We had the notorious petrol onslaught, another £27 million; we had the removal of the subsidy on butter so that consumers, particularly those with large families and small incomes, had to pay an extra 4p per lb.  This meant another £3 million for the Exchequer.  Finally, we have this rather mean little Bill which adds another £3½ million.  The total of these so far this autumn, in advance of the budget, before the budget proposals have even been framed let alone introduced, means that all of us are paying an extra £46 million per year.  This is merely part of <Col N="250" /> a much larger pattern and it should be treated in that way.</P>
    <P>This Bill does nothing to improve the health services&mdash;no one will be any better as a result.  It is simply ludicrous for the Minister and others to suggest that it is necessary to bring this in because of a remission of rates. We were not told at the time of the last general election that if the burden of health charges on rates was remitted the ratepayers would have to pay additional sums of this kind. These are two completely different things.  Rates should not be brought into it at all.  This is simply a taxing Bill.  It can be included with the petrol taxation, with the removal of the subsidy on butter and the vast increase in postal rates as an advance notice of the budget in an effort to relieve the Minister for Finance of some of the problems that he will face on budget day.  For that reason we must oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senators who contributed to the debate.  I appreciate their concern about local matters and about some of the general matters raised.  I was intrigued to discover that at least one of the prominent members of the Fianna Fáil Party was disillusioned about the health boards.  He described them as failures.  It is only a short time since these boards were established and Senator Killilea suggested that there was waste, that there were too many people employed, particularly by the Western Health Board.  Deputies in the other House were full of praise for that health board, and in particular for the CEO.</P>
      <P>The health boards have been established and it would be almost impossible to reconstitute them on the basis of counties.  If there is waste, if there are too many people employed, I suggest that members of the health boards would pinpoint where these problems occur.  So far as the Department are concerned, expenditure is severely monitored and new appointments are not easily made, unless they are absolutely necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a bit late in the day for Fianna Fáil to say that we should revert to <Col N="251" /> the old system whereby the county council were the health authority area.  The health boards were made to ensure economies.  It is difficult to compare present costs with those incurred under the old county system but let nobody be under the impression that moneys expended on the health services are squandered in any way.  It was a bit of a contradiction when the Senator who referred to waste of money said that there were not enough moneys being allocated to the health board in his region.</P>
    <P>I was intrigued to hear Fianna Fáil Senators talking about the shortage of hospital beds.  Fianna Fáil must take a fair share of responsibility for that.  I am not referring to their 16 years of office; I am referring to the time when Deputy Seán Flanagan, as Minister for Health, instructed what were afterwards called the Fitzgerald Committee to draw up a plan for the country.  This plan was presented to the Government in 1968 and nobody will deny that from 1968 to 1973 nothing was done about the provision of hospitals and although they said they accepted, in general, the Fitzgerald Report, nothing in the world was done to implement it, to have it discussed or to have it moderated or supplemented in any way.  I have been given the task now and I am going about my business as a democrat should.</P>
    <P>Apart from the report of the working parties in the various areas.  I undertook to consult and am now engaged in consulting local interests. The decisions will be made as soon as possible.  In some areas they will not be popular decisions; in other areas, where acute general hospitals will be established, they will be popular decisions.  Sometimes we regret what we said five or six years ago, either in the Dáil or in the Seanad, but I was amused to hear Senator Yeats, Lenihan and others describe this as a taxation Bill.  If it is a taxation Bill now, what was it when it was introduced in 1971?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It was given the title <Col N="252" />&ldquo;Health Contributions&rdquo;.  Senator Yeats said also that it was neither right nor proper to have pre-budget legislation of this kind before the introduction of the budget next month. One could make the same criticism of the regime in 1970 which introduced this particular scheme about a month after the budget was introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If it had been before the budget, there would be the same criticism.  This health contribution was meant to be permanent.  Fianna Fáil Senators know that better than anybody else.  It was made clear in June, 1971 by the then Minister for Health, the late Mr. Erskine Childers, who said in the Official Report at column 334 volume 255 that &ldquo;contributions would not remain static and were bound to increase&rdquo;.  In what circumstances would there be increases in health contributions?  Nothing was done from 1971 to 1973.  I do not take the former Minister to task about that. This Bill increases the rates fixed in 1971.  It is not unreasonable that they should be increased particularly when one has regard to the increases in all other costs, particularly in the field of health.  I will not go too deeply into the colossal increases that have occurred in the various fields of health.</P>
      <P>The health services in 1971-72 cost £86 million and in 1974 cost £166 million.  That is an increase of £80 million or 93 per cent.  One would imagine, in accordance with the manner in which the Bill was originally introduced and in view of the increase in these costs and the fact that health contributions were to be a factor in financing the health services, that there might have been increases in the interim period between 1971 and 1973. It is reasonable to expect that health contributions would also increase. These are but one factor in paying for the health services: the others being the Exchequer and rates.  This is the system I inherited from my late predecessor and one at which I intend to have a further look.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between the period 1971-72 and <Col N="253" /> 1974, the cost of limited eligibility services for the middle income group increased by over 90 per cent.  If the late Mr. Erskine Childers believed it should be permanent, in those circumstances he also might have increased the health contributions.  It has been suggested that this was a contribution to general taxation and to the Exchequer. The increase of £3½ million will go to the health services as will be seen from the Book of Estimates.  I am not enamoured of the present system and I will review the method of financing.  There will also be a review of the financing of the social welfare benefits and the assistance group. I propose to carry out that review in conjunction with a review of the social welfare services.</P>
    <P>I do not think our difficulty is unique as regards financing health services. Governments all over the world are grappling with this problem of how to finance rapidly rising costs in the health services.  Nobody could say we were near perfection, even in this country. Every day more demands are made by people in all sectors.  We should always strive to ensure that the best services possible are available for our people.  There is no easy solution.  I hope this review body will be able to propose a better system of financing. There is no guarantee that this will happen as this problem exists practically in every country of Europe, but in any case it is worth exploring.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion among the contributions today that a system of pay-related contributions should be introduced.  I would not be committed to the pay-related type of payments. It is separate and distinct from pay-related payments in social welfare.  If one pays at a certain rate, the rate of disability benefit or unemployment benefit is related to the payment made.  If they were pay-related it would merely mean that people would be paying different amounts of money for the same service.  This may be a system whereby one could get more from those who are regarded as being rich but nobody could say those earning £25, £35, £40, £45 per week were wealthy.  Therefore, there would be a disparity between the man with <Col N="254" /> £25 or £30 a week as against the man with £35 or £40.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with a particular service.  If it were suggested that a pay-related system should be used to finance health I would say that it would be wrong because one is paying for the same service.  At times, we have been sneered at as being doctrinaire socialists.  We have demonstrated in the last 21 months that we are practical socialists.  The evidence of this lies in the field of the Department of Social Welfare.  Not even the members of the Fianna Fáil Party really believed we could be so relatively generous.  It must be conceded that the benefits given in the two budgets far outshone any of the benefits given by Fianna Fáil having regard to the increases in the cost of living and so on.</P>
      <P>While I do not want to anticipate what the Minister for Finance might do, I will merely say that we are committed to helping these people who are dependent on assistance or welfare either from the Department of Social Welfare of the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>The Senator's party had their own in their day.  There were a few turnover taxes, wholesale taxes, increases in postage and so on. I am in the House too long to be taken in by this.  It has been said that these increases are due mainly to inflation and higher wages.  This is not so.  We have increased expenditure on health in real terms by 8 per cent in the year 1973-74 and in the present year by 7 per cent.  That is not such a bad record.  At the same time, we have reduced the liability of rate-payers' in respect of contributions towards health services from £36 million in 1972-73 to £13.5 million in 1974. The rates contributions in 1975 will be further reduced to £9 million until they are eliminated altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lenihan chided us about <Col N="255" /> this and suggested that this is an advantage which is given to property owners and owners of big houses and big estates, and so on.  We have done this only in respect of health and housing subsidies.  How much more unfair would it be if rates were to be removed entirely?  Surely that would be to the benefit of those in the higher income group and of little or no advantage to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Rates will be reduced and finally eliminated altogether.  In the last 20 months we have started to remove what I regard to be the most regressive element of health service financing.  This is appreciated by the public and by public representatives.</P>
      <P>This increase has been described as an imposition on the middle income group.  Approximately 90 per cent of the cost of services for those in the middle income group&mdash;those who are entitled to limited eligibility&mdash;is borne by the Exchequer.  This percentage is rising very rapidly every year.  All sections of the population, including the upper income group, are contributing towards the cost of the service through taxation.  Some people suggest that the entire cost should be borne by the Exchequer.  I am not committed, as I said, one way or another in this matter.</P>
      <P>I repeat that I hope the review group will be able to recommend a different type of financing.  When they do I certainly will give it my consideration to find out what is the most equitable form of providing finance for the health services.  Whatever the final decision, I must continue the present method, which I inherited and one about which I am not too happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were complaints as well that there were no dramatic changes in <Col N="256" /> legislation in the field of health.  I believe that health services can be improved without additional legislation.  I agree that the Act of 1970 was a comprehensive Act which allowed any Minister for Health to make all these improvements that are down on paper, provided the money was there.</P>
    <P>As I said, I think the Act of 1970 is good in itself.  It provided for a great deal of services which even the late Minister could not deliver.  Therefore, the problem is not legislation; it is the problem of finding the financial resources.  Within the existing legislation it was possible for me to make improvements over the last 21 months. The situation described here of people trying to get into hospital, not getting dentures and so on, has been there since 1953.  In the Act of 1970 there is provision to make certain services available by regulation to those in the middle income group.  The difficulty is to concentrate on the application of these funds and services to the lower income group.</P>
    <P>I was asked what specific improvements could be made with the £3½ million.  I could not say accurately what specific improvements could be made, but I can point out what I did between 1972-73 and 1974-75.  In that year, health expenditure increased by £61 million, or 58 per cent.  The amount of money allocated to the Department of Health by the Government was not ungenerous.  It has been referred to in this debate.  It enabled me, for example, to devote £1 million per annum to the constant care allowance for severely mentally and physically handicapped children.  I gave them £25 per month, with no means test.  That certainly could be regarded as a vast improvement in the position of these unfortunate young children.</P>
    <P>Senator Killilea and Senator McGlinchey talked about expenditure on home help.  That was increased between 1972-73 and 1973-74.  In 1972-73 it was £150,000, and for this year it is £344,000.  Many more home helps have been recruited by the health boards.  We now have 3,000 of these people employed by the health boards and voluntary organisations.  Even this relatively small amount of money helps to keep old people, or those with <Col N="257" /> ailments, in the community rather than have them sent to geriatric homes or other institutions.  Allied with that, there has been a determined and successful effort by me, as Minister for Health, and by the Department to develop the social work services. These services are being developed as quickly as our universities can train the new social workers.  I am glad to be able to say that 33 post-graduate students are being sponsored by the health boards after their final year. There is evidence as well&mdash;I referred to this in my Estimate speech&mdash;of increased financial support for community information services through the National Social Service Council. This was very much desired and sought after by Members of the Oireachtas over a long period.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that nothing has been done for hospitals.  In 1974 £73 million was spent on the maintenance and development of the general hospital services.  The details of that are in my Estimate speech. This year, a sum of £46 million was devoted to services for the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped and provision of services in the psychiatric hospitals.  This area of illness is now being highlighted to the extent that much more money is being spent in order to ensure that those who are mentally ill or mentally handicapped will not alone be looked after but will also be trained, where possible, for outside employment or, if that is not possible, for sheltered employment. More money is being provided for psychiatric services in the community, in out-patient clinics, and for accommodation for mentally handicapped children and adults.  There is a new emphasis on training for outside employment and, where necessary, sheltered employment.  There is also a new emphasis on the community psychiatric services for these people.</P>
    <P>Senator McGlinchey referred to the rate of increase in expenditure and to deficiencies in the service.  The expenditure on real improvements in 1974&mdash; that is, on a notional basis in a 12-month period as set out in detail in the Dáil debates&mdash;was £9 million.  This is made up as follows: £4.5 million on <Col N="258" /> improving our general and psychiatric hospitals, including the provision of new units and improving both services and staffing; £1.5 million on the provvision of extra places in homes for mentally handicapped and the aged; £1.3 million increase in real expenditure on our general medical services; £1.7 million on improving community care services, especially the home help, child help and social work services. These are just a few examples of the extra services being provided because I was allocated so much money for 1974.</P>
    <P>There have been comments about the obligations of farmers to pay the £7 per week&mdash;£12 when the Bill passes. Frankly, some do not pay and have not paid since the scheme was introduced. There is an obligation on the health boards to collect this money. I mentioned in my speech that, if anyone had difficult in paying the £7 or £12, it could be paid by instalments. We all have an appreciation of the difficulties of farmers in 1974.  We also remember the good years they had in 1972 and 1973.</P>

      <Col N="260" /> It was suggested that there would be a cut-back this year.  I want to assure Senators that there will certainly be no cut-back.  Again, as I said in the Dáil, I would be dishonest if I told them there would be the same rate of improvements in 1975. I do not want to highlight the economic situation or go into it in detail, but everybody recognises that there are difficulties and it would not be possible to go ahead at the same speed as we did in 1973 and 1974.  The increase provided for health in the current Book of Estimates represents an increase of about 37 per cent.</P>
    <P>Senators were concerned, as we all are, about medical cards.  Some suggested one of my priorities should be the improvement of the guidelines for entitlement to a medical card.  In consultation with the CEOs I had proper guidelines drawn up that would be applied uniformly throughout the country.  Every public representative or citizen knows his or her entitlement. In addition, because of the review held last January, there was an increase to 35 per cent of the population now covered by the medical cards, representing approximately an additional 100,000 people covered.</P>

      <P>I am sorry about that. The CEOs, in consultation with me, also proposed to have another review of the guidelines in January.  It would be desirable in the present situation to have these guidelines reviewed again in June, again in consultation with <Col N="261" /> the CEOs, because a year is far too long.  A man's circumstances can change very drastically in a year.  For that reason, therefore, I believe the CEOs will make a recommendation to the effect that there would have to be a review, say, twice a year.</P>
      <P>I indicated in my speech that the limit of £1,600 would be increased by regulation.  A figure has not been put on it yet, but I would say it will be £2,250 or possibly £2,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say again how <Col N="262" /> appreciative I am of the contributions that have been made by the various Senators.  I hope they will agree with me, even though it is a relatively small amount of money, that because it goes to the health services directly it is a worthwhile contribution from those who are required to pay and, indeed, is in present circumstances a very good insurance for the contributor and his family against ill health.</P>

      <P>The drafting of a main amending Bill providing for important changes in broadcasting legislation is far advanced and it will be circulated in the new year.  I intend to initiate this main amending Bill in the Seanad and Senator will have the opportunity of discussing broadcasting in depth at that stage.</P>
      <P>The present short uncontroversial Bill now before the Seanad is merely an interim measure to enable the existing financial arrangements in regard to RTE to be continued for a short period.  Legislation providing continuing statutory authority to pay RTE the grant in respect of net receipts from broadcasting licences fees is required before the end of December, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangements for paying grants to RTE in respect of net receipts from broadcasting licence fees have existed since the establishment of the authority. Section 22 (1) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, provided for <Col N="263" /> the payment of such grants during each of the five financial years ended 31st March, 1965.  Section 2 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1966, and further amending Acts in 1971 and 1973 extended this period up to 31st March, 1974.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer financial year now ends on 31st December so the present Bill provides for a further extension of a little less than two years, that is up to 31st December, 1975.</P>
    <P>In practice the gross licence fees collected by the Post Office are paid into the Exchequer, and the Vote for Posts and Telegraphs contains provision in a special subhead for a grant-in-aid equal to the gross receipts less the collection costs and any amounts incurred by the Department in connection with prevention of interference to reception of radio and television programmes.</P>
    <P>Pending the passing of amending legislation, RTE's grant for general purposes for the nine-month period 1st April to 31st December, 1974, was calculated in the usual way and was included in my Department's Estimate which was approved in June, 1974. The present Bill provides for payments made since 1st April, 1974, and for further payments to be made in the period up to the end of December, 1975.</P>
    <P>Over the last five financial years, RTE's income has been a mere I.4 per cent greater than current expenditure and the small surplus was quite inadequate to finance their capital needs. The higher licence fees which came into operation on 1st October, 1974, and the increases in advertising rates which were applied from the same date will merely enable them to break even on current account in the period up to end March, 1976.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, Senators will have the opportunity to discuss broadcasting in depth when the main Broadcasting Bill is going through the House early next year.  In view of the non-controversial but technical nature of the present measure it might be more appropriate to defer a general debate on RTE until then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá faoin rud seo.  Níl sé ar intinn agam mórán a rá, ach sílim gur ceart dom cúpla focal a rá mar gheall ar an seirbhís agus na cláir a chuireann siad amach don ghnáth-dhuine.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister is aware that there are many parts of the country where Radio Éireann is not available. That is a technical fault and in particular applies in Northern Ireland. It has been announced that it is the intention of the Minister to provide a second channel to ensure that BBC will be available all over the country. I am liberal enough to concede that there are parts of the country where television viewers are able to get the three channels: ITV, BBC and RTE. It is ridiculous that any Minister or any Department would fall over backwards trying to bring an alien culture into every part of the country at a time when there are many areas where they are unable to get their own national broadcasting system, either Telefís Éireann or Radio Éireann.  The people of all Ireland would expect that our national broadcasting organisation would cater for the whole country and that that should be a top priority.</P>
      <P>It is well known that in many parts of our neighbouring country, England, they are unable to hear Radio Éireann. I am not a technical man but I remember the time when the broadcasting equipment which were purchased to provide a short-wave radio station was sold by a former Coalition Government. That was a backward step. I know of thousands of people from all over Ireland who were forced to emigrate to England and Scotland and who would take an immense pride in being able to listen in to an All-Ireland Final or listen to some of the news from the home country.  Unfortunately, they are unable to do so because of these technical matters.  If any extra money is being provided or if any improvement is envisaged that is one area that should be seen to.  Our exiles, as well as those living all over the country, would be thankful to us for doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend going into the question of programmes in detail but a national broadcasting system should <Col N="265" /> reflect the national image.  I believe that the vast majority of our people would like to have our own way of life portrayed in our national broadcasting system.  I shudder to see the youth of Ireland switching on and listening in to all this canned material that comes in from abroad.  We must remember that the present day youth will be the citizens of tomorrow. While I do not think there should be any strict censorship nevertheless we should be able to identify our broadcasting with our way of life.</P>
    <P>We often overlook the fact that the Irish language has been taught here for the past 50 years.  We overlook the fact that now there is almost free post-primary education up to university level available in many areas. We are an intelligent people and many many thousands of our people are bilingual.  I do not expect changes overnight, but the people providing our broadcasting services should avail of every opportunity to use our national language, particularly in school programmes and in wishing happy birthdays to young children and so on.  This is something no public representative should have to ask them to do.  It should be more or less expected of them that they would do that.</P>
    <P>I put tremendous stress on the spoken tongue.  Recently Senator West moved an excellent motion asking for oral examinations in French or German.  I believe that our people are very much influenced by what they see on Telefis Éireann and what they hear on Radio Éireann.  For that reason tremendous use could be made of the services.</P>
    <P>On the educational field other countries have programmes such as the &ldquo;Open University.&rdquo;  Such programmes would be very useful to the citizens of this country.  In view of the fact that the Government do not seem to have any money to provide vocational committees with sufficient funds to give any adult education in the schools it is necessary that Radio Éireann and Telefis Éireann devise useful educational programmes for adults.  They could be a kind of semi-entertainment. It is reasonable to ask for that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> It was a good thing that Radio na Gaeltachta was established.  Whatever the technicalities of the matter are, it is a pity it is not available in the rest of Ireland.  It is available in a very limited area.  It is matter to which the Minister should direct his attention because there are many people in the rest of Ireland who would like to follow some of these programmes.</P>
    <P>Another thing that is very important, so far as television and radio are concerned, is that people even yet have not sensed the influence these media can have on those who are listening and watching.  Telefís Éireann is now received in a great percentage of the homes of Ireland. It comes into the privacy of sitting-rooms, kitchens, wherever there is a television set.  Those charged with controlling broadcasting have a duty to ensure that a certain amount of censorship is exercised on and certain amount of moral teaching introduced into these programmes.  In other words, we should ensure that all that we held sacred and valuable in the past is not destroyed overnight.  We have a duty to the citizens who are to follow us to give them good, clean material&mdash;something that will be useful to them in the educational field, something that will give them a pride in their own country, in their own history and in their own race, and something that our exiles would be proud to hear or see.  They are always interested to know how the people at home are doing.</P>
    <P>There should also be more programes of the type enjoyed in rural Ireland.  I am not trying to divide city and country, but I say from my own experience that there is not a very large number of people enthusiastic about high-class music.  I am not trying to lower standards.  But we have a tremendous fund of good native Irish music.  We have musicians all over the country and many of them never get a chance to broadcast one tune on Radio Éireann or on Radio Telefís Éireann.  The country owes a debt of gratitude to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann who strove in the <Col N="267" /> past to have recognition given to our native culture, our native music and to our native songs.</P>
    <P>We have not had in the past the facilities enjoyed by other countries for the study of music, because of our unique history.  That does not mean that we were not an intelligent or musical people.  More time should be allotted to that kind of programme. I do not like to mention programmes by name when discussing this Bill, but from my own knowledge these programmes would be very entertaining. They also have a high viewing content. Some time ago when there was talk of playing down entertainment there were many protests against removing a particular programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his opening speech that there would be further opportunity for discussion of the subject of broadcasting in the new year. I hope the Minister will keep these points in mind.  I want to say that I am not a fanatic as far as the Irish language is concerned.  I feel strongly that the people who wish to pass the Irish language on to their children should be enabled to do so.  To be fair to the older generation, they did not have the opportunity of learning it.  The younger generation have had this opportunity.  They should be encouraged to speak not only Irish but other languages as well, because we are now a member of the European Community.  The Minister will realise the advantage of having a second or third language.  People representing this country and taking part in negotiations should be able to converse in different languages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has had something to say of encouragement to Senators.  We complain that sufficient attention is not paid to Bills introduced in the Seanad and therefore that full use is not made of the Seanad.  We would be able to make a very useful contribution to legislation introduced in this House before it would go to the Dáil. This view is shared by Senators on both side of the House.  The Minister has stated that he intends to introduce <Col N="268" /> an amending Bill, in which he provides for important changes in broadcasting legislation which is at an advanced stage, in the new year, and that we shall have an opportunity to discuss broadcasting in depth when the main Bill goes through the House early next year.</P>
      <P>Not only is the Minister introducing the Bill in the Seanad, which we have criticised other Ministers for not doing, but he also tells us that the Bill before us is merely an extension of existing legislation in accordance with the various amendments to the Acts over the years from 1960 to 1971. I would urge the Senators on the far side to read the explanatory memorandum and just deal with the subject matter of the Bill.  If we abuse the privilege, instead of setting an example by dealing with the relevant subject matter, we shall discourage Minister from introducing Bills in the Seanad.  Therefore, I would urge Senators to confine their comments to the measure before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senators Dolan and Harte in welcoming this Bill.  I should now like to see the Minister ask for more money for reasons I shall explain shortly.  I cannot agree with Senator Harte that, just because the Minister has promised us another Bill and another chance to discuss the organisation of the authority and the structure of the operation of which the Minister is in charge, we should confine our remarks purely to finance, because we get very few opportunities to discuss anything in the Seanad.  We have met only twice since the beginning of July. Therefore Senator Harte cannot accuse Senators on either side of the House of wasting anybody's time since the beginning of July.  We have just been earning our money and doing nothing in a legislative sense.  We do our best, but perhaps we shall get more opportunities in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister asking for more money for the reason that I feel our broadcasting service is too dominated by the advertising revenue it receives.  I know this is a difficult point and one on which a balance must be struck.  The balance <Col N="269" /> is not quite right at the moment.  It is something we should constantly examine.  I have before me a Press release from the authority's report for 1972, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The inadequacy of the licence fee levels caused the Authority to become increasingly dependent on advertising income.  In the past year advertising accounted for almost 52 per cent of total RTE revenue and licence fees for just over 45 per cent.  The Authority believes that the degree to which broadcasting has become financially dependent on advertising revenue is excessive and undesirable.</P>
    <P>The report states that the authority believe the licence fees income should provide at least 60 per cent of total revenue.  I would support that view. It is essential that we do not allow advertising to dominate the media operated by the State.  There would be very undesirable effects if advertising became too prevalent.  I am reminded of McLuhan's statement that the medium is the message.</P>
    <P>If you watch RTE television for a sufficient length of time the overall impression is not of the quality of the programmes, not of the standard of the interviews or the problem of bias in the news, but of the constant battering one gets from advertisements. The philosophy behind most advertisements that one sees on television is that self-satisfaction is the chief end of man.  I am worried about this and the effect it has in a subliminal way.</P>
    <P>While I realise that we cannot do without advertising, I would like to see it controlled more strictly.  I would like to see the time for which advertisements run very rigidly controlled. I would like to see the establishment of a body which would have two functions. For instance, I would like to see a press council which could mediate on the more subtle problems that arise between the journalists and the organisation, to try to preserve the freedom of the press which is essential but to ensure that it works within the limits that are set out, and I would like to see the advertisements monitored by some independent body <Col N="270" /> which could act as a buffer between the authority and the medium itself and could express public feelings about the sort of problems that arise in advertising.</P>
    <P>I also endorse Senator Dolan's plea for more use of television and radio educationally.  I wonder if we could not spend more money on this side of our broadcasting.  I would like to see some sort of deal being done between the authorities in the Republic and the open university&mdash;perhaps sharing some programmes or doing a swap. There are many programmes which RTE produces on Irish topics which now have considerable international interest.  It is one of the better effects of the publicity that this country has received.  Because of the troubles in the North one of the better effects is that there is a great deal of international interest in this country.  I think that many of the RTE programmes have a much wider potential audience.  They could be sold or exchanged with organisations such as the Open University.  We could relay some of their programmes in return for some programmes produced in Ireland.  I would like to see more done to develop the spoken tongues, not just Irish but the other modern continental languages.  We would like to see some work being done as is done on networks in Britain on the use of television and radio to develop the facility to speak foreign languages.</P>
    <P>Senator Dolan also mentioned the problem of transmitting to Northern Ireland.  I know this is one of the things that the Minister is concerned about.  I certainly think this is tremendously important.  I would like to see a special vote of money by the Oireachtas for the establishment of full transmission facilities in Northern Ireland.  I spent a good deal of time in Northern Ireland and I know that there are a number of places where the RTE signal is very poor.  Surely the Northern Ireland geographical area is not so big that we could not overcome this situation.  If we cannot do a deal with the BBC, can we not establish transmitters on the Border and beam the signal in?  When that is done I would like to see something <Col N="271" /> being done to have a weekly programme of northern cultural interest transmitted from RTE in Dublin.  I would like to see it going over the Thirty-two Counties.</P>
    <P>There are many fine and worthy aspects of northern culture&mdash;their music, their own way of speech, their poets, their writers and their own very distinctive tradition.  I feel it would do our people here good if they got hit with that for an hour every week.  A good programme of Orange music now and then would help in conjunction with a sensitive treatment of the northern cultural scene, to increase understanding.  If we are serious about beaming our programmes to Northern Ireland let us beam them something that will sell.  Let us give them some northern cultural programmes which will appeal.  My viewing of BBC Northern Ireland and UTV, which is not very extensive, does rather seem to indicate that northern culture is not very well catered for.  I think that the particular tradition up there which is very strong could be used by RTE with advantage.  I would like to see it beamed countrywide.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that we shall get an opportunity to have a more detailed discussion on the structure of broadcasting on radio and television in the new year.  It is appropriate that the legislation which the Minister intends to bring in is being introduced in this House.  We could give it a sensitive and in-depth debate. I look forward to it very much.</P>
    <P>There are problems of organisation in RTE which do need an airing and which we read about in the press.  We see not so much the problems but their effects in disputes, in walk-outs, in clear tension between management and the journalists, producers and various other people employed.  I do not think tension is a bad thing.  In fact in an organisation such as this where there are talented people, people with strong views and people with prejudices, tension is inevitable.  What I would like to see is this tension being channelled creatively. I look forward to a debate in <Col N="272" /> which we can give this the detailed discussion it deserves.  A good deal could be done by a fairly careful study of the roles played by the producers, the journalists and the organisation.  I have talked to people in the different categories and they have very different views of each other's roles.  An in-depth study of this could be very rewarding.</P>
    <P>In RTE there is this category of producer-director which seems to ask for a combination of qualities in one person that even the most talented people do not have.  You can be a good producer&mdash;the ideas man behind the programme, the man who thinks it out, the man who looks at the wide spectrum&mdash;but the director is the person who actually puts on the show and does the technical detail.  He is in charge of the actual operation of getting the thing on to the road. Some of the problems in RTE are caused by the fact that people are asked to combine both roles.  This is not wise.  It comes about through lack of finance.  We do not have enough money to pay separate producers and separate directors.  This sort of problem should be discussed and I hope we shall have an opportunity to do so later.  I remember travelling on the No. 10 bus to Donnybrook one time. I was interested to observe that a number of RTE executives were on this bus and alighted at Montrose.  The busman remarked to me later: &ldquo;You would think sometimes that that place was bloody Hollywood&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I know the problems that have to be faced.  I spoke to several people involved, and sensitive discussion on the problems would be welcomed.  I do not wish to say any more on this aspect until the next debate.  I hope the Minister will introduce the Bill early, and I am certain he will find a ready response in the Seanad for an opportunity to have a wide-ranging debate on the problems of our broadcasting authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator West, I should like to open my brief speech by assuring Senator Harte when it comes to a Bill which gives money to Radio Telefís Éireann that not only are Members of Seanad Éireann entitled, <Col N="273" /> but in normal circumstances have a duty, to discuss the manner in which this money will be used.  Therefore, there would be a discussion on general affairs and policies of Radio Telefís Éireann.  However, the Minister has told us, and I should like to thank him for this, that he is going to introduce in this House in the new year a Bill of a general nature which will enable such a debate to take place.  When he says the new year I take it in its literal sense, not meaning before the end of 1975, but in January.  He says also that the Bill will be of a general nature which will enable a full discussion to take place. On this basis one can let this Bill pass without the type of discussion which, normally speaking, would have had to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three points I should like to refer to briefly.  First, the question of the long-awaited new transmitter for the main Athlone radio wavelength. It was good to hear from the Minister on various occasions recently that, while there has been some delay, this transmitter will be brought into operation before too long.  I should like to ask him whether there is any possibility that, on the introduction of this new transmitter, we shall be able to use a sole national wavelength.  The Minister will agree that one of the bad things about Irish radio has been that in the 50 years since 2RN started operating, we have never had a national wavelength.  We have always had to share our wavelength with other transmitters.  At the moment on the same wavelength as the Athlone transmitter there is a station in West Berlin, another one in Italy and, indeed, there may be others.  Because of this, in England and also in parts of Ireland after dark it is extremely difficult to have any kind of good reception from the medium wavelength at Athlone.  I do not know whether the power of the new transmitter will be increased, but its effectiveness will inevitably be limited if we continue to share this wavelength with other countries.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell me&mdash;although I doubt it&mdash;that we shall have a national wavelength and, if not, that another opportunity will arise before too long <Col N="274" /> for us to put our case at some international conference to cover this matter.</P>
    <P>One of our problems in this regard is that we have perhaps gone too far in obeying the rules.  Other countries who did not have national wavelengths have taken them.  There are various propaganda radio stations operating in western Europe which have usurped wavelengths to which they are not entitled.  I am not suggesting that we should do the same, but it raises problems for us.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words on the pending second television channel. Some of the Minister's pronouncements over the past year have aroused considerable uneasiness.  I admit that those of us who live on the eastern coast have access to three or four channels&mdash;the Irish channel, UTV, HTV, and either one or two BBC channels, and we are in no position to tell people who live in the west or in the south that they should not look at foreign channels.  Nonetheless, there is a serious issue here which ought to be considered more carefully than the Minister has done to date.  Do we really want the Irish national television network to be distributing <i>ad lib</i> throughout the country live broadcasts from a foreign television transmitter, including the news and political commentary of all kinds?  The fact that people on the east coast can see and hear these things is a gratuitous matter of geography which does not necessarily commit the national television station to distribute these programmes.  In part, they are very good&mdash;I think the BBC programmes are the best in the world&mdash;some are extremely good and one would have no hesitation in suggesting they should be transmitted, but others are propaganda, sometimes of a rather nauseating kind.  Also, in many cases there is sheer vulgarity which there is no particular reason for us to distribute any further.</P>
    <P>My view is that the second channel ought to be given to Telefís Éireann on the basis that all or part of it will consist of the best programmes available, not merely from Britain but from other countries in the world, <Col N="275" /> particularly from Europe.  RTE could take some of the best British pro-gammes and some of the best of the American ones.  I am sure the Minister will agree that, in general, American television programmes are diabolical.  At the same time, on their educational network there are some extremely good programmes that could be used.  We should take some of their news programmes and documentaries which can be very good.  Some of the best programmes from the European television stations could be brought in. There would obviously be language difficulties, but these, in some cases, could be overcome by the use of subtitles or by dubbing.  Other programmes such as music, could provide entertainment irrespective of the language problems.  We should proceed along these lines rather than subjecting our people, holus bolus, to the sort of ever-present British cultural propaganda which already puts us in risk of becoming a mere provincial enclave of the larger country next door.</P>
    <P>The third point I should like to make arises out of what Senator West said about advertising.  Although it was a Fianna Fáil Government who introduced the original Bill, I have always felt they made a great mistake in allowing Telefís Éireann to be financed in part from advertising.  It is a great pity but it has been done now; we are stuck with it and I do not think we can get rid of it.  I agree with the television authority that we should try to limit, as far as possible, the proportion of revenue that comes from advertising, if only because the main effect from advertising clearly is that programmes must appeal to the lowest common denominator; otherwise, TAM ratings go down and advertising falls off.  Revenue from advertising is undesirable, but at this stage there is nothing we can do about it.</P>
    <P>I do not know why it is&mdash;not merely in this country but in other countries also&mdash;that the general run of advertisers seem to assume the public are half wits.  The mind boggles sometimes at this sort of thing.  Whom on <Col N="276" /> earth can these advertisers think they are talking to?</P>
    <P>I have often wondered&mdash;and I hope the Minister can enlighten me&mdash;why Telefís Éireann allow such advertising to be made abroad at a time when Irish actors and Irish film studios clearly are having a difficult time.  I am unable to see why it is not possible for Radio Telefís Éireann to lay down a rule that from a certain date all advertising shall be created in Ireland.  At the very least I should have thought that when products made in Ireland are being advertised. the advertising should be made in Ireland.  In many cases it is not.  The advertising matter of a well-known Irish commodity advertised on Irish television is made abroad.  This seems quite wrong.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister what problems there are in the way of ending this situation.  I have nothing further to add at the present.  Early in the new year we shall have a further opportunity of dealing with these matters.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Seanad very much for their approach to this whole problem.  This was a preview of the main debate which we will have early in the new year.  Senator Yeats mentioned January. I hope he will not fault me too much if it turns out to be February, but I mean early in the new year at any rate.</P>
      <P>The discussion we have had today is just about right in that Senators have covered the main topics without getting into very great depth.  The remarks that Senators have made will be studied in my Department and no doubt also in RTE between this and the main debate.  I should like my own answers to the points made by Senators to be taken also as temporary answers before a more substantive answer in the main debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main amending Bill which I shall be introducing in the Seanad&mdash; and I cannot claim the merit of innovation in bringing that before the Seanad, as it is my understanding that the original Bill, which has stood the test of time well in many ways, the <Col N="277" /> Broadcasting Act of 1960&mdash;came before the Seanad in the first instance. I am merely continuing a tradition. This Bill will be the first substantial amending Bill, as distinct from technical and minor amendments, to come before the Oireachtas in 14 years, and the debate on it can be an important one in the history of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Though not a very long Bill it will enable every main aspect of broadcasting to be relevantly discussed in depth with particular propositions before the House.  The question of open broadcasting as affecting both Northern Ireland and the reception of outside channels in this country will be relevant.  The general question of culture will be relevant, including the question of programmes in Irish. There will be a proposed amendment of the existing law there.</P>
    <P>I agree with the principle that the Seanad has every right to discuss the full range of broadcasting policy on a proposal affecting licence fees.  That is a basic proposition.  The Seanad has exercised that power with restraint.  I was amused by the zeal of Senators on the question of raising licence fees. Such zeal is not easily found in the directly elected House, for reasons which are clear.</P>
    <P>The wide range of bringing certain channels in here and bringing RTE into Northern Ireland is one which I should like to discuss at considerable length when we are discussing the main Bill.</P>
    <P>Radio na Gaeltachta is available throughout most of the country on VHF but of course not all sets as yet have VHF.  It is generally available on new sets.  The new transmitter will greatly increase the strength of our signal and together with other developments should mean that during the coming year RTE radio will be widely receivable with a strong signal in most parts of Britain.</P>
    <P>On the question of the second channel, Senator Yeats made many of the most important comments on what is a continuing debate.  I have been in touch with many people in the present single channel area and undoubtedly the demand there is for the right to receive one or more services from <Col N="278" /> overseas, not filtered and not censored in Dublin.  A good case can be made for the other concept: build up, edit the best that is done abroad and bring it in.  Unfortunately the people in the single channel area are not keen on Dublin making that selection for them.  That is a basic thing and I regard their wishes as of very considerable importance in a democracy.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 12, to delete &ldquo;1974&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1977&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason we have tabled this amendment is because the economic climate is not ripe for another increase.  In the last three weeks the National Coalition Government have surpassed themselves as far as extracting money from the hard-pressed taxpayers is concerned.  The people who are being asked to pay this increase are the workers, the small businessmen and the small farmers.  At this stage, when the Government are asking for restraint as far as income increases are concerned, we believe that, by accepting this amendment, the Minister would be demonstrating Government restraint as far as increases are concerned. I also feel, despite what the Minister said in his reply to the Second Reading, that the Government's achievements in the development of the health services are very poor and if the date for imposing this legislation is extended by three years possibly during that period the Government will expand the health services in the manner in which Fianna Fáil anticipated when introducing the Health Act of 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has given us to understand that the expansion rate has been very good and points to the fact that the Vote for health services has increased <Col N="280" /> from £86 million to £166 million.  He quoted figures which I quoted in my Second Reading speech and the only difference between us was that the Minister seemed to think that these figures were satisfactory whereas I felt sufficient money was not being injected into our health services.</P>
    <P>We should postpone the proposed increase until the Government decide that the health of the people should receive top priority.  I do not accept that they are giving it the priority they should.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, of the £40.5 million extra being provided in the coming year, £20 million will be devoted to pay and price increases.  An additional £9 million will go to pay for the relief of rates, leaving £11 million or £11½ million which will be spent on the various medical services and the provision and improvement of general and psychiatric hospitals. I do not believe that this money is sufficient and, had the Government not granted relief of rates, an additional £9 million would be spent in the coming year on the actual health services.  In fact, they have reduced expenditure on health services by £9 million, in order to keep an election promise.</P>
    <P>While some ratepayers admittedly will benefit, the people who should benefit from the health services have suffered.  That is why I am asking the Minister to accept this amendment, to postpone the collection of his increase for three years, to enable the Government to carry on the good work commenced by Fianna Fáil following the passing of the 1970 Bill. If in the next three years this Government should demonstrate the same dynamic approach to the expansion of the health services as the Fianna Fáil Government did in their last few years in office, then, by 1978, nobody would seriously object to a request to increase this contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Senator McGlinchey in his comments in regard to these amendments. They raise a point I made quite strongly on Second Stage.  We are imposing an 18 per cent increase on <Col N="281" /> those categories most disadvantaged by the present economic circumstances and by the effects of inflation. I am referring to what is called the middle income group.  They used be described as such but now they are described as people entitled to limited eligibility within the terminology of the Health Acts.  This category is outside the group entitled to general medical services: those still under £60 valuation in the case of farmers, people insured under the social welfare Acts and persons whose yearly incomes are less than £1,600.</P>
      <P>These three categories cannot be regarded as being well off.  They have to make a contribution towards the health services: apart from this contribution. They are not totally eligible for every medical service.  They are entitled to hospital in-patient and out-patient services, to maternity and infant care services and the drug subsidy scheme.  Outside of that they have to pay their way under the general medical services.  In addition to the contribution, these people have to pay for a substantial proportion of the medical attention which they or their families may require. This is the category asked to pay an 80 per cent increase, the category hardest hit.  People entitled to general medical services are, in the main, those who are looked after in one way or another, and rightly so.  That is part of our social obligation as a society. These people in the middle are a hard-working segment of our population. In most cases, whether working in a factory, or on a farm, or in administration they are ravaged by inflation and ravaged by the agricultural decline we witnessed during the past year.  These are precisely the people from whom the Minister decides to make a revenue grab, thereby adding to their tax burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister himself has admitted that there are real difficulties by reason of the farming situation in getting the contribution at the present level from farmers with under £60 valuation.  There is a real lack of thought on the part of the Government. It was certainly a strange decision for a Government to decide <Col N="282" /> to introduce a tax on this category at this stage.  I wish to emphasise again that this is not basically a health measure, this is a taxation measure.  There is nothing in this Bill that will add to, improve or expand the medical services.  This is simply a Bill to enable moneys to be transferred from Exchequer obligation to a headage payment in regard to social welfare earners, adult persons whose income is less than £1,600 per annum and farmers under £60 valuation.</P>
    <P>This headage type of payment, a straightforward payment, is increased by 80 per cent in one case per week and in the other case per year&mdash;26p per week and £12 per year as far as the farmer is concerned&mdash;and is paid automatically by the contributors without any regard whatever to earning capacity.  It is an automatic payment under certain figures and for certain categories.  There is no point in the Minister, as he said in reply on Second Stage, arguing that this is not taxation, and that this is not regressive. It is highly regressive, to use the economists' term, which means that it is unjust.  It is an unjust form of tax in that it is a headage tax irrespective of capacity to pay.  It is highly regressive.</P>

They went so far as to itemise the exact contribution as at 50 per cent.  Budgetary policies pursued by the Coalition Government over the last two years have contributed 50 per cent to the present economic difficulties.  That is from Dr. Kenneth Whitaker, chairman of the Central Bank, the major financial agency under the Government.</P>

      <P>I remember when the Health Act was introduced in 1970. The Minister, in replying, paid glowing compliments and emphasised the fact that under that Act the Minister for Health could adopt any progressive measure he wished and I agree with him.  Indeed, I would urge him to pursue that pragmatic approach to a greater degree rather than try to bring in doctrinaire measures we cannot afford.  That Act is an embracing Act under which the existing health and medical services can be improved in a rational manner.</P>
      <P>I wish to return to the point about the form of taxation proposed here. As everybody in this House knows any progressive community today tries to get away from what is called regressive taxation, in other words taxation where the same amount is taken from everybody irrespective of his capacity to pay.  That form of taxation is wrong, unjust and out.  Yet we have it embodied in this measure. It is not just a headage form of taxation for everybody&mdash;at least under that system you would be casting your net wider&mdash;it is a headage form of taxation for the limited categories I have mentioned who are the hardest hit categories in our community.</P>

Now we have an economy that is diminishing as far as economic progress is concerned, an economy where people cannot make decisions to develop the mines that would give employment.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is dithering in regard to making basic decisions that could create the wealth for this country from which we could draw increasing progressive taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis of Senator McGlinchey's amendments quite accords with what I have said and does not cut across the fundamental decision that was made in 1970.  Senator McGlinchey recognises in the first two amendments that we are now living in a period of serious economic difficulty and, therefore, we must minimise whatever further impost is made under the Health Contributions Act.  He wants to substitute 1977 for 1974 in the first amendment and substitute 1978 for 1975 in the second amendment.  The effect of those two amendments is to recognise the reality of the present economic situation.  It does not in any way take from the principle which is written into the 1970 Health Act but it recognises that the time, 1st January, 1975, is not opportune to bring in an 80 per cent increase in headage taxation as far as the disadvantaged people who will be taxed by this increase are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> That is, basically, what these two amendments are about.  It is a recognition of the fact that the scheme of health contributions must continue under the 1970 Act but this is the wrong time, having regard to our present economic difficulties, to introduce a measure of this kind.  It shows that we have a Government totally lacking in reality, totally out of touch. Apparently, they do not realise what they are doing in this case.  They are taking a burden from the Exchequer&mdash; which draws generally from all the people right across the board&mdash;and imposing that burden to an 80 per cent increased extent on the category who are affected most by present economic and financial circumstances, those who should have their position improved generally and more particularly under the administration of the health services.</P>
    <P>If the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Health, were being practical instead of announcing widespread, comprehensive health changes, providing a free health service for all the wealthy people, they would be concentrating on doing what they can do under the 1970 Act to improve the existing services.  They could provide better dental services but above all else they could widen the range of the general medical services to include half of the people now being taxed in this measure, the people in the lower segment of the middle-income group who are just out of the general medical services area. These are the people who need help and who are fully entitled to medical cards, free health and medical services.</P>
    <P>Instead of helping these people, people with chronic illnesses, people who require regular medical attention, people who require dental and other services that are not available to this category the Minister is concerned about conning the Labour Party Conference into adopting a resolution for a comprehensive health service that will benefit the wealthier people in our community.  Those people are fully satisfied with the operation of the voluntary health scheme and by way of an extension of that scheme, <Col N="286" /> and its development, they would secure all the benefits they would require adequate to their station in life.  This is why I feel very strongly about the form of taxation we have increased by 80 per cent in this measure, and to which Senator McGlinchey has rightly put down these amendments, to mitigate the effect of any such increase for three years.  That form of taxation in this day and age is profoundly unjust by reason of the economic circumstances in which these people find themselves.</P>
    <P>One other point to which I should like to refer&mdash;the Minister took me up wrongly in his reply&mdash;relates to the removal of the rates element in regard to health.  I feel very strongly that however regressive rates may be as a form of taxation this form of headage taxation is far more regressive. There is certainly nothing progressive or socially just in taking the rate charges in regard to health off office blocks, administration buildings, bank buildings, large factories, and off large properties, removing the liability and the obligation to pay rates from all of those people in the multi-millionaire category and giving them the very same facilities in regard to the removal of rates in relation to health as the people in the smaller ratepaying categories.  If that can be defended then I do not know what can be defended.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health stopped referring to the issue I raised and went back to our de-rating and housing programmes.  That has nothing to do with it.  I am certain that the committee established by the Minister&mdash;or have they been established yet?&mdash;or that he proposes to establish to review taxation and to review financing in regard to the health services, will recommend one thing very strongly&mdash;I have a certain authority on this&mdash;that there be some adjustment in the system of removing health charges from the rating system as it is at present, which applies right across the board in regard to financing the health services and which the Government will dearly regret.</P>
    <P>On the Minister's own figures it is evident that this is one of the main <Col N="287" /> reasons he finds himself in the position where he is at the moment, that he has removed a very fruitful source of revenue for health purposes that was being paid by the wealthier element in our community who could well afford to pay it.  This was all because of an ill-judged pre-election promise and all because he finds himself in a straitjacket into which he jumped so promptly after the election without looking into the serious consequences involved in following that ill-judged election promise the whole way home.</P>
    <P>When you have a situation where a rates contribution which amounted to £36 million to Health alone in 1972-73 and would probably be around £60 million today is going to be removed in about two years' time.  I feel that this is outrageous.  I would say on an assessment of that figure that half the contribution comes from the categories I am talking about, the really wealthy ratepayers who discharge rates and who should be discharging rates with regard to health services for the less well-off sections of our community. This is the matter which I am certain will be recommended by whatever committee the Minister establishes because it is so obvious and so completely sensible that it cannot be denied that the way to have gone about the abolition of the rates in regard to health charges, if it was socially desirable to do it, was to put a ceiling on it, for instance, a ceiling of under £60 valuation, a ceiling such as you have in the present middle-income category and one which would exclude from paying rates in respect of health all the people in the middle and the lower income categories.</P>

      <P>I realise that the health and medical services must be financed and resources must be made available to finance them.  Senator McGlinchey rightly suggests that we leave over taxing the middle-income group, the limited eligibility group, until January, 1978, that in lieu of taxing them it would be quite possible to get the £3.5 million, which is all that is involved, from the higher echelon of ratepayers.  The £3.5 million which Senator McGlinchey suggests should be postponed by reason of his amendment is the sort of money which could be easily got if there were rates extracted from the very top echelon of rate-paying people that I have mentioned who have been relieved of their duty to the less well off section of the community.</P>

      <P>Having mentioned that alternative, I want to come back again to Senator McGlinchey's amendments and the principle behind them.  The two amendments are designed to protect the people who are hardest hit by inflation and by the Government's taxation policy.  They are the people who have only a limited eligibility in respect of health services.  They are the people most of whom, if there was a progressive Government policy in regard to health, should be in the general medical services category.  They are not in the general medical services category. They have only got limited eligibility for certain medical services and on top of that they are now being asked to pay an 80 per cent increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGlinchey's amendments are very progressive and socially just in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  They seek to have 1978 the year in which to start this policy and not 1975.  I was suggesting in a constructive <Col N="289" /> way to the Minister and the Government alternative methods by which this equivalent sum or greater sum could be obtained.  I feel I was being highly constructive in not just negativing the Minister's proposals by supporting Senator McGlinchey's amendments but offering as well a very positive alternative to what the Government appear to have taken on themselves by the adoption of an ill-judged pre-election promise.</P>

      <P>Everybody will agree that health services at the moment are very demanding.  I was really surprised when the Senator on the other side of the House shed crocodile tears for the people who had to pay the contribution.  In 1970 when this Act was introduced, at a time of thriving economy, not alone did the then Government make provisions to cover hospitalisation but they went further and took from the pockets of the people whom they cry about today £4.3 million of a nest egg.</P>
      <P>There is no consistency.  The category covered in 1970 is the category which is covered today.  This amendment is amusing.  It requests a reduction from £12 to £8 in the contribution. In other words, inflation is not as high as we are led to believe.</P>

Not so long ago we had a midnight statement that all rates would be taken off.  We do not know who speaks for whom.  People must accept that there is a demand on our health services. <Col N="290" /> We sought £4.3 million in 1970.  If we are consistent, we will realise there is a great demand and the money will be utilised very quickly.  I do not believe that if we receive what we demand in this Bill even if we get what is sought in this Bill, we will not have any surplus.  We are demanding what we believe will cover the services.  I am confident the Minister is not trying to build up any nest egg from these contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator Lenihan was speaking Senator Halligan asked several times why Fianna Fáil introduced the first Bill. They introduced that Bill because they cared for the workers.  They wanted to demonstrate that care in a practical way.  In the first Bill Fianna Fáil abolished the 50p per day hospital fee and provided free hospitalisation for the workers, farmers and small business people.  In return they asked for 15 pence per week or £7 per year.</P>
      <P>The difference between the legislation in 1971 and this legislation is that, while the workers are now being asked to pay an extra 11p, or an extra £5 per year, there are no proposals by the National Coalition Government to improve the service in any way. Fianna Fáil took 15 pence and in return gave free hospitalisation and abolished the 50p per day.  This Government of the socialists and advocates of the just society clearly demonstrate that they do not give a brass button about the workers.  They are more concerned about giving free hospitalisation to the richest people.</P>

The people with numbered bank accounts in Swiss banks will be given free hospitalisation.  I am asking for an extension of three years because I feel that, before the Government place this latest imposition on the workers, they should in return do something worthwhile, as Fianna Fáil did in 1971.

      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment. With due respect to the Senators who have spoken, they have contributed much more on the amendment than they did on the Second Reading. If there is any significance in that fact <Col N="292" /> or not I do not know.  There is the same repetition.  Postponing this measure until 1978 is tantamount to the rejection of the Bill altogether. Voting against the measure in the Committee and Final Stages is superfluous. I do not know why there should be this repetition of irrelevancies. In any case, there will still be a selective tax, as a Senator described it, in 1978.  The Senator said the economic climate is not right.  I do not know if it was right when the measure was introduced in 1971.  We were told that year was a boom year.  I have no recollection of it being like that.</P>
      <P>On the question of workers, small farmers and business people, Senators on the other side of the House are inclined to think that every farmer, no matter what his acreage if he has a valuation under £60, will pay.  The practice of the health boards is that, roughly speaking, anybody under a £20 valuation&mdash;I will not be held to that&mdash;would be regarded as being in the lower income group and can therefore avail themselves of medical cards and all medical services.  I said that the business people to whom the Senators referred would have the allowance of £1,600 increased.  I know the concern Fianna Fáil has for the workers.  We have had many examples of their concern expressed today.  It is a matter of contradiction when one comes to talk about a Department such as the Department of Health.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We remember many by-elections&mdash;in Monaghan and a few other places.  The Senator did not always have his own way.  I do not think there is any use repeating the achievements of the last two years. Sufficient to say&mdash;and can anybody disprove it on the figures which I gave in the Dáil and which I quoted today? &mdash;that the improvements in real terms over the last two years were 8 per cent and 7 per cent respectively.  I have no hesitation in admitting that these improvements were made as a result of the various Health Acts, in particular the 1970 Act.</P>
      <P>Senator McGlinchey suggested that the £9 million relief in rates could have been spent on the health services. Perhaps he has no concern for the ratepayers at all.  Ratepayers have been considerably worried about the amount of rates in recent years and they were very grateful that in our two budgets housing and health charges were reduced and, please God, in our third budget will be reduced further.</P>
      <P>According to Senator McGlinchey, one would get the impression that he did not want that type of relief.  I am not in favour of the general system of payment by way of rates because the burden usually falls on the householder, the father of a family.  In many cases, if the sons and daughters are working they earn more than the father.  I believe that sons and daughters should make their contribution to the rates and health charges.  This is what they will do within the limits of the proposals contained in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan spoke of a nice round figure of 80 per cent increase in the proposed charges.  I suppose he wanted to round off the figure, but it is 72 per cent.  Perhaps he should have said 70 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Give or take whatever you like for the sake of argument, but relate that increase to the cost of the <Col N="295" /> services or relate it to the cost of living or wages and salaries and, on these counts, these charges are justified.</P>
      <P>I do not see much point in covering the same ground again.  The Senators suggest that this should be postponed until 1978 but it will still be, as has been described, a selective tax.  Therefore I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>I think it was Senator Lenihan who told us of the circumstances in which the Act of 1971 was introduced.  I should like to remind Senator Lenihan that at that time, when there was a charge of 10/- per day for those in the middle income group who had to have hospital care, the cost to the State then was £700,000.  The measure brought in by my predecessor in 1971 raised that figure to £5 million.  If anyone wishes to call it a tax in that context they may, but the tax is attributable to my late predecessor. An increased income of £4.3 million was brought to the health services.  I do not take any exception to that.  I believe, as I said before, that it is not the best form, but it is a reasonably good form of insurance for 55 per cent of the population who can have free hospital care, out-patient attendance, mother and child scheme and free drugs.</P>
      <P>There were also references to the proposal to extend free hospitalisation to the other income groups.  I want to make this quite clear.  It was inferred that there was a difference of opinion on the scheme generally between the consultants and myself. There is a difference but it has nothing to do with the implementation of the scheme in so far as they are concerned.  What is in dispute is the method of payment. Frankly I was not prepared to give what would be virtually a blank cheque when it was suggested that it should be on a fee per item basis.  My suggestion was that they should be paid a salary and given compensation for what are described as anti-social hours.  They would not accept this and for that reason I established a review body to inquire into the methods of payment to these consultants in such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> Therefore, let nobody assume that the dispute between the consultants and myself is about the implementation of the scheme.  It is about the manner and method of payment. There was a question raised as to taxation generally and an allegation was made that the poor were paying for the rich.  I do not know to what extent that will have an effect in view of the introduction of a wealth tax, a capital gains tax and a profits on mining tax by this Government.  When we suggested this down through the years Fianna Fáil opposed it vigorously. This is the manner in which to get money from those who have got it&mdash; not the methods that were applied by Fianna Fáil when there was taxation across the board.</P>
    <P>Capital gains taxes, wealth taxes and profits on mining taxes were taken from people who have money in order that we may not only give assistance to the health services but to other services in the country as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a strange situation when we have a Minister coming in and talking about profits on mining on an amendment to delete the year 1974 and substitute 1977 in section 1 of the Health Contributions Bill.  I have no intention of following the Minister down the mine&mdash;I will try to stick to health.  As a comment on the way in which this Government are conducting their business, the Minister feels it is necessary to deny with some vigour that he is raising taxation by 80 per cent&mdash;he says it is only 72 per cent.  All right, we will agree on the 72 per cent but even by present Government standards that is a considerable rise.</P>
      <P>Senator Halligan has asked on several occasions whether we propose to accept these terms.  I forget his exact words&mdash;he was interrupted on a number of occasions&mdash;but I understand he wants us to say whether this request for taxation was also requested in 1971.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>This type of taxation is requested and was requested for 1971. I accept that.  We have to consider also the situation that in 1971 the public, and particularly the farming community, were in a much better position to pay this tax.  The Minister for Finance in an unguarded moment last summer described the position as being like paradise compared with the conditions in which we are living now.  It was an unwise statement but I think a true one.  Things were like paradise at that time compared with the position now.  The public were, therefore, in a position to pay this type of taxation, which I concede in theory is desirable, but I suppose that neither this Government nor any other Government can always achieve perfection in taxation measures.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless the taxation was imposed at a time when people were in a position to pay it.  With regard to the farming community as a whole there seems to be a difference of opinion about this but the lowest estimate of their fall in real income this year is 30 per cent.  First of all we have the extraordinary decision taken to impose income tax on them and, secondly, we have the decision to increase these charges.  Apart from the farming community who are certainly not in a position to pay these charges&mdash;the Minister says they have been refraining from paying, for whatever reason, as much as £500,000 in the last 12 months&mdash;the community as a whole is in a bad position to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister suggested that the Fianna Fáil Government paid little regard to the workers or to the interests of labour as a whole.  In answer to that it is justifiable for us to point out that under Fianna Fáil the administration of the country was carried out in such a way that we did not have almost 90,000 people out of work.  I know <Col N="298" /> there have been foreign influences but, nonetheless, the fact remains&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most gracious of the Senator to say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the last time the Minister was in office the number of unemployed ended up at around 97,000.  It is now 83,000 and I will make Senator Halligan this prophecy that after Christmas, at the beginning of January, it will certainly be 90,000.  I can bet on that but it is a bet one would clearly prefer to lose.  I am afraid that is the position.  How far it will go beyond that one does not know. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has said he would not be surprised if it reached 100,000 next year.</P>
      <P>Without a doubt things are going to be very difficult.  In answer to the Minister's comment, I think it is justified for any member of Fianna Fáil to say that we did not reach this state of unemployment in our period in office in the last 16 years.  People in this or any other country would prefer to be in decent, economic conditions with rising standards of living and in work rather than being thrown sops by the Government.  It is on that front that this Government have failed.</P>
      <P>The late Seán Lemass once said that the real test of a Government was the number of people they managed to keep in employment.  On that test this Government are failing.  The worst aspect of it is, and the reason why we are putting forward this amendment, is that the Government have chosen this particular time&mdash;when they are asking everybody else to exercise restraint in seeking income rises&mdash;in this rather sneaky kind of way to reduce people's incomes, especially the incomes of sections of the population who can least afford it.</P>
      <P>It is for that reason that we suggest a delay of three years would give this, or perhaps more likely another Government, a chance to bring about some kind of improvement in the economic condition of the country. People would then be in a better position to pay this taxation, which clearly they are not in a position to pay now.</P>

I addressed Senator Lenihan about the principle behind this Bill and I asked why, if something was right in principle in 1970, it should be wrong in principle in 1974 simply because one had crossed the floor of the House?</P>
      <P>I do not like the principle behind the Bill.  I believe it to be a form of taxation and to be regressive.  It is now part of the method of financing the health services.  As they need the extra revenue I shall support the measure. That does not mean that I will refrain from criticising the principle.  I have no hesitation whatsoever in giving the like of Senator McGlinchey a hostage to fortune which he may quote back to me in two or three years' time.  If I was in the House in 1970 he could have quoted back something along the lines I have just enunciated.</P>
      <P>We have the spectacle of a man who was the second Cabinet Minister, second only to the man who introduced the Bill, denouncing, as leader of his party, the principle behind the measure which he was responsible for introducing in the first place.  I categorise that in any political terms as nothing more than unctuous hypocrisy.  The purpose the Bill is intended to achieve is far too serious for that type of dissent.  It is petty party politics that traduces the name of politics and traduces the profession to which we all belong.  If something was right when one was in Government it remains right when one is in Opposition.  No party point of the moment justifies turning principles around on their heads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGlinchey made the spurious point that in 1970 what Fianna Fáil took with one hand they gave back with the other.  They relieved <Col N="300" /> this section of the population of the ten shillings a day charge that eliminated, as the Minister has said, £700,000 but imposed a regressive tax of £4.3 million. Of course, it was not a tax then because it was a Fianna Fáil tax.</P>

      <P>The point was made by Senator Lenihan, in supporting the amendment, that what was correct in 1970-71 is wrong now because of changed economic circumstances.  That is an interesting contribution to the theory of public finance.  I am sure it will find its way into the textbooks for the benefit of students of economics and of public administration.  It is not one to which I would subscribe, there are very few people who would, but it is at least novel and, therefore, worthy of future note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1971-72, even under Fianna Fáil, the economy grew.  It continued to grow in 1973 and it has grown even in the very serious circumstances obtaining in 1974.  While I do not have the figures for real growth, the GNP, at hand, I am sure the capacity of the economy and the total GNP <Col N="301" /> have risen in real terms, since this Bill was introduced, somewhere between 13 per cent and 15 per cent.</P>

      <P>At the beginning of a period it was correct to introduce a form of taxation which it is incorrect to adjust when the economy has, in the interval, grown by about 14 per cent to 15 per cent.  The economy has grown in real terms in the interval.  If the Senator will pardon me making an elementary point in economics, when the economy grows, incomes grow.  If incomes grow the taxable base grows. That seems to have escaped the Opposition benches in arguing that an increase from 15p to 26p per week is beyond the taxable capacity of this section of the community and that the proposal in the Bill should be deferred for a time.</P>

      <P>I want to come back to the point on which I started, that a principle remains immutable despite changes in external circumstances.  If it was correct to introduce it in the original Act it remains valid now.  If it was regressive in 1970-71 it is just as regressive now.  The size of the taxable capacity does not affect the principle one way or the other.  The truth of the matter is that the Opposition know that this amendment is no more than a peg upon which to hang a rather contentious opposition to the health policy generally.  It is no more than that.  They would do themselves well and the House better if they were to pretend that their amendment was nothing more than that and cease this sort of exercise in opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to follow the Minister down the line, or I would not like to follow Senator Halligan's line of argument.  He does not understand clearly the point that <Col N="302" /> was made from this side of the House.  I would not dare to defend Senator Lenihan in this instance, but I understand clearly what he was saying. It can be borne out by fact and by history.  This is not the first time in the history of the State that we had a period of great economic strife. We had several of them in 16 years of Fianna Fáil Government.  We did not introduce regressive legislation at a particular moment when the nation was suffering, as it is now, from great economic strain.  This is the point we are trying to make.</P>
      <P>Senator McGlinchey had to specify a year or a date to try to make the point that now is not the exact time. He had to specify, say, 1977.  It could be 1976 or it could be 1975.  We do not know.  To get it clear in Senator Halligan's head, we are saying this is not the time, when we are suffering from great economic strain, to bring in legislation such as this, nor is it the time to bring in legislation such as was brought in last week where the Government collected £27½ million. In the following few days they collected £2½ million by the removal of the butter subsidy.  In the last three weeks they have collected at the rate of £11 million a week in taxation.</P>
      <P>Senator McGlinchey could do nothing else in this amendment but try to name a date in order to make the point that this is not the moment to bring this legislation in.  When it was brought in by the previous Minister, the late Mr. Erskine Childers, it was at a time when people could afford to pay.  The Minister admitted that today when he said the farmers had a hey-day in 1971 and 1972. Since this Government got into power the graph has gone the other way.  The farmers are the people who are being asked to pay in this instance.  I am sure many of them will not be able to pay, but that does not mean they will get a medical card as the Minister seems to think.  The Minister mentioned a figure of £20 valuation which I think is not correct.</P>

      <P>We must plead for the workers.  Santa Claus will not be coming to a lot of them.  Not that I blame the Minister for that.  Instead of Santa Claus coming the Minister is coming in the guise of Santa Claus and taking money from them.  We have a reverse situation in this instance.  We are asked for a 75 per cent increase on 1st January.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries yesterday failed to honour a commitment given to farmers a fortnight ago. The Minister for Health then adds an extra £5 on the people the commitment in respect of whom the Minister for Agriculture failed to honour.  Of course we can expect that from the National Coalition.  Nobody believes what they say any more.  That was obvious from the results of the North East Cork bye-election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In the last two or three years there has been substantial inflation; costs have increased <Col N="305" /> substantially.  The trend at the moment seems to indicate that inflation will continue.  We will therefore have higher costs in every State service, every public service, and undoubtedly in every private service too.  All Ministers for Health, including the late President and the present Minister, did their best to expand the health services.  Unfortunately they have to be paid for. This amendment proposes to keep the charge at the present level for another three years in the light of the knowledge that inflation will continue for some years to come.  This amendment is dishonest.  I think Senator Killilea knows it is dishonest.  With all due respect to the Chair, I think the Senator is talking hypocrisy or stupidity.  This amendment is absolutely hypocritical.  It has been put down for a purpose.  It has been flogged to death.</P>

If I were to say that&mdash;and I am anxious that Senator Russell should hear the question I am directing to him through the Chair&mdash; would Senator Russell call me a hypocrite?

    <P>Considering what Senator Halligan said a few moments ago, if it was right in 1971 how can it be wrong today? We can use this argument against them.

      <P>Senator Halligan was not in this House in 1971 but on 13th July of that year at column 1241, Volume 70 of the Official Report the leader of the Labour Party, Senator Fitzgerald, had this to say:</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is there.  I made that point in my own speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>In February, 1973, the Fine Gael and Labour Parties came together and they published the infamous 14-point plan which consisted of promises they would implement if elected to Government.  They made a categorical claim that they would halt rising prices.  We all know now how dishonest that promise was and how miserably they have failed to implement it.  They blamed everyone but themselves and the poor Arabs have come in for more than a fair share of the blame.  Tonight they are asking us to approve of another price increase but on this occasion no one can blame the Arabs.  I have tabled these amendments because I believe that there have been too many financial impositions on the workers in the last 21 months and particularly in the last 21 days.  I do not believe that every week should be <Col N="307" /> a budget week in Leinster House.  This measure could only be described as a miniature budget&mdash;a measure to collect from the workers the sum of £3½ million without giving any direct new benefit.  If Fianna Fáil were re-elected in the last election £9 million would not have been taken from the Health Estimate to alleviate the ratepayers. The Minister asks did we not believe the hard pressed ratepayers should have been relieved in this way.  They should have been relieved of rates as well.  In order to provide that relief next year alone £9 million that should have been devoted to the expansion of the health services so that the Government can live up to their election promise.</P>
      <P>The people who benefit from this rate relief may not realise that it has been provided by cutting the Health Estimate by this amount.  We should not ask the people to carry this burden at this time.  It is another imposition and, as each day goes by, the people have to face increase after increase. Admittedly some of them are outside the control of the Government, but this is one increase that is within their control.  It is wrong to do this now and, because it is, I would ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment on the grounds that by giving some increase to the Minister, even a small one, that would not place the same burden on the people as the Minister's proposals.  I accept that £3½ million is not in itself the kind of burden that the people in a normal year would be unable to support.  The problem here is twofold. First of all, this is not a normal year.  We have the situation that economists on the whole agree that there has been an overall 4 per cent fall in the real income of the community, allowing for changes in trading conditions, and so on.  This fall is worse in the sense that one particular section of the population, the farmers, have suffered very severely indeed in this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the condition that one has to relate that at this precise <Col N="308" /> moment in December, 1974, there has been an overall fall in the national income during the year.  At the moment, because of a very rapid rise in unemployment and, in particular, because of the enormous 20 per cent inflation that we are suffering from, many households, even where the breadwinner is still in employment, are finding it very difficult to make ends meet.  Therefore this is not the time to impose taxation of this kind, which is always regressive and is particularly so in present conditions. Secondly, while I suggest that the sum of £3½ million to be raised by the Minister in this Bill is much more serious that one might otherwise feel, it is part really of the whole pattern of mini-budget that this Government have been introducing through various Ministers during the past month or so.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned on Second Reading, the Government, through various Ministers, who apparently have had instructions from the Minister for Finance to raise money in whatever way is possible in advance of the budget, have raised a total of £46 million in increased imposts on the people by way of very heavy increases in postal and telephone charges, very heavy increases in the tax on petrol, by the elimination of the subsidy on butter, thereby raising the price to the consumer and, finally, this Bill, with its additional imposition of £3½ million. Had this Bill come by itself, even in the present difficult circumstances one might have been able to accept it more easily.  However, it comes as the last imposition in a long line of impositions by the Government, all apparently designed to ease the task of the Minister for Finance in his forthcoming budget on 15th January next.  In these circumstances, this relatively small sum becomes far more serious.  We all know the old saying: &ldquo;It is the last straw that breaks the camel's back&rdquo; and this could well be the last straw that breaks the backs of many innocent families and, because of that, we must support this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in going over all the arguments again. This amendment is tantamount to saying: <Col N="309" />&ldquo;Withdraw the Bill.&rdquo;  I have no intention of doing so.  The amounts suggested would bring in about £3,000 or £4,000 and it would not be worth while bringing in a Bill for such an amount.  A subvention of £3½ million is, however, something that could be well used in the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>Somebody&mdash;I do not know who&mdash; described this as a sneaky method.  It has all been open and above board, it was discussed for days in the Dáil.  It was circulated many weeks ago.  It is now before the Seanad and we have had a reasonably long debate; I make no apology for introducing it, knowing that it will contribute to the health services.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer has also played its part since this Government came into office.  In 1972-73, 74 per cent of the health charges were paid by the Exchequer. In 1975, the estimate is that we will be paying 90 per cent of the health charges from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I should like to endorse what Senator Halligan said because I, too, am not too happy about this type of taxation or insurance and I promise the House that there will be a review.  If there is a better system, one that would be equitable in the distribution of moneys, I certainly will introduce such a scheme.  There is a possibility that the Exchequer may take on the entire cost.  Since we changed horses, we seem to have different arguments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, on both sides.  I suppose this is the way of politics, but I certainly take exception to the fact that Members of the Fianna Fáil Party call this a tax while, in 1971, when it was introduced, it was said to be in substitution for the 10/- per day paid by those who were hospitalised. I honestly think that, in present circumstances, this is reasonably good value, even for a poor farmer.  A stay of 24 days in hospital at the old rate of 10/- per day would work out higher than this proposed contribution.  Mention was made of the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme.  It is a good scheme but this is a far better bargain for the people in this category.  They <Col N="310" /> have many more advantages than they would have in the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme in which they would pay a good deal more.</P>
      <P>I do not think we need go too deeply into this.  All the arguments about petrol, butter, unemployment, and the state of the economy have all been made before.  Without further ado I would say that I could not accept these two amendments because if I were to accept them I need not have come into the Seanad at all.  I could have scrapped the Bill.</P>

The reason I described it as a sneaky way of imposing taxation is that it would seem to suggest that in some way this money is required to make up the Department's budget for the health services.  It is not that at all.  The situation is that if this Bill had never been framed, or if it were rejected now, the result would be that the Minister for Finance in his forthcoming budget would have to find £3½ million somewhere which, of course,&mdash;and I make a present of this to the Minister straight away&mdash; would have to be done through taxation, though I hope a fairer means of taxation than is contained in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic point is that this Bill is designed to relieve and has the effect of relieving the Minister for Finance of the task of finding £3½ million in his budget.  Just as in the case of the increased postal charges, the increased petrol charges, the elimination of the subsidy on butter, the sole and intended effect is the same&mdash;that of relieving the Minister for Finance of the task of finding money in his forthcoming budget.  Of course this is nice for the Minister for Finance but, nevertheless, these types of budget operations, irrespective of whether they are done by ministerial order or by legislation, can be described as sneaky particularly when, as in this case, it comes three weeks before the budget.  It is part of the budget <Col N="311" /> apparatus, one might say, and yet it is not included in the ministerial statement read out on budget day.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that a more candid, open and straightforward way, from the point of view of the public, for dealing with these matters would be to have them all included in the budget.  I know it is not always possible to wait for the budget.  There are times when the budget may be six months or nine months away and you have to take some kind of action, but all these things have been brought in at the very end of the year within weeks, days almost, of the budget, clearly designed to relieve the Minister of problems in his budget statement. They could perfectly well wait to be included in the budget statement. That impels me to describe it as a sneaky method of imposing taxation.</P>

      <P>We had better not get too sneaky about it.  I said before today&mdash;I do not know whether Senator Yeats was here&mdash;we are, indeed, only four weeks away from the budget but this Bill was circulated two or three weeks ago.  If this is a sneaky way to introduce taxation or the raising of money, the same accusation could have been made against my predecessor and the members of the Government at that time who in the beginning of June, 1971, introduced the original measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide statutory authority for subvention payments to CIE amounting to £11.3 million in the nine-months' period ending on 31st December, 1974, which are additional to the annual grant of £2.65 million payable to the board under the Transport Act, 1964 (Section 6) Order, 1969.  This is in accordance with the views expressed by the Public Accounts Committee earlier this year, in the course of their consideration of the Appropriation Accounts for 1971-72, that supporting legislation is desirable when moneys to supplement CIE's statutory annual grant are being provided by the Oireachtas.  The Bill also makes certain necessary amendments to existing transport legislation arising from the provisions of EEC regulations governing State aid to transport undertakings.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I propose to review briefly the position of CIE in recent years.  The progressive deterioration in the board's financial position continues to be cause for concern.  Since it was fixed in 1969, the board's statutory annual grant of £2.65 million has proved to be completely inadequate, due largely to the effects of inflation. The board's losses increased from over £3 million in 1969-70 to £11.67 million in 1973-74; the estimated net loss for the nine-month period ending 31st December, 1974, is almost £14 million. The main portion of these losses is attributable to the railway system, but the position has been aggravated by a decline into a loss-making situation of hitherto profitable road services.</P>
      <P>As announced in March, 1974, the Government have decided that the railway system should continue to be preserved subject to further concentration and reorganisation in accordance with the general concepts outlined in the McKinsey Report on CIE, as developed in further studies made by the board, and have approved, in principle, additional capital investment to enable CIE to implement their proposals. The Government accepted that there was an acute need for modernisation and rationalisation of the railway system, particularly in the freight sector, in order to contain railway losses and to avoid a continual erosion of traffic.  CIE's plan for the future development of the railways, involving modernisation of stations and depots, introduction of new equipment and handling methods and redeployment of manpower, was announced by the board last July.  The plan will take six years to implement and will cost in the region of £27 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No fundamental alteration of the passenger network is proposed for the present, other than normal timetable adjustments.  The plans for freight movement involve the introduction of new types of trains on which economic loading and high utilisation will be achieved.  Twenty-two railheads throughout the country are scheduled for reconstruction and development and will provide a comprehensive freight service for containers, small freight and bulk traffics.  A further 27 railheads are scheduled for major alteration and development to cater for specialised freight traffics.  Freight facilities are being withdrawn on a selective basis from a number of lightly used stations, some of which have <Col N="315" /> handled negligible volumes of traffic in recent years.</P>
    <P>CIE are fully conscious of the need for adequate communication with all parties concerned in relation to proposed changes and an extensive programme of consultation with staff, trade unions and customers has taken place and it is the board's intention to keep interested parties advised of progress.</P>
    <P>In the year 1973-74 over 12.7 million passengers were carried on CIE rail services reflecting continued buoyancy in rail passenger carryings due, no doubt, to the board's new promotional fares, the increased number of passenger trains daily and the attraction of CIE's new supertrain services.  Over the past three years the number of rail passengers has increased by 23 per cent.</P>
    <P>Rail freight tonnage at 3.7 million tons in 1973-74 was over 1 per cent higher than 1972-73.  Significant increases occurred in general traffics, mineral ores and gypsum but reductions occurred in fertilisers, sugar, grain and cement traffics.  There was also an increase in CIE's road passenger carryings.  Dublin city buses carried 220 million passengers in 1973-74, an increase of ten million over the previous year.  Sixty-three million passengers were carried in 1973-74 on the board's provincial bus services, excluding special school services, an increase of 1,000,000 over the previous year.  In the road freight section, the total tonnage carried in 1973-74 was six million tons, representing an increase of 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that most of the services showed continued buoyancy, this has not, unfortunately, been sufficient to counteract the prevailing economic forces, and the board's deficits still continue to grow. The energy crisis which occurred in late 1973, while it created additional demand for passenger services and highlighted the importance of public transport in a situation of world energy shortage, nevertheless added considerably to CIE's fuel bills and adversely affected costs.  Of greater significance, however, are the continuing increases in labour costs, which <Col N="316" /> together with higher materials costs and increased social insurance and interest charges, contribute substantially to the board's deteriorating financial position.</P>
    <P>The latest estimate of CIE's net deficit for the current nine-month financial period ending 31st December, 1974, is £13.95 million.  Of this amount, £9.25 million has already been met by way of subvention payments to CIE, the necessary provision having been made in the Estimates for my Department.  The main reason for the excess of £4.7 million in the board's deficit over the Estimates provision was the decision of the Government to ameliorate the impact of the July, 1974, increases in CIE rates and fares by limiting the increases in Dublin city bus and suburban rail fares and provincial city and town bus fares to 20 per cent instead of the 33 per cent increase proposed by CIE and approved by the National Prices Commission.  This, combined with a delay of three months in the implementation of the increases, resulted in a reduction of an estimated £3.3 million in the anticipated yield from the increased charges.  Other significant factors were the nine-week bus strike in Dublin city and a general decline in economic activity, resulting in heavy revenue losses to CIE.</P>
    <P>The statutory annual grant to CIE of £2.65 million is, therefore, inadequate to the extent of £11.3 million and statutory cover for payment of this amount to CIE is provided in section 2 of the Bill.  It is proposed to provide in a Supplementary Estimate for the amount of £4.7 million not already covered in the Estimates provision. Pending provision of these additional moneys, CIE with my consent, given with the approval of the Minister for Finance, have been availing of temporary borrowings to meet their serious cash deficiency.</P>
    <P>Under EEC regulations governing State aid to transport undertakings, the existing blanket subvention arrangements for CIE are no longer appropriate and provision is, therefore, being made in section 5 for the repeal of section 6 of the Transport Act, 1964, which provided for a fixed annual grant for CIE, subject to review at five <Col N="317" /> yearly intervals.  Consequential on the repeal of this section, an amendment is required in section 2 of the 1964 Act and this is provided for in section 3 of the Bill.  Henceforth, grants to CIE will be paid in accordance with the relevant EEC regulations and provision for these payments will be made in the Estimate for my Department.</P>
    <P>There are three relevant EEC regulations:</P>
    <P>(1)  <i>Regulation 1191/69</i> which provides for payment of compensation to transport undertakings in respect of losses incurred on services operated under public service obligations which are deemed essential to ensure the provision of adequate transport services.</P>
    <P>(2)  <i>Regulation 1192/69</i> which provides for compensation in respect of specified financial burdens borne by railway undertakings which are not borne to the same extent by other transport undertakings, for example, cost of level crossings, retirement and welfare benefits, and so on;</P>
    <P>(3)  <i>Regulation 1107/70</i> which specifies certain additional circumstances in which State aids may be paid to transport undertakings.  This regulation enables the grant of State aid to cover, <i>inter alia</i>,</P>
    <P>(a)  public service obligations not coming within the meaning of regulation 1191/69;</P>
    <P>(b)  railway infrastructure costs, to the extent that competing modes of transport do not bear their full share of infrastructure costs;</P>
    <P>(c)  balancing subventions to meet the residual deficits of railway undertakings.</P>
    <P>These EEC regulations are merely part of a comprehensive structure which is being built up in the development of a Community Common Transport Policy.  One of the aims of this policy is to eliminate disparities liable to distort conditions of competition in the transport market and for this purpose it is necessary to harmonise laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to transport.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="318" /> Proposals for a new subvention structure for CIE to comply with the provisions of these EEC regulations have been submitted to the EEC Commission and arrangements are being made for the introduction of the new subvention structure from 1st January, 1975.</P>
    <P>The main features of the proposed new subvention structure are as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  It is proposed that compensation will be paid in respect of the losses remaining on rail passenger services after fares increases and any possible economies in operation, on the grounds that these services are being provided under a public service obligation within the meaning of regulation 1191/69.  The obligation will be subject to whatever conditions I may decide to impose with a view to reducing losses.</P>
    <P>(2)  Losses on rail freight services, in so far as they cannot be met by rates increases, economies, and so on, will be covered by a combination of payments under the provisions of Regulation 1192/69 and Regulation 1107/70 including a balancing subvention as provided for in the latter regulation.  Every effort must, however, be made by CIE to operate these services on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>(3)  Losses incurred on the board's road passenger services, including the Dublin city services, which cannot be recouped by way of fares increases or eliminated by economies in operation, will be met under the provisions of Regulation 1107/70.</P>
    <P>(4)  It is proposed that losses incurred on the maintenance of the canals will be met under the provisions of Regulation 1107/70. Separate provision will be made in my Department's Vote for losses on the Galway-Aran service operated by CIE.  As regards CIE's other services, I would expect the board to operate at a profit or at least break even, taking one year with another.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements for subventing CIE will be subject to review at <Col N="319" /> regular intervals and will of course come under scrutiny each year in connection with the Estimates for my Department.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is of course necessary and everybody in the House will be obligated to support it.  It has to meet essential financial obligations to the national transport undertaking. However, the Minister's speech which was excellent, broadens the area of debate and I take it that outside the financial aspects we can continue to seek to discuss some interesting aspects that have been raised by him.</P>
      <P>First of all, we are at the stage when we have to make very definite decisions as to the future of various aspects of CIE's operations.  Indeed the EEC regulations mentioned in the Minister's speech make it incumbent on us to do so.  I am very glad that in particular the first Regulation, 1191/69, which provides for payment of compensation to transport undertakings in respect of losses incurred on services operated under public service obligations, has been so worded.  It recognises quite clearly the social obligations that exist in regard to transport undertakings.  It is important from Ireland's point of view that this be recognised and implemented.  Public transport is now part of the social infrastructure of the community.  We tried, rightly so, to keep CIE within certain commercial parameters.  While that is still desirable, especially in respect of some of CIE's undertakings, there are real social obligations.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Minister and the officials concerned who worked hard to establish that regulation which recognises that public service obligations can be compensated in respect of losses incurred on services of a social service type, thereby recognising the social contribution of certain transport undertakings. This is an important regulation and relevant to the rail passenger service. The subvention structure under that regulation will deal with losses in rail passenger services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, the Dublin City road <Col N="320" /> passenger services, although not under as favourable a regulation, come within a subsequent regulation and are covered.  I should like clarification from the Minister on that point.  The regulations under which the Dublin road passenger service can be subvented are not quite as global or as broad an undertaking as the regulation which provides for subvention to the railways.</P>
    <P>The road-rail freight deficits can also be met, as suggested here, by a combination of two regulations.  The rail freight service must, under these regulations, be commercially viable. The EEC regulations quite clearly recognise the rail passenger service as being a social undertaking and, to a lesser degree the road passenger service, in Dublin, and the rail freight service.  The future of the rail freight service is important in the commercial sense.  I am glad that substantial investment is being made in setting up rail freight in key centres and improving the handling equipment there. Substantial investment plans have already been announced by the board. There can be a substantial increase in the area of rail freight provided an efficient automatic handling system, based on an overall national freight plan, can be implemented.  CIE have already begun to do this.</P>
    <P>As regards the road passenger service in Dublin, there is a strong argument for separating it.  I should like CIE to develop as an overall holding company with separate specified operations.  This would involve a road passenger service for Dublin, provincial passenger services, rail freight service and road-rail passenger services. If these companies are loosely associated with each other under an overall holding company but each of them with a specific subvention and special targets at which to aim, very good results could be achieved. Deficits cannot be eliminated.  However, there must be some measuring rod to minimise them.  How to strike the balance between social and wasteful investment with commercial commitment must be the goal of future policy in relation to our transport system.  This recommendation forms a large part of the McKinsey Report, <Col N="321" /> which sought to balance the social obligations with the commercial criteria.</P>
    <P>Basically the social obligation takes precedence, particularly in the passenger field.  It can be commercial in the freight field.  A structure should be set up to enable the units within the CIE umbrella to be independent, yet interrelated, so that their profit and loss and social contribution position can be itemised to enable the appropriate balance sheet&mdash;not in the narrow sense but the appropriate social balance sheet as well as the commercial balance sheet&mdash;to be drawn up.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer and to which the Minister referred in paragraph 4, is the delay in Government decision-making in relation to increases in fares and rates. I am well aware of the problems involved.  A consistent problem has been the inability of the Government to agree to raise fares where the argument is overwhelmingly in favour of such an increase and where delay only causes further deficit.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech refers to a delay of three months in the implementation of increases, which resulted in the reduction of an estimated £3.3 million in the anticipated revenue from the increased charges.  These charges were recommended not only by CIE but by the National Prices Commission after a very thorough investigation of CIE's submission to that body.  The National Prices Commission recommended increases in Dublin's bus and suburban rail fares and provincial city and town bus fares. The figure was reduced from 33 per cent to 20 per cent.  The recommendation was delayed by the Government for three months and resulted in a loss of £3.3 million.  That type of lax decision-making is inexcusable.  The Minister can say that it happened when I was Minister for Transport and Power too, and I agree.  The lack of immediate decision-making regarding the handling of the affairs of the country is inexcusable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is not quite right.  The £3.3 million resulted in the cutting down from the 33 per <Col N="322" /> cent to 20 per cent.  It was not all due to the delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  At any rate, Government delays in making decisions in such matters have, over the years, caused substantial losses in money and aggravated CIE's deficit position.  There is an unwillingness on the part of the Government to face up to responsibilities and make decisions quickly.  This is one of the causes of our present economic problems. We have nothing but indecision in regard to the whole future of the mining development&mdash;an indecision that is resulting in lack of investment and growing unemployment.  This is just one area.  Senator Russell is well aware of what I say here.</P>
      <P>The only way in which our economy generally at all levels, be it transport, industry or agriculture, can get out of our present difficulties is to get on with the job.  We must get rid of doctrinaire reasoning and pre-conceived attitudes and make decisions.  The time was never more ripe for that attitude. We cannot support doctrinaire hangups in our present situation.  CIE is a very big business to run.  There are social and commercial implications which we have to face up to in a pragmatic way thus seeking to achieve what is right and proper in the circumstances without any doctrinaire hang-ups which have got us into sufficient trouble in the field of health and mining.  The important thing at the present time is to maintain people at work and enhance our employment force.</P>

      <P>Coming back to the Bill before us and the McKinsey Report on which Senator West has put down a motion, I should like to emphasise that the important aspect is the capital investment that is required to modernise and rationalise the whole system.  It can best be done by breaking the system up into units. The modernisation and rationalisation of the railway system in particular is important.  I feel that the rail freight system offers a tremendous opportunity.  I know CIE have already gone into the modernisation of stations, depots, new equipment, handling methods and redeployment of manpower.  The plan will take six years to implement and will cost £27 million.  It is the most important step that has been taken by CIE.  In this whole rail freight area in which I see a great future provided we get the economy moving, we were behind but we are now anticipating that over the next six years the economy will really get moving again.  CIE are making the investment to ensure that this happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister's views in regard to CIE in the context of the whole national transport system.  I am certain that we can have a constructive debate on this because it is a matter in which there is unanimity at the moment among all political parties.  There is agreement now&mdash;CIE have recognised this fact&mdash;that there are basic social obligations relating to the activities of an organisation like CIE.  There is also the need to have commercial criteria <Col N="324" /> applied to them.  The problem that faces us is how that can be done most efficiently within the structure of the EEC regulations.  There is agreement among the three political parties that we are on the right road. The main problem will be in regard to the necessary capital and finance to do the job properly and the need, where necessary, if fares have to be held at certain levels, that there is a recognition of that fact by the Government.  Specific services have to be run at a certain level: it is a social need.</P>
    <P>The argument could be put forward that far more effective use could be made in a city like Dublin of the great disbursement we have under the whole category of social welfare. Rather than giving such moneys in hand-outs to people they could be given in specifically reduced fares from certain outlying centres to enable people to get to and from work&mdash; not to meet a deficit, in so far as CIE are concerned, but as a positive, social welfare contribution to CIE for categories of people.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that cheap fares might be considered a very desirable sort of social welfare help for people coming to work from satellite housing areas provided it is not itemised as a deficit in so far as CIE are concerned. It should be described positively as a social welfare payment to CIE in respect of a social welfare commitment by the State to such people in respect of passenger transport. This is the thinking we should have in the future.  It should be clearly itemised in the books, the units separated, and the social obligations and commercial criteria specified rather than having CIE, as it has been heretofore in my view, demoralised by hanging a deficit around its neck when, in fact, it was carrying out social obligations.  CIE should not be demoralised by the Government holding up their applications for legitimate fare increases.</P>
    <P>The Government and CIE will face up to the fact that there is this mix of the social and commercial situations. If this is properly itemised and spelled out the State and the national <Col N="325" /> transport undertaking can move forward in a positive way in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we must accept this Bill as a necessary measure to keep the national transport undertaking alive.  It would be hard to say that we welcome it.  I am sure it is no pleasure for the Minister for Transport and Power to bring a Bill of this nature forward when seeking such enormous funds which must ultimately come from the taxpayers' pocket.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to consider the present rate of losses.  The Minister speaking in the other House said they were averaging something like £1½ million per month or nearly £18 million a year, which is about £6 per head for every man, woman and child in the country. Earlier, in the House today some people were kicking up a row because we were talking about increasing certain contributions by £5 a year.  Every worker, whether it be farm worker or factory worker, is paying on average something like £18 a head to keep CIE operating.  This gives some indication of what CIE is costing the community. We must maintain CIE.  I go along with what Senator Lenihan said in that regard.  This latest stage in what has been a very sad saga for CIE might be regarded as having started in 1958 with the Transport Act of that year. I can remember the then Minister&mdash; the late Mr. Seán Lemass&mdash;introducing that Bill under which CIE were to get a grant-in-aid of £1 million per year for five years, and he confidently predicted that at the end of the fifth year CIE would have money in the kitty to carry on the undertaking and to make further developments.</P>
      <P>At that time he also spoke, as we are speaking now, about the commercial and social side of CIE.  Sixteen years ago it was evident to everybody &mdash;to the Deputies and Senators of that day&mdash;that CIE had a strong social element in its make-up.  It is only now we are beginning to appreciate the fact that it is unfair to hang a heavy social commitment running into millions of pounds around the neck of an undertaking and hope that it will somehow pay its way or at least that it will not cost the taxpayer too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE are confined in an impossible <Col N="326" /> straitjacket by the 1958 Transport Act. They are being called on to modernise and rationalise their system on the one hand and on the other hand to run the undertaking generally according to commercial practices.  The two things just cannot be done while, at the same time, maintaining a transport undertaking with a large social content.  We have to face up to this fact.  The public would accept the situation more calmly and certainly with more reservation if they knew what section of CIE was paying its way by normal commercial practices and the section that was serving the public socially.  I think that the taxpayer would accept the fact that they have to pay a measure of tax to maintain CIE as a national undertaking.</P>
    <P>It must be a very frustrating experience for any board, at the end of the current year, to have substantial increases in all sections of their business and yet find it necessary to seek aid from the Exchequer.  There has been an increase in the number of passengers carried by rail, in rail freight tonnage, in the numbers carried by bus both in Dublin and the provinces and an increase in road freight haulage.  This is a very fine result, indeed, in what has been an extremely difficult year.  Yet at the end of all that the Minister has to come in here to seek money to keep the undertaking going up to the end of the year.  In my view the board of CIE have been criticised too severely by Members of the Dáil.  They should be commended for carrying on against almost impossible odds.</P>
    <P>Among the criticisms CIE have had to bear is the failure to establish sound industrial relations between management and labour.  I do not know how valid is that criticism.  In my experience in the Limerick area CIE are doing a good job.  Then there is failure to implement capital plans. The Minister has referred to this aspect.  Capital plans are to be implemented over the next five or six years and, hopefully, they will result in providing better service at a lower cost&mdash;a cost of some £27 million. They have been criticised, too, for failure to provide dynamic and effective management.  It is easy to criticise <Col N="327" /> management because there are very few managers and their voting strength is not very great.  All management is not perfect.  We suffer from a lack of effective management in a number of areas and when we criticise management we should be fair and take into account the circumstances and the conditions under which they have to work.</P>
    <P>CIE are being asked to do the impossible, that is, to pay their way and be a social service at the same time.  This cannot be done and the sooner we realise it the better.  We must face up to the realities of the situation, as Senator Lenihan has already pointed out.  Various proposals have been made by amateurs like myself to improve the working, the image and the effectiveness and, hopefully, the profitability of CIE.  I do not want to add to these suggestions but some things occur to me that might be helpful.</P>
    <P>CIE are at present organised into five areas, each under an area manager.  I suggest that these areas wherever practicable, could coincide with the areas covered by the regional development boards, the IDA areas or the tourism areas. There are nine of these in the country and it might be possible to arrange them in such a way that the five would coincide, say, with groups of two.  The progress of CIE is intimately bound up with industrial development in each of these areas and CIE must be part of the integrated development.  SFADC have an enormous amount of experience and expertise which should be harnessed to the efforts of CIE to develop along the right lines.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of mining. One of the successes of CIE in recent years has been the carrying of ores from the Silvermines area to Foynes. That type of development, integrated with the development of natural resources, holds out one of the best hopes for expansion in CIE.  They can compete with any form of road transport in the business of long-haul bulk cargoes.</P>
    <P>It might be worth considering the establishment of local area boards <Col N="328" /> with local area managers.  These boards could be of assistance to the local manager and could have representation from commercial interests, trade unionists and others who would help to bring business to the railways and also help their general development.  I should like to see the establishment of a national transport council to co-ordinate development of roads, rail and canals, financed from a national transport fund to which all means of transport would contribute.  There could also be a subvention from the Exchequer. We cannot have a national transport company divided into various areas. There must be an integrated system with one branch, if necessary, carrying another.</P>
    <P>The social element of the system should be segregated and defined clearly and each area board should get a grant from the total grant to enable them to introduce some measure of competition between the areas.  We tend to regard CIE as a large, clumsy complex of railways and road trucks.  This complex should be divided into smaller, viable sections than the five areas already in existence. This might lead to more efficient working.  Normal commercial practices should be introduced into CIE and the measure of competition introduced to which I have already referred. Competition helps to keep business on its toes and is vitally necessary for success.  If this element were encouraged in CIE it might prove profitable.</P>
    <P>As one who has had a lot to do with CIE over the years, I should like to pay a tribute both to the management and to the workers.  They have a difficult task.  In every area where there is a station or a railhead giving employment to local people it is of immeasurable benefit.  In my area, Limerick city, any attempt to reduce the employment provided by CIE would have a disastrous fall-out effect on trade and industry.  In saying that I have regard for the realities of life. If the work is not there, obviously men cannot be employed.  A positive step should be taken to attract more business to CIE and I am convinced that, given the opportunities, CIE would continue to do a good job. <Col N="329" /> We must preserve CIE as a national undertaking and we must not forget that during the war years from 1939 to 1945 we were very glad to have this national undertaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. Senator Lenihan and Senator Russell both made interesting and important contributions, Senator Lenihan mentioned the social value of a national transport company.  Senator Russell suggested ways in which the commercial aspect of the company could be improved and the profitability increased.</P>
      <P>Despite that, Mr. Lemass may have talked about a social component in the CIE make-up when the Transport Act, which gave the first subvention of £1 million 16 years ago was being discussed. The realisation of the social position is much stronger now.  I should like to see a further move in this direction.  I am glad that one of the two main proposals in the current Bill is to finance CIE, according to EEC regulations, which pay out money for loss-making services regarded as an essential social amenity. This is a very important concept. It is one which the company should make more of in their publicity. Instead of constantly being belaboured for having a commercial loss we should look at the same sum as a social input.  The two should be balanced against each other and the money which we are giving to CIE should be looked at as an important social input to balance against a commercial loss.</P>
      <P>The reception a Bill like this receives in the House indicates that in spite of the bad publicity CIE get people realise only too well how essential a national transport undertaking is to us.  It is not enough to say that the same operation could be run by private companies if the Government were prepared to grant them the same amount of money as given to CIE. Private companies cannot be expected to break even or break even with a large subvention.  No private undertakings would take up most of the CIE operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Russell pointed out only too <Col N="330" /> well the essential value of the service particularly in times of crisis.  Who is to say that we will not have a crisis in 1975 of major proportions?  Who would bet against a Middle East war which would cut off our oil supplies? When there is a crisis we must have a national transport undertaking.  The maintenance of CIE and their services is essential.  It is up to us to ensure that the money which is voted from the Oireachtas to CIE is spent in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>One of the problems facing us as Members of the Oireachtas with very limited amounts of information on the company is that essentially we do not have the background knowledge to be able to comment on the company's deficit.  We get a blanket figure of £13.5 million for nine months and we do not have enough background information to comment.  I would argue for an Oireachtas body to examine semi-State concerns so that they can, with professional help, give the public and Members of the Oireachtas some background information to enable them to make judgments, behave responsibly and act not as auditors but as people who can satisfy the Members of the Oireachtas that the money is being spent properly.  This would act as an important buffer between the public and the company.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister has talked about the new freight plans, the comprehensive service, the liner trains, the bulk trains and particularly the new developments at the freight yards around the country.  I would commend to the Minister's attention the problem of publicity.  It is easy for the Press and the media to criticise CIE every time there is a deficit.  The company should put positive publicity out.  I am glad to see the displays all around the countryside at the stations which are scheduled for major development. The display cabinets there give an opportunity to the public to see what exactly is the forward planning in the freight yards.  I commend to the Minister the idea of publishing a newspaper, <i>The Travel Express.</i> This is important publicity.  Operations like the rail sale, cheap winter fares are good publicity.  Educational tours may <Col N="331" /> not make the company a lot of money but they are worth a lot in publicity terms.  The Minister should encourage the Cabinet to travel by train more often.  Nobody in a senior position seems to travel by train.  It is regarded as demeaning to travel by train unless there is an oil crisis and, therefore, good publicity.</P>
    <P>In a conversation with the late President&mdash;everybody knows his addiction to the railway&mdash;he confessed that he felt he was the only member of the last Administration who travelled regularly by train.  There is no member of the current Administration who travels regularly by train.</P>

      <P>Good for the Minister. If other Cabinet Ministers travelled by rail it would be an important psychological boost for the railway and would also show that the mania for the use of the State Mercedes is non-existent.  We have a State transport service and people should use it. I would not object to the Minister travelling first-class any time.  It would give the service a tremendous boost and would provide a lot of good spin-off publicity.  It is only now that the company are beginning to realise how important publicity is and are beginning to get into the league as far as publicity moves are concerned. The public will respond to these moves.</P>
      <P>There are some specific questions I should like to raise.  The first is the social costing that McKinsey did.  It is a pity that this debate has taken so long to come to fruition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did have an opportunity in 1972. Senator Lenihan who was then in the seat had given me an assurance that we could have the debate next day but he flew off to Paris on a late call taking McKinsey with him.  It took another three years before we got the debate which means the actual costings are out of date.  I felt at the time&mdash;and I said this before&mdash;that McKinsey's social costs were too low.  This is a matter of judgment. <Col N="332" /> Economists would not agree.  I do not think economists are in a position to agree, and who can estimate the sort of problems we face?  No economists in 1971 would have foreseen the present oil prices which will certainly discourage private transport, but it will underline the necessity for a public company.  Their estimate was that if the railways were closed down the cost of redundancy compensation at that time spread over 20 years would be £70 million.  That was only redundancy compensation and they tried to cost for the length of time that people had to spend in their cars in the Dublin commuter area and so on. The costs were staggering.  The sums of money we are talking about are not enormous when you take social costs into consideration.</P>
    <P>CIE should make more of these social costings and point out to the taxpayer who is paying for the service what it would cost him in actual terms if these services were curtailed or terminated altogether.  This would make people realise what the position is.  The new rolling stock which was advocated at that time is a success.  It cost some money, it was a pity that it could not be assembled in this country, but I think it is a success.  It is working very well.  The long distance stock has got praise all round.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister what the policy is on the permanent way.  It is important if our rail service is to remain modernised and if it is going to compete that we improve our permanent way.  The permanent way, with the exception of, say, the main line between Cork and Dublin, is not as good as it should be, and it certainly will not stand up to the fast freight and fast passenger demands of the late seventies and the eighties.  What is the Minister doing?  Is he talking about or thinking about continuous welded rail?  If he is not thinking about continuous welded rail, what is he doing to modernise our rather problematical permanent way?  Is the signalling system to be replaced by signalling with coloured lights throughout the country?  That is another question I would like to ask.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> I would like to ask about the position in regard to commuter rail traffic.  The commuter rolling stock in Dublin is out of date.  The old push and pull trains are not the thing.  We need new rolling stock, sliding doors, and more seating.  The Minister knows that the commuter stock must be replaced.  Perhaps the programme has started, but I would like to know more about it.  We need higher frequency and greater acceleration than we can get with the push and pull units.  These are essential if the present trend of considerable increases in commuter numbers using the service continues. I would regard this as a much more important factor than the actual profit or loss on the service.  If you do your social costings you get a colossal benefit in CIE's favour.  We need to update our commuter stock, and this needs to be done as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask if any progress has been made on thinking <i>vis-á-vis</i> an underground&mdash;the Heanue Report and the Dublin Transportation Plan. Are the projected costs putting it out of the market all together?  What are we going to do about transportation? Are we just going to sink down into the morass of multiple inter-change overpass under-pass sort of problems the European, American and British cities are now rejecting for the road solution? It is not enough just to build these huge roads.  The destruction and the deprivation and the change of character in a city is too much.  The argument for an underground is very strong, but I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be involved in the traffic plans for our cities.  I am very much in favour of the idea of more pedestrian areas.  We are far behind in this regard.  We have had a couple of experiments and I think they were warmly received by the populace.  What is CIE's thinking? It affects the whole transportation in the city centre.  The more of the city centre that can be preserved traffic-free the better.  This does affect the service.  It might be necessary to run a free minibus service with the main traffic routes going round the <Col N="334" /> outside of the pedestrian area.  Of course there are problems here, but it is important to know what the Minister's thinking is.  I feel that we would make a great mistake if we tried to dispose of the permanent way at any stage.  The Harcourt Street line was an obvious example.  I hope that even if trains cease to run on any specific stretch of line the company will think twice before they dispose of the actual ground.  One never knows; one might want to turn the old lines into bus ways; one might want to re-develop the railway with rail cars or something else.  The actual ground in which the permanent way is laid should always be preserved and held in the company's hands in case of future developments.</P>
    <P>Our whole thinking has changed so much in the last ten years that no one knows how much it will change in the next ten years.  Certainly it looks as if our big conurbations are going to develop, and we shall want faster and faster traffic between the conurbations, both freight and passenger traffic.  This is best provided by rail.  It may even come to the stage when legislation will have to be passed restricting the routes of the heavy lorry especially with the size of these European monsters that are now tearing up the roads, and the legislation may have to be in the form that certain traffics must go by rail.  I would be in favour of that.</P>
    <P>This is the way things are going to move and the way things are moving in Europe.  Our situation is not quite the same.  We have not the same population densities.  I would like to know the Minister's thinking on this. It makes for the development and maintenance of our rail services. When one talks about CIE and subventions there are other parts of the services as well which are extremely important&mdash;provincial buses, city buses, the waterways, the Aran islands, the Naomh Éanna from Galway.  The main loss-making service, the service which comes in for the most criticism, is the railways.  It is essential to maintain them and I would join with Senator Russell in commending the Board of CIE on the <Col N="335" /> efforts they are making.  His suggestion about a local area committee to work with the local area manager is an excellent one.  I like to see the commercial approach.  I like to see CIE attempting to serve as many people as possible.  It worries me that sometimes the middle and top management in CIE seems to change over rather too quickly, and when they get somebody who really is oriented in this way and really has ideas, they do not remunerate him enough.  I would like to see the people in jobs at the top of what is a very important operation for the whole of the State being properly remunerated. An increase in salary would help to retain the more talented managers in the CIE system, and we need them.  One could go on talking for a long time about the problems which the service faces.  I do not intend to do so.  I am glad of this opportunity to raise some of the problems which the McKinsey Report touched on.  I feel I am echoing the feeling of the general public when I say that if CIE put their case to the public about the real position the public will continue to support them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I agree with Senator West that no private company would take up the CIE operation.</P>
      <P>The McKinsey Report revealed something which 95 per cent of the people realised&mdash;that the greatest enemy of a public transport company is the growth of the private car. There are too many cars in the country.  That is progress we cannot stop.  The Report pointed out that the rail section was losing money.  We must ask ourselves if the advantages and the benefits of the rail service justify this subvention.  There is the question of national prestige.  As a modern European country we might lose that prestige if we lost the railway. I believe the majority of the people wish the rail services to continue to be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE are a public transport company and their priority must be the <Col N="336" /> passengers.  The best service should be maintained to attract passengers. People travelling on long journeys find the trains comfortable.  The rail service has a great record of safety. That in itself is a very important aspect of any passenger journey.  If we reduce rail services what will be the result?  We will bring more cars and lorries on to the roads, roads which were never intended for such traffic.  I wonder if we make that decision will we have to call in another study group to work out a solution for the roads.  Senator West said the social aspect was underestimated. I agree with him.  There are 10,000 people employed in the rail section of CIE.  It is a fair estimation that those 10,000 are responsible for the livelihood of 50,000 people, including children.</P>
    <P>The closing of branch lines was a wrong decision.  To worsen the position the railway tracks, which could be very useful today, have been taken up.  I see no choice but to return again to the railways.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend the management and staff for the wonderful job they are doing.  They are working on a very tight rein.  Freight traffic has increased and bus passenger numbers have also increased but despite these increases they have lost money.  If we could get a breakdown of those figures we might have a better idea of how things stand.  I am not suggesting that the management are not doing their best but there is an incentive to canvass traffic?  What action would a shopkeeper take if he increased his turnover by £6,000 but, in the following February, was told by his accountant that he had lost £2,500?  What action would he take?</P>
    <P>I hope the staff of 10,000 will be maintained.  If 30 new factories opened up and guaranteed that they would employ 10,000 men on a permanent basis I am sure any figure within reason would be voted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill but perhaps &ldquo;welcome&rdquo; is not the correct word since neither the Minister nor anyone else can welcome <Col N="337" /> a situation in which CIE, year by year, suffer increasing losses on their operations.  One must accept that once these losses have occurred one must initiate an increase in the subvention required to pay for them.  I agree with many of the comments on the social aspects of the operations of the transport services.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the loss suffered by CIE in the last financial year, 1973-74, was £11.67 million.  This has gone up in the present nine-month period to £13.95 million.  This is equivalent to a loss of £18.7 million in a 12-months period.  The question arises, under these circumstances, what kind of financial return will CIE have in 1975?  On the basis of the increases that have taken place and the inevitable increase in prices of perhaps 20 per cent and allowing for the extremely intensive labour nature of CIE's operations it seems that CIE will lose £25 million.  I would be surprised if it were lower than that; it will, perhaps, be higher.  If £19 million was lost in the current 12-month period, allowing for the returns of previous years it seems that a loss of £25 million can be expected.</P>
      <P>I am not at all clear why the figure in the Book of Estimates for 1975 only provides for £17 million to be allotted to CIE for losses under the three headings.  It seems to be that that is £8 million, or perhaps more than that, lower than the likely losses that should have been suffered by CIE. There is a discrepancy here which calls for explanation and I would be glad to have the Minister's views on this.</P>
      <P>Getting down to the more general aspects of the Bill we can agree that the social aspect of transport, in this and other countries, is becoming increasingly important and we probably have reached the stage now where it is unwise even to talk in terms of losses on transport.  After all, we do not talk about losses on health services or on various other Government services necessary for the benefit of the people and we must therefore accept that transport is necessary as a social amenity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="338" /> While I can accept completely that saying to a company like CIE that they need not think about losses anymore would entail risk of further depreciating their technical operating efficiency, nonetheless we should be realistic; we should accept that these ever-increasing sums are not really losses in the ordinary sense of the word.  An ordinary commercial company would not ruin many of the services CIE run because everybody knows they will never make a profit &mdash;they will make large losses&mdash;and the fact that CIE run them shows that they are obeying Government instructions to carry out a social service.</P>
    <P>This is particularly true in the present energy problem.  A number of speakers have referred to CIE as a social amenity.  More and more the Minister and all of us must think in terms of the energy situation.  One aspect of the matter has been dealt with particularly by Senator West&mdash; the suburban train services in and out of Dublin.  I mention these not because, as a Dubliner, I am particularly orientated towards Dublin but because it seems to me that these services, unlike the other train services, lend themselves to very large and rapid increases in traffic.  I have no doubt but that in five years one could double or perhaps treble the numbers travelling on the Dublin suburban train services.  Even on the Minister's excellent service to Cork I do not think it would be possible to expect anything like that increase in traffic in a comparable period.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that if satisfactory, modern trains, such as Senator West suggested, with sliding doors such as one finds on suburban trains all over the world, were provided on the suburban services in Dublin and at frequent intervals, which is a vital point, one would enormously increase the numbers using the trains.  The great problem with suburban services at the moment is one needs to have a timetable. If there were frequent services &mdash;perhaps at quarter-hour intervals or even more frequently at rush hours &mdash;from Howth, on the one hand, and <Col N="339" /> Bray on the other there would be an enormous increase in traffic.</P>
    <P>This operation would be expensive. It would cost the taxpayer a considerable amount of money, but it would have a beneficial effect on our balance of payments.  The energy problem is so great and the cost of oil is such a burden that in all our transport services we must think in terms of energy all the time.  It is ludicrous, when we are desperately trying to pay enormous increases in the price of oil year by year&mdash;and this is likely to continue indefinitely&mdash;that we should have the roads lined with cars.  In the morning and evening each car carries only one or two persons at the most.  They are using a scarce commodity at great cost to the community.  I do not think this should be allowed at a time when we have parallel public services capable of carrying a great many passengers.</P>
    <P>There is the constantly worsening traffic problem in Dublin.  Even allowing for a certain slowing down inevitable because of the annual increase in traffic, there is no doubt but that one of these days on some Friday afternoon the traffic in Dublin will just seize up and nobody will get home for about two days.  The prognostications are for a further enormous increase in the number of cars and it is quite clear Dublin streets will not be able to take it.  The Minister should think in these terms.  He said that CIE will spend £27 million on a capital programme over the next six years. This is nothing like sufficient; it is only just over £4 million a year.  I do not know what it is going to be used for, but it is in no way adequate.</P>
    <P>Senator West referred to the state of the rail track.  He said it is quite good between Dublin and Cork but on other lines it is dreadful.  These lines are not adequate for anything more than about 50 miles an hour and, when a train is doing 60, 65, or 70 miles an hour, it sways in a most alarming manner; it is most uncomfortable. There are many drawbacks of this kind on the railways that need to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of <Col N="340" /> freight.  CIE freight has a very bad name.  The problem is that it has to run at fixed periods whether or not the lorries are full and CIE are often accused of inefficiency as a result.  In order to obtain some element of independence a very large number of companies run their own transport. One can understand why they prefer to do this.  A company wishing to deliver material rapidly prefers to have its own lorry available at a moment's notice.  In the present energy situation can we afford this any longer?  Should the Government not gradually develop a situation which would make it more and more difficult for companies to run their own transport?  Companies which run their own transport have lorries making a one-way journey empty but even when the lorries are carrying goods, they are often only half full. This seems a very great waste of scarce materials.  Even though it may seem dictatorial, we may have to try and put more freight on to the State or some kind of central transport and stop this wasteful carrying of materials in private lorries.</P>
    <P>I want to stress what was said about the social aspect of the matter. Even though it may seem expensive, more and more stress should be laid on public transport, both freight and passenger.  We should not think in terms of losses.  The Government should think in terms of what is the best way of dealing with the situation from the national point of view and consider assistance merely as a Government subvention and not a loss in the normal sense of the word.</P>

      <P>I shall be very brief. We all realise that, if CIE are to be kept going, they must receive an injection of capital.  I would ask the Minister to advise CIE to try and dispose of as much of their assets as possible.  When I speak of assets I mean old buildings, dwellinghouses, parcels of land, harbour-masters' dwellings, stores and so on.  There are many stores still in their possession all over the country.  They could profitably dispose of those in an effort to raise more capital for CIE.  The canals <Col N="341" /> are a liability and, sooner or later, a decision will have to be made regarding them.  They are a menace to the farming community because of their location.  They are a menace to local authorities because they cannot negotiate satisfactorily with CIE the construction of new bridges.  These are all matters worthy of consideration. They may not be completely relevant to the Bill, but I would ask the Minister to take them into consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential that this Bill should pass all Stages before the end of the financial year which, of course, will be three months earlier than normal.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Seanad for the way they treated this Bill.  I am particularly grateful&mdash;and this point was recognised, too, in the Dáil; perhaps Senator Lenihan would be better able to answer it than I would myself&mdash;that it shows a change of heart on the part of public representatives, a realisation of the role of public transport in this State.  Senator Lenihan said that social objectives must be basic in the passenger field.  I think that is the word he used.  I agree with that suggestion.  Senator Yeats, Senator West, Senator Russell and Senator O'Brien also made the same point and I agree with them.</P>
      <P>CIE cannot just decide what their social role is.  They must operate within commercial confines.  If the Government decide that certain things must be done by CIE, then the Government should pay for that service. This has already happened in two areas.  For instance, school transport is not operated by CIE in the way the Dublin city bus services are.  CIE merely act as an agent for the Department of Education who say how the services should be run, what children should be picked up and at what points.  CIE then submit their bill to the Department of Education who pay that bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to the Department of Social Welfare in the case of free passes for old age pensioners.  This service cannot be carried out in the same detailed way as it is for the Department of Education, but there is a sum <Col N="342" /> which CIE charge the Department of Social Welfare for carrying old age pensioners free of charge on buses and trains.  This is one area in which specific Government Departments and, indeed, municipal authorities could see where they wanted services to operate and have CIE act as agents for them or pay them a fixed sum for operating these services.  This would be the way I should like to see CIE develop in the future.  I would certainly not agree &mdash;and Senator West referred to this point&mdash;with the closing of branch lines.  I said in my introductory speech that the Government have decided that the railway system should continue to be preserved subject to further concentration and reorganisation in accordance with the general concepts outlined in the McKinsey Report. That would be my philosophy about the rail services of CIE.  There should be no further lopping off of branch lines.</P>
    <P>Obviously, in the interests of commercial objectives the company would have to look at each station from the point of view of picking up quantities of goods which would make economic loads, palletisation, fork-loading units and specific carriages for bulk loads. They probably could not continue to service all the stations that are now being serviced.  They would have to draw back on that end of the service, but not by lopping off or closing further branch lines.  When they announced their rail plan in the middle of this year, I said that I did not wish to see any further branch lines closed, and I repeat that here.  I would hope that CIE could work towards commercial objectives, particularly in rail freight, which is one heavy loss-making sector.  Somebody said here tonight that CIE could compete with private hauliers on the road in this sector.</P>
    <P>I would put that even more positively. If they were properly organised and had the proper capital injection to handle these goods, the private hauliers could not compete with them in the freight sector.  There is a very big future for CIE in that end of the business, but they must be given the capital&mdash;the Government have given it to them this year&mdash;to modernise and <Col N="343" /> handle container traffic.  They have made a very good start on this already and a number of stations are being modernised and up-graded to enable them to handle large quantities of goods.  This will continue over a six-year period and, at the end of that, I would see very significant increases in the amount of goods being carried by CIE.  This will be of benefit not only to CIE but also to the various local authorities who will have this heavy traffic taken off their roads. From an environmental point of view this will also be important.  This is another area where, perhaps, CIE could be given a subvention.  There would be a saving to local authorities on road building to carry heavy goods if these heavy goods could be transferred to rail.</P>
    <P>The remark made by Senator Lenihan in opening his speech has been repeated in this debate and was also made in the other House.  It has come too late to be recognised from the staff morale point of view.  It is that we cannot eliminate deficits in CIE.  If this had been faced up to ten or 15 years ago and if it had been seen that CIE had other benefits, and that deficits would continually occur and that Ministers for Transport and Power would have to come back to the Oireachtas looking for extra subventions for CIE, then, I think, the morale of the staff and the management of the company would be far higher and, over the last number of years, they would have benefited and been better able to cope with the increased traffic which seemed to be moving their way.  An illustration of this is the effect of the success of the Supertrains on the morale of the staff of CIE.  There are 20,000 people employed by CIE.  They are one of the biggest employers in the country. If their morale is high and they are out hungrily looking for business and anxious to serve their customers, this will have its effect on the increased amount of traffic they will get to carry, both passenger and goods traffic.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan also mentioned the Dublin city services and asked how they could be subvented under <Col N="344" /> the EEC Regulations.  Regulation 1191 does not apply to the road transport services of railway undertakings, but there is provision in Regulation 1107/70 for compensation in respect of public service obligations not covered by the 1191 directive. Compensation in respect of the Dublin city services will be covered by Regulation 1107/70.  He also referred to separating the different elements of CIE and breaking them down into different categories&mdash;provincial bus services, city bus services, road freight, and various services like that, and identifying each one of them from a subvention point of view.  These services are already broken down and are separately managed and appear separately in the Company's accounts.  If we could identify these and break them down further and if the Government would pay for various services which they would commission and get CIE to act as agents for them, this would help the morale of the staff of CIE and is something on which I would place great importance.  For two years the public and politicians had an attitude towards CIE employees as if they were a drag on the economy, whereas it was quite the reverse.  They had a very positive contribution to make to the economy and we should have recognised that a long time ago.</P>
    <P>In relation to the fares and rates increase, it was not a delay but a postponement of the increase by the Government.  Even though Senator Lenihan does not appreciate this&mdash; and CIE certainly did not, the fare-paying public possibly did appreciate a three months' delay.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats referred to the £17 million subvention in the 1975 Estimate. This is the amount the Government have fixed for CIE subvention in 1975.  As he pointed out, there is a very high labour content in CIE and it would be measly to expect that there would not be an increase in fares and rates during the next financial year.  That is quite true.  Senator Russell said that CIE should not be criticised and that is the point I have been making and he spoke about the long haul of bulk goods.  He said that CIE are very capable of carrying <Col N="345" /> these.  It is one of the areas in which they would be seeking to extend their influence and extend their dominance of that market.</P>
    <P>A number of suggestions were made by Senators which are, perhaps, more appropriate to the board of CIE than to the Minister but I will certainly take them all to them.  Senator Russell made two of these points.  One referred to local area boards which seem to me to be of some benefit and the other one related to the redrawing of CIE areas to coincide with the health boards, the regional development organisation and the tourism organisation. There may be something in that and I will ask the board of CIE to have a look at that.</P>
    <P>Senator West suggested that a select committee of the House should look into the affairs of CIE.  I presume he meant more than CIE; he meant all the State companies.  As I said in the Dáil I am sympathetic to this and I would like to see this happening.  From a Minister's point of view, and from the companies' point of view, and, of course, from the public's point of view whom the Senators and Deputies represent there would be benefit in it for everybody.  I do not want to infer that there has not been an informed discussion here but there would be a more deeply critical discussion of the affairs of semi-State companies if it had been thrashed out in private with the managements of the various companies by a committee of the House. I am sympathetic to this.  The whole question is being examined by the Department of the Public Service and the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Senator West wanted to know how the breakdown in the loss of £13.95 million was arrived at.  As most Senators know, there was a £10 million loss on the rail services.  The Dublin city services lost £3.3 million.  Other bus services, that is provincial bus services, lost £250,000; road freight lost £210,000; the canals lost £110,000. Senator Keegan, in his contribution, thought the canals were a liability but I do not agree with that.  They may be a nuisance to some travellers in various counties but from the tourism <Col N="346" /> point of view they are not a liability but a tremendous asset.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to canals which are not being maintained by CIE.  They are a nuisance and they are an eyesore.  They are overgrown with weeds and bushes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, they are a great asset from the tourism point of view and the general amenity point of view not just for the tourist but for the people living in the area. There can be tremendous amenity there.  I would hate to see them closed up in any way.  In fact, I would prefer to see local authorities with CIE and Bord Fáilte developing the canals and developing an inland waterway system.</P>
      <P>I am out of order now when I talk about tourism.  But there is a tremendous potential for the development of our inland waterways.  We could have with the extension of a few of our canals one of the biggest inland waterway networks in Europe and there is undoubtedly, a demand tourist-wise for this type of market. This market is undoubtedly in demand on the Continent.  It does not have to be sold; it is almost self-promoting. As long as I am Minister and as long as I have any influence over CIE, the canals will not be closed but will be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator West and Senator Yeats spoke about the Dublin suburban railways.  I mentioned in the Dáil that in January, 1974 an announcement was made that the Government had given approval in principle to major proposals for the development of the Dublin rail commuter services.  The development of these services would involve the provision of new rolling stocks, signalling systems and stations in the existing north-south lines with subsequent extensions of Blanchardstown and Clondalkin.  This is the subject of an examination by CIE with the help of consultants who are also going into the feasibility of constructing a short underground railway in central Dublin.  I expect this examination to be completed in the new year and it will be submitted to CIE and through them to me and to the <Col N="347" /> Government.  We should wait for that.</P>
    <P>The signalling system I refer to here is not part of the £27 million I referred to in my speech but the £27 million does allow for a new signalling system all over the country.  The laying of permanent way rails is extremely expensive and CIE have made a start on this but, because of financial problems, the amount they can do in any one year is limited.  They have made a start.</P>

      <P>Certainly on the trunk routes they will be moving towards continuous welded rails.  I hope I have dealt with all the points raised.  Points made by Senator O'Brien, Senator West and other Senators are matters for CIE and I will bring them and the subject of the debate to the attention of CIE.  There are many points they will be glad to note and examine.  A number of Senators here have had dealings with the board and management of CIE and I am sure they have found that they are not an enclosed order that one cannot get at without ringing bells.  They are anxious to talk to people and from the point of view of the modernisation of the stations announced last July, they are anxious that the people in the various localities should understand what they are trying to do.  They have been taking pains with the Members of the Oireachtas, in particular, to see that they are informed.  They have, as Senator West has said, erected models in stations that are going to be upgraded and modernised.  They will be taking advantage of the various media ways of informing the public of what is going on.  I hope that the new attitude which I detected in the House, and in the Seanad, towards CIE will extend to the public in general and that they will be proud of CIE in the future years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section that lays on the board of CIE the obligation to pay their way having account of the money provided by the Minister. I should like to return briefly to a point I was making to the Minister about the potential loss next year for CIE.  When I suggested that a conservative estimate for the loss for the coming financial year 1975, would be around the £25 million mark, I was, of course, allowing for increases in fares in that.  Experience of recent years, and, indeed, the experience of some 15 years back but, certainly, the last three or four years, has been that even though there have been annual increases in fares, sometimes very large increases, these have never been sufficient to enable CIE to even reduce their losses, or keep their losses at the level of the previous year. They go up year by year in spite of additional fares.  There is no reason that I can see with the present rate of inflation why they should not also be in this position next year.</P>
      <P>At the moment, as the Minister has pointed out, CIE are making losses at the rate of £19 million in a full year.  They are being allotted in the Estimates for 1975 £17 million.  The suggestion is, in other words, that whether by means of enormous increases in fares or other means their losses are going to decrease by £2 million, I would be interested to learn from the Minister why this figure has been inserted because it does not make sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been the experience, as Senator Yeats said, of the last few years and no matter how much any Government provided for a loss in CIE in future years this was never conditioned.  The Government must keep a rein on CIE.  The Government cannot say what CIE will lose next year and insert it in the Book of Estimates.  That would be too much of an easy ride for the board of CIE.  I am not sure how Senator Yeats calculated £25 million. I think he calculated it on the basis of £19 million for this year.  Is that correct?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Minister's point.  In the nine-month period, the loss was £13.95 million, as the Minister has told us.  A simple calculation would suggest that £13.95 million over a nine-month period is £18.7 million over a 12-month period.  In other words, CIE are losing at a rate approximately just under £19 million. This is the way I have calculated the figure, which is near enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It was mentioned in the Dáil but I have not got the actual figures.  The point I am making is that a Government must keep a rein on CIE.  I do not know what rate of wage or fare increases Senator Yeats would consider fair.  We are working on hypothetical figures.  It would be impossible either to prove or disprove. Senator Yeats' estimation of fare or wage increases would be very intelligent guesses but they would be estimations rather than facts.  The Government have decided that a rein should be kept on CIE as much as possible, to work as tightly as possible and to examine all the ramifications in order to keep the subvention in the next financial year at £17 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Minister's point.  However, the Minister rightly pointed out that this kind of thing in previous years had discouraged CIE because it seemed impossible for them ever to make ends meet.  CIE were <Col N="350" /> constantly being given additional sums of money.  This is another case in point.  Other people besides myself must have been estimating potential losses for next year.  Surely, if the Minister were to ask CIE how much they think they will lose next year, in the light of foreseeable circumstances and possible increases in fares &mdash;surely his Department must have estimated&mdash;it would seem an elementary thing to do.  While I am in no position to make an accurate estimate, it seems, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that £25 million is a fairly conservative estimate and that on that basis the sum in the Estimate is not simply an addition but it is an £8 million addition and a very large additional sum will be required next year.  It does not seem a very sensible way of handling the national book-keeping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have no way of either proving or disproving Senator Yeats' £25 million.  I would hope that the Government are right and that Senator Yeats is wrong. That is as far as I can go, but we consider that CIE should be able to operate within a subvention of £17 million in the next financial year. There will almost certainly be an application for an increase in rates and fares during that time which will help towards balancing their books.</P>
