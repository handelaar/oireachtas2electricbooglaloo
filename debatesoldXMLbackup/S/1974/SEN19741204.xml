      <P>I should like to propose an amendment to the Order of Business so that it be agreed that we take Motions Nos. 24 and 25, which I understand will then be withdrawn, No. 7 on the Order Paper, that is the First Stage of the Family Planning Bill, 1974, and then Nos. 1 and 5.  I am asking the House to give the Family Planning Bill, 1974, a First Reading today so that this Bill may be published and become available to the citizens for comment and observation.  I will not be pressing for a debate on it in the immediate future.  Instead I would ask the Senators to give publication to this Bill.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that the Lower House has amended its rules of procedure to avoid a First Stage.  This is the attitude of the Lower House towards a First Stage.  It is in general an automatic stage of publication of a Bill.  It is particularly so when the subject matter is one of importance to the public interest and when there have already been before this House proposals to change that law in that area. It is not an area which has not come before the Seanad.  Senators have been informed privately of the contents of that Bill.  I can see only value in taking the First Stage today.  I can see no reason why the First Stage would not be supported.  I ask the Senators to allow the Order of Business to be amended accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to propose a further amendment.  I do not propose to speak on the amendment which Senator Robinson has just proposed. The amendment I should like to propose is, assuming the Order of Business is amended in the way Senator Robinson suggested, to add after No. 7, No. 6 on the Order Paper:</P>
      <P>A Bill entitled an Act to provide for the disclosure in the reports of directors of companies of gifts for political and charitable purposes and for that purpose to amend the Companies Act, 1963.</P>
      <P>I propose to amend the Order of Business to include this Bill on the very simple grounds that it has been as long on the Order Paper as any other item which appears on it today, certainly within the first half of the Order Paper, with the exception of the Bill of which we are now taking the Second Stage. When I last raised this matter before the Recess I was given the usual vague assurances from the other side of the House that the matter would be examined.  It was brought to my attention that not one but two Ministers, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Justice, were involved in the Bill and that their views would have to be sought on the matter.  We also had a specific assurance from Senator Brendan Halligan, on behalf of the Labour Party, that they supported the spirit of this legislation and were anxious to see it given an early First Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the Members on the other side of the House have been up to but I have had personal assurances from both Ministers concerned that they have no objection to taking the First Stage of this Bill.  I do not even <Col N="12" /> see why their attitude should be relevant to us as a House capable of controlling our own business.  However I mention it for the information of the House as an indication that, however dilatory Members on the other side may feel about doing their homework and consulting the people concerned, I have managed to do in five minutes what they have not yet managed to do in six months.  I would urge very strongly the incorporation of this Bill in the Order of Business at this stage.</P>

      <P>I stated on a number of occasions that the position in this House is that the House settles its own Order of Business.  I have made a proposal as to the order in which business should be taken.  As far as I am concerned I am not prepared to accept the amendments which have been made to my proposal, but it is entirely a matter for the House.  As regards No. 7 Senator Robinson did Members of the House the courtesy of sending them a copy of her Bill and I understand she extended the same courtesy to the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may express a personal view it seems to me that a Minister would require rather more than a week&mdash;I think I am correct in saying he received it last week&mdash;to consider the Bill proposed by Senator Robinson.  A further view of mine is that both the Parliament <Col N="13" /> and the people would welcome a rest from this seemingly perpetual peddling of Contraceptive Bills.  I do not imagine that Senator Robinson is correct in assuming that there is such a public interest as to demand the immediate publication of this Bill.  It is a matter for the House.  I am expressing my own views on it.  Other Members of the <Col N="14" /> House are entitled to vote exactly as they wish.</P>

    <Title>Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1974    (Certified Money Bill):    Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is an enabling measure to raise the statutory limit on issues from the Local Loans Fund from £600 million to £1,000 million.</P>
      <P>Exchequer loans are made to local authorities, including regional health boards, vocational education committees and harbour authorities, through the Local Loans Fund to finance essential capital services.  The statutory limit on issues from the fund was £5 million when it was established in 1935.  The limit has been increased periodically by successive enactments and was last set at £600 million in 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="15" /> This fund has been the main source of capital for local authorities for many years.  In carrying out their wide responsibilities for the provision of many vital capital services these authorities have assumed ever-increasing commitments which must be financed almost entirely by loans from the fund.  In 1973-74, over 90 per cent of local authority capital expenditure was met in this way. The balance came from the internal resources of the authorities and from banks and insurance companies.</P>
    <P>Up to 31st March, 1974, issues from the fund totalled £498 million, of which £383 million, equivalent to 77 per cent, was provided for housing.  A total of £245 million was provided for the building of local authority dwellings, £109 million for private house purchase loans and over £28 million for supplementary housing grants.  Over £69 million was provided for water supply and sewerage schemes, while the balance of £46 million was spent on hospitals, vocational schools, harbour works, libraries, fire stations, swimming pools and other amenities.</P>
    <P>There has been an unprecedented increase in the annual total of issues from the fund since the last Act was passed.  Between 1972-73 and 1974-75 the annual amount has risen from £49 million to an estimated £98 million.  The most significant increase has occurred in issues for the house purchase loans scheme, under which loans are made by local authorities to persons with modest incomes to enable them to build or purchase their own homes.</P>
    <P>Annual issues from the fund for this purpose will have risen in the two-year period mentioned from £8 million to an estimated £34 million.  This dramatic jump in the demand for local authority loans may be attributed to the expansion of the national housing programme to meet the Government's target of 25,000 dwellings a year and the increase in the maximum loans and income limits for borrowers which were introduced in 1973 against the background of a contracting supply of mortgage finance from the building societies.</P>
    <P>Expenditure from the fund for the building of local authority dwellings has also risen in the two years, that is, from £25 million to £40 million, in line with <Col N="16" /> the increases in output following adoption by the Government of a target of 8,000 local authority dwellings per year. Sanitary services expenditure will have almost doubled in the same period, that is, from £8 million to £15 million, to meet the expanded needs of both housing and industrial development.</P>
    <P>By 31st December, 1974, issues from the fund will have exceeded £570 million.  The present statutory limit of £600 million should be reached during the early part of next year, so that an increase in the limit is again required to enable the issue of loans to continue after that time.  At the present rate of issues from the fund the limit will have to be raised by £400 million to provide for the next three to four years.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, a new statutory limit of £1,000 million is proposed in the Bill which, I trust, will be acceptable to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is a straightforward one.  It is an enabling Bill enabling the limits of loan issues from the Local Loans Fund to be raised from £600 million to £1,000 million.  This is not due to any expansion in social development mentioned by the Minister. It is largely due to inflation and the sum of £1,000 million is worth about what £600 million was worth in 1972.  There is no dramatic increase in expenditure here.  There is a legitimate increase in the funds available to keep pace with the decreasing value of money.</P>
      <P>The other fact the Minister was frank enough to admit is that the building societies have no funds to advance moneys.  There is increased pressure on the Local Loans Fund for that reason. The Minister stated that this measure is being introduced against the background of a contracting supply of mortgage finance from the building societies.  A zero supply of mortgage finance from the building societies would be more appropriate.  At least the Minister has admitted that this is the factor which led to the situation&mdash; a rapidly contracting supply of mortgage finance from the building societies. Unless the Government make a radical reappraisal of the whole question of housing finance they are not facing up to their responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure is merely a continuing <Col N="17" /> one.  It makes do with the present system.  It keeps pace with inflation by raising the limit from £600 million to £1,000 million.  It is the minimum the Minister for Finance should do in the present situation.  Nothing the Minister has said here or in the Dáil indicates that there is any serious Government thinking on the real serious problem of overall housing finance against the background of contracting mortgage finance from building societies.  Building societies are not able to cope because they are not getting a supply of money, whereas the banks apparently have a supply of money and have increased profits.</P>
    <P>There has been no indication of any radical thought by the Government into establishing a national policy towards housing finance that would include the banks.  The banks are included in housing finance in many countries throughout the world.  Any radical solution that would enable the banks to come in on housing finance should be looked at.  There are problems, I know, but the matter is so serious that they should be driven into a situation where they will fulfil their social obligations in that respect.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to have the supply of money drying up for building societies without the Government stepping in and ensuring there is an adequate replacement.  Even though, as the Minister stated, the annual issue in the two-year period from the Local Loans Fund for housing purposes has risen from £8 million to £34 million, that is still inadequate to cope with the problem against the background of a contracting supply from the building societies and without help from the banks to deal with the supply of finance formerly dealt with by building societies.</P>
    <P>This problem of housing finance lies at the root of the whole housing construction crisis which exists at the present time.  There is a serious housing crisis mainly because of the lack of housing finance and because the building societies have no housing finance. There is little in this Bill to deal with that problem.  This is merely a continuing measure making allowance for inflation and continuing with the scheme which has been acting in its own modest <Col N="18" /> way in dealing with certain levels of house building.</P>
    <P>I will confine my remarks to money dispersed under the Local Loans Fund. In 1973, £2,350 was fixed as the upper income limit and linked with that was the upper limit of loans, at £4,500. Inflation has eroded both figures substantially since 1973.  We have publicly made a modest proposal to the Minister under both these headings.  We suggested that the least that might be done is to raise the upper income limit of £2,350 to £3,000 and to raise the upper limit of loan from £4,500 to £6,000. These are basic, modest requests which would do very little more than cope with the rate of inflation and the depreciation in the value of money since September, 1973.  As those unrealistic limits stand, the large segment of the population over the income limit of £2,350&mdash;that is a substantial segment of the population at present&mdash;were catered for by building societies.  They are now in a very serious position in regard to house building.  Funds are not available for the segment of proposed house builders over £2,350 income per year.  It is because finance is not available for that category that the housing industry is in its present crisis.  It is the private house building industry that is primarily hit by this lack of funds and it is the private housing building industry that would be catering for the people whose incomes are over £2,350.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not attempted in this Bill to offer any explanation why this proposal is not being considered. The obvious explanation is lack of funds &mdash;that it would place too great a drain on the Local Loans Fund and would divert money from other purposes such as the development of sewerage, water and so on.  It would divert money from those requirements to housing.  That may be the Minister's answer.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is sufficient explanation in the situation that exists at present.  The Minister will be making serious pronouncements on the state of the economy within a few hours.  The economy is in a very serious state. Nobody takes any joy out of that.  It is the duty of the Minister for Finance to inform us fully of the state of the economy and not to produce a document such as was issued recently by his <Col N="19" /> Department in regard to economic development in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am diverting a little. Fundamentally, if life is to be injected into our economy the answer lies in the construction industry.  It is in this industry, and particularly in the house building sector of it, that the Government should do most to give a lift to the economy in the present situation. That is my advice for what it is worth. One practical way in which this can be done is to raise the upper income limit from the ludicrously low figure of £2,350 to at least £3,000 and raise the upper limit of loan from £4,500 to at least £6,000.  It may divert money from other purposes envisaged under the Local Loans Fund, but in the present situation what is needed most is a lift in the construction industry and the house building industry and I consider it is worth diverting money to this area of economic activity.  It is worth concentrating on this because of the high employment content which exists, particularly in house building.</P>

    <P>I am sure if the Minister analyses the situation he will realise there are many other areas of expenditure under the Local Loans Fund that do not have the same high employment content that exists in house building.  In my opinion, in the present situation there is a compelling reason for the Minister to divert funds to house building and the most practical way to do this is under the application and administration of the Local Loans Fund by raising the income and loan levels under the fund in respect of house building.  He can by this inject extra finance into the area of house building.  He can do something that is socially necessary in regard to providing houses for people who cannot get them due to the collapse of the building societies, and on the economic side provide a much-needed pump-primer for house building which has a high employment content.  In that way, he will ensure higher employment in that sector in the next six or nine <Col N="20" /> months during which we will be facing very serious economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>This Bill as it stands makes no contribution to solving our economic difficulties.  It is merely a continuing Bill.  What is needed is something along the lines I suggested to inject money into house building and thereby do something for the social and economic problems that affect us generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Lenihan in welcoming this necessary enabling Bill.  That is about the only thing I can agree with him on.  In regard to his dissertation, as a member of a local authority for the last six months I thought Senator Lenihan might be better informed on exactly what the Government have been doing to assist local authority capital programmes throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The point he made about inflation accounting largely for the increased grants and loans from central funds for local authorities will not stand up.  If you take the increases between the years 1972-73 and 1974-75, that is just three years, under the three most important headings, finance for local authority dwellings went up from £25 million to £40 million, an increase of approximately 40 per cent; house purchase loans went up from £8 million to £34 million, an increase of more than 300 per cent; and water and sewerage finance went up from £8 million to £15 million, an increase of almost 200 per cent.  Any fair-minded person will agree, even allowing for the high rate of inflation in the past two years, that the amount of funds allocated to local authorities during that two-year period far exceeds the rate of inflation, and this indicates the Government's anxiety to increase the capital activities of all local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Lenihan that it would be most desirable if the income ceiling and loan ceiling in regard to SDA loans could be raised.  We should remember that it is only a little over 12 months since the present limits were fixed, that is, £2,350 for income and £4,500 for the maximum loan.  That was a substantial increase at the time. Obviously there is a limit to the amount of capital which the Government can transfer into any capital activity.  It <Col N="21" /> must be remembered that money can come from only two sources&mdash;either from taxation or from borrowing.  In proposing an increase in both limits I think it would be only fair and constructive to suggest where the money might come from.</P>
    <P>At the moment interest on local authority loans, as Senator Lenihan and other members of local authorities will know, is heavily subsidised.  The going rate for borrowing both inside and outside the country is substantially higher than the interest charged by the Local Loans Fund.  Therefore the taxpayer is being called on twice&mdash;first of all to provide at least part of the capital for the loans and secondly to subsidise the rate of interest.  We should appreciate that there is a limit to which the taxpayer can be called on to bear these burdens.  Having regard to incomes generally today and the cost of building, particularly private building, if the Minister can without bearing too heavily on the taxpayer either provide the extra funds or subsidise the rate of interest, certainly I in common with every other public representative would welcome it being put into effect.</P>
    <P>The Minister could give consideration &mdash;perhaps this does not come strictly within his ambit but possibly the ambit of the Minister for Local Government&mdash; to empowering local authorities to purchase second-hand houses for resale or letting to tenants.  There are at the moment SDA houses available that might be bought by local authorities if the legal difficulties could be overcome.</P>
    <P>A further suggestion which might help to overcome the problem mentioned by Senator Lenihan, and one all local authorities and local representatives are conversant with, is that some joint arrangement would be made between the local authorities and the building societies to fund the purchase of houses.  What I have in mind is that local authorities could within their limits lend up to, say, £4,500 and thereafter the building societies could lend the balance of the purchase price of a house.  I do not know whether that is practical, but it strikes me it would make available to house purchasers in the income bracket above £2,350 who wanted to buy a house of say £6,000, sufficient to enable them to raise, say, <Col N="22" /> three-quarters of the funds from the local authorities and the balance from the housing societies.</P>

      <P>I have to intervene to point out that this is neither a Bill on local government nor on housing generally.  I must ask the Senator and those who follow in the debate to keep the discussion to the Local Loans Fund and the effect of the amount in the Local Loans Fund on the operations that are carried out under it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse Senator Lenihan's plea to maintain at all costs activity in house building of all kinds&mdash;local authority and private house building.  It has the great advantage that most of the materials used are manufactured at home&mdash;cement, steel, and furniture, possibly to a limited extent, paints, sanitary ware, various fittings and so on.  Employment would be maintained not only in the building industry but also in the ancillary industries.  For this reason I hope the Government will continue to show encouragement and support for a high level of house building.  They have already indicated that they have set a target of 25,000 houses a year, of which 8,000 will be local authority and the balance private enterprise houses.  I hope that every effort will be made to maintain and possibly increase that programme, particularly in the present difficult times.</P>
      <P>House accommodation is vitally necessary for the expansion of industrial development.  One of the great needs, particularly in rural areas, in areas apart from the higher urban centres, is houses for executives and skilled and unskilled workers.  If we are to pursue our industrial trends effectively and quickly, obviously we must have ample housing available for the operatives who work in these factories.  I should like to see the Minister planning ahead to ensure that adequate funds would be available not on a year-to-year basis but possibly on a five-year basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that among the authorities which borrow from the Local Loans Fund, harbour authorities might possibly be dealt with in a different way. At present harbour authorities are lumped in with hospitals, vocational <Col N="23" /> schools, libraries, fire stations, swimming pools and other amenities.  In the years to come the cinderella of the transport industry in this country, the port industry, will have to get far more attention from the Government and far more funds if it is to develop as an integral part of our transport system and be what it should be&mdash;an important outlet and inlet for international trade between this country and overseas.  I would suggest that the time has come when it might be dealt with in the same way as CIE or Aer Lingus, the ESB or other similar Government sponsored services.  I appreciate that the ports are not organised in the same way&mdash;they are not a single semi-State body&mdash;but the time has come when the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Finance will have to take a hard look at the whole port industry and devise a different scheme for funding its operations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as a necessary measure.  It is an indication of the Government's interest to maintain housing in this country, both local authority and private enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the previous speakers in impressing on the Minister the necessity for keeping activity going at full in all those areas of local authority jurisdiction&mdash;housing, amenity development and so on.  The fund, which began at £5 million in 1935, is now proposed to be a loan fund reaching a maximum of £1,000 million. It would seem, then, that the whole purpose of the fund has changed fairly drastically from its earlier days when it was a loan fund in a real sense and there was some idea about a loan being paid back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, with the sums that are involved and the fact that this is contributing 90 per cent of local authority capital expenditure, there is no hope or expectation that the loans will be repaid in any way.  Consequently it would seem that the time has come to have another look at this type of financing and that it should more properly be labelled a local authority grant rather than loan.  It is of little use carrying loans on books over years when the only form of repayment is that of another <Col N="24" /> loan.  This just emphasises that at the present stage the taxpayer has to foot the bill in any case, whether it is footed by the local authority's rate collection or through central taxation.  Therefore at this stage, when the central authority are providing such a large share of the capital expenditure of the local authority, it is no longer right or proper that it should be labelled a loan.</P>
    <P>The only figure that stands out is £46 million that was spent on hospitals, vocational schools, harbour works, libraries, fire stations, swimming pools and other amenities.  I know, of course, there are central contributions to many of those projects as well, but still the £46 million in the context of the £600 million total expenditure seems rather small on this side of the activities.  We hope that when the present economic difficulties have been overcome this side of the work of the local authorities will benefit from far greater stress and greater funds and that a measure of our prosperity and our development will be the increase we can make under those headings in local areas.  All these swimming pools, libraries and other amenities require a great deal more than we have got at present and when the finance is available I hope that a proper push will be given in this direction.</P>
    <P>On the question of trying to relieve the housing burden which is now falling so heavily on the local authorities and aggravated by the contracting supply of mortgage finance available from building societies, we hope that the position with regard to the building societies will improve.  The effort of encouraging people to save as their contribution to this has not really been settled in a proper way.  I should like to see as a contribution by the young wage-earners before they need a house and before they plan to marry that there would be imaginative schemes by the local authorities and others to encourage them to save and thereby provide their part of this necessary housing finance.  The amount of finance that is going on to the State and the taxpayer is not a healthy sign.  It is not a sign of a community capable and eager to look after themselves.  Allied with the other figure of all that is spent on drink at present, £200 million per year&mdash;a good deal of it by that sector <Col N="25" /> that I have suggested should be encouraged to provide for the future by saving&mdash;it pinpoints a weakness.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill as it is.  I do not want to widen the scope of the debate unduly, but anything that will ease the burden of providing housing finance on the local authorities would be a worthwhile contribution and should be tackled in an imaginative scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I welcome the Bill.  It has been suggested that our loan ceiling for the erection of council houses would be increased from £4,500 to £6,000.  I wonder if this would be in the interest of the people who are building the houses.  I had an experience ten years ago when SDA loans were first made available for local authority houses and cottages for sale throughout the country. At that time cottages were being sold for roughly £1,200 to £1,500.  Then the loan became available and competition became much keener.  As a result, where there was a cottage for sale one found five or six people making application to the same authority seeking loans.  Then there was the understandable feature of the engineers from the local authority examining the structure of the house and valuing it.  They allowed a certain value, say £3,500.  I had one case where five persons were approved for loans of £3,500 and the auctioneer again advertised and called the five together again&mdash;of course they were trying to find out from some of the people which of them were sufficiently thrifty to get extra pounds to buy their house.  When we speak of £6,000 loans we must ask how somebody with a family and earning £35 per week would repay £60 per month on a loan.</P>

      <P>I again have to intervene.  The Senator is going very wide of the Local Loans Fund.  I appreciate that he is following up a point already made by another Senator but I am afraid he has travelled well beyond the scope of the Bill at this stage.</P>

      <P>The general situation now regarding local authority loans is that they are two-and-a-half times the amount of the wages.  Over ten months ago this loan ceiling was increased to <Col N="26" /> the present ceiling of £4,500 and, as Senator Russell pointed out, it is appropriate to suggest a further increase.  Nevertheless we should ask ourselves. where does the money come from?  At present loans are being subsidised at roughly 6½ to 7 per cent.  In 1971 they were subsidised only to the extent of only 1 per cent.  Now we are borrowing at the rate of 15½ per cent and, at the same time, charging only 10½ to the borrower.  However, I am sure it will be gratifying and give a certain amount of confidence to the local authorities to realise that money is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>The last sentence of Senator O'Brien's speech interests me. He says local authorities would be confident if they knew that money was available.  Not alone does it interest me, it surprises me, because despite the fact that the limit issue in this Bill has not been reached and despite the fact that we see today from the Minister's speech that there is still plenty of money in the Local Loans Fund, I know from the local authority I am a member of that there is no money available at the moment to pay supplementary housing grants.  There is such a delay in the payment of loans that there is reason to suspect that the Land Registry office has been told to slow up the transfer of titles in order to hold up the payment of loans.  If this Bill helps in a small way to relieve the serious housing situation that exists at the moment, then I welcome it wholeheartedly, but increasing the limit to £1,000 million is not going to solve the problem if the money from the loans fund is not paid out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is one thing to have a large limit, but it is an entirely different matter to use the money in the fund.  In recent times the money has not been paid out from the Local Loans Fund and as a result local authorities are frustrated. Only in the last few days I have received letters from Donegal County Council informing me that supplementary grants would be paid to certain individuals as soon as the money was made available.  Failure to provide this money is another example of the disastrous housing policy pursued by the Government.  I note that in the course <Col N="27" /> of his speech the Minister told us that the increase in the maximum loans and income limits for borrowers were introduced in 1973 against the background of a contracting supply of mortgage finance from the building societies.  This would suggest to me that the Minister is saying that there is a shortage of money in the building societies, and yet it is only a few months since his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, stated clearly and categorically that the building societies had plenty of money for this purpose. It would appear that there is a difference of opinion in this regard between the two Ministers.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said in the course of his speech: &ldquo;This dramatic jump in the demand for local authority loans may be attributed to the expansion of the national housing programme to meet the Government's target of 25,000 dwellings a year.&rdquo; The Minister is telling us that the demand for loans from this fund is such that there has been a dramatic jump to meet the Government's target of 25,000 dwellings a year. We have listened to various members of the Government and particularly to the Minister for Local Government boasting that in their first year of office the Government, through the help of the Local Loans Fund, realised their target of 25,000 dwellings.  I remember a few months ago asking the Minister for Local Government if he had on the night that the Coalition Government took office waved a magic wand and that suddenly thousands of houses appeared throughout the land.</P>
    <P>When the Government claim that they provided 25,000 houses in a year they are deliberately misleading the people.  The figures they produce to back up this argument are wrong; they are cooked.  The claim of 25,000 is a falsehood, because, in order to reach that figure, they have included houses vested in that year.  They have included all the houses vested by Dublin Corporation, Cork Corporation, the Waterford, Galway and Limerick Corporations.  They have included all the cottages vested by county councils throughout the country and all the houses sold by urban councils.  In my own town in that year <Col N="28" /> at least 30 houses were sold to the tenants, but the figure of 25,000 for 1973 includes that figure of 30 houses which were built five years ago by a Fianna Fáil Government.  I wish to state categorically here today that the official statistics issued by the Department of Local Government stated clearly that the figure of 25,000 included houses vested in the tenants in that year. While I have not at the moment at my disposal the actual number of houses vested, I would say that it would be something in the region of 4,000 houses.</P>

      <P>I must again intervene, as I have done continually in this debate, to indicate that Senators should confine themselves to the Local Loans Fund and to the effect of the size of the fund on the operations under it.  Details of policies in regard to housing or other aspects of local authority operations is outside the scope of the Bill.  I would be glad if the Senator did not go into the amount of detail which he has done in regard to local authority housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer therefore that the Government would make proper use of the Local Loans Fund and provide for us the number of houses which they promised to build. If they fail to keep that promise, they should at least be honest with the people and admit that in the particular year that they did not reach the target which they undertook to reach, instead of cooking the figures and giving false information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A plea has already been made to increase both the limits for SDA loans and the income limits and the amount of money available.  Because of the failure of borrowers to get money from the building societies the demand for SDA loans is growing day by day. Under the existing regulations anyone earning more than £2,350 per annum is precluded from availing of this money. That has brought about the most serious housing crisis this country has experienced since the spring of 1957 when the last Coalition Government were in office.  We all remember then that a similar situation existed.  There was no money for loans or grants and the builders ceased their operations.  While the Government, and particularly the <Col N="29" /> Minister for Local Government, spent the summer claiming that there was no housing crisis, as each week went by we learned of yet another builder whose back was to the wall.  In my own town, which is a small one, in recent weeks two builders who had purchased a considerable amount of land on which to build houses to sell to the people have announced that they must cease operations because their clients cannot get the money to buy their homes.  If this happens in one small town then the situation throughout the land must be very serious indeed.  I have no hesitation in saying that this situation has been caused not by the Arabs or the sheiks but by the most incompetent Cabinet this country has ever had.  It seems strange to me that Coalition Governments and housing crises go hand in hand.</P>
    <P>This Government do not seem to understand how to tackle the problem. When this problem was at its height the Minister for Local Government persisted in his claim that there was no such crisis in existence.  If we are to attempt to stimulate our economy we must begin through our housing programmes. The Local Loans Fund, which will now have a borrowing limit of £1,000 million, should be used to the full. Instead of discouraging people from providing their own homes the Government should be doing everything in their power to encourage people in this way.  I have often felt that any person in the supplementary grant category should have a loan with an interest maximum of 5 per cent.  There are many people who attempt to build their own homes who could sit back in flats and single rooms and wait to be housed by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>We all can think of people with initiative who would have come within the ambit of local authority housing. Young men earning around £30 per week are being forced to borrow £4,500. Considering that their repayments are £8.40 per month per £1,000 for 30 years, this means they have to repay £37.80 per month on a loan of £4,500.  I see many young men who are about to get married or who got married in the recent past applying for loans of this kind.  They are earning £30 per week <Col N="30" /> and committing themselves to a repayment of £37.80 per month.  Many of them feel that they are in a financial position to repay this loan.  They completely overlook, of course, that in a few short years they will have a number of children and their household expenses will have increased enormously. They could have waited in a single room and eventually the local authority and the State would have had to house them.</P>
    <P>I remember speaking on legislation such as this some years ago and expressing the view then that I express now. For people of this category loans should be subsidised by the State to a much greater degree than they are at the moment.  These people, after all, are relieving the State of housing.  I know that such a suggestion might be very difficult to implement and the cost might be prohibitive.  I would like to think that, at least, it is given some consideration.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and trust the Government will put it to its proper use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators I detect slight mischief-making on the part of the Opposition to date in this session.  An interesting session lies ahead of us.  Senator McGlinchey, in accusing the Government of producing houses out of a hat, has produced figures out of his own hat which I am sure the Minister for Local Government will, in his own good time, refute in no uncertain manner&mdash;a manner which is all his own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that Senator McGlinchey at least welcomed the Bill and the increase in the ceiling from £600 million to £1,000 million.  Senator Lenihan has implied that the doubling in the two-year period from 1972-73 to 1974-75 from £49 million to £98 million has been accounted for by inflationary increases. This cannot be accepted by anybody. Senator Lenihan would like people to believe that there has been a 100 per cent rate of inflation over the past two years. He cannot in all honesty and realism believe so.  Would he deny that the record number of 25,000 houses built in 1973-74 has accounted in some way for the increase in the figure from £49 million to £98 million?  I have no doubt <Col N="31" /> that we can look forward to an increase in the coming years in the number of houses that are to be built.</P>
    <P>It is interesting, looking at the figures that the Minister has given us, that provision of both local authority and private housing has more than doubled in the two years.  Water and sewerage loans issued have almost doubled. Altogether these figures have risen from £41 million to £89 million in the two years.  There does not seem to be the same <i>pro rata</i> increase in respect of the balance of the moneys making up the £49 million and £98 million, respectively. Eight million pounds in 1972-73 has risen to only £9 million in the current year.  I would like the Minister to indicate whether there has been a shortfall in the demand under this heading or whether there has been a cut-back in respect of the issue of loans. They cover important fields such as libraries, fire stations, swimming pools and other amenities.</P>
    <P>At the present time, the Minister for Finance is extremely anxious to ge value for the money he distributes.  He should try to impress on the Department of Local Government and indeed on all local authorities, the necessity for dealing speedily with applications for issues from the Local Loans Fund and the processing by the Department of Local Government of these loan issues. There have always been delays.  These delays have occurred not only in the current year, they have been experienced by everyone who has ever served on a local authority.  Any delay now, due to the present worldwide inflation, will inevitably lead to increased costs to the Exchequer funds.  I would ask the Minister to impress on the Department of Local Government and on all local authorities the necessity for obviating these delays in future.</P>
    <P>There is one point which Senator Russell made.  He urged that local authorities engage in the purchase of secondhand houses.  I do not know if this would be a wise procedure.  They would be engaging openly in the market for secondhand houses and this could invite a certain amount of criticism.  It might not be wise.</P>
    <P>We have no alternative but to <Col N="32" /> welcome this Bill.  We accept it knowing that within the figure of £1,000 million there is built in a margin for increased activity in the future.  Accordingly, we welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to commend the Minister for bringing in this Bill.  At the same time I wish to draw attention to the fact that it raises a number of fairly important fundamental issues which I would not like to see skimmed over.</P>
      <P>The first of these is the critical and ever-present question of decentralisation and local autonomy.  Any of us involved in politics or in any structures of administration will be keenly aware of the fact that there is no decentralisation worthy of the name which does not involve control over resources.  We are dealing with a Bill which relates to the Local Loans Fund.  This Bill empowers the Exchequer to grant moneys to local authorities for various works set out in the Minister's speech.  I should like the Minister to tell us something about the mechanism through which this money is made available to the local authorities. I would be grateful for his views on decentralisation in the control of the resources administrated through the Local Loans Fund.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of pseudodecentralisation here and indeed in all other countries.  There has been a great deal more talk about decentralisation than has ever been translated into action.  Where action has been taken, very often it has been decentralisation with so many strings attached that nothing ever happened.  The control of resources fundamental to decentralisation and the necessary degree of local autonomy are never fulfilled in practice. I accept that the overall shape of the economy and within that overall shape, the pattern of capital expenditure must and should be determined by the Government of the day.  I believe equally firmly that there is scope for far greater latitude in spending than any Government here have yet had the courage to adopt.  I urge on the Minister the advantages, in democratic terms and in terms of efficiency in the spending of this very important money, of a greater degree of genuine decentralisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" /> I am specifically interested in the provision of this money for financing vocational education.  This is a simple example of my first point.  The Minister states that funds are made available for various things, including vocational schools.  We are all aware that the actual decisions on how much money should be provided, to which vocational education committees it should be made available and when it should be given to them, is the subject of a very complex network of relationships involving not only the Minister for Finance and the Local Loans Fund but also the Minister for Education and the vocational education committees themselves.  We are not speaking about a one-to-one relationship between the Local Loans Fund and the vocational education committees; we are speaking about some kind of eternal triangle on which a great deal of the sparring is done at departmental level between the Department of Education and the Department of Finance.  There is relatively little involvement coming from the local areas.  I should like to underline my earlier remarks about autonomy in decentralisation by stressing the need for a greater local input in decision making in determining this expenditure.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Over £69 million was provided for water supply and sewerage schemes, while the balance of £46 million was spent on hospitals, vocational schools, harbour works, libraries, fire stations, swimming pools and other amenities.</P>
    <P>To the ordinary man in the street, £46 million seems a great deal of money. When we consider the number of areas in which this sum is being spent&mdash;six specific areas and &ldquo;other amenities,&rdquo; which could cover a great deal&mdash;we realise that £46 million is not such a great deal of money.  Sharing out this money obviously does not satisfy fully the needs of any area, although it does help to alleviate some pressing problems.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a very strong feeling which exists in the vocational education sector.  This sector has been hard done by in the matter of capital finance.  I <Col N="34" /> know, from visiting these schools and from speaking to people involved in this sector of the educational system, that many of them work under extraordinarily bad conditions, conditions which would never be tolerated under the Factory Acts, conditions which would certainly never be tolerated by the average civil servant.  While the exact accuracy of the charge that they are being discriminated against must, to a certain extent, depend on figures which presumably will be supplied by the Department of Education in their forthcoming Estimate, I can safely draw the Minister's attention to the cry for help from one important sector of the educational system.</P>
    <P>This cry must be listened to because it comes from a sector of the educational system which traditionally has underwritten the social and economic aims which formed such a large part of the pre-election programme of this Government.  This sector has also had a traditional concern for the underprivileged and those who are handicapped socially and economically.  This sector has taken, not to put too fine a tooth on it, the rejects of other parts of the educational system and has done its level best to cherish these children as equally as children from other parts of the system.  It has done so in a situation in which, its teachers and administrators would tell you, it has been severely starved of desperately important capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one final point. Of the six specific areas which are involved in the spending of the £46 million, three at least can be said to be related to some degree&mdash;vocational schools, libraries and swimming pools. I urge the Minister that, when spending this money and making it available for these very important works, he insists on the maximum possible degree of co-ordination between the various authorities involved.  The haphazard planning of important amenities like schools, libraries and swimming pools has often resulted in a severe waste of money&mdash;the kind of money this Bill is designed to raise.  Furthermore, the failure to reach agreement between the various authorities concerned has often resulted in local communities being <Col N="35" /> unfairly deprived of these amenities for many years while departmental rivalries and other factors combine to ensure that there is the maximum of talk and the minimum of action.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer the Minister to the very admirable scheme which is under way in the area at present served by the County Cork Vocational Education Committee.  New schools erected by this committee are being made the centre of amenity activities.  The chief executive officer should be commended for his far-sightedness in seeing that if amenity provisions are not carried out on an integrated basis they will probably never be carried out at all.  I urge the Minister to put the gun to the heads of these people when they come looking for money for amenities.  He should tell them to plan their amenities in a co-ordinated and integrated way.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious delay in the provision of swimming pools and similar facilities for community schools, which do not come under this heading, because of departmental rivalries.  While it may not be the Minister's immediate function to knock other Departments' heads together, I urge strongly on him that it is at least a proximate function in the exercise of his responsibilities towards the economy and the expenditure of the money he is giving them.</P>
    <P>While commending this Bill to the House, I ask the Minister to investigate seriously the possibility of greater resource control by local authorities which justify such control by the manner in which they co-ordinate and integrate their activities.  I urge him to look seriously at the provision of capital funds in the vocational education sector, the lack of which is felt by the people involved to be severely militating against their work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow the other speakers in complimenting the Minister on providing this extra money. At one time if somebody mentioned £1,000 million there would be consternation. Today it appears that £1,000 million is very little in the context of what has to be done to expand all the various services mentioned in the <Col N="36" /> Minister's speech and other services not mentioned.</P>
      <P>While we admit that the housing situation is not all it should be, perhaps it is time that there was some rationalisation of that industry.  Perhaps the shortage of money today might lead to this.  We all know that people in the building trade were vieing with each other to buy land at inflated prices because there was a market for houses. Now that the market has slowed down we might find that rationalisation of the price of building land was necessary.</P>
      <P>If there is a slow-down in housing, there are many areas which have been mentioned already where the money can be and should be spent.  The Minister has an ample field for the expenditure of even more money from the Local Loans Fund.  Educational needs and vocational schools in particular, have been mentioned. If the traditional builders are short of work in housing, they might decide that permanent construction should be utilised for school extensions rather than building wooden pre-fabs. They are a disgrace from every point of view, and particularly because of the amount of money that has to be spent on their upkeep and maintenance.  This is a field where the construction industry could change over to what was known as the ordinary block and concrete construction.</P>
      <P>Money will be spent on harbour works, libraries, fire stations and so forth.  Our hospital building programme is being held up through lack of finance. In the Western Health Board area we have capital expenditure of almost £10 million envisaged over the next five years.  I am pointing this out to show that there should be no lack of work in the construction area, provided the finance comes from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps some other method of finance is needed to provide the necessary infrastructure for expanding industry, such as we hope to have in north Mayo in the not-too-distant future.  According to a survey made by the county manager and a team, an amount in the region of £18 million will be necessary to provide sufficient infrastructure.  This includes housing, communications of all kinds&mdash; rail and road&mdash;the provision of power <Col N="37" /> and energy supplies, harbour works and also the amenities needed for a population expected to explode by some thousands in the not-too-distant future.</P>
    <P>The local authorities are unable to find money for this at rates level.  Considering Mayo has the highest rate in Ireland, we would not be able to find that kind of money.  To get a loan from the Local Loans Fund would be impossible.  Some new structure should be set up by the Minister.  The banks should be utilised in some way.  The banks keep their own interest to the fore.  They are interested in commercial propositions and because of their shareholders, they find it necessary to invest only in sound investments.  The banks owe something to the nation.  It is time they were forced into a situation where they would have to provide the necessary capital infrastructure if our nation is to expand at all.</P>
    <P>From the Minister's point of view expenditure on housing brings its own return after a certain time.  Expenditure on infrastructure&mdash;in education, on the provision of schools and in health on the provision of hospitals&mdash;would not give an immediate return and, perhaps, never a monetary return.  A balance must be kept by any Finance Minister between the two.  Wherever it is necessary for money to be spent, it should never be held in the Exchequer and carried over to another year.  If the local authorities and the education authorities get the money, they are prepared to spend it.  I thank the Minister for having increased the amount to the extent he has.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Leader of this side of the House pointed out in his opening remarks, we support this measure mainly on the basis of its enabling and continuing capacity.  The fact that the Minister is looking for an extra £400 million to finance the loan funds signifies the present inflation and, indeed, future inflation in this country. When one considers that 75 per cent of the loans fund is devoted to housing requirements of some sort, I hope that the Leas-Chathaoirleach will bear with me if I dwell on the housing aspect of this Bill.  As I said, 75 per cent of the loans fund is devoted towards housing requirements of some description.  When <Col N="38" /> we take into consideration that water and sewerage facilities all over the country can be very closely aligned with housing, we realise that perhaps 80 per cent of the loans fund could be devoted to housing requirements.</P>
      <P>Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party have on numerous occasions pressed the Minister to increase the upper income limit from £2,350 to £3,000 and the upper loan limit from £4,500 to £6,000. As a member of a local authority, I naturally meet many young people in my own area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator is straying into an area which is more relevant to the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out, 75 per cent of the loans fund is devoted towards housing.  I should like to stress that there is a real necessity for the upper income limit to be increased.  I know of many people in my own area who may be only £10 above the upper income limit of £2,350.  They find themselves very frustrated because at present a loan of any description is not available to them.  I know of many who have made application to building societies and have not been successful in their application. It is on that basis that there is this vacuum to be filled.</P>
      <P>There are many people who cannot at the present time obtain a housing loan. This is why I stress that the Minister, in collaboration with the Minister for Local Government, should see that the upper income limit is increased to at least £3,000 and that the upper loan limit is increased to £6,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If what Senator Russell and Senator Markey state is correct regarding the percentage increases given for capital expenditure towards local authority housing, sewerage and water, there is no reason why the Minister cannot increase the upper income and loan limits.  If it is not all devoured by inflation, considering the amount of the increase for which the Minister is asking&mdash;a sum of £400 million&mdash;there must be money available to increase the upper income and loan limits.  We, on this side of the House, support this measure mainly on the basis of its enabling and continuing capacity.  I <Col N="39" /> would stress on the Minister the desirability of increasing those limits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the measure introduced by the Minister.  The necessity for raising the limit from £600 million to £1,000 million has been brought about by the inflationary situation in which we find ourselves.  It is unfortunate that we have such a situation, but we must face realities.  We must plan on the basis of continued inflationary trends here.</P>
      <P>The building industry, which is serviced in the main by the Local Loans Fund, is our life blood so far as planning, building and providing housing for the future is concerned.  For that reason every effort should be made by the Minister for Finance to ensure that the maximum use is made of the money allocated.  This is a fund which pays for itself in the long run.  It is not a liability on the taxpayer.  It is not a liability on the community.  The people who avail of the loan services pay for the use of the money.  They are building up our national wealth by their efforts. We have never fully realised the efforts of private enterprise in this country. When we look at the allocation itself&mdash; £109 million for private house-building alone irrespective of supplementary housing grants&mdash;that should indicate the efforts being made by private enterprise to provide their own homes.</P>
      <P>I am convinced we do not go far enough in assisting those people.  They are enterprising; they make their own savings and then set about purchasing sites which are very hard to come by and are becoming dearer as time goes by. Those people, should receive greater recognition from the State for their special efforts by getting greater incentives. The only way their special efforts can be recognised is by giving them greater incentives, by providing the money at the lowest possible rate of interest, by providing the maximum rate of loans and by providing the maximum rates of supplementary grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we have not an adequate allocation for water and sewerage schemes.  Without water and sewerage schemes we cannot hope to <Col N="40" /> continue with both local authority and private housing development.  There is a great need for increased allocations to be made available to local authorities for water and sewerage extensions. There are many towns and villages still without sewerage supplies.  Most areas have water supplies.  That factor militates against the decentralisation programme envisaged by Governments in the past.  I think it is also the policy of this Government to continue decentralisation. We would have greater decentralisation of industry if all the services were available at local authority level in our smaller towns and villages.  I feel that the allocation of £69 million is not adequate if we are to make any real impact on the problem of providing sewerage schemes for our smaller towns and villages, without even planning for extensions in our larger towns.  Housing has suffered to a certain extent in the past because industry always seemed to get preference when it came to the expansion of water and sewerage.</P>
    <P>Another area in which I was disappointed with the allocation is hospitals. In every county and in every health board area there is a hue and cry for hospital extension.  In my own county we are awaiting sanction of a children's ward.  I am afraid that sanction will not be given in the near future because such a small amount has been earmarked for hospitals and schools.  I would prefer if the Minister set aside a specific sum for hospitals and hospital extensions. When one sees the sum of £46 million spread over hospitals, vocational schools, harbour works, libraries, fire stations and so on, one realises that one or two major harbour schemes in the whole country could devour that entire £46 million.  I would prefer if the Minister would be more specific in regard to the allocation being made available for hospital extensions.  As I said before, most health boards have been making plans over the years for hospital extensions and all those schemes are held up awaiting ministerial sanction.</P>
    <P>We have a similar situation in regard to vocational schools.  I regard vocational education as a necessity.  The possibility of all our children entering <Col N="41" /> university is limited.  Again a specific sum should have been allocated for vocational schools.  We know that the prefabs which have been erected throughout the country are not the answer.  They are small; the ventilation is not adequate; the air conditioning is non-existent.  We have overcrowded classes packed into small prefabricated buildings with the result that the teacher cannot do his job effectively and the children cannot obtain the maximum benefits from education in those vocational schools.</P>
    <P>Fire stations are a necessity.  An adequate fire service, especially in this day and age, is something which deserves serious consideration.</P>
    <P>With regard to swimming pools, I regret to say that local authorities have embarked on providing swimming pools and that all of them are working at a loss and therefore are a liability on the local authority and a liability on the Local Loans Fund because in the long run the loan repayments have to be met.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the high cost of borrowing.  This is a service for which the people pay.  The Minister should spare no effort in trying to make money available at the lowest possible rate because we are investing in the future when we provide money for building. The more private building we can encourage the better for the economy. Therefore the Minister should do everything possible to ensure that we have the maximum amount of private development.</P>
    <P>I was a bit worried about Senator McGlinchey's statement that the Land Registry have been told to slow up the transfer of housing sites.  I ask the Minister to tell us whether that is true or not.  I would be very disappointed if I thought that any Government Department endeavoured to deliberately slow down the rate of building by asking another Government Department to hold up the sanction of transfer of sites. As we all know, when a private individual sets about building his house the first thing he has to have is a site. Then, in order to avail of the loans, he has to have a clear title to that site, and the local authority in turn place a mortgage on the site.  It is all very involved and delays can occur of up to <Col N="42" /> 18 months and, in some cases two years. I would be disappointed if I thought any Minister or any Department deliberately instructed another Department to slow down the sanction of the transfer of sites.</P>
    <P>With regard to the housing targets there is one factor which has been completely overlooked, that it is the people themselves who achieve the targets, not the Government.  The people who set about building their own homes and providing their own houses are the people who set the pace.  They deserve the praise and not any Minister.  It is the people who decide to build and furnish their own homes who deserve the credit because of their enterprising ability and determination to provide for themselves and their future and leave a house as security for their wives or families.</P>
    <P>Again, I would like the Minister to clarify the situation in regard to the Land Registry.  I would also ask that a specific sum be made available for the improvement and extension of hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right that we should view the Minister's request for more money in the light of the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  I say this because within the next few hours the Minister will be making a statement on the economy.  He has already made statements indicating that in the next two years our economic future will not be rosy.  It is not the fault of anybody in this country and it is certainly not the fault of the Government.  It is because inflationary tendencies in the countries with which we trade.  We all know our near neighbour is in an economic condition that demands the application of the most stringent remedies, which apparently are being applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of these circumstances I feel the Minister is taking a prudent step in making this additional provision. Local authorities, of which many of us are members, will understand the increased demands on the Local Loans Fund.  Borrowers in rural areas may have varying costs but they all face the general increase in the cost of providing electricity in rural areas.  While I agree with Senator Keegan that water and sewerage services need to be supplemented <Col N="43" /> by local authority and State grants, I think the greatest drain on a rural borrower endeavouring to provide himself with a home is the heavy cost of obtaining an electricity supply.  I can tell the Minister of a small farmer who is entitled to a State and local authority grant but who is having to pay £950 for an electricity supply.  The Local Loans Fund could be utilised to lessen the burden of providing electricity for new homes.  When I say &ldquo;new homes&rdquo; I mean new houses subsidised by the State and local authorities.  This would help people in rural areas to obtain electricity, the cost of obtaining which is a prime problem.</P>
    <P>Local authorities utilise the Local Loans Fund to provide grants for a wide range of amenities and for the provision of opportunities for young people to have a place to meet in order to take them away from enticements not in their best interests.  Local authorities should be provided by the Minister with money to expand.  These are the things that would make it easier and more enticing for the younger people to stay in the country and to stay in their own locality.  The youth from the rural areas have been enticed by the opportunities provided by public moneys in the cities and in the towns, particularly in Dublin.  These should be balanced by similar advancements in rural Ireland.  The sooner the decentralisation of State services, for which the Minister is providing money, is implemented, the better it will be for the country.  I am sure the Minister will ensure that moneys are made available for rural planning, to ensure that there is a continuation of employment opportunities and that old peoples' homes are provided not only in the cities but in the rural areas also.</P>
    <P>I should like again to impress on the Minister the necessity of easing the burden of heavy electricity installation costs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I should like to assure the Minister that it has my full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for the manner in which they received the Bill. There was universal welcome for the <Col N="44" /> increase in the limit on the size of the fund because of the social objectives for which the money in the fund is used.</P>
      <P>We heard a number of statements from the Opposition which were, to say the least, misleading.  I would like to think that it was simply due to innocence or ignorance on their part, but I suspect that some of the statements were not truthful and rather were due to an ill disposition.  The suggestion that the Land Registry had been asked to slow up registration of titles is about the silliest of all the statements made, because any person who knows anything about land registration knows that the Land Registry do not become involved until such time as the cash has passed and the deed completed.  When the deed is signed, sealed and delivered then the Land Registry come into the process.  It is only the registration of the deal that has already taken place which concerns the Land Registry.  The fact that that mischievous statement was made is an indication that, as I say, some of us were not well disposed towards having the true position revealed. There have been delays for years in the Land Registry due, I am sorry to say, to serious neglect in the provision of accommodation and equipment required there.  That legacy, which we are trying to correct, is a legacy left to us by the last administration. No delay in the Land Registry today however would in any way hold up the issuing of money from the Local Loans Fund.  Therefore they will want to dream up some better excuse than that.  That one certainly will not wash.</P>
      <P>The suggestion has been made by several Senators, including Senator Lenihan, that the increase which we are seeking in the statutory limit of the Local Loans Fund is attributable to inflation.  That of course is not so.  The increase in the cost of living since the Local Loans Fund was fixed at £600 million is less than 30 per cent.  The increase which we are now seeking in the statutory limit is 66 and two-thirds. The reasons are because of the massive increases that we have paid out of the Local Loans Fund for housing, for sanitary services&mdash;all the services allied to the house building industry and the several other capital expenditures financed from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="45" /> Once again today we had the most outrageous, irresponsible and unfair statements being made about the building societies.  The building society situation is very healthy indeed and they are paying out more money and giving more approvals this year than were given last year.  For the April-June period, 1973, building society approvals were £6.7 million.  This year, 1974, they are £10.7 million.  In July-September, 1973, building society approvals were £8.8 million and in 1974 that was increased to £10.5 million.</P>
    <P>What has happened is that there has been such a massive growth in the number of houses being provided that the building societies share has slipped back because the main injection of money for this massive housing drive has come from the Exchequer.  Consequently, the building societies' share is reduced but the moneys they are paying out are, I am glad to say, increasing.</P>
    <P>In 1972-73, for instance, building societies carried 73 per cent of the loans approved.  The local authority schemes at that time represented only 18 per cent and insurance companies 9 per cent.  In 1974 the situation was changed, in that building societies are now carrying only 41 per cent of the cost of housing, the Exchequer is carrying 50 per cent, instead of the 18 per cent which was being paid two years ago, and the insurance companies situation has remained in or about the same.  There is, I am glad to say, some slight improvement in the share being carried by insurance companies and we are hopeful that this will be further increased.  The loan payments in the 1972-73 financial year were £61.2 million.  Last year they were £77.8 million and this year, on an annualised basis, it will be £87 million, all of which shows the most significant and remarkable growth of money for housing purposes.</P>
    <P>The use to which that money has been put is reflected in the large number of houses being provided.  The output of houses is now 9,000 per annum more than it was two years ago and, as is common knowledge, there has been a most significant increase in the provision of local authority houses in particular.</P>
    <P>This has not been easy.  We never <Col N="46" /> pretended in Government that money is easy to come by.  Nobody but a fool thinks that money is plentiful or cheap, particularly at present.  Notwithstanding these immense difficulties that we have had, we have provided the money and it is because of that we are now in a position that the Local Loans Fund will be exhausted in the first quarter of 1975. That is why we must get this additional limit, so that the level at which we have provided the money may be maintained in the years to come.</P>
    <P>Several Senators asked for an increase in the loan limits and also for an increase in the income limits of persons applying for SDA loans.  Of course, the granting of either of those would cost more money but when resources are insufficient to meet the demands upon them, the Government consider that those with the first claim are the people with the smallest incomes.  Until their wants are satisfied we would not be justified in raising the limits of loans or incomes.  It is interesting that the average loan sought is well below the present limit which indicates that while it might not satisfy the wishes of all house applicants who may have standards of housing in mind higher than the average person, the fact that the loans issued are below the limits is an indication that the limits are not unfair and are not tailored to the market.</P>
    <P>Some figures may be of interest here. In 1972 the average wage was £29.88 per week.  At that time the SDA income limit was £34.50 per week.  Now the average wage is £38.56 per week and the SDA income limit is £45 per week. So that the income limit for SDA purposes is well above the average wage. What is particularly important to remember is that the certificates of income are based upon the applicant's earnings in the previous 12 months so that, although the limit is at a particular figure, that does not relate to what the person is currently earning.  It is what the person earned over the last year. When, as in this year, incomes have risen considerably, 25 per cent and more, we are in a situation in which people now qualify for loans for SDA purposes based upon what their incomes were a year ago.  That is something which is often overlooked when people <Col N="47" /> are applying pressures for increases in the income limits.</P>
    <P>I want, having said that, to assure the House that the Government are very concerned about maintaining realistic limits and we will not permit a situation to develop, such as developed under our predecessors, where the income limits get out of line with current wages. We want the scheme to operate in a realistic fashion.  The substantial increases which we have given, both in income limits and in the loan limits, is an indication of how we have met this requirement.</P>
    <P>Two years ago the capital programme of expenditure on SDA loans was £9.2 million which was even less than was paid out in 1970-71.  It was £9.53 million in 1970-71, £8.63 million in 1971-72 and it was £9.20 million in 1972-73.  In our first year of Government we jumped it up to £20.74 million and currently it is at £35.20 million, indicating a very massive increase in the SDA fund. That has been done at a time when the building societies situation has not shown the same growth as it did in earlier periods.  I want to emphasise again that there is no contraction of the building societies fund except that it has not kept pace with the increased demand which is being made for housing finance because of the very substantial increase in the housing output.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell made a plea for additional money for harbours.  I would not wish to debate with him the correct procedures for financing harbour works nor indeed would I think it appropriate to discuss on this Bill the general policy and administrative measures necessary to improve our harbours but for his information I should like to record that the amount of money allocated for harbour work in the current period, 1974-75, is £500,000.  Out of the total money allocated already from the Local Loans Fund a mere 0.6 per cent of the total amount was spent on harbours so I can understand Senator Russell's disappointment that it has not been more.</P>
    <P>Members may find the percentages of interest.  The Local Loans Fund resources have been allocated in the <Col N="48" /> following percentages since the fund was created: local authority housing 49.2; house purchase loans 21.9; local authority supplementary grants 5.7; Gaeltacht housing, a very small fraction, I have not got the exact figure; total for housing 76.8; sanitary services 13.9; vocational schools 3.9; health services 3.8; harbours 0.6 and other services 1.0.  I will return in a moment to the question Senator Horgan posed about vocational schools and also the question posed by others about hospitals.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan referred to the subsidies which the State pays.  He is quite right to remind people of the tremendous subsidies which the State provides against interest charges, because at a time when the State has to borrow at 12½ to 16 per cent the State is providing an extremely generous subsidy by making money available from the Local Loans Fund at 10 per cent.  It is almost a giveaway to be providing funds at that rate.  On top of that, we have to bear in mind that a very large number of people who receive loans through the mechanism of the Local Loans Fund are themselves income tax payers and they receive a further subsidy by reason of being able to set off the interest paid against their tax liability.  So the real rate of borrowing from the Local Loans Fund is 7 per cent or even less at a time when the normal lending rate could vary from 15 to 20 per cent.  The person who is borrowing for housing today is really enjoying a bargain.</P>
    <P>This is not to make light of the burden it is on any family who recently acquired a house to meet the housing outgoings which can, of course, represent a very considerable portion of the family income.  In the long run, house purchasers are very fortunate indeed because they are borrowing at a mere fraction of the current rate of interest; they are investing in an asset which is increasing in value at a rate much faster than the rate of inflation.  At the time of enduring pain, it is not easy to look forward to comfort and pleasure.</P>
    <P>On the complaint about the inadequacy of money for hospitals and vocational schools, I should like to point out that the Local Loans Fund is <Col N="49" /> only one of the sources of providing money for these services.  In the case of hospitals, only £2.8 million out of £10 million expenditure on hospitals this year came from the Local Loans Fund. The remainder of the money came from the Hospitals Trust Fund and from voted capital moneys&mdash;moneys which are voted direct rather than being processed through the Local Loans Fund. Of the £20 million being spent this year on schools and university buildings, only £1 million of the capital involved is being paid out of the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>It is only one of the mechanisms and it would be wrong for anybody to think that the figures I reported here today represented the total of the State's investment in these most important fields.  I support entirely the views expressed by Senators about the importance of money for schools and hospitals. They may be assured that these will get the Government's priority consideration at all times&mdash;even in times when money is hard to come by and is extremely costly.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Senators McGlinchey and Horgan to explain how the fund works.  It is important to remember that 76 per cent of the total fund is in respect of housing.  A great deal of that is in respect of house purchase loans and supplementary grants.  The process is a very simple one because the money is made available in a block grant to the local authorities, and they administer the schemes.</P>
    <P>In relation to other activities, the consideration of applications for and the approval of loans from the fund is the function of the Minister for Finance. The fund is actually administered by the Office of Public Works which control the issue of moneys from the fund within the limits which are set down by the Minister for Finance.  At the beginning of each year the Department of Finance notify the Office of Public Works of the amounts which can be drawn from the fund during the year for each service.  Then the Office of Public Works ensure that the guidelines are respected and that no drawing exceeds the authorised amount.</P>
    <P>The local authorities do not themselves <Col N="50" /> apply directly to the fund for loans.  Instead, any local authority, education authority and so on which require loan finance for a scheme approach the appropriate Department. The procedures are handled by the Departments down the line and not by the Department of Finance as such. Unfortunately this can be time consuming. It is the most time consuming stage of the whole process because the average time taken by the Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works to handle applications for loans is about a fortnight.  In many cases it is less.  The detailed work has been done long before the application for the global sum reaches the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senators will appreciate how long it may take to agree in principle to a loan and then to all the details like planning, the preparation of contract documents, the issuing of tenders, the examination of tenders and so on.  All that is done before it ever reaches the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I will bring to the attention of the Ministers concerned the complaints that have been made here about delays in the processing of applications for money which ultimately comes from this fund.  We would not wish any unnecessary delays to arise.</P>
    <P>I assure Senator Horgan that the Government greatly value the idea of decentralisation, of conferring on local authorities greater autonomy than they had previously enjoyed.  In fact the Minister for Local Government is taking a number of steps in this field to cut out the duplication of work which previously was necessary.  In so far as that can be done without offending against good financial control, it will be done.  There have been occasions in the past where the exercise of good financial control has often meant that the cost of administration has increased because the costs are greater than when the good idea was first conceived.  I would prefer to see a good idea carried through to fruition rather than have it spoiled because costs arose during the handling of details which unfortunately are necessary, but sometimes you cao save money by cutting corners.  If duplication can be avoided, Senatsur <Col N="51" /> can be assured that it will be the Government's objective.</P>
    <P>At one time it was necessary for local authorities to enter into a mortgage with the State for any moneys received from the Local Loans Fund.  I am glad to say that all these complex procedures were removed by the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1961.  Nowadays there is a fairly simple undertaking drafted by the Office of Public Works in consultation with the applicant.  It is on the basis of such an undertaking that the money is issued.</P>
    <P>Senator McGlinchey asked that the maximum rate of interest charged by the State on loans from the fund should be no more than 5 per cent.  For reasons I pointed out earlier, this would be most unreasonable.  It would mean an Exchequer subsidy of 10 to 12 per cent on all moneys advanced.  I do not think one could in conscience support an Exchequer subsidy of that dimension. There is a great deal to be said for charging the full cost of money at any particular time.  While the Minister for Finance might regard that as desirable, it would not be regarded in that light by the payers.  It is something which controls the supply of money.  If the going cost is not paid by the beneficiaries of loans, it must be paid for by somebody else.  The Exchequer is no more than what exists in the common pool. If there is not enough in that pool it is not possible to provide the kind of bonanza that would be given to people if the interest rate was 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey asked for increased expenditure on what he regarded as useful services such as fire stations and so on.  The Government realise the need for more expenditure in these neglected fields and this is reflected in the fact that we have increased by 70 per cent the amount expended on these items in a two year period.  The amount has risen from £0.66 million in 1972-73 to £1.12 million in 1974-75.</P>
    <P>I trust I have dealt with most of the points raised in the debate.  If there has been any significant omission on my part, I assure Senators that I will communicate with them directly.  The fund needs to be increased so that we can maintain the pace of public capital <Col N="52" /> expenditure, which is a desirable thing at any time.  At a time when there are passing difficulties in the private sector we see a great need to maintain an adequate level of expenditure in the public sector.  The facilities sought in this Bill will ensure that this is done and I am grateful to the House for the way in which it has been received.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just one brief question to ask the Minister.  I am very grateful for his very full reply on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>Section 1 is a deceptively simple section.  It is an enabling section and the simplest thing about it is the sum mentioned, £1,000 million.  Is the Minister really satisfied that the statutory arrangements for transactions of this magnitude between local and central authorities are, at this point in time, adequate?  As the Minister pointed out, when the scheme was initiated in 1935, the limit was £5 million.</P>
      <P>Although he did not give us the information about the percentage of local government capital expenditure represented by £5 million, it is fairly obvious that at that time the scheme was intended as a sort of deficit financing for local government capital expenditure. We now have the situation that we are told that in 1973-74 the Local Loans Fund met more than 90 per cent of local authority capital expenditure. So we have a situation in which the relationship between the fund and the local authorities has been completely reversed.  We have put a 500 horse power engine into a Model T Ford and we are still driving it down the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister accept that there has been, if only by erosion, a major change in the financial relationship between the central authority and the <Col N="53" /> local authority in matters covered by this Bill?  Is he satisfied that the statutory arrangements which were originally devised in 1935 to cover the situation then express the reality of it any longer?</P>

      <P>When the fund was established in 1935 a number of those bodies were able themselves to go on the money market to obtain their own finances.  Since then the scene has changed considerably. On that account there is certainly a greater need to resort to the Local Loans Fund than previously.  The 1961 Act, which I mentioned earlier, improved the working arrangements and removed some of the legal restrictions which were unnecessary.  Much simpler procedures have since been adopted.  I am not aware that there are any working difficulties now in the operation of the scheme but if there are, we will not hesitate to remedy them.  If we were to authorise local authorities to enter the money market in an endeavour to collect money we would have to consider what effect that might have on the capacity of the State to borrow.  It would be no great harm if they could do it directly rather than have the State do it and then hand the money out.  In the present position of the money market it is obviously an impossible thing to conceive because even the State has considerable difficulty in borrowing.</P>

There is no inclination at the moment in any of the European money markets to lend money to local authorities, so for some time to come it is more than probable that the Local Loans Fund will be the only machinery whereby this capital can be provided, other than such small amounts as local authorities themselves directly negotiate with insurance companies and banks.</P>

      <P>The question that raised itself in my mind when I made this point was that different countries have different traditions.  In Britain, for <Col N="54" /> example, when it comes to the raising of finance by local authorities specifically for education there is a tradition there that a substantially greater proportion of funds is raised locally by means of rates.  This is also controlled locally.</P>
      <P>This is not the case here, because a ceiling has been put on the amount of money which may be raised by local authorities by way of rates for purposes such as this.  While I should hate to be pilloried by the Press for advocating that rates should be raised, I was wondering whether, apart from the money market method of obtaining funds, the Minister might occasionally think in terms of allowing local authorities greater flexibility in this area, transferring some of the taxation from a central basis to a local basis with all the beneficial advantages for autonomy and self-management this implies.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am grateful to the Seanad for providing an opportunity to debate the proposals in this Bill and the issues which underlie it.  I am also grateful to the Minister for being present during the debate.  I hope to have the support of the Seanad for the changes in the law contained in this Bill.  I hope they will approach it as an important social issue and not as a party political issue; not as something which would divide parties as such but something which each Senator can examine on its merits <Col N="55" /> and on which each Senator can come to a decision.  I hope that if there is a vote on the Bill it will be a free vote. The nature of the subject matter would suggest that this would be the appropriate way in which the Seanad should approach the proposals contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, since the Bill was published last May I have had a very interesting feed-back on its contents.  I have had many constructive suggestions relating to it.  I am of the opinion that it could certainly be improved on Committee Stage, particularly the provisions relating to the property rights of an illegitimate child.  It is important for us to remember that what we are debating is the principle of changing the law relating to illegitimate children, of improving their status under Irish law, of giving them some equality with children born in wedlock.  We are not judging this Bill on every last dot and comma of it.  If the principles are accepted then or at Committee Stage I would be open to bringing in amendments. I would also welcome any suggested amendments proposed by individual Senators.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the indulgence of the House in speaking at some length on this matter.  It is important when a social issue of this sort comes before us to examine it in detail.  The opportunities are not all that frequent for the assessment of something like the subject matter before us now, an assessment of the status of illegitimate children, of their position under our law; and for consideration of positive proposals to change that situation and to improve that status.</P>
    <P>The first issue, I believe, is a constitutional one.  It derives from the failure of our laws at present to live up to the constitutional guarantees and, in particular, the guarantee contained in Article 40.1. of the Constitution that &ldquo;all citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.&rdquo; Children born out of wedlock are not equal before the law.  Children born out of wedlock are discriminated against in that they do not have succession rights to their father's property; in that their family relationship is not given full <Col N="56" /> recognition and protection, and in that they are burdened with the social stigma implied in being called illegitimate.</P>
    <P>It was a matter of great regret to the proposers of this Bill that we had to call it by such an ugly title.  We had to call it the Illegitimate Children (Maintenance and Succession) Bill, 1974, because to have tried to change the title, to depart from the concept of illegitimacy, would involve a much more extensive change in legislation which was not within our resources as Private Members.  It was not possible.  I hope that, when a major Children's Act is brought in by the Government, one of the purposes of that Act will be to remove any difference in status between the legitimate and illegitimate child so that the word &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; will disappear from our language.</P>
    <P>That is the first constitutional issue posed by Article 40, which guarantees that all citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law, and the fact that our laws do not hold illegitimate children equal.</P>
    <P>There is another provision of the Constitution which is a little less known but which is of extreme importance during a debate in the Dáil or Seanad on the question of changing the law.  I refer to the article of the Constitution which is directed to the Houses of the Oireachtas&mdash;Article 45 on the directive principles of social policy provides guidelines for the Oireachtas enacting legislation.  These provisions guide us in bringing into force legislation within the spirit and terms of the other articles of the Constitution which are binding and which are recognisable by the courts. I refer in particular to Article 45, section 1, which provides:</P>
    <P>The State shall strive to promote the welfare of the whole people by securing and protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice and charity shall inform all the institutions of the national life.</P>
    <P>I would submit that, in so far as we have created a status of illegitimacy, in so far as it is a stigma on innocent children when born, that is not a social order which reflects either justice or charity.  It is indeed a most inhumane, unfair and unjust social order which <Col N="57" /> we must not lose any time in correcting and changing.</P>
    <P>We have a fundamental obligation to remove the existing legal and social discriminations.  We must also compensate for past failure by taking positive measures to help the single mother who is coping with the financial and social burdens felt by any single parent bringing up children in society.  The Government have the primary responsibility, to which they have not yet fully faced up, to remove legal discriminations.  But we all have a responsibility&mdash;and, in particular, we, the Members of the Seanad, in considering a proposal to change a law of this sort, have a responsibility&mdash;to examine our existing prejudices and to change our attitude towards these children and their mothers.  Instead of isolating the single mother and branding her as guilty of misconduct, the community should take positive measures to assist her in her dual responsibility and to anticipate her social needs and those of her child or children.  Fathers should be encouraged to acknowledge their children without fear of becoming social outcasts themselves; and in cases where the father is not identifiable the local community in which the single mother and her child or children live should be concerned to ensure that the particular child has a balanced relationship with other adults and children living in that community to compensate for the absence of the second natural parent.  It will require conscious and sustained effort by us as a people to remedy the injustice caused by years of discrimination and neglect.  I would submit that the leadership in this can and should come from the Seanad in accepting the principles underlying this Bill and in passing it on to a further Committee Stage for examination of its detailed provisions.</P>
    <P>In looking at the concept of illegitimacy it is sad to see that Irish law is much more backward than other jurisdictions whose general common law we have inherited.  In particular I would refer here to the United Kingdom, but I would also refer to other jurisdictions which are directly comparable such as Australia or New Zealand.  Under Irish law the illegitimate child is marked out <Col N="58" /> by a number of discriminatory rules.  He is in theory the child of no one&mdash;the <i>filius nullius</i> of the common law.  I would like here to refer very briefly to the effect of that.  I am quoting from H.K. Bevan's <i>Law relating to Children.</i> In the paragraph on illegitimacy relating to disposition of property Mr. Bevan states:</P>
    <P>One of the consequences of the common law treatment of the bastard as <i>filius nullius</i> was the rule of construction that <i>prima facie</i> any reference in an instrument to &ldquo;children&rdquo;, &ldquo;issue&rdquo; and the like was exclusively to those who were legitimate, and, although it was a presumptive and not an absolute rule, it was not easily disturbed.</P>
    <P>Then he goes on to show in what way the law was changed in England by the Family Law Reform Act of 1969.  He examines the position on intestacy under the Family Law Reform Act and says:</P>
    <P>Prior to the Family Law Reform Act, 1969, the limits of recognition accorded to the illegitimate child by the law of intestate succession were that he and his issue were entitled to succeed on the intestacy of his mother provided that she left no legitimate issue, and she was entitled to succeed on his intestacy as if he were the only surviving parent.  The Act of 1969 is a significant event in the legal emancipation of the illegitimate child, because it enables him or, if he is dead, his issue, to succeed on the intestacy of either of his parents as if he were their legitimate child.  Correspondingly, each of them has a right of succession on his intestacy if they survive him.</P>
    <P>That is a directly comparable jurisdiction where the law has been changed without any serious disruption of social attitudes, without any great trauma. Justice has been rendered in the circumstances, or at least partial justice has been rendered.  In Ireland, alas, we are far from this stage.  As far as the rights of the illegitimate child are concerned, they are still governed by the provisions of the Legitimacy Act, 1931, section 9 of which gives the illegitimate child in Ireland the only right it has and, as we <Col N="59" /> see, a very limited right to any succession to property.  Section 9, subsection (1), provides:</P>
    <P>Where, after the commencement of this Act, the mother of an illegitimate child, such child not being a legitimated person, dies intestate as respects all or any of her real or personal property and does not leave any legitimate issue her surviving, the illegitimate child or if he is dead, his issue shall be entitled to take any interest therein to which he or such issue would have been entitled if he had been born legitimate.</P>
    <P>The next subsection gives the mother a corresponding right to inherit from her illegitimate child.  The illegitimate child has a limited right to inherit on intestacy from his mother provided there are not other legitimate issues.  If the mother married somebody and had legitimate issue then presumably her illegitimate children would be excluded on intestacy. Their very limited statutory right would be removed.  So the right to property, as far as it exists, is a very minimal right of intestate succession to the mother, with no right of property either intestate or in any other way to the father.</P>
    <P>The right of support during the young life of the illegitimate child is curtailed by very restrictive affiliation proceedings, and this is one of the matters which we are trying to amend in this Bill.  The fact that the affiliation proceedings must be brought in the first six months after the child is born in practice means that virtually no affiliation proceedings are brought.  In that first six months the single mother is preoccupied with the emotional involvement with her baby.  She is probably not well advised.  She may be wanting to marry the father and not take a lawsuit against him.  For various reasons the affiliation legislation is ineffective because of the arbitrary and unfair time limit.  Similarly, section 117 of the Succession Act, 1969, which has given certain rights to children who were cut off in their parents' will, does not appear to give any right to the illegitimate child to come into the court and say that the parent has not acted as a prudent parent and has wrongfully and <Col N="60" /> unfairly excluded that child by willing the property elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It would even appear that there is a trend in constitutional cases towards a narrow definition of family rights by defining the family in this context as a married family.  I think it would be very regrettable if there was a combination of quite different sections of the Constitution in order to provide that the family, in so far as constitutional family rights are concerned, was only the married family.  I myself, in looking at the relevant provisions, cannot follow the line of reasoning which appears to draw this conclusion, and I question the social value of it.  I also question the constitutional equity of it.</P>
    <P>Having examined what is meant by illegitimacy, we might ask where does the concept come from?  How did we get such a concept in our law?  The system of discrimination based on a concept of illegitimacy was influenced by the Canon Law, and it was through the Canon Law that it became part of the common law, and then was inherited by us as part of our legal system.  The object of the Canon Law in having very strict rules about legitimacy was to discourage fornication and adultery. What might be questioned now, in modern terms, is the logic of trying to prevent fornication and adultery by means of victimising and penalising the innocent offspring of a relationship outside marriage.  I would submit that there is no justification either in law or in church principles for this attitude.  It was the Canon Law which influenced the English common law and, whereas in England they have changed by statute the harsh effect of the common law, we retain it in all its purity, in all its harshness and in all its discriminatory aspects.</P>
    <P>The moral basis of the Canon and common law attitude to illegitimacy is not at all easy to understand.  If the intention was to discourage promiscuity among adults then, as I say, this appears to be a very strange way of going about it by vesting all the penalty and all the discrimination in innocent children. This situation becomes even more unfair and even more absurd when it is realised that the activities to be discouraged, fornication and adultery, are not themselves criminal.  They are not <Col N="61" /> criminal offences under our criminal code, but we victimise, we discriminate against, and we exclude from the normal rights of a child, any offspring of such relationship.  This offends against one of the most basic principles of law, that one person should not have to suffer for the activity or conduct of another; and how much more serious that is when the person who suffers for the activity or conduct of another is an innocent child.  How could we possibly say that we are carrying out the directives of social policy, that we have a system which is imbued with justice and charity, when we penalise and victimise innocent children for conduct which happens before their birth and over which they could have had no control, and for which they, for the rest of their lives, suffer?</P>
    <P>It was argued in support of having a concept of illegitimacy that not to have such an attitude would encourage promiscuity&mdash;that otherwise people would be promiscuous.  There is a false assumption here.  There is an assumption that all relationships outside marriage are, by definition, promiscuous. This is insulting, inaccurate and very wrong.  It is something which I have noticed in debates in relation to another matter which unfortunately did not get a First Reading in the House earlier this afternoon.  There is a tendency automatically to characterise relationships outside marriage as promiscuous. This shows a complete lack of understanding of the term &ldquo;promiscuity&rdquo; and, as I say, it is also an insult to the many serious lasting relationships between parties which are not based on a formal marriage.  Not all illegitimate children by any means are the product of a promiscuous relationship; and moreover&mdash;and this is the real argument&mdash;the statistics, and I will quote some of these statistics, show that the legal disabilities affecting illegitimacy do not affect at all the illegitimacy rate.  The illegitimacy rate has increased, and it is increasing more sharply in this country, despite the disabilities, so there is no deterrent value in the concept of illegitimacy.  It does not have this affect.  As I say, I will have some figures to quote on that.</P>
    <P>Another argument that is put forward for maintaining a different status for <Col N="62" /> and the stigma of illegitimacy is that to give the illegitimate child rights of succession in relation to the child's natural father would frustrate the legitimate expectations of the father's lawful wife and of the legitimate children that he might have.  At first that appears to be a very significant argument; but I think that it fails to balance the legitimate expectation of the child born outside wedlock, the reasonable expectations that his father will make suitable provision for him during his life and also that the father will provide some of his property after death in the same way as he would provide for his children born in wedlock. There is this reasonable expectation of the child born outside wedlock in those circumstances.  What is necessary is a balanced appraisal of different rights and not the present totally one-sided, totally discriminatory, totally unjust situation which excludes the illegitimate child.</P>
    <P>Once again one can point to the many jurisdictions, both common law jurisdictions and civil law jurisdictions, which have gone ahead and made the necessary changes so that there is no longer an exclusion of illegitimate children from the right to inherit.  I would point to the Family Law Reform Act, 1969, in the United Kingdom, and also a statute in New Zealand, the Status of Children Act of 1969, which was entitled &ldquo;an Act to Remove the Legal Disabilities of Children Born Out of Wedlock&rdquo;.  Similarly, other jurisdictions have followed, and it is time that we, with our well known preoccupation and general concern for family life and for children, examined the situation and amended our law in that respect.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the support from the natural father of the child during the child's young years in this country is largely a fiction because of the arbitrary time limit attached to affiliation proceedings. What we would propose to do in the Bill before the House is to abolish any time limit on the bringing of affiliation proceedings.  We do so because we regard it as a matter of principle.  The child born out of wedlock has a right to support during his young years from his father.  This is not a penal matter.  This is not something <Col N="63" /> that the father has to be confronted with in some penal way.  It is a right on which it is wrong to put a time limit.  It is wrong that the time limit be six months, as it is at present.  It is wrong that it be three years, as it is in England and some other jurisdictions.  There should be no time limit and only the very obvious practical limit of the period during which proof of paternity can be established.  If the matter has to come before the court&mdash;if the natural father in the circumstances has not admitted paternity&mdash;then the true determinant in the case will be the question of being able to establish paternity.</P>
    <P>Apart from that very important question of principle, I believe that there are important practical reasons why there should not be any time limit on the bringing of affiliation proceedings. It would be possible to envisage circumstances where the single mother had a good job and had decided to keep her child born out of wedlock but did not see any particular need to bring affiliation proceedings against the father in the circumstances in which she was supporting the child.  But if she lost her job, if she became ill, if she became insane, if she became in any way incapable of supporting that child, then why should the Legislature have prevented that child, or any child, from having the right of support from its father?  Why do we see any logic or any reason or any public interest in putting in an arbitrary time limit to cut off the right of a child?  I believe that the right of a child is a continuing one and that it should remain enforceable throughout the child's dependency.</P>
    <P>Another amendment which we have proposed in this Bill is that the period of dependency be one in which the child is in continuing education.  Under the Act we are amending the cut-off period is 16 years.  At the present time, particularly with the greater availability of university and other scholarships, it is very likely that a child will be or can be in continuing education for a longer period.  Just as other children have a right to the support of their parents, so the illegitimate should have the right to the support of their parents in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> There are many substantial and major crucial criticisms to be made of the concept of illegitimacy.  It is easy to point to injustice and to the hardships which it causes on children of this country.  The present situation is summed up very well by Mr. William Duncan, a lecturer in family law in Trinity College, who delivered one of the papers at a recent conference organised by CHERISH, about which I will say a little more later.  He summed up the position very accurately when he said:</P>
    <P>What stands in the way of reform is not rational argument but a public prejudice against illegitimate children based on centuries of unquestioning discrimination.  This prejudice, combined with Governmental inertia, has resulted in Ireland remaining a member of that increasingly exclusive club of nations which persist in the persecution of innocent children.</P>
    <P>That may sound harsh but I would submit that if a person examines the position, he will find it is fair and accurate enough.  This is something about which we cannot remain content. We must take very significant steps to remedy this state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I want now to fill in the background a little about the position of illegitimate children in Ireland.  In doing so, I would like to express gratitude and pay tribute to the organisation, CHERISH. This organisation was founded about 18 months ago by a group of single mothers.  They came together in order to try to create public awareness of the status of illegitimate children, to fight for the rights of their children, to try to get changes in the law, to try to get them recognised, first of all as a category for the purpose of social welfare benefits&mdash;which was achieved in the Social Welfare Act of 1973&mdash;and also to remove other legal discriminations. They formed themselves into a limited company.  They had meetings, and on the 26th October of this year they organised a very successful conference in Dun Laoghaire.  The Minister was present and, indeed, opened that conference.  Unfortunately he was not able to remain for the proceedings, for the papers or discussions; but these papers and a summary of the discussions <Col N="65" /> will be published.  They will provide very important evidence of the position of illegitimate children and the very sharp discriminations which exist.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to one of these papers delivered by Dr. Dermot Walsh of the Medico-Social Research Board, which gives a more accurate and a less emotional picture than any words.  He gives the statistical pattern relating to illegitimacy in Ireland.  I find the figures which he quotes more chilling than any eloquence, or any descriptive words, that could be used in this House or, indeed, in any forum in Ireland.  I quote from his paper entitled &ldquo;The Unmarried Mother and her Child in Ireland&rdquo;.  The position in Ireland today is dealt with under a side heading &ldquo;The Facts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The number of illegitimate births in this country has risen steadily since 1959 and by 1971 had reached 1,842 births.  In effect the number of illegitimate births in Ireland has roughly doubled between 1961 and 1971, and the illegitimate birth rate per 1,000 single and widowed women now stands at 6.3 as against 3.3 in 1961. This represents 2.6 per cent of total births in 1971.  In 1971 there were a further 1,510 illegitimate births to Irish-born women in the UK, but we do not know the length of residence in the UK of those mothers and accordingly we cannot state how many of the conceptions leading to those births occurred in Ireland.  There are no comparative data on illegitimate births in Britain by mothers' birthplace in 1961. Additionally, in 1971 there were 577 legally induced abortions on women giving the Irish Republic as their usual residence.  By 1972 the number of terminations had doubled to almost a thousand, and it is interesting when one reflects that the rate of te mination of pregnancy among women who gave their normal place of residence as the Irish Republic in the age group 25 29 almost equalled the number of live births to unmarried Irish women in Ireland in that same age group.  Put another way, of all conceptions to Irish unmarried in the 25-29 age group not ending in spontaneous abortion and <Col N="66" /> not leading to birth outside the country, 43% were terminated in England, a remarkably high proportion compared with only 29% of English unmarried pregnancies in the same age group.</P>
    <P>The data then presented in this paragraph indicate clearly that there has been a doubling of the illegitimate fertility, a recourse to legal termination of pregnancy in Britain with the introduction of 1967 Abortion Act, and the inevitable conclusion since conception is the consequence of sexual activity that there has been a considerable rise in extramarital or pre-marital sexual activity in this country.  Therefore the problem of the unmarried mother and her child is one that is now twice as great as it was in 1961, and the question arises whether the measures to cope with it have been doubled in this decennium, making the unlikely supposition that they were adequate then.</P>
    <P>I think these are very chilling statistics when one compares the number of Irish unmarried mothers or pregnant girls in the 25-29 age group&mdash;a considerably higher number of whom get an abortion in England than their English equivalent in the same age group.  These are very startling figures indeed.  I submit that this is something we cannot sweep under the carpet and say it does not happen.  We must face up to it.  The facts which I have quoted and the further material contained in that paper by Dr. Dermot Walsh certainly show that the deterrent penal stigma of illegitimacy does not affect the illegitimacy rate.  We cannot take the old Canon Law and later common law idea that if you make it a stigma if a child is born out of wedlock you might deter somebody from relationships outside marriage.  This is nonsense and can be shown empirically by statistics to be nonsense.  There is not even that, to my view, very suspect argument in favour of a status of illegitimacy.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to remarks at another meeting held in Ireland, this time in Limerick&mdash;a conference on adoption, on aspects of adoption, held in Limerick in April, 1974.  At that conference, Miss Jane <Col N="67" /> Rowe, director of the ABAA in England, read a paper entitled &ldquo;The Mother's decision and the Child's Welfare&rdquo;.  I would like, if I may, to put on the record of the Seanad the riddle with which she commenced her paper because I think it is worth perpetuating.</P>
    <P>I'd like to start this evening by asking you a riddle.  &ldquo;What can't be avoided and lasts a life time; shouldn't be delayed but mustn't be hurried; can never be entirely right, but ruins lives when wrong?&rdquo; I am sure you have no difficulty in recognising the answer as the mother's decision about her out-of-wedlock child.</P>
    <P>This is a terrible decision the single mother has to make: what is to be the future of her child?  Will she retain the child herself, and what is the situation if she does?  Will she place the child in adoption?  Will she place it in fosterage? Her decision is very important because, no matter what decision she makes, she can never totally right the situation.</P>
    <P>At page nine of this booklet from which I am quoting, called <i>Aspects of Adoption, Some Basic Principles</i>, Miss Rowe looks at the unmarried parents and what we know about them.  This is important because undoubtedly we have to admit that, despite the occasional conference organised either by CHERISH or other voluntary bodies, we do not have in this area the sort of social statistics which would help us come to a proper appraisal of the position.  To some extent we can and should rely on better statistical material, better social studies and better research in another jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Miss Rowe says:</P>
    <P>Studies done in the past two or three decades have shown how impossible it is to categorise unmarried mothers or the men by whom they become pregnant.  About the only thing they have in common is the out-of-wedlock pregnancy! These parents are of all ages, all social classes, all degrees of intelligence&mdash;or lack of it.  They vary from perfectly normal people who have got themselves into difficulties to deeply disturbed individuals driven into self <Col N="68" /> destructive situations by their own unconscious needs.</P>
    <P>It is well to remember that social workers see only a proportion of unmarried mothers and a tiny minority of unmarried fathers.  Those who come for help contain a disproportionate number of those with quite serious personal problems beyond those created by the pregnancy.  The others manage without the help of social agencies.</P>
    <P>This is a very valid point.  Those who come to social welfare for help are actually the ones with problems which may not in fact be totally related to the pregnancy but may have deeper personal problems.</P>
    <P>Then Miss Rowe goes on to give brief evidence of an extremely important study carried out in Britain.  She says:</P>
    <P>The National Child Development Study being carried out in England is a fascinating longitudinal survey of a large group of children born in 1958. Special studies have been made of various sub groups including adopted children (&ldquo;Growing Up Adopted&rdquo;) and illegitimate children (&ldquo;Born Illegitimate&rdquo;).  These two books compare the children's development at the age of seven and we are all eagerly awaiting the results of further studies done when they were 11 and 15.</P>
    <P>I'd like to give you a few of the findings from &ldquo;Born Illegitimate&rdquo;.  This is the book on illegitimate children.</P>
    <P>There was no difference in the social class of mothers having legitimate or illegitimate children and no reason to expect genetic differences between the groups.  However, the illegitimate children were disadvantaged at birth on account of having had less ante natal care and suffering more birth hazards.  Thus they got off to a poor start and for most of them this was later accentuated by difficult home circumstances and an unfavourable environment.  Not surprisingly, this affected almost every aspect of their physical, intellectual and emotional development.  Illegitimate children, when compared with their legitimate peers, were shorter and lighter, worse readers, less creative <Col N="69" /> and more often maladjusted.  It was surprising and depressing to find that it did not seem to make any appreciable difference whether these children were living with their mothers alone, with both natural parents, with a step-parent or in some other family situation.  The overall picture was of a complex web of environmental hardship and deprivation which had a cumulatively disadvantageous effect.</P>
    <P>By contrast, the much smaller group of illegitimate children who had been adopted were found to have escaped the long-term effects of the disadvantages they had experienced at birth.  These had been counteracted by the very favourable environment which they had enjoyed in their adoptive families.  In virtually every respect the adopted children as a group were doing as well or better than the whole cohort and most markedly better than their fellow illegitimates.</P>
    <P>We can see that it is altogether too facile an assumption to say that the right place for a baby is always with his mother.  It may not be.  But the research findings also show that not every adoption is happy and successful. The Natural Children's Bureau Study found some very unsatisfactory placements.  It is hard to measure family &ldquo;success&rdquo; since all normal families have some problems.  But if one takes success as the absence of serious or persistent difficulties, a whole series of research studies show that approximately three-quarters of adoption placements turn out quite well.  In the remaining quarter there will be some very distressing failures causing great unhappiness to all concerned.  Adoption is never an easy solution and must be compared with major surgery, which is often necessary but never desirable in itself.</P>
    <P>These observations are the fruits of a continuing, longitudinal study on the effects on children of illegitimacy, of being placed in adoption in comparison with children who are legitimate and have not gone through this process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a powerful argument in favour of adoption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not necessarily think so.  The report goes on to say that it would be too facile to say that it is, in fact, an argument in favour of adoption and later studies point to this.  Just as it is too facile to say that the child ought always to be left with its natural mother, so is it too facile to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On these figures the balance is in favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On these particular figures the justification for that balance being in favour of adoption is the environmental hardships and hazards of the illegitimate child&mdash;and the study revealed just how disadvantaged they are.  Therefore I would agree to that extent.  But that is in existing circumstances. If one changes the circumstances and removes the environmental factors and the deprivations, then that assumption would be altogether too facile.  Illegitimacy really means that these children are less well able to read, that they are lighter, slower, that they are disadvantaged from birth.</P>
      <P>I do not want to spend too much time quoting from various submissions, although there is a great deal of useful material contained in them which should be available to the House in assessing the proposals in the Bill which we have put forward.  However, I want to quote briefly from the statement on family law reform which issued from the Council for Social Welfare, a committee of the Catholic Bishops' Conference. I may say that it gives me almost pleasure to quote a statement emanating, at least indirectly, from the Catholic Bishops and to find that it is, for once, a happy coincidence that we are in general agreed on reforms rather than in any way at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope it would give the Senator total pleasure, not just almost pleasure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me very real pleasure indeed.  I should like to quote from the relevant chapter in this report, which is an excellent and very thorough appraisal of family law.  I agree in general terms with all the proposals in it.  I would go further on some issues than this committee have been prepared to do, but it is a very welcome addition <Col N="71" /> to the lobby for change of family law in Ireland.  Chapter 6 relates to the status of a child born out of wedlock.  I remind Senators that this is the Catholic bishops in Ireland speaking.  They have done their homework and they know the position and we can learn from their conclusions.  Chapter 6 provides:</P>
      <P>6.1.  The child of an unmarried mother is considerably disadvantaged under our present legal system.  For example, the child of an unmarried mother cannot have his paternity established; he has no rights of succession against the property of his natural father, and only a limited right to succeed to the property of his mother, notwithstanding the changes introduced by the Succession Act, 1965; the law does not enforce effectually the maintenance responsibilities of putative fathers; such maintenance as the Court may award ceases when the child reaches 16 years of age.</P>
      <P>6.2.  If an unmarried mother is granted an affiliation order there are no means whereby she can require the putative father to contribute to her own upkeep and maintenance while she is rearing the child.</P>
      <P>6.3.  The Church acknowledges that there is a moral obligation on fathers to support their children whether legitimate or illegitimate.</P>
      <P>6.4.  Other countries have procedures to permit the voluntary acknowledgement of their child by a father and mother who do not intend to, or who cannot, marry.  This permits paternity to be proved and the child to be given the same status as a legitimate child.</P>
      <P>6.5.  We are concerned with the rights of all children and that they should be treated equally.  We regard it as unchristian that children born out of wedlock should, as a result of the actions of their parents, be victimised by legal distinctions between them and children born to married parents.  Consequently, we wish to urge that the legal disabilities imposed on these children should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> Then they go on to list their recommendations and these too I should like to put on the record of the House:</P>
    <P>6.5.1.  We would recommend that&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  There should be no distinction between children before the law;</P>
    <P>2.  The law be amended to allow voluntary acknowledgement of a child born out of wedlock.  It is considered that power to object to such an acknowledgement should be given to the spouse of either parent;</P>
    <P>3.  Children born out of wedlock be given rights of succession;</P>
    <P>4.  Provisions be enacted whereby the single mother could formally recognise her child so that if she were to marry a man other than the father of the child, that child would have equal rights of succession to her property with any legitimate children the couple might have.  This equates the position of a child born out of wedlock to that of a step-child;</P>
    <P>5.  The procedure of voluntary acknowledgement should be extended to the wife who has an extra-marital child;</P>
    <P>6.  Children of a void or voidable marriage should not be bastardised but should continue to be regarded as legitimate offspring of the parties following a decree of nullity;</P>
    <P>7.  The Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Order) Act, 1930 be amended in the following respects:</P>
    <P>(a)  The time limit during which a mother may bring affiliation proceedings against the father of her child should be extended from 6 months to 3 years;</P>
    <P>(b)  Maintenance in respect of the child should continue until he has finished full-time education and not cease, as at present, at 16 years;</P>
    <P>(c)  Consideration be given to the introduction of genetic testing to establish paternity. Such tests have now become so sophisticated that the margin of error is minimal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> That is the assessment by the Catholic Hierarchy of the existing law relating to illegitimate children and those are the recommendations for reform.  The precise recommendations do not go as far as the statement of principle that children should be treated equally.  It is not equal, for example, to continue a three year time limit on affiliation proceedings or to allow a spouse to object.  These are small quibbles.  From the tone and general scope of the proposals I welcome them as an important contribution to the movement for reform of family law in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I should like now to turn briefly to the proposals in the Bill itself.  Not only might the Bill appear on a reading as a very technical Bill, but it is also a Bill which the Seanad might regard as not being entirely complete.  My colleague, Senator Horgan, may mention the possibility of introducing an amendment on Committee Stage which would remedy the present situation that the children of a marriage which has been annulled are rendered illegitimate, so that they are, in effect, bastardised retrospectively.  Those children should remain legitimate even if the marriage has been annulled.  This is a provision which exists again in the other common law jurisdictions.  A change has been made and we too should make that change.  It might be appropriate to include such a provision in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Looking at the terms of the Bill as it stands, it has to be read very closely with the Bill which it seeks to amend, the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act of 1930.  It also amends certain sections of the Courts Act of 1971, which is the most recent provision improving the maintenance payments which may be made for illegitimate children.  Section 2 is an interpretation and definition section.  Section 3 provides that section 2 of the Act of 1930 be amended.  Paragraph (a) amends section 2 by cutting out reference to &ldquo;a local body administering the relief of the poor when giving relief to the mother of an illegitimate child&rdquo;.  The issuing of summons would be on the application of the natural mother and not on the possible application of a local body administering the relief to the poor and giving relief to the mother of the illegitimate child.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> In fact that whole area of the possibility of the Department of Social Welfare being the body which come between the mother and the father, so that the mother need not bring the father into court by taking a lawsuit against him, is a very important area. Indeed, I would favour the possibility of the Department of Social Welfare being the moving body.  This sort of reform and amendment could only be brought about in a Social Welfare Act and it is not suitable to the much more limited subject matter of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (b) is important because it deletes the time limits relating to the bringing of affiliation proceedings.  It deletes subsection (2) of section 2 of the 1930 Act.  Subsection (2) as it stands provides that</P>
    <P>... an application for the issue of a summons or other process under this section may be made only&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  before the birth of the illegitimate child in respect of whom the application is made, or</P>
    <P>(b)  within six months after the birth of such child, or</P>
    <P>(c)  where the alleged father of such child contributed to the maintenance of such child within six months after its birth, at any time after such contribution, or</P>
    <P>(d)  where the alleged father of such child was not resident in Saorstát Éireann at the date of the birth of such child, at any time within six months after such alleged father first enters Saorstát Éireann after such date, or</P>
    <P>(e)  where the alleged father of such child was resident in Saorstát Éireann at the date of the birth of such child but ceased to be so resident within six months after such a date, at any time within six months after such alleged father first entered Saorstát Éireann after such cesser, or</P>
    <P>(f)  where the child is born within six months before the passing of this Act, within three months after the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>These provisions effectively confine affiliation proceedings to proceedings which have been initiated within six months of the birth of the illegitimate <Col N="75" /> child.  In practice almost no affiliation proceedings are brought in this country. This is an ineffective remedy, and the proposal is to delete the existing wording of subsection (2), which I just read, and to substitute instead after the word &ldquo;made&rdquo;</P>
    <P>either before or after the birth of the illegitimate child in respect of whom the application is made provided that the application is made within the period during which a weekly sum for the maintenance and education of such child may be made payable by virtue of section 4 of this Act.</P>
    <P>In other words, while the child is in continuing education, the period during which under the terms of this amending Bill the child should continue to receive maintenance and support from its father.</P>
    <P>Section 4 makes a minor adjustment to subsection (6) of section 3 of the 1930 Act, which provides what details may be published in relation to the parties to affiliation proceedings.  It reads:</P>
    <P>It shall not be lawful to print or publish or cause or procure to be printed or published any report, statement, commentary or other matter of or in relation to any judicial proceedings for the grant of an affiliation order save and except all or any of the following particulars of such proceedings, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the names of the parties ...</P>
    <P>We felt that, if the idea was to maintain a certain anonymity in respect of privacy of the parties concerned, to allow their names to be published did not really achieve this.  We were hoping to make the minor amendment of substituting &ldquo;the parties designated by initials&rdquo;.  This is a very common practice in other areas such as in adoption where in the reporting of a court case initials are used rather than names of the parties, because of a very reasonable desire to protect anonymity in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill is clear in that it provides that the cut off period for the payment of weekly sums will not be at the age of 16 years, as it is under the <Col N="76" /> 1930 Act, but will be on the completion by such child, being over the age of 16 years, of a course of full-time instruction at any university, college, school or other educational establishment.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the amending Bill amends the 1930 Act, and in so far as it was amended itself by the Courts Act of 1971, amends the appropriate provision of that Act.  Section 6 (1) (a) of the Bill substitutes &ldquo;one hundred pounds&rdquo; for &ldquo;fifty pounds&rdquo; in relation to the payment of funeral expenses of an illegitimate child.  Under the 1930 Act £5 was the maximum amount the father would be liable to pay.  This was increased in the 1971 Act to £50.  We submit that there should be a maximum ceiling of £100 in present realistic terms.  Paragraph (b) relates to the fact that the father may be required to pay for the apprenticeship of an illegitimate child. We submit that, in so far as an apprenticeship has a relevance, it could be an advantage.  It could be good for the illegitimate child to have the opportunity of a paid apprenticeship in some trade or profession.  The appropriate proposal in this rather limited Bill, which is trying to improve the 1930 Act, would be to increase the amount again to more realistic figures and to make the maximum £200 rather than £50.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) relates to a child who has been receiving affiliation payments who subsequently dies.  The amount for the funeral expenses should again be increased from the £50, as stated in the 1971 Act, to £100.  Subsection (2) is the more important amendment of the Courts Act of 1971.  This regulates the maximum amount the District Court can provide in weekly maintenance sums against the father.  The sum of £5 was inserted in section 19 (3) (a) of the Courts Act of 1971.  We would amend that by the substitution of £20.  This would be much more realistic and in conformity with the standard of living. It is not worth the time of a single mother to bring affiliation proceedings for £5 a week.  She will get more on social welfare.  This is not a realistic figure.  It is an unfair figure if the father happens to be somebody with a good income who could provide much better support for his child.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> Therefore in this Bill we provide for a maximum of £20 in the District Court. We do this, although we are aware that the Courts Act, 1971, allows the possibility of a single mother going to the High Court for an unlimited amount. We do this deliberately because High Court proceedings are outside the scope of the average non-lawyer, the person without legal advice, especially when there is at present no system of civil legal aid.  Perhaps civil legal aid may be introduced in the near future.  Nevertheless High Court proceedings are really a non-remedy for most people who would know more easily how to go to the District Court for recovery of a sum for maintenance.</P>
    <P>We tried to make the procedure more flexible by allowing the Minister from time to time to vary the maximum amount specified, to keep up with the cost of living, and we provided that this could be done by ministerial order to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas allowing the possibility of a resolution annulling such order.  This means there would be parliamentary scrutiny of the maximum amount that was being ordered for maintenance of the illegitimate children in the District Court.</P>
    <P>Section 7 removes from section 9 of the 1930 Act the words &ldquo;or to a local body charged with administration of the poor&rdquo;.  We repeal entirely the provisions of section 11, subsection (2), because again they relate to a local body for the relief of the poor.</P>
    <P>Section 9 changes the penalty where a father, to avoid his responsibility, changes his address and tries to evade the situation.  The penalty under the 1930 Act was £2.  We thought it appropriate to bring that penalty more into line with the present value of money and to substitute £20.</P>
    <P>These are rather small amendments of the 1930 Act but they are an attempt to improve it and do so in a way that the House can immediately accept in changing the law.  These proposals do not require further elaborate study. They can all be implemented now and would, in a practical sense, contribute very substantially to improving the status of the illegitimate child.</P>
    <P>By far the most important section is section 10, which attempts to give the illegitimate child property rights.  It <Col N="78" /> provides where at any time after the making of an affiliation order the putative or admitted father of the illegitimate child or any other person dies intestate in respect of any real or personal property, other than property subject to entailed interest under a disposition made before the date of the affiliation order, that property shall devolve in all respects to the illegitimate child with the child of the putative or admitted father and the mother born in lawful wedlock.</P>
    <P>One criticism that could be made of this provision is that it confines itself to the case where affiliation proceedings have been brought, where there is a putative or admitted father.  It might be said that if there is to be a genuine attempt to bring full equality there should be a statement of the fact that the illegitimate child has property rights, and it could then be a matter of separate proof to establish the necessary evidence of parenthood.  It may be possible to introduce a more simple method of declaring and acknowledging a child for the purpose of giving property rights to a child born outside wedlock.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) is the formula for creating rights on intestacy for the illegitimate child on the same basis as a child born in lawful wedlock.  Similarly subsection (2) tries to meet the position where a disposition is made of real or personal property either by deed during the lifetime or by will to operate after death.  We try to create an equality of status for the illegitimate child, so that the illegitimate child can also come in under the Succession Act and defeat the will in so far as it totally deprives him of any right of succession to the property of his natural parent.</P>
    <P>On this Second Stage the House is not concerned so much with the detailed technical provisions of the Bill.  What is required is an assessment of the underlying principle that the present laws fail to live up to the constitutional standard proclaimed in Article 40, section 1, of equality of human persons before the law.  One can point to most unjust, unfair and victimising discrimination of innocent children in our legislation.  The Seanad is asked in this Bill to give leadership in changing the existing procedure in relation to affiliation <Col N="79" /> proceedings and in giving property and succession rights to children born out of wedlock as part of an overall programme to change the status of the children themselves.  The Government, in bringing in a Children's Act, must eliminate all discrimination, must remove the concept of illegitimacy from our law, if they genuinely want to create equality between children born in wedlock and children born outside wedlock.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>In Belfast, a part of the country from which we might well take a lesson now and again, there is a legend outside a city centre church which reads: &ldquo;Despite inflation, the wages of sin remain the same&rdquo;.  This is a crude and a sad statement.  This Bill's purpose is to effect a fundamental change in the situation whereby the wages of sin, if one must call it such, are almost always paid by the innocent party.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson has gone into considerable detail on the constitutional backing for her action in bringing in this Bill.  I can do nothing except agree with what she has said.  I should like to draw attention to two very small points of detail at the beginning and then make a few more general remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present state of the law discriminates effectively not only against children who are illegitimate in the normal course of events but children who have been retrospectively bastardised by the operation of a nullity decree by the courts.  I should like to make it quite clear that I am not speaking about nullity decrees given by clerical courts which have no civil effect in this country but nullity decrees which may be in certain circumstances awarded by Irish courts.  The bitter irony of the situation is&mdash;indeed it has been referred to, though not in the same context, by the Catholic bishops&mdash;that children of the marriage declared by the courts of the land to be null and void are in a considerably worse position than they would be if their parents managed to get a divorce.  There is considerable opposition to the idea that divorce should be introduced into this country and yet the one thing that can be said about divorce is that it is partly, at any <Col N="80" /> rate, an attempt to provide for children. We do not have even this residual attempt to provide for children in the only procedures available in the courts, namely the nullity procedures.  This may affect children very seriously indeed.</P>
    <P>The second detailed provision of the Bill, to which I would like to refer, is section 5, which extends the weekly payments idea to all children above the age of 16 years, who are undergoing full-time instruction at any university, college, school or other educational establishment.  I presume this means under the age of majority.  I am not sure whether this is 18 or 21.</P>
    <P>There is much conflicting evidence about the importance and value of education to children, but at the very least it is recognised that educational deprivation is one of the major components in the general vicious cycle of deprivation which affects so many children in this country.  I am particularly glad that this provision has been written into this Bill because, while it will not necessarily solve all the social and economic problems of illegitimate children, it at least sets the wheel moving in the other direction.  It acknowledges that equality of educational opportunity is the right of the illegitimate as indeed of every other child.  It acknowledges that one of the main obstacles to participation in education by deprived children is financial and economic.  It takes some modest steps to ensure that, whatever obstacles are in the way of an illegitimate child's access to further education, financial ones should not be numbered among them if at all possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson has given chapter and verse for the statistics about illegitimacy in this country.  The figures that she gave are indeed very sobering ones.  We have to remember that shortly after the introduction of special allowances for mothers of illegitimate children by this Government&mdash;a very forward looking step that was&mdash;the number of applications rapidly increased into the thousands.  I am quite sure these applications are still increasing. I see no reason why they should not increase.  It is certainly true, as Senator Robinson said, that the illegitimacy rate is high and is rising.</P>
    <P>I would refer the Seanad to a more detailed survey than any she quoted <Col N="81" /> from, carried out by the Southern Health Board in the region of Cork city and county and Kerry.  This was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 18th April last year and noted that illegitimate births in this area had practically doubled as a proportion of total births there since 1965.  This is very relevant in terms not only of the Bill we are discussing this evening but in terms of our social welfare expenditure and our social welfare priorities.</P>
    <P>Illegitimacy is a very complex phenomenon. I often wish that people who stigmatised it paused to reflect before they did so on the complexity of the phenomenon and on the inadequacy of any of the popular solutions which are frequently advanced to cure it.  If I may mix scientific and popular jargon for a moment, it could safely be said that not all bastards are illegitimate and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>To return to the question of the statistical look at illegitimacy, I think we should support a measure like this precisely because it is designed to make responsible for the welfare of these children some of the people whose responsibility primarily it is.  I am not saying that the State should not support and look after illegitimate children.  The Government have in general shown much more flexibility and understanding of this problem than other administrations in recent years.</P>
    <P>There is a very good argument, on the other hand, for ensuring that the State should not be asked to bear an undue proportion of a burden that other people are unwilling and not unnecessarily unable to bear.  I am not holding out to the Minister for Finance or to the Minister for Justice the prospect of considerable saving in public expenditure on social welfare if this Bill were passed.  But there is an important principle here that, if there are resources in private hands which can be used for the maintenance and welfare of illegitimate children, there is every argument for using these resources where possible and allowing the State resources to be used as a supplement in this area or in other areas of social welfare where they may be needed.</P>
    <P>There are very important moral principles involved here.  This Bill is not about the prevention of illegitimacy.  It <Col N="82" /> is not about morality in that very narrow sense.  It is an expression of the fact that the State, the community and the parents of illegitimate children have a duty and a responsibility to look after these children.  None of us, looking at the modern phenomenon of illegitimacy, can take it easily.  As Senator Robinson pointed out, there is attached to it a stigma, a source of trouble for the child and for at least one of its parents in later life.  We have to accept the fact that, for a wide variety of reasons, illegitimacy exists.  It is increasing and, much as we would deplore the increase in the illegitimacy rate in view of the human suffering which it involves in very many cases, we must accept responsibility in the matter of looking after such children when they are born.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was first published it provoked some public reaction.  I was delighted to see that.  I would hope that this debate will spur even more public reaction and comment on the whole question of illegitimacy and the law.</P>
    <P>There are two articles in particular to which I should like to draw the attention of the House, one critical and one approbatory.  The critical article appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 24th October this year.  It is by Dervla Murphy.  I shall quote one paragraph from it which was a direct comment on our Bill after it had had its First Reading:</P>
    <P>It may safely be assumed that for a long time to come the unit of husband, wife and legitimate issue will be generally regarded in Ireland as the only possible family unit.  And against such a background, no amount of well-meaning legislation can lessen the chief handicap suffered by illegitimate children who are not adopted&mdash;the emotional deprivation of being brought up by only one natural parent.</P>
    <P>This article produced another article, in effect a reply, in the same paper on the following day, by Maura O'Dea who is Chairman of CHERISH, the association for unmarried mothers and their children.  In her reply to Dervla Murphy's article she wrote:</P>
    <P>To say that the law must be changed because men may never <Col N="83" /> admit paternity is to condone a system of exploitation of the weakest section of the community&mdash;children. The idea seems to be that men must be allowed to &ldquo;sow their wild oats&rdquo; and must not be called to account. The fact that the oats happen to be a child is just too bad.</P>
    <P>These two reactions I found extremely interesting, not least the critical reaction by Dervla Murphy because it displays a reaction which to my mind could be very common among Irish people and which could effectively militate against what this Bill and we as its sponsors are trying to do.  Fundamentally, the misconception on which this sort of criticism is based is a misconception about what the Bill is setting out to do. At this point one should, even if only in negative terms, make it quite clear what the Bill is not doing, what it can never do and certainly does not propose to do.</P>
    <P>As I have already noted, it is not a Bill to prevent the birth of illegitimate children.  You could, if you liked, argue that it might have this effect in so far as people who are involved in casual extramarital and other associations might after the passage of such legislation think twice before allowing themselves to be put in the situation in which their relationship might produce a child. Obviously, the more selfish such people are the more unlikely they might be to produce an illegitimate child if they knew not only that they might have to support it through paternity orders but that a substantial proportion of their property might devolve to it in the event of their death.  You could, if you liked, on a strict legalistic basis make out a rather unreal argument in favour of this Bill as a Bill which might prevent the type of association which I have described from producing illegitimate children and promoting a responsible attitude to sexuality.</P>
    <P>This is not the fundamental purpose of the Bill and indeed if it turned out to be such a purpose it would be only accidental.  The whole question of preventing illegitimate births is a matter which covers such a wide spectrum of education in public and social attitudes that I doubt if any Bill could be devised <Col N="84" /> which would deal with it properly. Neither is this Bill legislating for love. Ms. Murphy's criticism of the Bill was based, partly at any rate, on the argument that it will not make up to an illegitimate child for the lack of love, the lack of a suitable environment which follows from the fact that the child is being brought up by only one parent.</P>
    <P>Again, as in the case of illegitimate births, there is no way I am aware of that anybody can legislate love into existence.  Love for children, whether illegitimate or legitimate, exists or it does not exist.  It grows or it does not grow and it can die.  Whatever you may say about it, you cannot legislate it into existence.  It is no purpose of this Bill to do so.  This does not mean that the sponsors of this Bill are in any way callous about the kind of situation which is involved in illegitimacy.  It does not mean that we are not concerned about the lack of love which mars and scars the lives of so many young children in this situation.  But we recognise there are limitations to what legislation can do, and our Bill is an attempt to probe the limits of what a Bill can do in a humane and balanced way.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it might be put forward as an argument to some critics of the Bill, although not to Dervla Murphy, who think that this Bill may subsidise immorality.  Certain critics may think of it as such.  If they do, I would ask them to consider whether perhaps the time has not come to redefine immorality, especially in this complex area of family relationships&mdash;whether the time has come to consider that we may never have defined morality and immorality adequately.</P>
    <P>I should like to put in this context a number of propositions which have governed my support for this Bill.  I believe they are propositions which will be assented to by the proposer and other supporters of the Bill.  I put them as moral principles which should govern the law in relation to children and more especially to the law related to children who are commonly known as illegitimate.</P>
    <P>The first is that the personal social and economic welfare of every child is a primary moral obligation of that child's parents and of the community as a whole.  This sounds simple, but if <Col N="85" /> you note that I am refusing to categorise the child as &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; or &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; you will see that it is a proposition with potentially radical consequences for legislation and in social attitudes generally.</P>
    <P>The second is that children are entitled whenever possible to a balanced and stable home environment.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the stability and balance of any home environment is fundamentally a function of the human relationships involved and only secondarily a function of the legal relationships between the persons concerned.</P>
    <P>The fourth is that the law should support, or at the very least not discriminate against, the children of family relationships whether these family relationships are hallowed by law or not.</P>
    <P>Essentially, I am making two different types of case in favour of illegitimate children and their property rights.  The first kind of case is based quite simply on the reality that a child exists and that it is entitled morally to support and to whatever succession rights can be devised for it from its parents.  This is a right that exists irrespective of whether that child is the child of a one-parent family or whether the child is the child of a two-parent family in which the parents may be living in a legal marriage.</P>
    <P>The second kind of claim I am making is precisely on behalf of the child in the latter situation.  For the child of this type of situation I am demanding not only the recognition of a right which, in the case of a child in a one-parent situation, may have to be exercised against opposition, but the removal of a disqualification based on a legalistic, inhuman and, I suspect, sociologically quite inadequate view of the human family.  The key matter in all this of course is property.  If no human beings owned property I suspect the question of illegitimacy would never have arisen, or if it had arisen would never have generated one-quarter or one-sixteenth of the friction that it generates today. This is a sad but certainly recognisable fact of modern times.  Many of the highly moral attitudes towards illegitimacy are in reality no more than a transposed and transferred or concealed justification of the rights of private <Col N="86" /> property.  It is a justification which is fundamentally selfish and which fundamentally works against the best interests of the children concerned.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House, only in passing, that this right of private property, which as I have said is the hidden basis of so much of our popular thinking about illegitimacy, is one which has never been as widely accepted as it is in some quarters at the present time.  In the Christian Church there has been a very long and distinguished tradition of rejection of the right to private property, of promotion of the value of communitarian existence and of the common ownership of goods which our modern moralists might do well to pay attention to.  In our own tradition as a Republic and before the coming into existence of the Republic, there was an equally strong tradition of socialism through Lalor and Connolly and similar people.</P>
    <P>When we talk about private property and its relationship to succession and to intestacy and to illegitimacy, we should beware of speaking and acting as if this was some sort of inalienable right which pre-existed all other human rights and in some way governed and controlled them.  I think it is true to say that the right to private property as a concept has been used to buttress some of the most inhuman and anti-social aspects of modern society, some of the most depriving forms of exploitation of man by man that we know in the world today.  Yet in actual fact it has always been a right which has been very circumscribed. When it suits people they claim it as an absolute right, especially when the people against whom they claim it have no comeback.  This is particularly true in the case of illegitimate children. When public pressure grows, people are prepared to cede a little and sometimes they cede a great deal more as long as in some peculiar theoretical framework this great right to private property remains intact.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is a right which in practice is severely circumscribed.  It has been circumscribed in our own country and in our own time by the Revenue Acts, by the Succession Acts, by the wealth tax.  Almost every form of taxation that you can mention is a qualification of this allegedly para-divine <Col N="87" /> right to private property.  Yet we draw the line at a further infraction of this right in situations in which innocent children are involved.  I really think that we have to examine our scale of priorities, we have to examine our sense of values when we find ourselves doing this.  We should not be sanctimonious about this.  Basically we should face one rather indelible fact and that is that our prejudice against illegitimate children is based fundamentally on personal and social judgments about the morality or otherwise of the act which produces them.</P>
    <P>Let us have the courage now, I ask the House, not only to change the law&mdash; which can and must be done&mdash;but to change the attitudes and the values which have helped to make this law as inhuman and as discriminatory as it now is.  We may change the law but if we do not accept at the same time the need to change our attitude and prejudices the advance will be small indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to support this Bill introduced by Senator Robinson and now spoken on by Senator Horgan.  The preface to what I have to say on the Bill is something very simple and it is this.  When it comes to replying to the arguments being made, we will be faced with fundamental principles which naturally arise on the Second Stage of the Bill. That is, we may be told: &ldquo;So much is legally possible now and it should satisfy you, and for that reason you should withdraw or delay your Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to that, I would remind the House of something said by Senator Robinson when introducing her Bill. She was quoting Article 45 of the Constitution&mdash;that the State shall strive to promote the welfare of the whole people by securing and protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice and charity shall inform all the institutions of the national life.  An interpretation of that Article of the Constitution in my book means that law is an instrument of justice and justice is, I am sure both sides of the House would agree, an attribute which is claimed by society structured on different principles, in <Col N="88" /> other words, that society does not exist for the law but rather that the law is an instrument of justice, and Article 45 asks us by our actions and by our legislation to ensure that what we do in both of these Houses will in fact defend a social order in which justice and charity shall inform all the institutions of the national life.</P>
    <P>This is a modest Bill.  It speaks only of those children who are referred to in the Bill as illegitimate children, and I might say at the beginning that the State has not gone nearly so far towards defending the children of the State, not to speak of the subsection of those children of the State referred to as the illegitimate children of the State.</P>
    <P>We have seen the document which Senator Robinson used as an instrument to begin her speech with.  In that document was a number of pious pretentions towards the principle of life, towards the principle of children living in dignity, towards the society circumscribed by dignity.  Not only have we made those principles hollow but we have taken refuge in legal instruments which often express the negation of those very principles which might be somehow or another extracted from the Constitution, a document which is not adequate in itself.</P>
    <P>In supporting the Bill, I am not happy with the term &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; in the Title.  It is distasteful to me for a number of reasons.  It has being used in more popular places.  People have used the phrase in debate and they have used it because this House should be a place where people speak honestly. People have been called bastards in our society.  They have been called that for specific reasons.  It helps to isolate individuals from the main current of social life.  It helps to stigmatise the individual.  Externally it can be used to set the individual apart.  Externally it can be used to deprive the individual of opportunity.  Internally that stigmatisation may be expressed in the lowering of the individual's self esteem.</P>
    <P>In the most definitive book on stigma, by Edwina Schur, a woman writer, she said: &ldquo;My father looks at me and he begins to cry.  What should I do?&rdquo; This is in respect of a physical defect and in cases of physical defects individuals feel they are set apart.  What we are discuss- <Col N="89" /> ing now is not a physical defect.  It is a social defect.  We are setting people apart&mdash;this is what we are speaking about.</P>
    <P>The principles involved in this Bill are very simple as far as I am concerned. First of all they are principles as to whether we are willing to acknowledge that every child born in this country is entitled to begin life equally, to begin life free from the consequences of the actions of his parents one way or another.  I have said I am unhappy with the Title of the Bill&mdash;The Illegitimate Children (Maintenance and Succession) Bill, 1974&mdash;because remember what we are doing in this very modest piece of paper: we are deeming in one of the Houses of the Oireachtas to give away certain rights which decently structured society would have given away automatically.  If we were the Christian society we have the pretentions to claim to be so often, we would not find it necessary to legislate property rights into existence for all of the children of the nation.  We would not find it necessary, for example, to protect a mother from writing off her rights to look after her children.  We would not find it necessary to insult, for example, the parents of the child born out of wedlock in the future relations with their child.</P>
    <P>We find all this necessary because our legislation lags behind the kind of society we might be.  Our society is not human enough, so we have to legislate some semblance of humanity into existence.  Again, by way of being preliminary, I would ask people who might vote for or against this Bill and who might favour a more sophisticated adoption procedure have they the proof to place before this House that children are better served in institutions than in relations with people who are their blood relatives?  Where is that proof?</P>
    <P>Does not the proof exist that children born out of wedlock and parents of children born out of wedlock have been systematically insulted in the history of our society?  What has been our attitude?  This is 1974 in Seanad Éireann.  We are to decide on this.  We have in the Lower House just now been reminded of the economic realities of <Col N="90" /> 1974 in a particular time of 1974.  We should ask ourselves are we willing to be reminded of the economic realities of 1974 in one House and to have the social attitudes of the 19th century in the other House.  If that is our attitude we should say so.</P>
    <P>I believe that both of our Houses should enact legislation which is human legislation.  There has been an attitude, something which is unfortunately not often brought out in the open in this country, that the people who beget a child out of wedlock are somehow or another a special kind of people. There is indeed a case in the history of our courts here as to why a child born out of wedlock is a particular kind of child.  I quote from now Deputy John Kelly's <i>Fundamental Rights in the Irish Law and Constitution.</i> In quoting a particular case, and giving the opinion of a judge, he suggests:</P>
    <P>In the opinion of the Court each of the persons described as having rights under ss. 14 (1) and 16 (1) can be regarded as having, or capable of having, in relation to the adoption of the child, a moral capacity or social function which differentiates him from persons who are not given such rights.  When it is considered that an illegitimate child may be begotten by an act of rape, by a callous seduction, or by an act of casual commerce by a man with a woman, as well as by the association of a man with a woman in making a common home without marriage in circumstances approximating to those of married life (the latter was the situation here), and that, except in the latter instance, it is rare for a natural father to take any interest in his offspring...</P>
    <P>Here we have a member of the Judiciary in this case offering an opinion not only on parents but making a prognosis as to a child's life in future&mdash;the child is to be the accident of the judge's opinion of the parents.</P>
    <P>Is that the kind of society we want? I would suggest it is not.  It is very sad in 1974 that a Bill with the title Illegitimate Children (Maintenance and Succession) Bill should have to come before us.  I disagree with the concept &ldquo;illegitimacy&rdquo;.  I dislike the Title, but it <Col N="91" /> is necessary if there is to be an appropriate legal change.</P>
    <P>In disagreeing with the concept, I believe that all children are children of love.  All children, then, should begin equally in rights, and property should exist for those children.  That is why I support the Bill, and when I come to comment on the sections I will express opinions as to why I wish it had gone very much further.  As I said, we appear to be conceding, in the second half of the 20th century rights to children that we have deprived rather dreadfully.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the concept of the family itself.  What do we want to define the family as?  The last speaker mentioned that &ldquo;family&rdquo; should be given a different sociological definition. The family has indeed been so defined.  The family can be defined as the nuclear family of the modern age, the extended family of a previous time, their advantages and disadvantages&mdash; the anonymity of the nuclear family, the community provisions of the extended family.  Indeed some people refer to the family of God.  But if they refer to the family of God, do they include those who are particular members of the family of God who can inherit property and those who are bastards within the family of God and can inherit no property?  They are referred to specifically in the second half of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Here there can be no quibble about what the Bill is at.  The Bill in its early stages begins by, for example, proposing something very simple.  It adverts to first of all the emotional state of the mother and to the position of law in relation to similar circumstances in other countries.  In relation to the first of these, it realises quite rightly that when a child is born very often the mother's immediate reaction is emotional. Yet under present law she needs to act quickly or forever forfeit her rights. So the simple provision, then, is to harmonise the law even in relation to other legislatures often referred to as pagan.</P>
    <P>In many cases here in the particular section, I find it again tedious to even suggest the amendments.  When you <Col N="92" /> think of what is involved&mdash;section 6 of the Act, for example, amends a previous Act by substituting the sum of £100 for £50.  Again, in paragraph (c), £100 is substituted for £50.  Senator Robinson commented on this point, but I would go much farther than she did. I would change many of these sections to provide £100 per week or £1,000 a week so that when a woman appears before the court she will never be circumscribed by inflation.  I have no training in law but I have some small experience in social life and some training in sociology.  A woman must balance out what she is likely to get before enduring the shame of appearing before the courts.  I would suggest a huge sum of money so that she would never have to do such a balancing act in the future.</P>
    <P>Again, we must think of the indignity of the previous legislation: the change in sums of money, the provision for funerals.  The people who suggest changes in this Act should suggest changes to expand and strengthen it. The monetary provisions should be deleted and larger provision substituted. The Minister should take up Senator Robinson's suggestion.  It would be encouraging to hear him say &ldquo;I have found the Family Law Reform Act of Great Britain, 1971, and the Status of Children Act, 1969, insufficient.  I have decided to bring in a law which will give children even more.  There will be no such thing as deprived children in Ireland in future.&rdquo; This is the kind of reaction we need to this Bill, not people voting against it.</P>
    <P>I come back to the word &ldquo;family&rdquo;.  I want to comment on it because it occurs in the Bill.  I must confess a personal preference for the word &ldquo;household&rdquo; to word the &ldquo;family&rdquo;, because I have found &ldquo;family&rdquo; in discourse in Ireland, in the Press and professionally, to be used in a rather limited sense.  It is used by mafia in a more general and often in a more Christian sense than I have heard it used in Ireland in recent times, in so far as it extends to more people and with a greater equality in relationships than is normal here. When a person attaches himself to a household for a long time he is entitled to the sustenance of that household.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="93" /> The provisions of the Bill before the House are very specific.  There is a change in penalty for changing address. Section 10 deals with the substantive matter of the Bill.  People may say: &ldquo;We have changed the rights of the woman.  We have given her more time.&rdquo; I believe we could have gone farther in that matter.  In many cases the procedures could be expanded and improved. This is the disadvantage of the Bill being brought in by an Independent Senator, although a gifted one, which should have been brought in before now by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>Take the whole idea of property&mdash; the idea, for example, of an admitted father.  I am not sure myself as to what constitutes admission; or if we are speaking of admission before the courts or whether it merely means a father says to the mother that he wants to admit that the child is his and assume responsibility and share whatever possessions he has with the child.  He cannot do this at present without a series of degradations.  The Bill does not remove all of these degradations; it could have gone farther when it is primarily concerned with them.</P>
    <P>That is the whole substance of the Bill.  It is the idea of whether all children are equal or whether children should go through life with the mark of degradation on them.  It is also about the procedures of degradation.  To come to my point about the money, how could the award of it ever compensate for the loss of love which might exist between two people when its granting must be acted out in court?  What might take place in such a court?  A child born of a moment of love suddenly becomes the object on which a judge can sit and decide his portion.  Is that what we want?  Children governed by legality? Children the victims of successful degradation ceremonies in court?  What we should do is to make sure that property and the law precede the circumstances of the law itself, that the rights of children and the rights of the usage of property are attendant upon people rather than that people should have to adjust themselves to the procedures of law.</P>
    <P>Senator John Horgan said something which might be regarded as almost <Col N="94" /> cynical: we would hardly have any argument if it was not for the question of property.  This, unfortunately, is not true.  It is true to some extent that when you decide, for example, to enforce equality, at least in terms of responsibility for one's actions in relation to children who have been born, it hurts people and people will object to it.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest sympathy for many people living in modern society. Our society is not a socialist one.  If it was, it would not be necessary to have this legislation which we have now. Therefore the people who object to the Bill should do so openly.  They should say: &ldquo;My objection is that I want to protect my property against all of my children and keep it for some of my children.&rdquo; That would be honest. What we are saying is that all of one's children are entitled to all of the consequences of one's activity other than one's activity in relation to love itself.  It is a very simple point.</P>
    <P>When I said that Senator Horgan was somewhat wrong, here I was remembering what I had read in the statements regarding the moral judgment that had been made as to the kind of people who are involved in producing children out of wedlock.  Here we are dealing with something more vicious. How dare people stand in judgment on the act of love?  If people decide to be members of a particular religion that is their business.  It is something that needs to be respected.  In many cases it is based on something established over time and not without consideration.  They are not necessarily established only in western culture.  Other cultures have existed and have been wiped out by the logical extension of some of the western practices.</P>
    <P>If the State then be a religious expression, that is one kind of impertinence because it means that we are opting out of modernism.  Then you are suggesting something else.  Not only have you the right to subject the State to religious creed but the right to subject a particular category of children to social opprobrium because we feel like it.  That is what we are undoing.  We have been refused the right earlier on today to redress some of the relationship between Church and State.  We <Col N="95" /> should be allowed in this Bill to mitigate some of the opprobrium which society has directed against a section of our community.</P>
    <P>I believe that we should not only be thinking of the present and the future and the quality of our law now but of the terrible things we have done in the past.  There has been, as a result of the class division in our society, the abuse of institutions to allow certain categories of the population to be released from their responsibility, to release children into society, stigmatise them, give them the badge of being children who have been in an institution.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I must say that unfortunately none of the kind of changes that I would like is contained in this Bill.  What is it doing?  Tidying up two Bills and an Act of 1930; changing succession rights&mdash;and there will be people who will object to that.  They will say there is no sharing of property. We all look for the ones we want responsibility for.  There will be people who will say we have the right to make moral judgments on people who make love.  Good luck to that sort of people. It is a sad situation in 1974 if we have to begin at this stage.  It is a very small step.  It is just the beginning of the redressing of the huge imbalance against women in regard to their rights in society.  It is, more importantly, the beginning of the assertion of rights for children which have been granted in societies older than ours and more repressive than ours.  It is the beginning of ending the myth that a child out of wedlock belongs in an institution rather than with his parents.  What we need to do now is to mould society in the interest of its future children.  It may be sad for us to have to take up the burden of oppression which we have raised against children, of the terrible legislation, of our terrible guilts of omission.  But it still is not late and I would appeal to all Members of the Seanad to support this Bill.</P>

      <P>Before I refer to the Bill itself I should like to make some remarks putting this measure into its context in connection with the changes in and our changing attitudes to family <Col N="96" /> law.  It is significant that this measure is sponsored by Senator Robinson and Senator Horgan.  I salute them and Senator Higgins who is a member of the group.  It follows a pattern which has evolved in this House, of the Seanad becoming a forum for discussion of subjects of extreme sensitivity in the area of family law and family morality. In some cases this House has discussed these measures before; they have had much public discussion.  In other situations the reverse has been the case and there has been considerable demand in the media for changes in the law before the Seanad has had an opportunity of having a full debate.</P>
      <P>This Bill is one of a continuing succession of attempts by Senators to change our attitudes which have become outmoded; to change legislation which may have suited a previous age but is no longer suited to our society in 1974. Before the recent Adoption Act of 1974 was passed&mdash;in the period of the previous administration&mdash;we had a long, detailed debate in the Seanad on a previous Bill, again sponsored by Senator Robinson.  There was no question but that the debate in this House at that time and the debate again when the Adoption Bill of 1974 was introduced here by the Minister for Justice had an important effect.  The debate was marked by sensitive contributions from all sides and from Members representing a diverse section of the community.  I feel that this debate will help to focus attention on another specific problem&mdash;the problem of the illegitimate child.  Whether we like the name or not, it is the legal title for these less fortunate people.  It is something that this House could well spend some time considering.  I hope this debate will continue in the spirit in which it has started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned in a previous debate of this nature that our legislators have run away from the problems in this area. This is highlighted by the fact that the two most important changes which have taken place in connection with family law have been made not by the Oireachtas but by the Supreme Court, declaring two particular pieces of our legislation to be unconstitutional.  One was concerned with the availability of family planning methods and the other <Col N="97" /> was concerned with the adoption of children by couples of differing religions. It is a particularly sad reflection, an accurate and a true reflection, of the fact that until recent debates, particularly in this House&mdash;and I think that this House is a forum in which the subject can be discussed and has been discussed in a constructive frame of mind by all&mdash;the attitude that prevailed was that these matters were, for some reason which is not clear to me, problems which should not be raised or brought into the open, that if you swept the whole business under the carpet, and that if you kept doing this often enough it would disappear.  This attitude has changed because of efforts by Members of this House to highlight these problems.  Highlighting of these problems has also been done by the media.  But the change has been brought about mainly by a change in attitude among the people.  They are more concerned with these problems now than heretofore.  The rulings of the Supreme Court reflect the feelings of the judiciary and the feelings abroad in the land. People now care more about these problems and this change of attitude has spurred the Oireachtas to get to grips with these problems.  In my opinion we are rather late in the day.</P>
    <P>This Bill is another attempt to deal with a specific problem.  In the delicate area of family morality there is no question that the Church is involved. When one speaks of the Church in Ireland, one should not, of course, speak of one single religious denomination. So often when we say the Church in Ireland we mean the Roman Catholic Church.  The other Churches, I feel, are often as dilatory in these matters&mdash;not always, I am glad to say, but often&mdash; as the Roman Catholic Church appears to me.  On this particular issue, Senator Robinson has pointed out there is no question but that the Church favours change.  It does not defend the <i>status quo.</i> This does not come just from the young, radical members of the clergy and laity; this opinion comes from a hierarchical commission and we can take it that it reflects, to some extent, the hierarchy's agreement with the necessity for changes in the legislation and changes in our attitude to people who are legally termed illegitimate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> There is another reason why, at this time, we should consider this change a matter of urgency.  It was touched upon by Senator Higgins when he talked about the family and he said he preferred the word &ldquo;household&rdquo;.  I agree with him and I think this indicates that the family and family structure has changed very rapidly as we move from a rural to a predominantly urban society.  There is no question in my mind that the family, in the rural context, has a more all-embracing nature than the family in modern suburban surroundings.  When I grew up in the country, it was commonplace, and it still is, for one's parents and grandparents to stay in the same house in which they lived and in which their children grew up.  They married and reared their families in that house and old people rather than being sent away into old people's homes were part of the family community, the household, which is the basis of our society. Sometimes against our will, as our life changes, as the proportion of city dwellers grows and the proportion of people living in the country decreases, the family take a bit of a bashing.  In the environment in which I grew up we had a family consisting of grandparents, aunts, cousins and uncles.  A real family.  This was in a country house.  My family were by no means rich but they were not poor.  They were better off than average and this was mainly because both my parents had professions and worked all their lives and earned money all their lives.  We were about twice as well off, say, as a family whose father had been a schoolmaster, as my father was.  We did have a little more latitude but that was not the point.  In the ambience in which we grew up the family included grandparents, cousins, uncles and people who were less directly related to the breadwinner and the offspring than the word &ldquo;family&rdquo; would mean now.  If I were married and living in a suburban environment I would find it really difficult to keep grandparents, aunts, uncles and so on in the house.  While I would do this if I possibly could on my means, in the end, after an attempt at widening the family circle, making it more of a household than a family, I might be forced to send them to old <Col N="99" /> people's homes, to other accommodation in some other part of suburbia.  I might be forced to tighten the reins and reduce the family unit to just parents and their children.</P>
    <P>This has a direct relevance to the measure we are discussing because there is no question, if we go back far enough, that the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children was slight.  Going back to Celtic times, the illegitimate children had more rights in inheriting property than they have now and the family was an all-embracing unit.</P>
    <P>If one goes back to Celtic times the illegitimate children certainly had more rights in terms of property than they have now.  The family was an all-embracing unit.  As the family increased in size, the problems of illegitimate offspring became more acute.  They are often consigned to institutions.  It is a sad fact and something we should try and change.  This is another compelling reason why the law concerning illegitimacy, maintenance and succession should be reformed.</P>

      <P>Senator West gave notice earlier that he proposed to raise the following matter on the Adjournment:</P>
      <P>The necessity for an oral examination in modern languages in the leaving certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to raise this specific problem concerning the necessity for oral examinations in modern languages in the leaving certificate. In modern languages I include French, the most widely taken language, German, Spanish and Italian.  When the new syllabus for the teaching of these languages was drawn up in 1968 it was stated that the main aims of the teaching should be to enable the pupil (a) to understand the target language as spoken by an educated native; (b) to develop accuracy and fluency in oral expression; (c) to read at sight; (d) to translate passages; and (e) to acquire <Col N="100" /> competence in writing and also to become competent in composition and to deal with prose from dictation.</P>
      <P>Various proposals were drawn up and suggestions were made about the implementation of an oral examination in these subjects.  So far no oral examination has been put into effect in the leaving certificate examination.  I would urge that this be done with all expediency. The necessity of an oral test must be clear to everybody, particularly as we are now members of the EEC.  This has greatly increased travel, commerce and cultural relations with our EEC neighbours.  The four languages I have mentioned, and English, are the main languages of the Community.  We are particularly fortunate that English is the most widely spoken language in the Community.  If it were not we certainly would have had oral tests in our State examinations long before now.  I would urge the Minister to change this situation as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I sat the leaving certificate in 1954 and I regret to say that I got Honours French in the leaving certificate after one year's study.  I got a rather high mark in Honours French.  I could not speak a word of the language, but I proved very adept at learning passages of French prose off by heart, at learning standard answers to standard questions and generally becoming an expert at examination technique.  This stood me in good stead in other situations later but that is no reason for leaving the situation as it is.</P>
      <P>I have travelled quite extensively in the EEC and the teaching of languages which I received in secondary school has had very little effect on me.  I am guilty of not having made more efforts in recent years.  I get by because English is such a widely spoken language, but the point is that I am just an obvious and glaring example of someone who has emerged from our Irish secondary school system practically untouched by modern European linguistic culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The syllabus committee of the Department of Education, reconvened in May, 1973, stressed the necessity for oral examinations in the modern languages. Because the syllabus has been written with an oral test in mind a considerable number of schools have <Col N="101" /> geared their teaching towards the actuality of an oral test in the leaving certificate.  This has left schools in the lurch.  The Department have been less than fair to them.  In 1968 the Department announced that there may be an oral assessment and in 1974 there still is not one.  All arguments are in favour of this test.  It seems to me that in principle the necessity for an oral assessment has been accepted by the Minister.  It also appears that the only problems are the practical ones of actually putting oral examinations into operation.</P>
    <P>I have proposals before me for oral examinations which are broadly supported by the modern languages leaving certificate syllabus committee of the Department of Education, the National Committee of Modern Language Study and the National Commission for the Teaching of Modern Continental Languages of the Royal Irish Academy.  The Department are aware of these proposals and of the proposals of their own committee. They are also aware of the findings of the national commission on teaching of modern languages.  Both groups have proposals for the leaving certificate examinations which would incorporate oral tests as well as a written examination. They suggest that there should be aural comprehension test derived from an unprepared passage to be read by a native speaker on a tape for candidates at the examination.  Oral expression was also to be tested by individual examination conducted by suitably competent examiners, which would include the reading of an unseen passage by the candidate and a conversation with the examiner on a simple everyday topic.  Perhaps some topics would be outlined in advance and they have set out a marking structure which might possibly be followed.  There is obviously flexibility in this sort of thing and considerable discussion is needed to determine what is the best system. But there is no question that all these bodies support the general principle.</P>
    <P>These papers also discuss the problems concerned with conducting such an examination, the arranging for the moderating of marks by the examiners and random checks on the procedures of the oral examinations. <Col N="102" /> Perhaps the examiners would submit tape recordings of oral examinations. The importance is stressed of making clear to the oral examiners that the candidate is being tested, not the teacher or the school.  They also consider the problems of recruitment and training of examiners, the problem of standardising marking and the idea of sending specimen tests to schools, arranging for specimen examinations and of course the problem of payment of examiners.</P>
    <P>Clearly the recruitment of examiners is something that would come about through discussions between the Department and the interested bodies such as the ASTI.  The National Commission on the Teaching of Modern Languages has worked out a rough allocation for the subject of French.  Working on normal hours with four candidates per hour taking the examination over a period of eight days, they suggest that at the current number of students taking French, 73 examiners would be needed for the leaving certificate and 113 examiners for the intermediate certificate.  Examiners could be teachers who would not be examining the school in which they were actually teaching. They could be people who were formerly teachers; married women who were formerly teaching French, and examiners could be recruited from the universities.  There are a fairly broad spectrum of people who would be suitable to act as examiners provided they were given the proper briefing and instruction by the Department.</P>
    <P>It seems that the only problems are practical ones in actually introducing the oral.  The principle has been accepted and the most convincing argument is that in the leaving certificate there is an oral examination in Irish which indicates that where pressure is sufficiently strong the problems can be overcome.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar an gcéad dul síos mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Seanadóir Trevor West ós rud é gur thug sé cúpla nóiméad dom.  Tar éis sin ba mhaith liom chuidiú leis san mhéid atá curtha aige ós comhair an tSeanaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I merely want to say that down through the centuries language has been used as the vehicle through which <Col N="103" /> people convey their thoughts.  The spoken language is tremendously important. I know from experience that children at a very young age are able to converse in two languages in this country, Irish and English.  There is not any confusion; they do not get mixed up.  The Irish people are not inferior to those living on the Continent or elsewhere.  Our children are well able to assimilate one, two, three or four languages if they get the opportunity. It is up to us to give that opportunity to our children because since we entered the EEC a new window has been opened up for us onto Europe.</P>
    <P>For the first time in many generations many people in this country now realise that there are languages other than Irish or English.  French, German, Italian and other languages used on the Continent have become tremendously important.  It is true to say that practically nobody at present can consider himself even half educated if he has not at least some smattering of a foreign language.  Senators who have travelled abroad and been on the Continent know how proud these people are of their own language and the great disadvantage it can be to our people who go out there if they have not some idea of what the other people are talking about.  No interpreter can take the place of the person who can interpret for himself in his own mind what his opposite number is trying to convey.</P>
    <P>Some years ago at a vocational conference and here lately in the Seanad I put forward the view that an effort should be made in the future to start on French, German or Italian even in our national schools.  There should be some method whereby this could be squeezed into the curriculum in view of the fact that we can now make use of tape recorders and various other media.</P>
    <P>Recently there was a statement by a gentleman who came to this country to set up a printing company to produce those interesting magazines for school-going children, <i>Spraoi, Sonas</i> and <i>Siamsa.</i> His comment regarding French was that he found out that even some of the text books which were circulating here were not true French.</P>
    <P>While I know that our teacher are <Col N="104" /> excellent teachers so far as teaching French and other languages is concerned, it is important for parents to realise that unless the children are able to use the language orally, unless they are able to speak with a French person or a German or Italian when they meet them, there is no point in their saying they passed the leaving certificate or any other examination.</P>
    <P>Children should not be denied the chance to acquaint themselves with the pronounciation and so on of a foreign language.  It is important that we should try to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  If it was made compulsory for children to have a spoken knowledge of these languages for their leaving certificate, it would be very important to them in after life. At present people from many parts of this country cannot enter our universities despite the fact that their parents contribute towards their support.  The universities seem to have set certain standards and chosen certain subjects, some of which are not available in parts of the country.  Consequently, some children cannot enter the universities.</P>
    <P>I feel Senator West's request is very necessary.  The children of Ireland will thank the Minister if he accedes to this. We are living in a new age.  Most people get a certain amount of satisfaction if, when they meet foreign people&mdash; French, Italians or Germans&mdash;they are able to converse with them in their own languages.  It will also make us more proud of and have a greater respect for our own language.  The more languages we know the easier it is to acquire a second, a third or a fourth language.  I thank Senator West for raising this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke) Richard (Dick) Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of introducing oral tests as part of the leaving certificate examination in modern languages is one which has been a matter of concern to the Department of Education for some years&mdash;since 1968, in fact.  This matter has been under constant review during that period and consultations have taken place with various interests involved&mdash;at university and in the other levels of teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> The Department of Education have held the view&mdash;one which I, personally, support&mdash;that it is desirable, educationally, that some test of a pupil's oral ability should be a component of the examination in any modern language, especially at leaving certificate level. There is no need for me to enlarge on that point.  An exemplification of the Department's view, already referred to by Senator West, was the introduction of the oral examination in the leaving certificate examination in Irish.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons advanced in favour of the introduction of the oral test is the continuing and progressive emphasis laid in the teaching process on audio-visual and audio-lingual methods, the purpose of which is to develop oral competence.  The Department have encouraged and aided the development of teaching methods along these lines and have also introduced measures at intermediate certificate level to test oral competence in modern languages.  I am referring here particularly to the voluntary assessment by the schools themselves of the pupil's oral ability, which is accepted by my Department as a proportion of the marks finally given to the pupils.  Here we touch on the kernel of the matter under discussion and points to which I will refer later.</P>
    <P>May I pose the question as follows? Which is the soundest approach educationally to the whole problem of the application of oral tests in modern languages&mdash;an externally administered and monitored examination or a school-based test giving the result of a continuous assessment by the school?  As I have said, however, I shall return to this in a moment.</P>
    <P>The other measure introduced by the Department of Education at intermediate level has been the alternate examination in French.  This examination, which is being taken by an increasing number of schools, has been in operation for the last few years.  Its purpose is to cater for those schools which have adopted an almost completely audiovisual audio-lingual approach to the teaching of French.  This examination contains a definite oral component.  A recording on tape forms part of the examination and 50 per cent of the total marks go to oral expression and aural comprehension.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="106" /> The Department of Education over a number of years have been working gradually&mdash;some would say, perhaps, too cautiously&mdash;towards the development of oral examination techniques in modern languages.  Whether we are now at the point where these techniques could be effectively and fruitfully applied at leaving certificate examination level is one of the problems which has faced and is still facing the Department. In a situation where the vast majority of our teachers of modern continental languages are still in the process of perfecting their knowledge of the languages they are teaching, have we a sufficient body of skill and expertise among their necessarily limited numbers to ensure an oral examination procedure which will produce fruitful results?</P>
    <P>In case there is a misunderstanding, I hasten to add that I should not be taken as questioning the competence of the teachers.  I am merely saying that the pool of expertise is limited to those actually teaching modern languages and that the degree of technical expertise required for an effective examination procedure at this level is very high.  We would in fact have to train practically all our modern language teachers in the sophisticated techniques required.  This of course, is possible and desirable, but obviously it would take time.  I am mentioning it here merely as one of the difficulties inherent in this problem of oral examination at leaving certificate level.</P>
    <P>The main difficulty however, lies in the area I have already mentioned. Should oral tests in modern languages, together with practical tests in practical subjects, be more educationally effective if carried out as part of an externally administered and externally monitored examination or should they form part of the continuous assessment of the pupil's competence carried out by the school as part of the educational process?</P>
    <P>The educational world in general for some time now has been developing the idea of greater participation and greater autonomy by the school and by the individual teachers in the total educational process, of which examinations form a part.  In some countries, such as <Col N="107" /> Belgium, what we call public examinations are administered and monitored by the individual school.  It is unlikely that we shall ever go as far as that in granting autonomy to the school, nor perhaps would the schools themselves desire such a position.  We are however encouraging schools to be more and more active in certain areas of autonomy. I mention, for instance, the transition year project, which has been introduced into a number of schools during the current school year.  This project gives schools and teachers a greater degree of autonomy in the devising of the school programme of activities than has ever obtained in our schools before this.</P>
    <P>This however is only an example of a certain approach towards education in general where pupil participation, teacher participation and school participation is stressed.  It is the view of the Department of Education that the area of assessment of oral ability of the individual pupil is one which is uniquely susceptible to school-based, teacher-based continuous assessment.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the teaching associations would prefer the externally administered and externally monitored type of oral examination, which at best can test only very limited areas of oral competence and which would be difficult to administer.  I have already mentioned one of the main difficulties, the value of which would be very questionable.  I notice that all the proposals referred to by Senator West are put forward on the basis of externally administered and monitored tests.  Such an examination would be open to the criticism that, while making a nodding gesture in the direction of recognising the necessity for oral testing in principle, it would not in fact test what it purported to test.</P>
    <P>There is another factor which must be taken into consideration.  The question of the setting up of an independent examination board is under active consideration.  If such a board is constituted it will undoubtedly formulate its own examination techniques.  Since this area of oral testing in modern languages is one on which there are opposing ideas, it would seem to me <Col N="108" /> better not to make a definite commitment until the area has been thoroughly researched.</P>
    <P>May I refer briefly in this connection and make a plea for a sense of reality in relation to the extent to which the State is able to undertake additional expenditure on educational proposals and the need to recognise the fact that further progress in certain areas can only be achieved on the basis of a readiness not to attach a price tag to every activity?  Nobody is more pleased than I am at the improvements effected in teachers' salaries in recent years and that the stage has been reached when the general level of salaries for the profession bears favourable international comparison on any basis which may be considered.  The process of bringing the salary scales for women and single men to the level for married men, which the present Government have undertaken and which will be completed by December, 1975, raises still further the status of the great majority of the general body of teachers but entails very heavy additional expenditure on the educational Votes. The estimated additional cost in this respect for teachers in first and second level schools is of the order of £12 million for the year 1976.</P>
    <P>If this question of payment for assessment is important, may I appeal to teachers not to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs and to accept that certain desirable educational reforms, which teachers recognise as highly desirable and strongly recommend, cannot be undertaken on the basis of additional State expenditure?  I would ask that they should reconsider their attitude in relation to conditions which they attach for participation in these reforms.</P>
    <P>In this, may I return to my suggestion that there is a definite opposition of idea here.  I am in favour of school-based assessment and greater autonomy for schools.  I am not in a position to suggest at this point that greater expenditure should or can be undertaken. Therefore, until this question of the opposition in principle of the two ideas of examination is settled, I cannot hold out any hope to the profession that this <Col N="109" /> matter will be resolved in the early future.</P>
    <P>May I add, finally, that nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see the matter resolved, having spent the greater part of my own existence as teacher in this particular field.</P>
