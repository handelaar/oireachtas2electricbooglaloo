    <Title>Industrial Credit (Amendment) Bill, 1974: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to increase the statutory limit on the borrowing powers of the Industrial Credit Company and also to increase the limit on the extent to which the Minister for Finance can guarantee the company's borrowing.</P>
      <P>The existing statutory limit on borrowing by the Industrial Credit Company is £30 million.  Actual borrowing is now £23.5 million and a further substantial rise is in prospect because of the rate of expansion of the company's business.  On the basis of firm commitments already entered into by the company, it is probable that the statutory limit will be exceeded in the second half of 1974.  It is therefore necessary to raise the statutory limit on borrowing in order to enable the company to meet the demands for finance for industry.  The new limit proposed in section 2 of the Bill is £75 million.  While this is a substantial increase, it reflects the growth in ICC business and the likelihood that the upward trend will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the period April to December, 1974, the company have budgeted to provide financial facilities totalling £14.6 million for industry.  In the previous 12 months the company disbursed £13 million which was in itself a record figure.  Of the £14.6 million which the company will advance up to December next, £5.5 million relates to their subsidiary company, Shipping Finance Corporation, which provide loans for new shipbuilding. The balance will be disbursed by the ICC for the benefit of industry in general.  Most of the capital used by the ICC for their own purposes is secured from non-Exchequer sources and it is <Col N="1023" /> hoped that this position will continue. The capital required for the operations of the Shipping Finance Corporation is provided from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has power under the existing legislation to guarantee borrowing by the ICC and it is proposed in section 3 of the Bill to raise the limit on his power of guaranee from £30 million to £75 million to correspond with the new limit on borrowing.  At present the total amount borrowed under guarantee is £6 million and it is unlikely that the Minister will be called on to guarantee all borrowing by the company.  It is the usual practice however to fix the same limits for borrowing and guarantee purposes.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Credit Act of 1933 conferred wide powers on the company enabling them to underwrite capital issues, to provide issuing house facilities and to make large and medium-term capital available, particularly for the establishment of new industries.  While the Industrial Credit Company operate as a commercial undertaking and have been a profitable enterprise since their establishment, their primary aim is to contribute to national economic expansion. They examine sympathetically every project brought to their notice having regard particularly to economic soundness, employment potential, possible contribution to the reduction of emigration, importance to the proposed locality and utilisation of indigenous raw materials and of the services and products of existing industries. Their facilities have been availed of over the entire range of industry and in all parts of the country by large, medium and small undertakings.</P>
    <P>In the last decade the ICC have considerably expanded their activities. The company have extended their services to include the provision of hire-purchase facilities for plant and machinery, equipment leasing and finance for distribution.  In addition to the provision of capital, the ICC have also a subsidiary company, Mergers Limited, which specialise in the field of mergers and takeovers by undertaking share evaluations and by advising in negotiations for mergers between firms.  As I have already mentioned, they are also <Col N="1024" /> concerned with shipbuilding finance through their other subsidiary company, Shipping Finance Corporation.</P>
    <P>Since our entry into membership of the European Economic Community, the demand for ICC facilities has expanded rapidly.  Given the trading opportunities now open to us and the need for increased industrial investment to sustain economic growth, there will be a continuing demand for the facilities provided by the company.  I am most anxious therefore that the company should be in a position to contribute to industry the financial and organisational expertise which they have built up over the years in addition to financial assistance.  The present legislation, when enacted, will enable the company to maintain a reasonable flow of funds to industry.</P>
    <P>Because of the high demand for industrial finance and the capital intensive nature of modern industry it will not of course be possible for the company to provide all the funds which industry is likely to require.  In seeking funds from the Exchequer, the company's requirements will have to be balanced against demands on behalf of other important services.  It is hoped therefore that the commendable initiative shown by the company in the past in raising capital from non-Exchequer sources can be maintained.</P>
    <P>In the past few years the company have made significant advances in tapping sources of capital abroad.  They have established a very valuable association with the World Bank, with which they have negotiated a loan.  It is also confidently expected that our membership of the EEC will redound to the company's advantage by enabling them to draw on the resources of Community institutions such as the European Investment Bank and to make contact with the national development banks and other financial institutions in the other member states.</P>
    <P>In this regard I am pleased that the company have completed negotiations with the European Investment Bank for a loan of £2½ million, the full details of which will be announced in the near future.  They have also recently signed a co-operation agreement with the other institutions specialising in long-term <Col N="1025" /> credit in the European Community.</P>
    <P>The main purposes of this agreement are to foster joint studies and an exchange of information and to enable projects having a European significance to be financed by the various parties to the agreement.  It is envisaged that one of the practical effects of this would be that the ICC might be invited to assist the financing of a transnational project in another member state and that the other development banks would participate in a project of direct benefit to this country.</P>
    <P>For more than 40 years the ICC have been to the fore in the financing of Irish industry.  At present the company have more than £30 million invested in industry.  Many of the successful industries established in the past 40 years started from modest beginnings with the assistance of finance provided or arranged by the company.  Facilities are provided for the establishment of new industries as well as the expansion of existing firms and the company have a tradition of giving special attention to proposals in regard to small projects. The continuing increase in the demand for the company's facilities is proof that their importance has in no way diminished with the enlargement of the industrial and financial sectors of our economy.  The present legislation will enable the company to continue their important role in the development of the economy and I confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pleasure in welcoming this Bill.  It was certainly necessary in relation to an institution which have a very worthy past, which have played an extremely important role in building up industry in this country.  I understand that something in the region of 54 per cent of the capital provided for industry between 1933 and 1968 was provided by the Industrial Credit Company.  That is an extraordinarily impressive figure.  It is certainly true to say that without the part which the company played in helping industry our industry could not have progressed at the rate it did during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" /> Consequently, I should like to start by complimenting the company on what they have done and to pay a tribute to Dr. Beddy, who played a large part in building up the company and who has now retired; and a tribute also, of course, to the many other officers of the company during that period.  We are not merely talking about what the Industrial Credit Company have done in the past.  It is quite evident from the figures which the Minister has given that they are not only continuing to do this good work but are doing so at an ever-increasing rate.  The figures which have been given for the past two years and the projected figures for the future show that they are playing an ever-increasing part in the provision of capital in a number of different ways for industry in this country.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, although the increase which is sought by the Minister in this Bill looks on first sight to be a very big one, we can accept it as being reasonable.  It is perhaps a little bit high, but nevertheless in all the circumstances I think that it is a reasonable figure. The only reason that the House would examine a figure like this and keep it fairly low is to ensure that the Minister would have to come back from time to time to enable the House to give its comments, give its praise, give its criticism to the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    <P>I am particularly glad to note and to agree with the Minister when he points out that a very high proportion of the borrowing which the company are making is from non-Exchequer sources. That eases the position of the Government and it is very necessary that the company should look outside Exchequer sources for funds.  It is also of course very creditable and satisfactory that they have found it possible to get funds from those sources.</P>
    <P>I see that the guarantee which the Minister is giving is being increased at exactly the same figure as the borrowing. It is quite obvious that this guarantee is no longer required at the same figure as the borrowing.  The Minister has said that it has been the practice to have the guarantee at the same rate as the figure for borrowing. <Col N="1027" /> I think this is a practice which might be reconsidered in the future because as the resources of the Industrial Credit Company increase&mdash;and they have, of course, increased very much&mdash;and as the good name of the company spreads and becomes accepted widespread, not only at home but abroad, then the necessity for a guarantee no longer seems necessary.  I think that the figure at the moment means that only something like £6 million out of £22 million in borrowing by the company is in fact guaranteed.  This should be recognised by the Minister and by the House. The company should not only be encouraged to borrow without the necessity of having a guarantee but they should be given credit for the fact that they can borrow without a guarantee. As this is to be the situation&mdash;and it will improve in the future in the sense that they will find it less and less necessary to have a guarantee&mdash;this should be recognised as time goes on and they should be given credit for the fact that they do not have to lean on the Minister for a guarantee when they are borrowing.</P>
    <P>I should just like to say a few words about Mergers Limited, which are a very excellent organisation, one which have done very good work in the past and which have indeed very good potential for doing work in the future. I may be wrong, but I feel their image is not as good as it deserves to be.  This is perhaps because they have not projected themselves in the way in which most of the merchant banks have.  Perhaps they have a certain inhibition about doing this.</P>
    <P>It is also due, possibly, to the feeling that certain companies which are considering takeovers or mergers feel that Mergers might to some extent be inhibited or curtailed by public policy by the national interest or by considering whether a particular merger or takeover is one of which the Government would approve or whether it is something which should be given their support.  When one goes to a merchant bank, the bank is concentrating entirely on the problem of their client and doing the very best for him.  I do not know whether the Mergers Limited would be <Col N="1028" /> in any way constrained by the desirability of the project from the public policy point of view; but people who are considering whom they should consult in the matter have the feeling that this might be an inhibiting factor and they are for that reason inclined to go to a merchant bank rather than to Mergers Limited.</P>
    <P>In any event, I feel that Mergers do not get the image they deserve for their work in the past and their potential in the future.  If anything can be done to improve this image it should be done. I appreciate that this may be difficult. There are certain proprieties which must be observed and it is difficult to do this, but in so far as it can be done it should be considered.</P>
    <P>Finally, as regards the financial health of the ICC, judging from the last report it is very satisfactory, making almost £1 million profit.  Whereas one must give credit to the company for this profit, there is always perhaps the feeling that they have been too good&mdash; that they have been succumbing to the tendency to make large profits and put aside large figures in reserve.  Naturally they should always bear in the mind the function they have.  They should, if they find themselves making too much money, perhaps take a few extra risks or give money at a slightly lower interest rate.  In that way they could ensure that they observe and comply with their responsibilities and objectives.  However I am not saying that they have succumbed to this tendency: perhaps in spite of taking very considerable risks and giving money at a very reasonable interest rate, they have made a very substantial profit.  Certainly, in view of their record in the past, I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt in regard to their report for last year.</P>
    <P>I have much pleasure in welcoming this Bill and wishing the Industrial Credit Company the best of progress in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Ryan in welcoming this Bill.  I note the general air of euphoria which overtakes both Houses of the Oireachtas when a Minister in charge of any of the semi-State companies comes in and wishes to increase the borrowing power by a trivial sum such as £40 million or £50 <Col N="1029" /> million.  It does not seem to matter to us if we were asked for £70 million or £80 million more.  As I stated on a previous Bill when we increased CIE's borrowing powers by an enormous sum, it was welcomed by everybody because it reflected the national attitude to semi-State corporations such as the Industrial Credit Company.  There is a reason for this attitude.  People realise how important a part these institutions have played in our industrial development. They realise that without such State intervention, in the best possible sense of the term, it would not have been possible to develop our economy to the its present level.</P>
      <P>Two of the things about which we ought to blow our trumpet a little more &mdash;I stated this last week in the debate on Northern Ireland&mdash;are first, we have our economy developed to its present level which is on a par with the economic situation in Northern Ireland, which receives a large subsidy from the UK Government; and secondly, we have a reasonably stable political situation.  These achievements are not sufficiently well known, especially in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things the Industrial Credit Company should do is to make their operations better known to the general public.  They are known to people in the upper echelons of industry and to most people in management but the general public have only a vague idea of how the Industrial Credit Company work.  I will ask the Minister some questions which will reveal the vagueness of my knowledge.  As Senator Ryan has pointed out, the company have a success story to tell and should take a bit more time and trouble in their public relations and not be afraid to tell this story to the general public. More emphasis on public relations would be a good thing.  It could happen that if too many people knew about the success of the ICC then it might result in a large increase in the demands for assistance, loans and the kind of financial backing which the Industrial Credit Company give.  On balance, I do not think better public relations would do the company any harm.  It would give rise generally to more confidence in such an institution and it <Col N="1030" /> would reflect well on the fact that the State is providing such a large increase in the borrowing power of the company.</P>
    <P>To give the Minister an example&mdash; this may just be indicative of my back-ground&mdash;the Agricultural Credit Corporation have a much better image and are more widely known in the country at large.  They are both very worthy organisations.  The ICC should pay more attention to their public image.</P>
    <P>As far as I can gather the main difference between the ICC and a merchant bank is not so much the rate at which one can obtain a loan but the actual length of the term of the loan at a fixed interest rate.  This the basic difference.  There are no merchant banks willing to provide money for such long terms at fixed rates.  They do not operate on that basis.  Therefore the ICC, being a company which operate this way, have played a very important part in the development of our industry.</P>
    <P>There is another point on which I should like to consult the Minister.  On page 2 of the Minister's script, he says:</P>
    <P>The Industrial Credit Company have been a profitable enterprise since their establishment.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech should have contained some figures to indicate that there has been a profit.  I do not think he would be letting any secrets out of the bag if he gave us some figures to prove that in fact over the period of their operation&mdash;40 years&mdash;the ICC have been a profitable enterprise. I presume he means by that statement that the ICC have <i>in toto</i> ended up in credit rather than in debt.  This to me seems an excellent thing.  With long-term loans at a fixed interest it must be difficult to end up in the black rather than in the red. Certainly some of the loans which the company make must have failed to be honoured.  They were not repaid.  Presumably the company have guarantees such as mortgages, and so on, on the organisations to which they lend money. I should like to have some idea from the Minister how the actual operation takes place.  What rates of interest are being paid currently?  What are the terms of the loans?  I should like figures to show <Col N="1031" /> the correctness of the statement that the ICC have been a profitable enterprise.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to detail the relationship of the ICC to the other two organisations which operate in this area&mdash;the IDA and Fóir Teoranta.  I know that the IDA operate to quite an extent outside this country with the object of bringing industry into the country.  It is also true that they help Irish industrialists, but not to such a large extent.  I believe that the IDA tend to make outright non-repayable grants to industries setting up in this country. The ICC make long-term loans once the industry has been established.  Fóir Teoranta are there as a fireman when the whole thing blows up.  We have therefore three organisations which would need to dovetail their operations. I presume that there are links between these organisations, formal and informal, so that we do not have good money being thrown after bad.  The Minister should say something on the relationship between these three bodies.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to tell us the locations of the offices outside Dublin.  I know the main ICC office is in Dublin.  There are sub-offices in both Cork and Limerick and perhaps in other centres.  How long have the branches in Cork and Limerick been in operation?  How much authority have they got?  What sort of ceiling is there on the grants they can issue without consulting the main branch in Dublin for authorisation?  This is important because it has been the policy of the Governments over the last eight, nine or ten years to attempt to move industry away from the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>Many of us think that the Dublin region is top-heavy with industry and that this policy should be pursued more vigorously.  It will not be pursued unless conditions in other areas are good and ancillary services are provided.  The ICC are one of these ancillary services and they are very important.  Clearly there is a great advantage in having ICC offices in other areas of the country. Offices should be established in a sort of ring around the country.  They should not be located only in Cork and Limerick.  Perhaps the Minister would say something about the company's future plans to open other branches.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1032" /> I would also like to ask the Minister about his statement on the commendable initiative shown by the company in the past in raising capital from non-Exchequer sources.  Some of the sources here are underlined&mdash;long-term loans from the World Bank, prospects of a loan from the European Investment Bank and other national development banks.  Anything we can get from these sources at reasonable rates of interest will be welcome.  Presumably if one gets money from the World Bank at 8 per cent and lends it out at 15 per cent, even long-term, that is one way of making a profit.</P>
    <P>What about the proportion of Irish investment in the ICC?  Here again, I should like to compare the company with the Agricultural Credit Corporation, which have a very vigorous and extensive campaign to persuade small investors to invest in the ACC.  They give good competitive rates, which certainly compete with the building societies, if not with the merchant banks.  They have an 8 per cent tax-free rate which is an attractive rate nowadays. As far as I am aware there is no parallel effort by the ICC to advertise and encourage investment by small investors.  Maybe it is not the ICC's policy to take money from small investors.  If the ICC can offer a competitive rate and give good terms they should make a greater effort than they do to attract small as well as large investors.  I also know that the Agricultural Credit Corporation give preferential borrowing rates to people who have lent them money.  Is this also the case with the ICC?  Do they give preferential rates to people who have invested money with them at some stage or other?</P>
    <P>What about the operation of shipping?  The Shipping Finance Corporation are a subsidiary of the ICC. They provide loans for new ship-building. As people are aware, there is one large shipyard in Ireland, which builds large ocean-going ships and completely dominates the Irish ship-building scene.  There are also a number of smaller yards building coastal vessels.  We should do everything we can to encourage the smaller operator.  There is only room for one <Col N="1033" /> large ship-building firm in the whole country.  If you take Harland and Wolff and Verolme, we have two.  Of course only the Cork dockyard would come under the aegis of the Industrial Credit Company.  I would like the Minister to say if the £5.5 million which the ICC are advancing to Shipping Finance Corporation will be given by directly payable grants.  Are the grants repayable at the same rates of interest, roughly, as at the rate at which the ICC are lending money to other sectors of industry? Are there differences in the mode of operation as between Shipping Finance Corporation and the Industrial Credit Company?  In other words, do they lend money out in similar ways or is one operating a non-repayable grant system and the other operating long-term repayable fixed interest loans?</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to ask the Minister about the relationship between the ICC and the Northern Ireland Finance Corporation which, I believe, does a similar job in Northern Ireland. I constantly advocate links between bodies doing the same tasks North and South of the Border.  There are difficulties, but none of these difficulties is insurmountable.  Great benefits can accrue from working together, from joint operations.  For example, a firm which has operations North and South of the Border might be dealt with jointly in consultation with the Northern Ireland Finance Corporation and the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    <P>This sort of co-operation is to be encouraged.  I would like to see us working together with the Northern Ireland Finance Corporation.  I presume the Northern Ireland Finance Corporation operate in a similar way.  Even if they do not, we could say to them: &ldquo;Look, how can we work together?  How can we share our experience?  How can we share our pool of information so that we can benefit both parts of the country?&rdquo; The attitude has changed greatly in the last five to ten years. There is much more openness in the Northern community in regard to operations of this kind.  Even though an initial breakthrough was made by Mr. Lemass in economic co-operation North and South, the spirit has changed greatly in the last five or ten years.  I <Col N="1034" /> think that the Northern business community are ready to do a deal with us in the South.  Semi-State bodies in both parts of the country should be working together.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to tell us definitely that there have been informal or formal discussions between these two bodies and, if not, why not and when they are going to start.  We are inclined to be a bit too cautious in our cross-Border approaches.  I think if we were bold we would get a good return.  I am strongly of the opinion that before we can have any worthwhile political discussions with our Northern fellow-countrymen we will have to have many economic and social contacts.  These contacts are the meaningful ones at the present time.  The lead should be given by the Government.  It will not be rejected by the Northern administration.  It may have to be handled carefully.  At certain times it may have to be done without any great advance publicity.  However I am absolutely certain that proper approaches by the people in the ICC to the Northern Ireland Finance Corporation would receive a warm welcome and there would be very fruitful areas of co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for the manner in which they have received the Bill.  As happened in another place, it has been generally welcomed as a sign of the optimism which exists in Irish industry and of the readiness of Irish industry to avail of the opportunities which are now opening for industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan queried whether it was necessary to extend the right to the Minister for Finance to guarantee the full amount of the authorised borrowing of the company, that is for £75 million.  I would say that in reality it probably is not necessary, but nevertheless it is desirable to extend that power because we could at some time be in the happy position that all the funds required by ICC could be made available from sources other than the Exchequer.  If we were in that happy position I think it would only become operative if the guarantee were there. In fact all the borrowings by the ICC <Col N="1035" /> other than the normal working bank overdraft are guaranteed by the State. As of October, 1973, for instance, the State had advanced £12½ million and the borrowings from other sources were as follows.  The Irish banks' loan, then £1.3 million; the loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, £1.3 million; and deposits &mdash;in the main from the Irish people&mdash; and short-term loans amounting to over £2 million.</P>
    <P>These are the kind of loans to the ICC which are guaranteed.  It is almost a universal practice for international organisations such as the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and other organisations of that kind to require a State guarantee from any body other than the State itself.  Of course, if the loan is made to the State they also require the guarantee of the Minister for Finance.  It is no reflection on the good standing of the ICC in the international monetary scene that the State guarantee is required.  This is just standard practice.  But in case we ever arrive at the happy day when there is more money on offer than is absolutely necessary, it is just as well to leave this umbrella there so that the State can provide the guarantee instead of the State itself advancing the money.  Of course if the State is advancing money to the ICC, or indeed for any other purpose, it must invariably leave some other demand in some other place further back down the queue.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan, I am afraid, repeated a mistake that was made by some of his colleagues in the Dáil in interpreting a figure in an erroneous way.  It has been suggested here and in the Dáil that 54 per cent of the capital used by Irish industry between 1933 and 1968 had been advanced by ICC.  That, in fact, is not so.  That figure relates only to the underwriting of the capital required by Irish industry, which of course is quite a different thing.  Far more has been advanced from the private sector to Irish industry than has ever been advanced by ICC.  I would not think that situation is likely to change in the future, nor do I think it would even be desirable that it should hange.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" /> However that is in no way to diminish the great record of ICC or to discredit the very significant contribution they have made in this vitally important field, because ICC have certainly gone in where other financial angels feared to tread.  And if they did go in, they made precious few mistakes.  It is greatly to the credit of the company that they have operated in a field where certainly 30 or 40 years ago the prospect of success was not as assured as it is today.  Any profits made by ICC are ploughed back into further advances by the ICC for industry.  They are not profits enjoyed to any significant extent by any private shareholders.</P>
    <P>While there are a number of private shareholders in the ICC, they are a predominantly State-owned company and receive more money from the State than they give back.</P>
    <P>The advances made by the Exchequer to the ICC are lent at 9 per cent, which is almost a derisory figure in comparison with figures offered today.  It is much less than the State has to pay for money which the State itself is borrowing.  We consider this is justified by the great work done by the ICC.  The ICC have lent money in areas where in the short-term profits were not obtainable, though in the long-term in most cases the ICC have fully justified the loans made as considerable profits have been made eventually.</P>
    <P>Senator West raised the point that the activities of the ICC were not so well-known as the activities of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  This may be so in a popular sense, but it is not material.  The ACC by their nature makes smaller loans available to a much larger number of people.  They make small loans available to small farmers for comparatively minor purposes, whereas the Industrial Credit Company, even though they treat particularly favourably the small concerns, are nevertheless advancing larger sums of money to a much smaller number of persons.</P>
    <P>Senator West also queried whether the ICC had enough offices.  They have offices in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. Again, because the decision-making is in respect of fewer people and for larger sums of money, there is more <Col N="1037" /> direct consultation with headquarters in Dublin than there might in relation to the ACC where local area officers might be empowered to make advances up to a certain limit or for specific purposes. On account of the much smaller workload which ICC have this process of necessary consultation does not involve delay.  There have been no complaints of which we are aware from people in the provinces about any lack of contact between their area and Dublin or of any lack of understanding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, supposing there was an office in the north-west, which is a region which does not appear to be covered by this or by many other State institutions as well as more favoured regions, they could build up business there.  They could publicise and deal with local problems on the spot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  But one must not overlook that the Department of Industry and Commerce and the IDA act as agents or informants.  When people from any area are seeking credit for industrial purposes, if they are not already aware of them, the Department of Industry and Commerce, my own Department or whatever other Government agency or local authority may be involved, inform the potential user of industrial credit of the services to be obtained from the ICC.  The regional development officers are all aware of the facilities granted by the ICC.  There is no lack of salesmanship so far as the services of the ICC are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deposit record of the ICC is not as dramatic as that of ACC.  We must look at the different nature of the two concerns.  The ACC deal with a large number of small people as borrowers or as depositors, whereas the ICC have tended to collect deposits from people who have larger sums to deposit.  If the ICC had more offices undoubtedly they would attract more deposits, but there are a number of money-attracting agencies which have opened more offices than would be warranted by the amount of deposits which they can attract.  There seems to be some contradiction in the argument which says that our banking system should be rationalised to reduce the number of bank <Col N="1038" /> branches, but allowing at the same time building societies and other organisations which attract funds to multiply their offices.</P>
    <P>The ICC are successful and have a good record because they have not lost their heads.  They have advanced according as the demand for their services advanced.  They have not engaged in prestigious promotion.  They have made capital available whenever it was required and could be given prudently. This is the reason for their success.  I share the expression of gratitude which Senator Eoin Ryan expressed to Dr. Beddy and his colleagues for the careful way in which they have managed the affairs of the ICC for the last 40 years. This is a record of commendable success which could well be emulated by other concerns in the public and the private sector.</P>
    <P>Senator West asked about the terms on which ICC loans are made.  They are usually made for periods of seven to 15 years.  It is possible to negotiate longer or shorter terms.  Occasionally the advances are made with specially tailored provisions which allow a borrower to postpone the payment of capital and even interest for some time after the loan commences.  This is done deliberately in the light of the not infrequent experience that a new concern or a development of an old concern requires some years' experience before it can be in a profit-making situation to enable it to repay advances. Interest is related to current market rates.  At present the minimum interest is 14¼ per cent for a five to seven year loan, 14½ per cent for a seven to a nine year loan and 14¾ per cent for a nine to 11 year loan.</P>
    <P>Senator West also asked about the Shipping Finance Corporation.  It is important to remember that the ICC do not make grants to anybody.  The IDA are the grant-making organisation. Fóir Teoranta are the rescue organisation who go in to provide capital for a company which has a prospect of making profit as long as they receive an injection of capital.  Fóir Teoranta might be regarded as mounting the fire brigade operation, going in to put out the fire.  The ICC of necessity have to <Col N="1039" /> operate more cautiously than Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>The following is the position regarding the Shipping Finance Corporation. From the commencement of their operations in 1961 to 31st October, 1973, the Shipping Finance Corporation have approved loans amounting to £23.3 million towards the construction of 11 ships, all at Verolme dockyard.  Of this sum, £11.8 million has been issued to date.  Total loans outstanding at October, 1973, amounted to £4,097,000. The company are providing credit finance of £5.7 million in respect of a 50,000 ton bulk carrier at present under construction at the dockyard. They are committed to providing a similar credit for a sister ship in 1975.</P>
    <P>They have a nominal share capital of a mere £100 and the company's sole source of capital, apart from their own cash flow, is loans from the ICC which in turn borrow the necessary capital by way of Exchequer advances. The Shipping Finance Corporation are prepared to advance up to 80 per cent of the total construction cost of a ship. The maximum credit period is eight years and the interest rate does not exceed 7½ per cent.  These terms are in accord with those prescribed in the OECD understanding on shipbuilding credit.  Proposals for an amendment of the understanding are at present being considered by the members.  These envisage a reduction in the maximum credit period from eight to seven years, a reduction in the maximum limit on credit from 80 per cent to 70 per cent of the total cost and an increase in the interest rate from 7½ per cent to 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>Since 1969-70 an interest subsidy is being paid to Shipping Finance Corporation on the Vote of the Department of Industry and Commerce to cover the difference between the rate at which the company lend and the rate at which they borrow from the Exchequer, which of course, as I mentioned earlier, is a mere 9 per cent plus a margin of 1 per cent to cover out-of-pocket expenses and to allow a reasonable reserve to be built up.  The amount paid in 1973-74 was £166,000 and the budget for the current year for the same purpose is <Col N="1040" /> £142,000.  This is a financial facility which is comparable to financial aids given in other countries to the ship-building industry and it is one which can be fully justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister about the smaller shipbuilding firms, firms building trawlers, yachts, and dredgers?  I referred to this in my speech.  There are a number of these firms, particularly on the east coast.  I note that the Minister said the Shipping Finance Corporation have dealt only with Verolme.  Of course that would be a much bigger sum with a totally different entitlement.  Would the smaller firms go to the ICC directly or would they go to the Shipping Finance Corporation?  I am rather surprised that none of them is included under this heading because there is quite a thriving boat-building industry for small boats in this country and it is very important that we develop it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in that case; but there are a number of small boatyards which are doing very good work and which are not restricted to fishing vessels only.  They should be supported. Perhaps the Minister could get the information for me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly make inquiries, but I do not think the boatyards to which the Senator makes reference are in any difficulty or they would not be operating.  However it will be worthwhile making inquiries and I certainly will do so.  I am glad the Senator has stimulated my own curiosity. I will convey to him any information I get in the matter.</P>
      <P>As Senator West and Senator Ryan mentioned, the ICC have been profitable since their establishment, but unfortunately I have not got the figures since 1933.  For example, since 1962 their profit has increased from £400,000 to about £1 million in 1973.  Of course we have to take account of depreciation in the value of money in the transition period.  Apart from shipbuilding finance, they make finance available to a number of enterprises on terms which are more favourable than would be available in the ordinary commercial market, having regard to the fact that they are not out to make a handsome profit.  It is very commendable that they make this profit, which in turn enables them to continue the favourable terms upon which they make money available to new applicants at the stage when these firms must struggle for some little time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically they make their money by borrowing money at a reasonable rate of interest and lending it at a higher rate.  That is where the profit comes in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is.  Senator West wanted to know if there was any working arrangement between the Northern Ireland Finance Corporation and the Industrial Credit Company.  So far as I know, no projects have arisen which involved in any way any joint contribution from them; but we know that there are informal contacts between the members of the two organisations.  Of course, if some trans-Border project were to arise which would be suitable for a joint contribution or for joint lending, the Senator can be certain that ICC would not have any doctrinal objection to it.  In fact, the ICC are already a member of the European organisation which promotes transnational arrangements.  Just as Britain and ourselves are members of the EEC, <Col N="1042" /> this would be an automatic arrangement if the necessary project came on stream.  It has not come yet, but I share with Senator West the hope that it may.</P>
      <P>I trust that I have dealt with most of the points raised by Senators in the course of the debate.  I note I have not dealt with a point made by Senator Ryan in relation to Mergers Limited. We have no evidence that firms are hesitant about approaching Mergers Limited for advice, but of course there are many other consultants in this field who would be only too happy to give advice to firms about mergers, reconstructions and so forth.  If the Senator is aware of any hesitancy on anyone's part in this field I would be glad if he would let me know about it and I shall see what and be done to allay the fears of these people.</P>
      <P>There is no justification for any fears or hesitancy on anyone's part because Mergers Limited operate in complete confidence even though they are a State-sponsored body.  The information which they get about the private affairs of applicants is treated in complete confidence and the Minister for Finance knows nothing about it.  No Minister for Finance would ever want to know anything about the affairs of people who are applying to ICC.  The board are appointed; they have their statutory powers.  They do their work well. Unless and until we find they are doing otherwise we will leave the board to operate in confidence and in complete freedom.  The day we find they are not doing that will be the day for the Government, whoever they may be, to consider the reconstruction of the board.  In the meantime if we want them to do their work well we must leave them complete freedom and allow them to exercise their responsibility in the way in which we have invariably found that State-sponsored bodies are prepared to operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>

It may be that in a particular case they might feel themselves in some way restrained from advising a certain course of action&mdash;for instance, if it involved some question of taxation avoidence or evasion which would be contrary to public policy.  No doubt, if that case arose, the people concerned would get their advice from another quarter.</P>

I know that <Col N="1044" /> we get it through the post in the normal way, but it comes with a flood of other material which sometimes ends up in the waste paper basket.  If, just for Members who are present and who wish to discuss the company, we could have a copy of the previous year's report with the speech, it would prevent people such as me from asking a lot of stupid questions.  If the Minister would give a thought to this matter in regard to this and similar Bills, it would be a good practice.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessary as a preventive against stupid questions, because there were none such asked this morning.  However I would certainly regard it as courteous facility which would be advantageous and perhaps it could be arranged for a future occasion.</P>
      <P>I should like to add that if and when we bring into being, as we hope to do, Oireachtas Committees to supervise State-sponsored bodies, then all Members of the Oireachtas could probably have a greater awareness of the problems and activities of particular companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the further financing of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited by extending the limits contained in the current legislation.  The Bill provides for:</P>
      <P>(1)  An increase from £17 million to £25 million in the aggregate of the amounts which the Minister for Finance may subscribe in taking up shares of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> (2)  An increase from £10 million to £17 million in the existing statutory limit on repayable advances by the Minister for Finance for the provision of houses and community services, and</P>
    <P>(3)  An increase from £10 million to £17 million in the aggregate amount of grants, voted annually, which may be made to the company.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited were set up in 1959 to promote the increased use of Shannon Airport for passenger and freight traffic and for tourist, commercial and industrial purposes in order to offset the prospect of the diminishing importance of Shannon as a transit airport, because of the transition to longer range aircraft.  Successful industrial development at Shannon in the succeeding years and the promotion of substantial tourist traffic through Shannon resulted in the company's original aim of maintaining the airport being modified to that of using the airport as a major asset in regional economic development.  In April, 1968, the industrial development functions of the company were extended to include the adjoining Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary region&mdash;(the Mid-West Region).  The company's present aim can be summarised as being the economic development of the entire region for which the continued development of Shannon is an essential feature.</P>
    <P>Share capital subscribed to the company is used for capital expenditure on the industrial estate at Shannon, on factory buildings and ancillary works in the mid-west region and a small percentage is used on projects relating to tourism.</P>
    <P>Repayable advances are used for capital expenditure on housing and community services at Shannon.  The houses are provided by the company to rent or to purchase and developed sites are also made available for persons wishing to build their own houses and for speculative building.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid moneys are applied towards meeting the company's running expenses and providing financial assistance to industries including grants towards factory buildings, new <Col N="1046" /> machinery and the training of workers on the Shannon Industrial Estate.  A substantial part of the company's running expenses arises from tourism promotion and this is met by a special grant-in-aid for which the Minister for Transport and Power is accountable but which nevertheless comes within the overall limitation in section 3 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The finances provided to the company under existing legislation&mdash;SFADCo Ltd.  Acts 1959 to 1970&mdash;up to 31st March, 1974, were as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The existing limit of £10 million for repayable advances has been reached and there are no funds available under this heading to meet requirements for the current financial year.  The balances available in the case of share capital and grant-in-aid will be sufficient to meet anticipated expenditure under these headings in the current nine-month period to 31st December, 1974, only. It is accordingly necessary to introduce new legislation to raise the existing limits.</P>
    <P>The normal practice when submitting proposals to increase the limits under the statutory heads is to relate such increases to the amounts required to cover the company's operations for a reasonable period ahead so as to afford a further opportunity of reviewing the activities of the company at a relatively early stage.  The present proposals have been drawn up on this basis.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the company should be provided with the financial resources up to the limits now proposed to enable them to consolidate the progress already made and to provide for further orderly development in the future in the various activities assigned to them by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <P>This Bill is acceptable to us.  The Shannon Free Airport Development Company have made a significant contribution to the economy of the country over the years.  The initial decision to establish an airport at Shannon was justified and the extension of that as time went on into an economic development area was not only necessary from one point of view but was also very desirable.  The success of the initial Shannon Free Airport Development Company from the time they were formed in 1959 was shown by the fact that it was decided in 1968 to extend their activities to the surrounding counties of Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary.  The company have since then played a very significant part.  It is not merely a good idea but, in a way, it was something very new and unique. Consequently it is a development which deserves the support of the House.  The company have done good work in the past and, I hope, will do good work in the future.  The extra funds sought in this Bill are not unreasonable.  As far as this side of the House is concerned, it is an acceptable Bill.</P>

      <P>I, also, want to say that I welcome the Bill.  I should like to concur with Senator Ryan in what he has said regarding the great importance of Shannon Airport and also to note the tremendous contribution it has made since its establishment to the economy of the nation.  A free airport such as this when it was set up first was unheard of.  It was a great venture in those days. Indeed, as some of us remember, it was a very controversial political decision in those times and many learned politicians felt that this undertaking would be doomed to failure.  It was prophesied on one occasion that the rabbits would run around it and that it was complete nonsense to venture on a project such as this.  We are glad now that with the passage of years the confidence which the then Government had in its establishment has been justified. Shannon Airport has gone from success to success.  This would not have happened either but for the dedication of the staff.  Not only is it a free airport but it is an international terminal and it is also the shop window of our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> For that reason it is important to us from the national point of view and from the tourist point of view that everything should be spick and span there and that we should think up new ideas and expand and improve in every possible way the facilities available there.  There had been threats in the past that American companies might overfly it because it was not the capital of our country.  This difficulty seems to have been resolved.  I do not know what action other countries would have taken in the matter.  Some of these developing countries change the capital as in Brazil and various other countries. Shannon is a developing town with enormous facilities.  As time goes on it will grow to be a very important unit of our economy.</P>
    <P>It should also project itself as an Irish town.  We all know from landing in foreign airports that they are always very conscious of the national image and they like to project their language even in signs, instructions, and so on.  I am quite sure that this has been done in Shannon.  We are losing sight of our bilingualism, our identity in our signs.  We are an independent nation.</P>
    <P>The money already invested in Shannon has produced an enormous amount of work for our people.  There are thousands of people employed there now.  They are in good employment and they are manufacturing goods which, so far as can be ascertained, sell in the competitive markets of the world. This is again a tribute to the workers of our country and to the workers at Shannon and to the facilities for training and instructing people to produce first class goods.  We welcome the many firms that have come in from abroad and have, through their confidence in our country, set up their industries there.  Of course, we would welcome more of them and the more we get the better for our economy.</P>
    <P>We are all glad that the Minister has brought this Bill before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am glad to welcome the Bill and we are very glad to see the development that has taken place in this area.  I should like to ask the Minister one question.  There has been mass development in the Shannon <Col N="1049" /> Airport area as well as in areas closely related to it but I would like to know what type of development has taken place in North Tipperary region because I am a Tipperary man.  I believe that of the total investment only a small percentage is related to Tipperary. I would like to get that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join other Members of the House in welcoming this Bill.  As we know, the people who thought up this idea initially and put considerable Government finance into the development of the Shannon region and the Shannon Free Airport were taking a considerable gamble.  There was a large risk involved.  It is very conclusively obvious that the gamble has come off, that the risk was justified. We have what in many ways is the most exciting piece of regional development in Ireland in that area.  It is a new community, a young community, a community in which many experiments in a social sense, many ecumenical advances, have been made.  I think in many ways the Shannon region is a model which should give us plenty of food for thought.  I would urge the Minister to try to ensure that other similar experiments are tried in the future.  It seems to me that the success of the Shannon regional development was due to the fact that there was a core to the whole operation and that core was provided by the airport and by the tax concessions which were given to industries setting up in the area. Because there was this core, everything built up around it and this gave a centre to the whole development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps when we are thinking of regional development in other parts of the country this concept would be worth bearing in mind&mdash;that regional development should be based around a core industry.  For example, the core industry might be provided by a deep-water port.  This might be the basic industrial unit.  With a deep-water port one could have a tax free zone and one could expect the regional development to take place spreading out from the centre.  Other core industries might be oil refineries or a mineral smelter.  When a location for a smelter has been chosen, major developments should be based <Col N="1050" /> around that single unit&mdash;not necessarily industrially connected.  One would hope of course that when a smelter was set up in an area other ancillary industries would be established in the region.  The Government should take a similar interest in the development of regions in other parts of the country.  Another possibility would be to use a nuclear power station as a centre from which one might build up specialist-type industries in the surrounding region.</P>
    <P>I hope further experiments of this nature will be tried.  They will require Government capital to start them off. They will not all succeed but if we develop one or two other regions perhaps on a smaller scale but based on the Shannon model, then it will be well worth while to take the gamble.  It is particularly interesting that the whole development has not stopped at the normal industrial barriers but that it has involved tourism&mdash;the &ldquo;Rent-an-Irish-Cottage&rdquo; scheme, which was developed in the Shannon region, has been successfully exploited.  It is a model for our tourist development.  There are schemes in North Tipperary, Clare and Limerick.  This idea of building Irish cottages in the rural areas brings benefits to the local people.</P>
    <P>It is one of the key factors in the success of the Shannon development that the rural parts of the region have benefited directly and not just indirectly. Rural amenities have been used and the obvious tourist attractions have been exploited.  Tourists are able to wine and dine in many of the castles of the region. Some of the castles are lived in as ordinary dwellings but others are used for tourist development.  This shows great initiative on the part of the company and particular tribute is due to Mr. Brendan O'Regan who has done a tremendous job, often against great odds.  He deserves tribute for his work on behalf of the region.</P>
    <P>Good management is the key to the operation.  The Government gave money and certain facilities and allowed the company and its chairman a good degree of autonomy in spending that money.  Mr. O'Regan certainly has not let the grass grow under his feet.  The outstanding amenities of the Tipperary, Clare and Limerick areas have been <Col N="1051" /> used in a clever and thoughtful way. This is a model for us to imitate in other areas.  The pattern is to build on a core, give Government support and give the regional manager the autonomy to develop the attractions of the area for industry, tourism and the economic life in general.  Whenever I visited Shannon I was impressed by the type of community life existing there.  Life is more settled and there is more genuine ecumenism and sharing of ideas between different sections of our community in the area.  This is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>There has been much controversy regarding the problem of American landing rights and the eventual overflying of Shannon when the big jets come into service.  The development is at such a stage that the Shannon region can cope with this occurrence.  Its industries are competitive.  It is generating its own steam.  The Government should take a strong line on the landing rights issue and the problems of American airlines flying into Shannon. Having invested so much and being so successful with the development of our own airline and facilities, the Minister for Transport and Power should ensure that our airline and the Shannon region are kept in the forefront of our discussions with outside bodies.  Shannon has reached a stage in its development where it is moving ahead under its own impetus and momentum.  The members of the company, those people who have been associated with the development and the Government which made the decision to back the development with State capital should all be congratulated on their success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamWhyte" hpid="Mr. Whyte Mr. Whyte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Whyte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take the opportunity of welcoming this Bill.  The Shannon Free Airport Development Company have done a very good job down through the years, initially for the Shannon region itself.  Their activities have gone farther than industry alone. Their operations have been crowned with success.  I suppose there are criticisms which can be offered too. Senator West said that the community there is a model for the country, but yet I have a feeling that something is lacking in regard to community life in <Col N="1052" /> the area.  Perhaps it is because it is a new area and that many of the schemes are being carried out on an experimental basis.  Nobody would dispute that the town of Shannon lacks a real community spirit.  It may take years to develop this spirit.  Many people are of the opinion that greater encouragement should be given to people in the estate to own their own houses so that they would have a living part in the community, something which seems to be lacking at the moment.</P>
      <P>Advances in aviation brought the danger that Shannon might be overflown. SFADCo have not only done a good job there but have expanded to cover the counties of Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary, in which I have a particular interest.  North Tipperary is not as favourably treated for grants as is the rest of the Shannon side region. It is fortunate to be within that region. Nonetheless it is apparent to many people that it is at a disadvantage with regard to grants.  It might loose out on industries being placed there because of this lack of equality of grants.  This is a bone of contention with the local authority and with many people interested in North Tipperary.  This is not intended as a criticism of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company. I just want to bring the matter to the attention of the Minister and hope for favourable results in the near future.</P>
      <P>When we speak of development in this region we often forget to give recognition to the county development teams in this and other areas.  SFADCo can and have done a lot in the past to help outside areas, but the spadework must be done by the county development teams.  They have been doing that in the past and have been responsible to a large extent for much of the development which has taken place. Without their co-operation many of the industries in the smaller towns in the region would not be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>SFADCo have brought about the establishment of many advance factories, which have been a great financial help to the area.  None of those advance factories has been left idle for very long. I should like to see advance factories in many more of the smaller towns.  Once the local authorities have provided the <Col N="1053" /> land and the factories are running smoothly, the local development bodies can encourage people to start other businesses in the area.  These businesses need not be of a foreign nature.  There is scope in many towns and villages for developments by the local people with the assistance of the local authority, the county development teams and SFADCo.  There is no danger that there will not be able, willing and adaptable workers available for those industries. There are many people who have left the Shannon region and who are quite prepared to come back to work in their native areas.  The unemployment register for an area may not always be an indication of the availability of labour in that area.  Unfortunately we will always have some unemployed and unemployable.</P>
    <P>We are perhaps one of the most thinly populated countries in Europe. Our people have gone over the world in the past for employment.  Our most progressive and forward looking people will not remain unemployed in any area.  They will migrate or emigrate. We should bring employment to them when possible at local level.  This is the type of thing which SFADCo have been doing over the past few years.  It is something which we should encourage. We should give greater attention to factories in the small towns.  One factory leads to another.  This helps in a big way.  We have good roads and a proper infrastructure.  It would be to the advantage of the country if we could get factories started in small towns, where facilities are not being used to full capacity at the moment, rather than placing them in the bigger growth centres where we have to provide roads, sewerage and all the other requirements.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment SFADCo for the very good job they have done in the past.  One thing which I did not mention already and in which SFADCo had a part to play is the &ldquo;Rent-an-Irish-Cottage&rdquo; scheme.  Some of these cottages can be seen in Clare and North Tipperary.  They have attracted tourism to the area.  They are fully utilised during the tourist season.  The local people have taken shares in this scheme and it has been a success.  I hope this <Col N="1054" /> development will continue to progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>We would be foolish if we were not to look at what the Shannon area has achieved as an example of what could be done in other parts of the country, particularly since Shannon has grown in a rather haphazard fashion not only into a town but to what could well be a city in the future.  It started off as a risk venture to salvage something at a time when it appeared that, due to uncertainty regarding the airport, the economic future of the area would not be great. We now have the situation where there is a considerable spin-off in tourism and recreational and other social activities apart from the industrial enterprise achieved in Shannon.</P>
      <P>There is a real case study here, which perhaps the Government could look at from two viewpoints.  First of all, they should see how the example of Shannon could be followed elsewhere in the country.  There are other areas which have some particular aspects about them which could be used as the centre and source of growth.  Castlebar airport is one example.  There are a number of deep-sea port areas.  There has been heavy investment in port facilities by the Northern Ireland authorities and the British Government on the far side of Carlingford Lough and we could well find ourselves in difficulty with any existing enterprises on the southern side of the lough.  There could well be a case for development in the Carlingford Lough area along the lines of that in Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of Shannon could also be looked at by the Government in the light of what Buchanan said when he advocated the development of growth centres.  Shannon is an example of the type of growth centre which Buchanan advocated and imagined.  He may well have taken the development of the Shannon area as an example of what he had in mind for this country as a whole. I do not know whether the success of Shannon has given the Government any motive to rethink where Buchanan could be applied in this country.  It is a matter which could receive some case study.  Shannon has advanced to the <Col N="1055" /> stage where it contains within itself an in-built growth potential.  The example of that growth could be followed elsewhere in the country.</P>
    <P>By approving this Bill we show our confidence in the future.  I should like the Government sometime to make a social study of the Shannon area.  The town has grown considerably in recent years and may well become a city in time, but the lack of certain facilities there could perhaps create difficulties. In future developments like Shannon we should ensure that as well as an industrial and economic infrastructure there is a proper social infrastructure as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators, I welcome the Bill.  It is one of the steps being taken by the Minister to provide even greater employment in the Shannon region.  We are inclined to become sectional or even parochial when we speak of economic development.  I am under pressure in my own area.  But one must be prepared to accept that sectional objectives must be subordinated to national economic developments regardless of where those developments are taking place.</P>
      <P>This Bill will assist in providing even further employment in the Shannon area.  I am enthusiastic about it because such employment will enable people to attain a good standard of living.  The most valuable resource of any country is its people; therefore legislation which helps our people by providing more employment must always be welcome.</P>
      <P>The people of the Shannon region must be congratulated on the success of their efforts to provide industry there. This Bill will be an encouragement to them and a reward for their enterprise. I hope that the experience they have gained will enable them to provide further industries at Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of money provided by the Bill may seem large but when we think of what has been achieved in Shannon already I do not think we would regard it as an excessive figure by today's standards.  Nobody would quibble about providing it, but I would have liked to have seen further research into development prospects in the area. Perhaps wests nsee ithat no another <Col N="1056" /> occasion.  I do not know if the Science Council have any function here.  Perhaps it is an area which they, with their expertise and experience, might examine.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the workers in the Shannon area.  There was a time when many of them would have emigrated rather than pack up and start a new home in another area.  It is a welcome trend in our society that people are now prepared to move from one area to another.  This has been particularly well demonstrated in Shannon.  The workers there have shown themselves to be a most adaptable labour force.  Has the Minister any plans to encourage this movement of labour by meeting the out-of-pocket expenses involved, providing travel assistance or assistance with the purchase of new houses and so on?  Such encouragement may be worth considering in order to attract people into areas where labour is required.  I would ask the Minister to bear those points in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly some day &mdash;it will probably be fairly soon&mdash;I will bring a Bill to the Seanad which will create a row, but I have not succeeded in doing that in the four or five Bills I have introduced here.  In the main they have been non-contentious.  Today's Bill is also non-contentious.  Although we have not had a row, on each occasion we have had a debate in which Senators have said things which I found helpful, interesting and stimulating.  Even if we do not become contentious we can fruitfully talk to each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The phrase used by Senator West was the one which applies to my feeling about Shannon.  It is a feeling of excitement mingled with a feeling of pride, because something genuinely new was created and something courageous. Senator Dolan referred to that also and he recalled a time when there was sharp political argument about whether it was right to develop Shannon at all. I can make my next statement with complete neutrality because I was not in politics then and I do not recall the arguments and I do not know the attitude of my party.  I hope it was constructive and courageous but I am <Col N="1057" /> not certain about this.  Whatever about the past, I have no doubt that the decision to go ahead with industrial and regional development based on Shannon and to defend the future of the airport and the region by means of SFADCo was a genuine innovation.  It was new and it was something in regard to which there were sceptics.  The sceptics have been routed; it was successful and those with vision and courage have been vindicated.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made&mdash;this is not directly my concern in the sense of being the responsible Minister&mdash;of innovation, flair, the willingness to take a risk, the power to have a new idea, which is such a rare thing.  There has been extraordinary flair and vigour in the management in SFADCo.  Mention was made of the castles, which have been a great success.  First, there was Bunratty, but it did not end there.  Mention was made of the &ldquo;Rent-an-Irish-Cottage&rdquo;, scheme which has been a success.  No mention was made of a venture which for many years, since I first saw one in Denmark and later in Sweden, I have had a great interest in.  That is the folk village at Bunratty.  This is a stimulating and valuable innovation.  One might state with hindsight that we should have had a folk village half a century ago, because Irish culture is more than the Irish language, Irish dancing, and so forth.  It is the way people live their everyday lives, the way they make cloth, build houses, cook, and so on.  We had to wait for SFADCo to introduce this. Thank God it is being done.</P>
    <P>I am trying to reply to points which were introduced sequentially.  Senator Whyte spoke about the future of Shannon, as did Senator Harte and Senator Markey.  There is an airport there.  It moved across the Shannon estuary from what was originally a place for flying boats.  Then there was industrial development in the immediate hinterland of the airport.  Now there is responsibility for a region.  SFADCo have recently sponsored a study on the estuary.  That estuary is a wonderful natural resource with extraordinary potential.  There is the old town of Limerick, there is the new town of Shannon, there is the airport, the industrial estate, the development of <Col N="1058" /> industry in the neighbourhood and now there begins to be the real lift-off of the estuary as well.  I am pleased to state there is an institute of higher education to the forefront of the type of scientific, technological and economic knowledge that will be necessary.  This is a region with an immense potential and I am pleased we have the proven administrative ability and also the proven flair and vision gathered together in SFADCo.  They have a great contribution to make to that development.</P>
    <P>Senator Butler asked about North Tipperary.  I cannot give much detail. In trying to see that there is the optimum use of public money&mdash;this is coming back to a point made by Senator Harte&mdash;each part of the country, each region and each part of each region have rights proportionate to their needs.  I must ensure that the money is spread in the optimum way and that nowhere, as a result of conceivable pressure, is favoured beyond its objective deserts and that nowhere is disadvantaged when it has objective rights to extra help.  Sitting here in Kildare Street there is a need for balance.</P>
    <P>In the five years up to 31st March, 1974, there have been 22 new firms established in County Limerick, 17 in County Clare and in the North Riding of County Tipperary there have been four.  This looks like imbalance though there have been two more since 31st March last in the North Riding and this is only part of County Tipperary. There have been 42 expansions to firms in County Limerick, 22 in County Clare and 26 in the North Riding of County Tipperary.  County Limerick lost seven firms, County Clare lost five and the North Riding of Tipperary lost none.  If we speak about job creation, new job creation in County Limerick was just under 3,000&mdash;2,943.  In County Clare the figure was 464 and in the North Riding of County Tipperary the figure was 378.  Therefore, if one compares the North Riding of Tipperary with the whole of County Clare there is not such an imbalance.</P>
    <P>I had the great pleasure in the recent past of going to North Tipperary where there was a function organised by the chamber of commerce in Thurles.  The <Col N="1059" /> reason for that function was that they got three new industries in the town in the recent past.  There has been a recent announcement in Borrisokane to this effect, too.</P>
    <P>The slight disadvantage in regard to grant level is not an indication of lack of interest or lack of commitment.  One has to balance grant according to need. I make this statement coming from a constituency which is sharply differentiated against, as is most of the Dublin region, with regard to grants.  This is justified as there is a natural growth in Dublin.  We do not want Dublin to become the great wen which sucks everything in the country and leaves things more lopsided than ever.  It is correct to spread development.  It is not an indication of lack of concern or commitment.</P>
    <P>We started, yesterday and again today, talking about this business of regional development.  I would say for myself in regard to my own departmental responsibility that when natural resources are more or less settled in broad outline&mdash;that was the pressing thing when I came into office and I hope the broad outlines will have emerged over the summer and autumn &mdash;I have no doubt that regional planning is the next major problem in which I must be involved.  In terms of trying to study it and trying to think about it I have been getting ready for this during the period that I have been in office.</P>
    <P>We have two poles, as I said recently: one is the growth centre concept with neglect for the rest of the country; the other is the concept of spreading the butter absolutely evenly over the bread. There are strong economic arguments in favour of the growth centre, but it is bad socially and it is destructive of community, destructive of tradition and destructive of many of the things that are very precious to us.  There are fairly strong economic arguments against spreading the butter evenly because you can build in pretty awful costs, awful transportation difficulties and indeed awful specialist servicing and infrastructural difficulties.  The answer, as in so many things, is a mix.  The answer is to get the good out of the growth centre and to skim that good <Col N="1060" /> off into the peripheral areas as much as possible.  I do not think that this necessarily means a factory for every village because with easier transportation now the catchment area gets bigger, but it certainly means spreading it.</P>
    <P>I am now going to anticipate a debate which I know will be an important one in this country in the next year or longer.  My conviction is that we ought &mdash;and I am referring to what Senator West and other Senators said&mdash;indeed to be thinking of the way that Shannon has functioned as a core for spreading out into Clare, into County Limerick and into the North Riding of Tipperary. It is an interesting model.  The balancing of the dynamic core plus the peripheral factory development is the whole art, as I see regional policy: it is not to go for one or the other in any simplistic sense; it is to get that mix right.</P>
    <P>We have an extremely interesting model in Shannon from which I think we can draw useful lessons.  I would urge the academic sociologists and economists to look at it.  We had the book of Lucey and Kaldar about industrial development in rural Ireland concerned with a part of Clare, Scariff, and a part of Sligo, Tubbercurry.  I would urge our bright young sociologists and economists looking for M.Sc. and Ph.D. subjects after they have done a first degree, to look at the economics and the sociology of Shannon in relation to future use of this knowledge in our industrial development because it will certainly bear a great deal of study.</P>
    <P>Senator West talked about the core being a deep water-port, or a refinery, or a smelter, or a nuclear power station. I think this idea of the interplay between an industrial core, a growth centre in the Buchanan sense and a dynamic periphery with its budded-off factories, with its daughter industrial areas, is a central idea in successful regional planning and a very interesting one. Indeed, if I make a comment about what has been happening, I was delighted&mdash; I think I probably have it on the record of the Oireachtas somewhere already&mdash;with what seemed superficially like an accusation on the front <Col N="1061" /> page of <i>Business and Finance.</i>  It was referring to what was happening in north Mayo and the caption was &ldquo;Too Much Too Soon&rdquo;.  It is a joy to be reproached for doing too much too soon.</P>
    <P>I think we may get a level of new job creation in a small number of large units in north Mayo in the fairly near future that will force on us the business of planning housing, of planning social development, of looking on that as a core that will spread out from north Connemara to well up into Sligo. Indeed Sligo itself is showing in a number of factories the same sort of dynamism.  The ideas that Senator West and some other Senators were concerning themselves with in relation to this Bill are ideas that will become the centre of a national debate.</P>
    <P>I am very much heartened by the way in which from the different sides political party was not obvious at all in the debate we have had.  If we can get deeply into the question of regional planning in an objective and non-partisan way, simply concerned with the best use of existing resources and existing knowledge, we can have a very good debate about a subject that has been kicked around a bit in debate over decades and one which has never been faced up to.</P>
    <P>Senator West paid tribute by name to Brendan O'Regan.  I should like to add my praise to that specific name.  The best measure of an efficient executive, the best definition of what an executive does when he is working really well, is to make himself redundant.  When he has produced a team around him who are so good that he can go away and do something else without the efficiency of the whole operation suffering, then he is really functioning well.  I think Brendan O'Regan, in addition to the flair and imagination he has shown, has done that.  There is a very good team of people there.  He has found the time apart from other things, to be concerned with the Third World and with passing on the knowledge that has been accumulated in his time in Shannon to the solution of Third World problems in a way that shows a very great social concern and social vision.  I am sure it is right&mdash;as Senator West urged we <Col N="1062" /> should do at Government level&mdash;that we should find good executives and trust them.  In my period, in visiting places like SFADCo, I have been impressed by the level of the executives. We have been building efficient middle-level people who can go anywhere and do anything.  I know that they are worthy of trust.  I am sure this is the right approach&mdash;finding them, being rigorous in their selection and then letting them go and do their thing freely.</P>
    <P>I was interested in people having some reservations about the community spirit in Shannon.  Senator Whyte, for example, mentioned this. I do not claim any intimate knowledge of Shannon, of the feel of the place.  The first time I was there was eight years ago when I was broadcasting and covering a lot of Ireland making programmes.  I have been back there many times since.  Maybe this is true. On the other hand, it is a marvellous thing to see the mixture of a concern with tradition and with Irish culture that is there.  Because of the tremendous high technology that people have in those two estates, there are all sorts of very sophisticated sports.  There is this mixture of high technology, of being very modern, being up with all of the recent things, and yet being traditional. Maybe you can generate the community spirit to the level we would wish when a new town grows but I must say, bowing to the greater knowledge of Senators, that I have been impressed by the amount of community feeling that has come into existence and by the sense of a town that is there in a short time.</P>
    <P>To some extent I was a little surprised at that aspect of Shannon being criticised.  Again, I think it is a matter for our politicians on the one hand and all of our leaders in society on the other hand.  Let the social scientists have a look at some new structure that has come into existence, which should be vastly interesting for them, and if they can pinpoint defects I see no reason why social scientists should be purely descriptive. They have a perfect right both to pinpoint defects and then to advance methods of solving them.  If there is a structural defect in Shannon let us have <Col N="1063" /> an analysis of it, let us isolate it and let us try to find mechanisms for overcoming it.  I know that there is a great sense of innovation and flexibility among the people involved in SFADCo and indeed in this new and very skilled and highly educated population that live there.  There would be all the confidence and all the flexibility to solve the problem like that, if it were shown to exist.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte talked about further research into the development of the area.  This is an ongoing task by SFADCo, and I instanced the study of the estuary as an example of the sort of research they are doing, or are having done for them.  Shannon now&mdash;I do not mean this as a pun&mdash;has lift off in the sense that the growth, to some extent, is now self-generating.  That does not mean that it can be neglected at all: that will not happen.  It means that if one looks beyond the immediate airport to the estuary and the higher educational aspect, and of course to the industrial estate and to the bits of industry in the extended Mid-West Region, one can look at general problems and not just the problem of the growth of the town or of the industrial estate.</P>
    <P>I believe that SFADCo are continuing and deepening that study, and of its different aspects, the social and tourist aspects as well as the industrial ones, with a good deal of flair, vision and originality.  I expect that they are going to continue coming up with the sort of initiatives, suggestions and propositions that have characterised them in the past.  I am sure that that task of research is necessary.  We are getting <Col N="1064" /> a good deal of it.  We have a sort of passion around the country for social surveys, for planning and for looking at the possibilities we have and SFADCo are in the forefront, and it is an important activity which they are doing.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered most of the points made, perhaps a little discursively, but I was interested in what was said: it raised important and broader issues.  I should now like to urge the Seanad to give this Bill a Second Reading.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without recommendation, received for final consideration and ordered to be returned to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Could I refer to a matter that was raised on the Order of Business this morning?  Senator Eoin Ryan asked leave of the House to explore the possibility of taking the Prosecution of Offences Bill today.  I have made inquiries in the matter, at Senator O'Higgins's instigation, and I am sorry to say it is not possible.  The Report Stage of this Bill is being dealt with in the other House sometime after Question Time and the question of taking it here is too indefinite: a time could not be fixed.  I have discussed it with Senator Eoin Ryan and he has agreed to leave the matter over until next week.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 17th July, 1974.</P>
