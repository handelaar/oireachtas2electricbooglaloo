      <P>I want to ask that Motion No. 16 standing in the names of Senator John Horgan and myself, that is the motion dealing with the mining industry in Ireland, be taken today in view of the recent developments and the possibility that this enormous wealth which belongs to the Irish people may be the subject of a controversy between two foreign countries.  The public should be made aware of an assurance the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave in May last in reply to a question from Deputy Desmond when the Minister said he would be prepared to give information. He also gave an assurance to the trade union movement that he would issue a White Paper.  In these circumstances I would suggest that it would be a great help to the whole community to know what is the present position in relation to this great mining wealth.  At present it appears likely to slip out of the hands of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>I appreciate Senator Browne's point.  It is of course a matter for the House to determine what it will or will not take as regards the business.  While I did not get any direct communication from Senator Browne as to his intention to seek to have this taken today, I did understand from the news media that he intended to make the request.  I had inquiries made if it <Col N="124" /> would be possible for the Minister to be here and it is not.  That is the only information I can give to the House.</P>
      <P>I gave a commitment last week to Senator McGowan to try to arrange to take a motion in which he was interested, that is, No. 11.  We succeeded in making those arrangements but it transpired that it did not suit the proposers of the motion to take it today.  In that sense it might have been possible to fit in another but it was not possible to arrange for this one within the time.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Order of 26th July, 1973, relating to the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities be amended by the addition of the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  That every report which the Joint Committee proposes to make under this order shall on <Col N="125" /> adoption by the Joint Committee be laid before the Seanad forthwith whereupon the Joint Committee shall be empowered to print and publish such report together with such related documents as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>This can be regarded as an agreed motion.  Under the existing procedure, before a Committee appointed by the House can print or publish their report, they must obtain the approval of the House to do so.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, they may wish to make reports from time to time.  It may well be that the reports would be of a comparatively urgent nature and if one of the Houses was not in session at the time it would be necessary to wait until the House met again in order to give the approval. It was suggested that the Committee might be enabled to have the report printed in such circumstances, and it was considered by our Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I understand from the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges that this authority should be given.  I understand also, that a motion similar to this is being moved in the Dáil today.</P>

    <Title>National Building Agency Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1974    (Certified Money Bill):    Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to facilitate the National Building Agency in raising the capital money needed to finance their expanding programme of housing for industry.</P>
      <P>The need for this housing and the lack of any other organisation to meet it effectively were the main reasons why the agency was established as a company in 1960.  The provision of proper accommodation for workers in industry remains an important function of the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> The agency were put on a statutory basis by the National Building Agency Limited Act, 1963.  Section 6 of that Act provided for the making of repayable advances to the agency by the Minister for Finance, and section 7 for guarantees by the Minister of moneys borrowed by it.  The latter power has not so far been used.  Section 9 of the 1963 Act put a limit of £2 million on the aggregate of borrowings or guarantees.  This limit was increased to £5 million by the National Building Agency Limited (Amendment) Act, 1969.  The present Bill proposes to extend the limit to £15 million.</P>
    <P>The increase of £10 million is needed to finance an expansion of the programme from the annual average of about 150 industrial houses over the past five years to an output of about 600 dwellings in each of the next five years.</P>
    <P>The Bill was generally welcomed in the Lower House, where a helpful debate raised some important matters directly connected with the purposes of the Bill.  Concern was expressed, for example, at the drabness and lack of variety of many housing schemes &mdash; a complaint which could fairly be levelled at many private and public schemes besides those built by the agency.  Deputies also echoed criticisms in Press reports of alleged defects in some agency schemes.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to assure Members of this House that I am very much alive to the need for improvement in the environmental aspects of housing schemes generally.  I have told the agency to pay particular attention to securing the best practicable environment when planning and constructing their future schemes.  I know also that some houses provided by the agency &mdash; particularly those built under the &ldquo;low-cost&rdquo; housing project &mdash; suffered from the skimping of space and materials which naturally resulted from a policy insisting on maximum economy in construction.  Other schemes have shown signs of inadequate supervision.  I hope that, as a result of my directions to the agency and of the augmentation of their board of directors by new members <Col N="127" /> having special experience of housing, such inadequacies will not be evident in future schemes.</P>
    <P>The possibility of financing the operations of the agency by means other than Exchequer advances was also raised in the Dáil.  It was suggested for instance that use might be made of an issue of bonds for the purpose.  I do not exclude this or other possible ways of raising capital, but I must point out that if the agency issued such bonds they would either be competing with national loans and with other public bodies for a limited pool of special investment funds or else would have to pay the going interest rates for normal lending-rates which are presently much higher than those on advances from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>The present arrangement, under which the agency participate in an orderly way in the public capital programme, has much to commend it. The agency have built a total of 1,398 houses for industry to date. They have work in progress on more than 450 houses and schemes in planning comprising more than 1,000 houses.  Almost all these houses are being provided for specific industries or for industrial employees nominated by industry or by the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>The programme is developed in close consultation with the authority and with the local housing authorities under the general co-ordination of my Department.  The main areas which will benefit from expansion of the agency's industrial housing activities in the next five years are Galway city and county, where 130 houses a year are to be built; County Donegal, where a total of 274 houses are planned; County Limerick, where 200 houses will be needed; County Mayo, where up to 1,000 houses may be required as a result of the establishment of major new industries, and County Cork, where about 500 industrial houses may be needed.  More than 30 areas throughout the country have been identified where houses may be needed for industrial purposes in the next five years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="128" /> Appreciating the importance of this programme to the industrial growth and expansion and the well being of our general economy.  I know that this House will welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's opening statement today is very similar to his opening speech on the Second Reading of this Bill in the Dáil last week.  When one reads his reply to the Second Stage debate in the Dáil, one immediately notices that it has more political fire than the opening statement here.  I have no doubt that in his files the Minister has available to him the same statistics which he used while replying to the Second Reading debate in the Dáil and I have no doubt that, if given the opportunity or excuse, he will use those same statistics here later this evening when possibly some of us may not have an opportunity of commenting on them.</P>
      <P>I notice that the Minister took one of my fellow county men to task for his stupidity but in reading the Minister's speech I got the feeling that he must consider that the vast majority of the people are stupid.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should intervene here to indicate to the Senator that it is not advisable to discuss the proceedings of the other House except in passing in order to answer arguments made there.  In regard to this Bill, which is primarily concerned with the National Building Agency, I am perturbed that the Senator is opening his speech by answering arguments made in the Dáil which were not central to the matter of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am only making a passing reference at the moment.  If I am not in order in discussing the housing statistics the Minister gave when replying to the Second Reading debate in the Dáil, I take it that the Minister will not be in order if he attempts to give these same statistics when replying to this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister speaks of 25,000 houses built during this financial year, one gets the impression that on the day he assumed office he waved a magic wand and suddenly thousands of partly-built houses appeared throughout the length and breadth of this country, because in order to complete 25,000 houses in this financial year a great many of them must have been in progress by the month of April. This impression has been conveyed to the people at every possible opportunity in recent months by the Minister and by other members of the Government.  First, if we are to judge the record of house building of the present Government the only question we can take into consideration is the number of houses on which building work commenced on 1st January this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must intervene again.  The Senator has been speaking for seven minutes and, to my knowledge, has not mentioned the National Building Agency once.  While it is in order to bring in passing references to housing in general, the Senator must speak to the Bill and to the part that the National Building Agency play in a general housing programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Building Agency were set up for a number of purposes.  It is true to say that they have done useful work in the past.  We on this side of the House welcome this Bill and welcome the extra money being made available to the agency because we realise that they are fulfilling a very important social need.  In the past the National Building Agency provided houses for members of the Garda Síochána.  This was a very successful scheme.  I note that in recent times the Department of Justice, and possibly the Garda Commissioner, seem to have lost interest in this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a pity.  In rural Ireland many gardaí were provided with houses through the National Building Agency at a time when their opportunities in strange towns of getting houses were practically nonexistent. While senior officials of the <Col N="130" /> Department of Justice may not now consider it worthwhile to request the National Building Agency to build these houses for gardaí, I believe, particularly in view of the increase in numbers of the Garda Síochána, that the rank and file still have a desire for these houses to be built by the National Building Agency.  I would ask the Minister to initiate discussions through the Department of Justice with the Garda Representative Body to get their views on this subject.</P>
    <P>I note that the National Building Agency are providing houses for soldiers at the Curragh and in Athlone.  Here again I feel that this is a field in which the National Building Agency could play a much greater part.  Since 1969 we have soldiers based in many towns around the Border and as a result of their arrival the housing position has become quite critical.  In my own town of Letterkenny in those four years between 40 and 50 young soldiers have been married.  Many of these people were strangers to the district and had no opportunity of obtaining houses or flats.  I am personally aware of many of these soldiers living under extremely difficult conditions. Again I would ask the Minister to have discussions with whichever officials are responsible in the Department of Defence and to consider the erection of schemes of houses by the National Building Agency for soldiers in towns such as Letterkenny where there are now permanent military barracks.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil debate there was a reference to bad workmanship in the past.  It would be very foolish for anyone to stand up here and say that all the houses built by the National Building Agency when Fianna Fáil were in office were built to perfection. I know that is not true.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to one scheme in particular in the town of Milford in County Donegal where 40 houses were built literally in a bog hole by the National Building Agency just seven years ago.  In a very short time it was discovered that the walls were cracked, that many of the houses were damp and there was evidence of poor workmanship.  The Minister <Col N="131" /> should have someone investigate the complaint I am making and if what I say is accurate, or even partly accurate, the necessary steps should be taken to ensure that this will not happen again.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister has given an assurance in his speech here today and in his contribution to the Bill in the Dáil.  In the Dáil he stated, as reported at column 641 of the Dáil Official Report for Wednesday, 13th February, 1974,</P>
    <P>... I can assure the House that as long as I am Minister for Local Government there will not be built any more of those houses which, because they were to house working-class people, were built cheaply and were of the worst possible materials and designs.  I have taken a definite decision that the houses that will be built from now on will be of the best quality and design.</P>
    <P>Later on he said:</P>
    <P>It is something that should never have happened and we took steps several months ago to ensure that it will not happen again.</P>
    <P>I studied a plan submitted by the National Building Agency for the erection of 90 industrial houses.  The roads in the scheme are 20 feet wide. There are no back entrances to the houses and there are many blind alleys.  There are no open spaces provided. There is provision in that plan for the erection of a further 100 houses.  Here is a scheme with roadways 20 feet wide, no back entrances, no playground facilities, no open spaces, and very little car park accommodation. It is not five years since I studied that plan; it is not five months or even five weeks since I studied that plan.  It is just ten days ago.  Seven years ago, when the National Building Agency applied for planning permission to Letterkenny Urban Council, a body of which I am a member, for planning permission to provide houses for industrial workers, I remember that that same council submitted plans to the Department for a housing scheme and in that plan they provided for roads of 20 <Col N="132" /> feet.  The Department of Local Government said: &ldquo;No, 20 feet is too narrow today&rdquo;, and the Department insisted that the roadways through that scheme should be 24 feet wide.  That was the Department of Local Government seven years ago.  But now, despite the Minister's assurance in the Dáil on Wednesday, 13th February, that he had taken a decision several months ago that the best quality and design would be insisted on, we find that only two days before he gave that assurance to Dáil Éireann the National Building Agency were seeking planning permission on the lines I have stated.  I notice that, when small builders in rural areas attempt to build 30 or 40 houses for sale, the planning authorities insist on all these amenities; and it would be very wrong if the building agency got away with what they are attempting in Letterkenny.</P>
    <P>Might I say that my council unanimously recommended to the planning authorities that they should insist on proper roadways and on proper amenities being provided.  A body such as this agency should set the highest possible standards, irrespective of the cost, because the people who will be living in these schemes will have to spend the rest of their lives there.  But a 200-house scheme without any open space, without any provision for trees, shrubs, playgrounds, and car parking, should not be tolerated in 1974.  From what I could see of this plan some of these houses were in blocks of six, and it will be necessary for their tenants or the occupiers of some of the houses to wheel manure for the back garden through the hallways of those houses.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to investigate this because, while he was blowing his political trumpet, the building agency was attempting to do what he said would not be done. Every step should be taken to ensure that schemes such as this are worthy of the area in which they are built. It is true to say that since they were established the National Building Agency have done tremendous work, and I have no doubt, despite some of the mistakes they may have made, <Col N="133" /> that they will continue to do so in the future.  That is why we on this side of the House welcome the opportunity of supporting the proposals to provide them with an extra £10 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill and I think the Minister can be assured that it will get a rapid passage through this House.  I should just like to make one or two comments on the Bill and to deal generally with what I think is the main purpose of the Bill, which perhaps may be overlooked in this debate. As I understand it and as the Minister I think has confirmed in his statement introducing this stage of the Bill, the main purpose of this extra capital is to provide accommodation for workers in industry, which provision remains one of the main functions of the agency.  The Minister was even more specific in introducing the Bill in the Dáil when he outlined the three main purposes of the agency and went as far as to say that this Bill dealt almost exclusively with the raising of funds to provide houses and ancillaries for industrial workers, and I should like to deal with that aspect of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While joining with Senator McGlinchey in congratulating the agency on the work they have done over past years notwithstanding certain criticisms, justified or unjustified, I have never been completely convinced of the need for the National Building Agency.  I have taken the view that, given the necessary funds and with adequate staffs, the local authorities throughout the country could provide the bulk of the housing needs, not only the normal needs for their growing population but also the needs for industrial workers.  I may be quite wrong but that is a view I have held for some years now.  Secondly, with the division of the Industrial Development Authority into regions I feel that the work of providing houses for industrial workers might be undertaken by the various regional authorities of the IDA.  If anybody has any doubts about their ability to provide housing for industrial workers they have only to look at the magnificent <Col N="134" /> work done by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company which is the agency of the IDA in the midwestern region.  Anybody who has been to Shannon Airport Industrial Estate and the environs of Shannon Airport will agree that they have done a wonderful job.</P>
    <P>I do not know how well organised the IDA is in the other regions throughout the country.  It would seem to me at least worthy of consideration by the Minister that the agency which is charged with the provision of industrial development in an area should also be charged with the task of providing houses for industrial workers who come to work in that area.  I put the proposal forward for the Minister's consideration.  I do not suggest that at this stage of the NBA's development any drastic changes should be made. If we can avoid overlapping and if we have organisations that can do certain types of work, I think we should avail of those to the full rather than be duplicating organisations and staffs.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of the regional development organisations which have not been referred to, perhaps understandably, by the Minister in his remarks. The regional development organisations, which certainly in some areas are playing a very useful role in co-ordinating and assisting industrial development and the provision of amenities for industrial development, should have some part to play in the provision of houses for industrial workers in their area.  I think they should also be consulted along with the IDA and the local authorities about the provision of houses in an area where substantial industrial development is envisaged.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned to see that in the reference to the programme over the next five years, which shows a substantial increase of 300 per cent in the rate of building over the past five years, there is mention of 200 houses for County Limerick.  I think that that figure will prove to be totally inadequate having regard to the potential development in the Shannon estuary already begun with the first major breakthrough in the recent announcement of the Alcan project for the estuary near Foynes.  It is anticipated <Col N="135" /> that there will be some 2,000 workers building the plant there over the next three or four years and thereafter permanent employment for 800 or 1,000 workers.  This is obviously going to be the first of many major developments in the Shannon estuarial area, both in the north and south banks of the Shannon and in the counties of Limerick, Clare, North Tipperary and Kerry.  It is not being too optimistic to visualise that over the next five years the need for industrial housing will show an enormous increase in that area.  I would specifically draw the Minister's attention to upgrading the programme for County Limerick and the other counties contiguous to the Shannon estuary.  There will be a great need for housing because I think that the potential of the Shannon is now at long last being realised.  I think that this major development announced last week by the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be followed fairly rapidly by other major industrial maritime developments.</P>
    <P>There was some comment in the Dáil debates which I read about the drabness of and lack of variety in the houses built by the NBA.  The Minister has commented on that in his remarks this afternoon.  He has also said, quite rightly, that the same criticism could apply to the houses built by private enterprise and the local authorities throughout the country. I could not agree with him more. The days are now long past when people were content to live in houses <i>per se</i>&mdash; four walls and a roof.  In addition to more interesting and more varied design, I should like to see in every housing development, whether it be by the NBA or the local authorities or indeed private enterprise developments, adequate space for playgrounds, recreation centres and parks.  A house is not a home unless these amenities are provided.  Whatever defects there are in past Housing Acts I hope that the present Minister will rectify them and ensure that any authority or any organisation building houses will provide adequate open spaces, so that houses will be homes for the families who have to live there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" /> I am long enough in a local authority to realise that in days gone by the only thing that mattered was building houses.  Things like playgrounds or parks or recreation centres did not matter.  People wanted to get out of the slums and get into some sort of decent housing conditions. That was quite understandable.  Our ideas and our standards have been raised from those days, and we cannot contemplate a housing estate or a housing scheme now without proper provision for the young people who will grow up in these houses and who will want to let off their excess steam on playgrounds or in recreational centres, together with facilities for community centres, for schools, churches, and shopping centres.  The whole lot should go hand in hand when the NBA and the local authorities are planning.  All these things should be planned together.  Every housing estate should be not only an estate of houses but also a community centre.  That should be the emphasis from now on.</P>
    <P>The provision of houses for the Defence Forces was mentioned, and obviously in some areas they are providing houses.  In other areas they are not providing houses for soldiers and for members of the Garda Síochána. Here the NBA could serve a very useful purpose.  I hope that the Minister will ensure that instead of the local authorities using up their limited funds for providing houses for members of the Defence Forces the NBA should be encouraged to provide these in the various areas throughout the country where there are Army barracks, Army personnel and Garda personnel as well as Civil Service personnel.</P>
    <P>Again I should like to welcome the Bill and to hope that in a few years from now the Minister will be coming back to look for more funds.  The fact that we have to build industrial houses is an indication of the economic progress of the country and its expansion and the confidence of the Minister and the Government in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to welcome this Bill.  I am very glad there is need <Col N="137" /> for it.  The National Building Agency were established in 1963 to do a specific job.  At that time there was an industrial expansion drive and it had been found that in many areas where new industries were arriving people were unable to find housing and the local authorities were not able to provide the houses fast enough.  Consequently it was necessary to have some type of organisation which would be able to do the job efficiently and quickly.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that since then almost 1,400 houses have been built by the National Building Agency.  It is a fairly good accomplishment and something for which they deserve credit.  It is true to say, as some previous speakers have said, that the local authorities, too, can build houses, but for some reason or another the machinery there is slower. Very often it has been difficult in the past to acquire building land and to acquire serviced sites and indeed to get the necessary facilities extended to those housing sites so that those living in the houses would have modern amenities.  As far as I know, the houses built by the National Building Agency are an excellent type of house, and it is only right that they should be of sound and solid structure with particular and individualistic characters of their own in each area. Very often the people occupying these houses may change from one place to another.  It is true that Garda and Army personnel and others like that are in occupations and professions where they can be moved from one area of the country to another.  It is good for them to know the type of house so that their furniture and fittings can match in along with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the money allocated to the National Building Agency to provide houses for industry may, in some instances, be allotted towards the provision of roads.  Roads may be the responsibility of the local authority and some other Government Department, but I think the NBA can spend some of their money in this direction. In the north western area of this country industrialists have experienced great difficulty in getting <Col N="138" /> manufactured goods from the factory out to the ports.  As the Minister himself well knows, being a native of the area and knowing these ports, we in County Cavan try to get our goods out to Greenore, Dundalk and Drogheda.  More often than not we have to make for Dublin city.  I do not know who is responsible for this portion of our roads from Clonee into Dublin city, but so far as we in the north western area are concerned it is certainly detrimental to our prospects for getting extra and especially heavy industry into our area.  The National Building Agency, or whoever is responsible, should see that something is done about that immediately, if at all possible.</P>
    <P>In that north western area we are not in a very advantageous geographical position because of political divisions in our country.  It would have been very interesting if the Minister had been able to supply us here with a list of where these houses had been built.  I would also have been interested to know if many of them would go into that area.  No nation can tolerate certain areas within its boundaries where the population is still declining and out of which people are moving because employment is not being provided.  It is the duty of the Government to ensure that there are proper roadways and proper facilities for industrialists from the ports right into the very heart of these areas.  As a matter of fact, they could lean backwards to facilitate places like Killeshandra, Ballinamore, Cavan and Donegal &mdash; places like that that are far away from the ports.  In many of those areas the houses are there already, and the people are there.  Young people used to emigrate 20 or 30 years ago, but thanks to the thinking of wise men like Seán Lemass regarding industries, industries have sprung up in those areas and young people are now determined to stay at home.  They are no longer anxious to emigrate.  They are receiving a reasonable chance of getting not alone a good primary education but post-primary and third-level education. They would like to stay in their <Col N="139" /> own country.  In a country like ours, where the population is now increasing, more attention should be paid to areas such as these.  Houses and other facilities should be provided for the Garda and Army and those working in industry.  There should be a greater effort made.  I took a special pride in Shannon Airport, Cork and Waterford and places like that.  They now have their industrial estates and so on.</P>
    <P>There is no industrial estate in the north western area.  Surely if a case could be made in the past for putting industrial estates in these other areas, it is time now for somebody to give that area of our country the encouragement it badly needs.  The people are there.  They are good, willing workers and are anxious to stay in the area.  The NBA have been doing a very good job.  I would not like to stand in the way of their receiving the extra finance that is necessary to continue on with the work, but I would be glad if the Minister would bring to the notice the few points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. There is one particular part of the Bill with which I was very impressed, and that is the provision in relation to the outlay of these housing schemes. Quite an amount of work that has been done by the NBA will in time become an eyesore.  There is one particular scheme that I have in mind &mdash; the one in Leixlip.  It will turn into a slum in a few years.  The people who went into these houses were young married people without families; families are growing up in them now; there are no open spaces for them, there are narrow roads and alleyways.  I do not think that is the type of building that should be done by the NBA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very pleased with what the Minister has stated here.  He has given instruction that all these matters will have to be looked into in future when the NBA are providing houses.  All we are concerned with here today is providing more money for the NBA to proceed with their work as a result of industrial expansion.  A debate on the general housing programme does not <Col N="140" /> arise at all to-day.  As a matter of fact, the amount of housing we are dealing with under the NBA up to now is approximately 1 per cent of our total housing needs.  None of us will deny that the NBA are doing quite a good job.  In towns like Mullingar, into which industries have been coming during the past year, we have been in touch with the NBA and we hope to provide land with proper sites and proper facilities &mdash; water and sewerage laid on &mdash; so that they can proceed with the work in the shortest time possible.</P>
    <P>I was really surprised at Senator McGlinchey here today complaining about the low standards that were evident in the NBA housing schemes, because at that time a Fianna Fáil Deputy was Minister for Local Government and he did not do anything about it.  He just let them throw up houses.  The theme was: &ldquo;Give us houses and we do not care what happens afterwards.&rdquo;  The most important thing that has been said by the Minister today is that we will not have a jungle any more, as has been created in the past.</P>
    <P>As regards the houses themselves, the engineers or architects responsible for planning these houses have shown very little imagination.  Where there are 500 or 600 houses together, they are all the same design.  In fact, if you were going home at night and the lights were not on you would not have a chance of getting to your own.  They are so much alike that you might have to knock at two or three doors before you would locate your own house.  I have seen the same thing in Limerick and in various other places.  It is very hard to know which house is which.  I should like to see more imagination in the building of these houses.  I should like to see one group of houses built in a certain way and another with different architecture in order to bring a bit of variety into the houses.</P>
    <P>There were complaints about the roads.  I would agree that it is a very valid complaint.  The roads are too narrow.  At present, even though people have garages, many of them have been turned into some sort of washroom or back-kitchen.  People do not <Col N="141" /> put their cars into these garages.  The cars are left on the roadside.  For that reason the roads would require to be much wider because cars are parked on both sides.</P>
    <P>I am glad to support the Minister in regard to the provision of this money so that houses may be provided by the NBA wherever they are required because of industrial development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnan" hpid="Mr. Brosnan Mr. Brosnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other Senators, I too, welcome the Bill.  My only quarrel with the Minister would be about the inadequacy of the amount of money he is seeking.  He is seeking that the limit of £2 million, as provided by the Principal Act, should be raised to £5 million.  To my mind, this bears no relationship whatsoever to the needs of the agency at the moment having regard to the increased costs of building houses, materials, lands, labour and having regard to the dramatic increase in industrial expansion in the interim.  I think the Minister is trying to put me right on the amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum is £15 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnan" hpid="Mr. Brosnan Mr. Brosnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>The £2 million in 1963 and the £5 million in 1969 were not adequate.  The Minister mentioned in his speech the number of houses envisaged for various parts of the country.  Like Senator Russell, I do not agree that the numbers he mentioned for Limerick are sufficient. Neither is the number he has in mind for Cork city and county.  The increased housing required as a result of the starting of the new industries which are apparently to be established in Bantry Bay and Little Island would necessitate a large number of houses and a very large portion of the £15 million the Minister has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the NBA have lost quite a lot of their enterprise and inventiveness over the years. There are many areas in which they could do very useful work.  There are a number of categories which could be catered for and which are not catered for at all by local authorities or by any other agency I know of.  I speak particularly of returning exile <Col N="142" /> workers, tradesmen or others who find that they are disqualified or barred from applying for local authority housing by the non-residence rule. The same would apply to migratory workers.  I mean by migratory workers workers who migrate from one area of activity to a more intensive area of industrial activity.  They do not qualify either for local authority housing. Members of the Garda Síochána have been catered for to some extent but there is further need for the provision of houses for both the Garda Síochána and the Army.  The army personnel in Spike Island have had several problems because they do not qualify for housing in the Cobh area. I would ask the Minister to get in touch with the Army authorities in Spike Island and Haulbowline in regard to providing housing for these people.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Garda, I know that the NBA built a number of houses for their use in the town of Midleton.  No purchase scheme was available to members of the Garda. For that reason the Gardaí left the agency house and built their own houses.  The agency should play a more active role.  I would envisage them as a kind of commando task force who would have more latitude and freedom of action in dealing with problems as and when they found them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to welcome this Bill and to congratulate the Minister on having decided to treble the amount of capital to be infused into the work of the National Building Agency.  It shows the confidence of the Minister in the future of the country, in its industrial expansion and its population expansion.  The Minister is asking the House to sanction the raising of £15 million for housing purposes.  We are sure that, with good forward planning and with good government, what the Minister envisages will come to pass in the years to come.  We have to admit that mistakes were made by the NBA in the past in regard to the type of house that was provided and the type of environment in which the houses were set.  Perhaps the NBA should not be blamed entirely for this. <Col N="143" /> Perhaps in future mistakes will be made, but it is realised that there will always be a conflict between needs and standards in housing.  If the need arises for a crash programme of housing, the standards are bound to drop.  A careful assessment of needs and standards will have to be made in the future.  We know that in the low-cost building schemes carried out by the NBA the houses today look like those found in a foreign country.  They do not fit into the environment and never will.  They will probably deteriorate to an alarming extent in the years to come.  Perhaps in some cases this could not have been avoided.  When young couples need housing, when there is overcrowding or other conditions which lead to a housing need, conditions such as storm damage or flooding, detailed planning is not possible in order to provide houses that might look well in the future and might also be functionally correct.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that in future attention will be paid to the environmental position and to the standard of the houses.  As was mentioned by other speakers this evening, one must have variety in roofing, in walling and in general layout.  Nothing is so distressing as to see a couple of hundred houses that look exactly the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that when schemes are being planned with a large number of houses the NBA will have a study made of the necessary amenities to be incorporated in the design.  Open spaces, shrubs, trees and flower-beds are needed.  I would not agree with some of the speakers this evening who said that very wide roads must be provided in these housing areas.  That is a mistake considering the price of building land at the moment.  Money cannot be spent on very wide roads. The best idea is to have car-parking spaces or even a garage area, where cars would all be put into a specially designed building, rather than into garages attached to the houses.  Most newly married couples cannot afford to buy very large houses but when the families have increased they turn the garage space into a living-room or <Col N="144" /> some other functional room instead of using it for the car.</P>
    <P>The situation in housing schemes should be examined.  Perhaps cars could be put into a planned building, with each man having his lock and key.  In that way road space could be saved.  All the width needed is sufficient to allow two cars or trucks to pass.  This would be approximately 17 feet.  This would save a tremendous amount of money.  If there is a 24-foot road, with cars parked on each side, maintaining the flow of traffic will cause great problems.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister envisages that 1,000 houses will be needed in County Mayo.  We hope that in the immediate future the plans of the Chicago Bridge and Iron Company for the erection of oil-drilling rigs at Killala will come to fruition. Land has already been acquired and a Japanese firm have acquired 400 acres of land in that immediate vicinity.  We are delighted that this has happened and we hope that when the occasion arises the NBA will get the go-ahead.</P>
    <P>I do not think there will be any problems with regard to the Mayo County Council in relation to this matter.  They have given every planning facility to the firms who propose to start there.  Houses are needed in the areas around Ballina, Killala, Crossmolina, Ballycastle and other small towns, where 3,000 workers are expected to reside during the next two or three years.  I hope that the environmental, housing and road conditions will be properly planned in the early stages and that the mistakes that have occurred in the past will not occur again.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill and hope that he will not be disappointed with the progress that is envisaged in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill as its purpose is to raise capital money to finance the expanding programme of housing for industry.  In reading the Minister's speech, I should like to raise the following points. There are five counties mentioned here and there are 130 houses per year for the coming five years for Galway, <Col N="145" /> that is a total of 650; 274 for Donegal; 200 for Limerick; and 1,000 for Mayo. On that basis alone I want an assurance from the Minister that the money to be spent is not to be spent on a regional basis.  If the proposals for those counties are examined it would appear that the money seems to be directed towards western development.</P>
      <P>Cork is also mentioned with a total of 500 houses in the coming five years. The reason I raise this point is that although there are 30 areas mentioned the midland region seems to be left out.  I cannot recollect many houses being built by the National Building Agency in the midland region.  The NBA came into existence only in 1960.  There were quite a number of houses built in my own county of Offaly.  I know that Bord na Móna are their own building agency and have built their own houses.  The ESB have a number of houses scattered around the county.  However, I think &mdash; although I am not too sure about this &mdash; that most of the ESB houses in County Offaly were built prior to 1960.  It is on that basis that I would direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that the programme tends towards western development in the main, although the Minister mentioned other areas as well.</P>
      <P>When I talk about Offaly I come back to my own town of Clara, where great industrial development has taken place particularly in the past two to three years.  To my knowledge the NBA were interested in providing houses for industrial workers in the town of Clara.  Perhaps the Minister would be in a position today to tell me if he is giving priority to that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not confining myself to Clara but wish to refer to the entire Midlands area.  It has been very much neglected by the National Building Agency in the past.  I would request the Minister to distribute this money on an equitable basis.  The number of houses mentioned in the Minister's speech would absorb a large part of the money raised.  The Midlands are progressing favourably in regard to industrial development and I would <Col N="146" /> ask the Minister to take this into consideration.</P>
    <P>In Offaly there is a need for more and better housing for ESB workers. Shortly we will have an extension to the Shannonbridge power station.  This will naturally involve a housing scheme for that area.  On that basis also I would ask the Minister to ensure that the moneys raised will be spent on an equitable basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, not alone am I prepared to welcome the Bill but I should like to take the opportunity of welcoming the necessity for the Bill.  It augurs well that there is so much confidence in the future.</P>
      <P>The NBA are doing a very fine job of work.  We have had experience of them in Limerick where they are undertaking a scheme of 42 houses, 30 for industrial workers and 12 for the local authority. Our local authority engineers visit the building sites very often and supervise within their own capacity, but I have a doubt as to whether there is sufficient agreement and co-ordination between the local authority engineers and the NBA.  I was disappointed in the Minister's forecast for west Limerick in the next five years.  We have acquired a very big industry and not alone are we looking forward to housing our people there but we are also looking forward to bringing back the people who emigrated from west Limerick in the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not seem to be fully aware of the amount of prosperity in the country.  There is a shortage of contractors in my county and during the past seven or eight months the raising of the ceiling of the loan under the SDA scheme has created an incentive. I am glad to say that Limerick County Council have paid out more in loans in the past nine months than was ever paid out in any nine months in the past 25 years.  I am not praising Limerick but I should like to pay a tribute to our county council.  We have a wonderful county council but the Minister will have to revise his assessment of our potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> I wish to congratulate the Minister on what he is doing and to welcome the Bill.  I sincerely hope the NBA will do as well during the next seven, eight or ten years as they have done in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackGarrett" hpid="Mr. Garrett Mr. Garrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a few points.  First of all I should like to welcome the Bill.  Like other Senators, however, I think it has not gone far enough.  Instead of looking for £15 million it would be more appropriate if we were looking for £35 million to accommodate the NBA.  I do not wish to repeat anything that has already been said on environment and planning. It has been suggested that they build a different type of house in the same locality.  Some planning authorities will not allow any deviation from the landscape, the environment and the plan that is already there.  They insist on that being carried out.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the number of industries we are to get in the west of Ireland in the very near future.  Some of them have been started since last Monday and some of them had started previous to that.  In the Ballina area 1,000 houses will have to be built not to mention what will be needed for the whole of County Mayo.  If the Land Commission move to Castlebar at some future date there will not be much sense in transferring young ladies to work in the Land Commission in Castlebar or in bringing in industrialists to work in industrial estates in the Ballina, Crossmolina or Killala areas unless something can be done to entice the NBA to build a type of flatlet or small house.</P>
      <P>Through Mayo County Council and the county development team, we have tried to get the NBA to build that type of living accommodation but they will not do so.  It is necessary that some organisation should be set up to build that type of flat for young people who may go to work in those towns.  That is the principal necessity in our county at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to impress on the Minister that there will be huge developments in the Killala/Ballina area <Col N="148" /> and if he could get the NBA to consider the idea of building flatlets, having rent collectors or caretakers to look after them, it would be a step in the right direction.  At present the NBA can only build for local authorities or industrialists within a certain plan.  I do not know of any other authority who would undertake this building.  I should like to hear from the Minister if he can in any way influence them to undertake this work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKerrigan" hpid="Mr. Kerrigan Mr. Kerrigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kerrigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In extending a welcome to this Bill which enables the NBA to extend their borrowing powers, I do so with a little reluctance. Though I am aware from the annual report of the NBA and from talking to people from different parts of the country that there are many good schemes because of the good work of the NBA, I will have to sound a note of warning.  In February, 1965, Cork Corporation were worried about their housing output.  It was in no way adequate to meet the heavy demands, so in a discussion with the trade union movement and the builders we explored the possibility of erecting 2,800 local authority houses over a number of years.  In July, 1965, agreement was reached.  At that time the output of houses was averaging 200 a year, by the corporation's own direct labour schemes and partly by local contracts. At that time the corporation had land available at Togher, Mayfield and Glen, approximately 260 acres of land, and the Department of Local Government were doubtful about the corporation's ability or capacity to do this work.  They asked that such work would be handed over to the NBA who would build 1,800 dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contract between the NBA and the contractors was drawn up in May, 1968, and the final handover was made in 1972.  Within a relatively short time 800 houses were built in Cork but as time passed the flow of complaints and problems from the tenants grew in volume and it was obvious that the cause of the dissatisfaction was much more serious than the normal pattern expected from tenants of any new housing scheme.  These problems could be classified in four categories&mdash;<Col N="149" /> financial, environmental, dwelling design and defects.  On the financial aspect, the houses cost an average of £4,500.  This immediately created a high rent and a high maximum on the houses and I am glad to congratulate the Minister and say that since he took office he has helped to alleviate that position.</P>
    <P>From the environmental point of view all the 1,200 houses were identical.  They were built in blocks of six and had no front gardens.  The design was an open plan.  Store houses for prams, bicycles, coal, and costs were placed outside front doors.  The inner sections of the scheme were pedestrianised.  Now we find that refuse vehicles cannot get full access to it and therefore tenants have to haul refuse all over the scheme to get it out to the roadside.</P>
    <P>With regard to the dwelling design, nearly 500 houses were provided with gas central heating.  No fireplaces were provided in these houses and the central heating was unacceptable to most tenants.  In the initial stages explosions occurred in several houses. The windows were of large plate glass, tenants are responsible for the breakages of these windows and these are quite expensive.  A point made by numerous people is that upstairs windows open by sash on top only.  This constitutes a fire hazard.</P>
    <P>In the 700 solid fuel houses, for economy purposes the traditional flue liner in concrete construction was abandoned and replaced by a sectional stainless steel insulator flue.  This treatment in construction did not meet with the Chief Fire Officer's standards and amendments had to be made to all houses.</P>
    <P>The standard range of minor defects are normal in such a scheme but one defect which emerged was a high proportion of houses that had a type of discolouration on the walls, particularly around windows.  Some householders succeeded in keeping it at bay, but in other houses nothing stopped it.  One wall in one house was treated three times in six weeks by the contractors but it still returned.  This particular problem has been referred to a British agency with expertise in <Col N="150" /> such matters.  A report has been forthcoming and it is being examined.</P>
    <P>I think there is something wrong with the basic contract for such schemes.  The NBA and the contractors being the only parties to the contract, the result was a complete lack of involvement of corporation officers during progress of the work.  In effect, Cork Corporation or their officers had no responsibility and this resulted in disinterest and lack of liaison during the term of the contract.  It will be recalled that the corporation were first allowed sight of the plans and layouts on 26th January, 1968.  The final signing of the contract was executed on 30th May, 1968.  For a project of such size, the time afforded allowed little opportunity for the technical officers of the corporation to evaluate all aspects of the proposed scheme.  In fact, work commenced immediately after the contract was signed while corporation officers were still in the process of correspondence seeking clarification of various design points and so on.  The final signing of such a contract should have been deferred until all the corporation officers concerned had been afforded the opportunity to examine fully all proposals and to record the approval of them.</P>
    <P>To deprive 1,200 local authority tenants of the front gardens to which they were traditionally accustomed was a drastic change.  There have been objections incessantly on this matter and many tenants have proceeded to fence in their own plots, often in an unsightly manner.</P>
    <P>The provision of gas central heating in 500 houses was another point that should be watched in future.  No fireplace was provided.  The central heating unit was selected and installed without consultation with the local gas supply company.  Still this local gas company are expected to service these units as well as supply the gas.  Coin meters could not be used for fear of explosion so tenants were faced with large quarterly bills which they could not meet.  As a result, quite a lot of them have been cut off.</P>
    <P>The report on the most prevalent complaint of all &mdash; the fungus, as the <Col N="151" /> tenants usually describe it &mdash; is <i>subjudice</i>, until such time as the contractors and the National Building Agency debate the experts' report.  In future we should be more than careful with schemes of such a size.  Experimentation should be made on small sites and small schemes.  I feel that this scheme was too large for experimentation and for that reason I am very critical of the National Building Agency.  I have spoken to people in other parts of the country who have had traditional houses built but I should like to state that these are not traditional houses.  They are system type houses.  I do not think we have had enough experience to have tried it out in such a large scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all join in welcoming this Bill.  The National Building Agency are an essential part of the task of getting buildings put up for industrial developments in areas where these come rather quickly.  I share a number of the criticisms of the schemes made both in the other House and here &mdash; for example, their drabness and in many cases their lack of proper environmental planning. This of course is to be expected to some extent when we cost the complete criteria.  It is shortsighted.  We should insist that each of those areas is properly provided with a full community centre that will provide an integral development of that community. Even though this may cost quite an amount, it is something that I would be very happy to see borne by this State agency and I think it would make a very positive contribution to the future development of communities.  I would go further and say it would prevent many of the social problems that we have with us in some of our communities, where a great deal of them can be traced to the lack of proper recreational and other facilities.  At a time when we have some confidence in the future&mdash; and I think all parties share this confidence &mdash; we should show this confidence by the level of planning that we put into such development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned about the cost of this.  The Minister has alluded to it <Col N="152" /> here &mdash; the increase of £10 million necessary to finance this.  The provision of housing is one thing, financing is something that should be tackled on a different level.  With today's high interest rates every inducement should be held out to the people getting those houses to purchase them over a reasonable period.  Taking a 20 year purchase scheme the addition for just paying off the capital is only 5 per cent whereas the interest is costing anything from 12 to 14 per cent.  When you have high interest rates the extra little effort to pay a few more per cent and become owners is a good investment for the owners concerned. It is an even better investment for the local authority, who are concerned with regulating and with financing that housing scheme.  Even if they had to pay half the capital involved immediately, it still would be well to induce the tenants to pay some extra percentage and thereby become owners.</P>
    <P>Also, no scheme should be sanctioned until it has incorporated in each house scope for future development: that should be part of the initial plan and the tenant should know of this development potential in the house so that maybe in five or ten years' time, when he needs to add an extra room or two, he will find there is provision for this in the plan and that a sketch is available to show how in the judgment of the original architect the addition could best be carried out.</P>
    <P>In industry today there has been considerable improvement in the earning capacity of the workers.  That should be reflected in the workers, or a large proportion of them, aspiring to ownership and having the pride of ownership in their homes.  Otherwise we are contributing to the development of a type of a classless society that has no roots and no pride in its environment.  It is only through cultivating the ideal of ownership that we can get the pride of citizenship so necessary today.  It is only through an adequate and properly serviced and developed community centre that we can prevent those masses of houses from degenerating into the concrete <Col N="153" /> jungles that have plagued other countries. We need to develop a community spirit here, community spirit that I hope will be Irish in the best sense of the word.</P>

      <P>The Bill goes some way towards meeting the projected demand for industrial housing in the years to come.  The data given by the Minister in his opening speech raises a couple of questions which perhaps should receive some consideration in his reply.  He referred to demand from the western seaboard, the southern seaboard and the north-western seaboard. It strikes me that where the IDA have gone into designated areas, the NBA have gone in also and done the job as requested or required by the IDA.  My experience on these counts is that where local authorities have found themselves having to supply housing for key industrial workers from the normal housing stock, this would appear to me to be an area in which the National Building Agency should have been doing the job.  It may well be that resources of the NBA in the past have been somewhat limited, partly as part of an overall policy between the IDA and themselves. As I have already indicated, they have gone where the IDA have gone and have supplied houses as required in those areas, particularly in the designated areas.</P>
      <P>Local authorities along the eastern and north-eastern seaboard areas have very dense population and they find themselves hard pressed to meet their own housing needs.  It strikes me as strange that the NBA do not seem to be coming into these areas and to be fulfilling to any great extent the housing requirements of industrial workers.  I think of an example in Dundalk some years ago where the county manager was requested at short notice to find houses out of his existing local authority's stock to house key workers who had been brought in from outside the county. By all means, it was a commendable thing that the houses were there to meet this need, but it also left the position that certain local applicants for housing had to stand down from their place in the queue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> I would ask the Minister to give some indication whether there has been what he would regard as a reasonable and a worthy demand from the IDA for housing requirements to be met by the NBA, particularly on the east coast and in the north-eastern area.  The National Building Agency have done great work.  They are a growing baby, as it were, in the field of industrial housing and, like any baby, should not be stunted in their growth.  I have only that one reservation&mdash;that the NBA should try to operate in a slightly larger field than the Minister has indicated to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the NBA were established they have performed a useful role in providing this country with some of the houses which its people required.  They have performed a service which measures up to the best we could expect.  The fact that there is need to allow the agency to acquire further finance is a clear indication of the role they will play in the future.  Therefore, it is important that the NBA be assisted in every way possible to ensure that we have a supply of houses to meet demands.  I have always stated, and I state it again, that we can all rejoice at the fact that there is demand for houses, because if the day ever comes when there ceases to be a demand for houses then we can all start to worry because it will mean that our nation is becoming stagnant.  So long as the demand for houses continues to grow we can all feel content and satisfied that our nation and its people are making progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One serious set-back to any building agency is the lack of suitable building land.  I would ask the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary if they would add new functions and new powers to the NBA to enable them to acquire land for future building, because the price of building land has become a major factor in house costs in recent years.  If the Minister has not power to enable the NBA to broaden their activities, then I say that a new agency should be established to acquire land for future house building.  The activities of such an agency should be concentrated <Col N="155" /> in rural areas because we all know that suitable building land adjoining any town has increased in price many times over because of the fact that people want to reside near suitable towns.  But with the advent of regional water schemes, I see no reason why we cannot move out into the rural areas and provide suitable group schemes serviced by water and sewerage so that houses can be provided at a lower cost.  After all, I think it is the general inclination of many new house owners to reside in peace and quiet.  There is no doubt that they will have that peace and quiet out in the rural areas.  They will also have all the amenities which can be afforded to them in built-up areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department should give serious consideration to the setting up of an authority or a new agency and give them full powers to acquire land to carry out advanced planning because we all know how many local authorities can be held back for years in their efforts compulsorily to acquire land for housing. We know that many towns in rural Ireland have lost industries because of the failure of local authorities to acquire land and because of the long drawn out process of instituting compulsory acquisition orders.  I would give my full support to any efforts the Minister or his Department would make to establish such an agency with powers to acquire land.</P>
    <P>The National Building Agency should give some consideration to the provision of demountable dwellings&mdash; houses that could be taken up and reerected in other areas.  Whenever a major industry is about to be established in an area you will have a great deal of site development and you will have a great deal of planning, engineering, installation of water and sewerage. Therefore the engagement of many people is required in order to carry out all the advance work necessary for the establishment of an industry. When the actual industry itself is established the labour content of that industry may be only a quarter or a fifth of the labour force needed to set up the industry.  If we had a <Col N="156" /> scheme of demountable dwellings which could be used while the workers are engaged in the establishment of the industry, those demountable dwellings could be removed easily and sited in some other area.  I think it is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested too, of course, that the contractors who are on the panel of the NBA are inclined to operate a closed shop.  That is detrimental to competitors tendering and to greater competition in the building industry.  It also tends to debar the small builder from participating in the scheme.  Again that is something that should be looked at and I am sure that the Minister, his Parliamentary Secretary and his officials in the Department will give it serious consideration.</P>
    <P>It is also worth mentioning that we are talking about this Bill at a time of a serious fuel crisis.  New thinking must be done on the design of houses so that every effort will be made to erect a dwelling which will require a minimum of heat.  We should have new methods of designing buildings. We should have greater emphasis placed on draught-proofing.  The cost of heating any of our new buildings will be prohibitive and I do not see any signs of this country ever being supplied with cheap heating oil again. As we all know homes must be heated. Therefore, greater efforts must be made to provide adequate insulation to ensure that homes can be kept at a warmer temperature with the minimum of cost.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that in the Minister's speech no reference whatsoever has been made to any advance building in the Midlands.  I do not know why he picked those regions, possibly because of the fact that the contractors in the Midlands are capable of dealing with the amount of building which is being done.  I would have been pleased if the activities of the National Building Agency were directed towards providing houses in County Westmeath which is in the heart of the Midlands. There is need for such development there.  It is good that there is always need for the erection of houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> I should like to see greater variety in house design.  This is an aspect that is worthy of serious consideration because it can be boring to see scheme after scheme of houses all erected on similar lines.  We should ensure as far as possible that we would have well designed groups of houses erected in rural areas convenient to industries and to towns where all the requirements and necessities of life can be purchased. The more houses we group together, the more people we will have congregating together and the more we are inclined to create that sick society.</P>
    <P>This takes me back to the problem of acquiring building land.  Every builder tries to erect as many houses as possible in the smallest space possible. There are thousands of acres of land in rural Ireland awaiting development and serious consideration must be given to making use of all this land. Whenever a scheme is designed it is necessary that provision be made for having adequate recreational facilities. Leisure-time facilities must be provided for children, for the old and for others.</P>
    <P>That is all I wish to say on this Bill. I join with the other speakers in their comments on the activities of the NBA and I suggest that serious consideration be given to establishing an agency which would have full powers to acquire land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the congratulations extended to the Minister from all sides of the House on the introduction of this Bill.  I welcome in particular the raising of the limit of the amount to be borrowed by the National Building Agency from £5 million to £15 million and, also, the increase from 150 to 600 in the number of houses to be built.  That is a clear indication of the Minister's faith in the industrial development of the country.  I should like also to draw attention to the cases specifically mentioned here with regard to development in Mayo, Donegal and Cork, particularly in regard to Mayo and Donegal.  These are counties which could do with a greater injection of capital and with the promotion of local industries.  I <Col N="158" /> welcome the suggested number of houses to be erected in these two counties.  Cavan and Leitrim are two of the three counties that showed a continued decline in population in the last census.  While I do not take it that the fact that they are not specifically mentioned here means that industrial development is not foreseen for that part of the country, I should like to remind the Minister that these are areas that show a continued decline in population.  The further south you go in the country it is not generally realised that Partition, apart from being a national problem, is also an economic one as it affects the parts of the country which are along the Border.  Development in counties Cavan, Leitrim and Donegal, which are situated along the Border, has been inhibited.  Economic development has been inhibited by the existence of the Border.  Further industrial development and the provision of housing to attract key industrial workers and management personnel would tend to reduce the economic difficulties that have arisen and developed as a result of Partition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the Minister for his assurance that he has given instructions and has asked that greater attention be paid to planning and to the environment when houses are being constructed by the National Building Agency.  It would be agreed generally that to erect a number of houses for families with large numbers of children and to make no effort to provide a playing place for these growing children could prove to be a strong factor in juvenile delinquency.  In all housing schemes in the future, whether they are under the National Building Agency or local authorities or whatever, it should be accepted that there is adequate provision for recreational facilities for children.  In so far as the Minister is striving to attain that, he is to be congratulated sincerely.  The point raised by Senator Markey is very valid.  In some cases local authorities, in order to assist in attracting industries to their own areas, have had to make available for key workers in an industry houses that were erected by <Col N="159" /> the local authority.  I cite the specific case of Bailieboro, where the Cavan County Council built 20 houses recently. It was considered by the council that it would be a wise thing to allocate four or these houses to key workers being attracted to industry in the town of Bailieboro.  That is a case where the National Building Agency could step in and supplement the work of the local authority.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal to be said for having some distinctive characteristic in different housing estates.  There is nothing more likely to dampen pride in your surroundings than to have rows of houses all of uniform design with no outstanding characteristics. It should be part of the aim of housing authorities to ensure that one row of houses is not identical with another.  If that is done the occupants of the houses will have more pride in their own area.  These people could, by the planting of shrubs and so on, add something to the beauty or attractiveness of the houses in which they live.  If all the houses are built on exactly the same plan, then there is a strong danger that people might lose pride in the home as distinct from pride in the house.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that more thought will be given to the planning and the development of special amenities for housing estates. In that way the Minister is performing a very great service.  Before he became Minister he was for years an active member of a local authority.  The experience he gained there of the deficiencies and of the lack of novelty and variety in these housing estates he is putting to good use now and is helping to create a different kind of approach to the building of houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I reckon that about one-third of our time in the Seanad and perhaps in the whole of the Oireachtas is spent discussing Bills of this nature &mdash; Bills under which we are voting sums of money or increases in borrowing power to State bodies or semiState organisations.  The general welcome that Bills of this nature get indicates that we recognise the need for such bodies in this country.  We are <Col N="160" /> not a very rich country and it is essential that the Government and their agencies should step in and fill the gaps which cannot be filled by private industry or financed by the ordinary means.</P>
      <P>Last week we voted a sum of practically £50 million towards CIE.  There are various ways in which the money could be spent or borrowing powers taken up.  This week we are discussing the increase in the borrowing power of the National Building Agency by £10 million.  The one thing that worries me about these debates is that we always seem to be signing blank cheques.  We vote an increase in borrowing power of £10 million without any real indication from the Minister, except for fairly vague and woolly statements in his speech, how the money will be spent.  We are to have no detailed account until the National Building Agency produce their report for the current year.</P>
      <P>However, arguing for more detail does not mean that I do not support the spirit of the Bill, because I certainly do.  I am pleased to see the number of new houses being built.  I would join with the other Senators in their general comments about the preservation of the environment, about the need for community development and for houses in areas where there is new industry. I am particularly pleased to see that in County Cork there is an expectation of about 500 industrial houses being built in the near future. I hope that some of this development will be channelled towards Midleton, which is a rapidly growing industrial area and where the major distilling complex in the country is being built at the moment by Irish Distillers. There will be a rapid and large increase in employment there and a considerable expansion in industry.</P>
      <P>The basic philosophy behind the National Building Agency is one which we all support.</P>
      <P>There are problems to be borne in mind when we discuss the provision of houses, for example, as many Members have already pointed out, there is the problem of the cost of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see some rapid Government action along the lines <Col N="161" /> recommended in the Kenny Report.  I am a bit distressed by the Government statement of the 26th January, 1974, which says that they accept in principle the concept suggested in the majority report in that document but that they intend to delay decisions pending consultation with all the interested bodies. It is the second part of this statement that worries me &mdash; the delayed decision pending consultation.  This can often mean in political terms that a decision is being put off for good and all.  We have seen so many examples of this over the whole political life of this country.  Statements like this are really cloaking the fact that Governments do not want to take decisions which are unpopular with some sections of the community but are necessary for the community's good as a whole.  I would urge the Government to get on with these consultations and start taking a few decisions.  Then I will say they are being a Government, not just a consulative body which are discussing matter <i>ad infinitum</i> and never reaching any decisions.  This is a malaise that affects all Governments.  The test of this Government is whether they can reach decisions and subsequently, implement them.  This is the test of a Government, not the fact that they go around consulting with all and sundry &mdash; because that of course can be used as a great delaying tactic.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Kenny Report being implemented and I should like to see the designated areas scheme being put into operation quickly.  My personal preference would be for a more drastic scheme involving land acquisition and land nationalisation.  I realise that, as the report suggests, this might conflict with Article 43 of the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if the Senator would not go into detail on this point; though it is generally relevant to the National Building Agency a detailed discussion would not be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that fact and I do not intend to go into a detailed discussion now.  I feel however that this matter is of such importance that it should be put down for debate as <Col N="162" /> a motion before the Seanad.  I hope to do this.  Clearly the decision on the acquisition of building lands affects the operation of the National Building Agency.  A clear and definite decision by the Government on this matter would facilitate the National Building Agency in future planning and financing and these are the issues we are talking about now.</P>
      <P>Several Senators have mentioned that since the NBA are a Government agency, they should take the lead in matters of environmental planning.  It is proper that a Government agency should not be behind private developers.  They should be in the forefront when it comes to planning, the preservation of the environment and matters of community development and community good.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to one specific matter.  I have a charming picture here of the Minister being presented with a copy of the An Taisce Report, <i>The Case for Tree Preservation in Ireland.</i> I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary is not in the picture as well. No doubt he would have added to the glamour of the occasion.  This is an important report produced by a responsible body.  It particularly affects development in urban areas.  It is sad to record and to read in this report that the local authorities have not been blameless in the matter of cutting down trees, trees which do so much for the urban areas in which they grow.  The local authorities have not been to the fore in putting on tree preservation orders to ensure that the trees in areas scheduled for development are preserved.  This is something of importance; it is a matter in which the National Building Agency should set an example for the rest of the country.  We should not have to continually urge local authorities to look at problems of the environment.  They should be taking the lead and setting examples for private developers.  I hope the Minister will not ignore the fact that the environment has been referred to by many other speakers and will ensure that the National Building Agency take this into account in their future developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that I <Col N="163" /> think the agency do a good job.  I am pleased to see an increase in their borrowing power.  I agree that it is important to encourage the residents to acquire their own houses over specified periods because it helps to give them pride in their dwellings and something that one owns oneself is something that one will treasure and look after.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill.  As a member of a local authority I am aware of housing requirements and housing needs generally.  My only regret is that, instead of authorising £15 million, the Bill does not seek £20 million or £25 million for the expansion and improvement of housing generally.  When the NBA came into being they were envisaged by many as an organisation that would be efficient and thorough in the execution of building in areas where factories were to be set up and where there was demand for housing over and above the ordinary requirement's that normally confront local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien made reference to something that happened in Cavan, something to which I also must refer. There was a similar occurrence in Longford.  As a result of the setting up of a welcome industry in Longford, 11 or 12 local authority houses were occupied by key workers and operators.  The Minister's speech sounded rather hollow in our ears since it is Cork and the western and north-western seaboards that are to benefit most from the increased moneys to be provided. I wish to refer to towns such as Longford, Mullingar and Granard, where industries are already set up by the IDA.  I had the pleasure of being present at the opening of an industry in Granard where we were informed that 300 workers would be required over the next three years.  If expansion is going to be that rapid it is into a place like this that the Minister and the National Building Agency should be directing money for the immediate provision of houses.  Housing requirement has to do with people and, irrespective of whether you are <Col N="164" /> working in a new industry or whether you are a key official in a public authority, or an official of the Government, you require a house.  What authority provides a house for you should be determined on whether you are somebody new coming in as a result of an industry, as a result of a new school, and so on, or whether you are the ordinary type of person who requires a house as a result of growth in the town population.  It is wrong that a local authority should make a survey of the housing needs of the working-class in, say, 1971 or 1972, and erect these houses in 1974.  When the scheme is finished, they say: &ldquo;You people who required these houses and whom we took account of when drawing up the scheme cannot get a third of the houses, because they must be kept for key workers&mdash;people who are coming here and who never before put their foot in this town.&rdquo;  That is not fair.  The Industrial Development Authority and the National Building Agency should co-operate in determining what number of houses are required in an area.  When an industry is being set up the National Building Agency should get a direction to provide a certain number of houses&mdash;say, 60, 80 or 100.  As a result of the experience of many members of public authorities, this is the most appropriate way in which the NBA could pursue the policy of easing the housing difficulty and leaving the local authorities to deal with the ordinary problems that arise in their own sphere of activities.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the planning of the environmental location, structuring and lay-out of houses is something that I subscribe to.  I concede that if an industry is set up, a housing scheme should be in proximity to it.  If it is in a housing area on one side of a town, the NBA or the local authority should provide a layout for the houses that would give an image of beauty and preserve the natural beauty of the area.  It is a pity to see a row of brown-tiled or green-tiled houses, or so many houses that if you walked into one house and came out and went into another 100 houses away, you could not see any difference in appearance of them.  They should be some <Col N="165" /> variation which might be regarded as a concession to beauty and art.</P>
    <P>The Minister would do well to consider industrial areas in the Midlands where there is a likelihood of an expansion of population.  While he is being fair in dealing with the western counties, Longford is one of the 12 western counties.  It is one of the counties that needs an industrial boost.  In order to give an impetus towards industrial development and an increase in employment, there must be an increase in housing accommodation for the people who will work there.  While I welcome the IDA's efforts to provide factories and welcome the people who come to work in those industries, I should like them to come to stay&mdash;not to come and collect a package and go away.  The counties that need the greatest help should get it soon.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in complimenting the Minister and I wish him the very best of luck with this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speakers, I, too, welcome this Bill, but with reservations.  As Senators Garrett and Kilbride have said, the amount sought falls short of requirements. In 1969, when we were in Government, I said in this House&mdash; it can be read in the Official Report &mdash;that the NBA were not looking for half enough money.  Time has proved me right, particularly when I see a reference by the Minister to the low-cost housing project.  The reason why we had to have a low-cost housing project was that we did not ask or get enough money then.  With the amount of money that is now being asked for, we will have at the end of the term another low-cost housing project, because at least twice as much money should have been sought.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I welcome the Bill because it is serving a particular area, that is, the west coast.  This is an area which, much to the amazement of everybody, has increased industrial employment.  There has been less emigration over the last ten years. It is at last, a thriving part of this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, enough has not been done by the National Building Agency in <Col N="166" /> that area.  For instance, in Tuam we have had several new industries over the last three or four years and the burden of housing the workers in those industries has fallen on the local council and the local town commissioners. We have made efforts to house them but we have not much money available to us.  This is an area where the National Building Agency could have and should have helped out, especially when we in the Galway County Council tried to help.</P>
    <P>I note, too, what has been said by the Minister with regard to Mayo and I do not like the wording of it.  Senator Garrett is the chairman of Mayo County Council and I am sure he is well aware that the new industries in Killala are a reality.  Two major industries are to be set up there that will need housing from the National Building Agency.  The estimate of 1,000 houses for Mayo is a small estimate.</P>
    <P>There is a word in the Minister's statement I do not like and I think it should be changed.  In the last paragraph of page 2 he says: &ldquo;The main areas which will benefit from expansion of the agency's industrial housing activities in the next five years are Galway city and county&rdquo; where 130 houses a year are to be built.  There are plans for 274 houses in County Donegal and 200 houses will be needed in County Limerick.  Then comes the point.  We are told that in County Mayo up to 1,000 houses may be required as a result of the establishment of major new industries.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be deleted and the word &ldquo;will&rdquo; inserted.  I would not like to see any way in which the Minister could slip out of a situation where the National Building Agency will have a commitment because Mayo, Galway or any of the western countries cannot supply on demand a quantity of housing to the extent that will be needed.</P>
    <P>In Galway we have learned from experience that it is physically impossible for us, as a local authority, to keep up with the housing expansion required in this field.  We hear a lot of talk about land prices but it is the demand that has caused land speculation and high land prices.  If the <Col N="167" /> National Building Agency were doing their job correctly and if they will do their job correctly in the future, the local authority would only be a second housing agency.  The primary one would be the National Building Agency.  I would suggest to the Minister, even at this late stage, to rethink the matter.  He should go back and have a look at the figures again and plan, for the next four years, a good National Building Agency programme under which the key workers, skilled and semi-skilled, can be housed and not have the blame thrown back on the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Everything in this Bill is not as rosy as it seems.  For instance, I have been in this House since 1969 and I have never heard of the excuse being made that everything would be better now. I refer to the first paragraph of page 2 where the Minister has the audacity to say: &ldquo;I hope that as a result of my directions to the agency and of the augmentation of its board of directors by new members having special experience in housing such inadequacies will not be evident in future schemes.&rdquo; I think he left a piece out of that statement because I am not so naive as to think&mdash;and I do not think anybody in this House is&mdash;that the important part of getting on this board of directors is that you had special experience in housing.  There were some other special experiences you had to have too.</P>
    <P>The first consideration would probably be that you would have to give these posts to members of the Fine Gael Party.  The second one would be that you would have to give them to members of the Labour Party.  I do not know which one would come first.  Somehow I think Fine Gael would.  And the third one would be that you should know a little bit about housing.  I have heard many an excuse put up in this House which said something is going to be cleaned up to make it look better, but this is the best joke I have ever heard used in this House to get out of a situation. That is not a fact at all.  The fact is that you have not got enough money and you have not asked for enough <Col N="168" /> money.  That is the proper excuse.  A few bob to a few directors will not solve the problem, particularly if they are on the Government side of the House, because that is only putting a pack of &ldquo;yes men&rdquo; into the job.  You are only changing the flag.</P>
    <P>The Minister should go back and ask for more money to do the job.  It is a job that has to be done, particularly on the western seaboard where the local authorities have not got the money and cannot get it to house those people coming in to work in new industries.  It is a commitment that must be seriously looked at.  For what it is worth, I welcome the few bob, but another look should be taken at the situation.  For instance, if the National Building Agency do not increase their allocations of money the Government must consider giving greater housing grants.  They should certainly be increased to double the present amount, particularly in those ares where a demand for housing has been created by new industries.</P>
    <P>The type of housing to be built is a matter that I need not go into because I am sure everybody is aware that we must try to improve the houses each time.  No matter how good you make them with a limited amount of money, the next time round people will say that they should be made still better, and rightly so. The environment should be protected. We would expect better development and a better type and quality of house in the future.  Senator Keegan has well said that, in the designing of houses, we should look into the heating aspect.  The cost of heating in houses nowadays is reaching an appalling level.  This aspect should get serious consideration by the Government.</P>
    <P>Taking this document for what it is worth, there is some effort made to try and help.  There are some good jokes in it as well and maybe at the end of the day the Minister may see fit to increase this allocation.</P>

      <P>There may be some confusion here.  Some of the complaints I have heard concerned the amount of housing that would be <Col N="169" /> provided.  People were talking in general terms rather than talking about the Bill before the House, which seeks an increase of £10 million for the National Building Agency to supplement local housing authority funds and not to supplant existing schemes.</P>
      <P>The Minister in announcing the programme has answered a great many of the criticisms in advance.  He said he wanted the National Building Agency to organise on his behalf an emergency housing programme to supplement the maximum output of local authority houses.  In other words, there is no question of supplanting what the local authorities are doing.  He went on to say that he envisaged the local authorities producing 8,000 houses by the year 1975 or 1976.  He offered the local authorities consultation and participation and also the possibility of many tenders and designs.</P>
      <P>Under the emergency programme procedures of the EEC he advertised in an EEC journal in accordance with the directives that were laid down by the EEC countries.  Looking through the report we find he is not looking for £10 million just for the sake of looking for it.  He is looking for £10 million because he says he knows exactly what he is going to do with it. He says he intends that a programme will be concentrated in areas of greatest demand arising either from social conditions or from economic development. He went on to ask the housing authorities to review the position in their own area as a matter of urgency and the indicate the extent to which extra houses would be required under the programme and also the position as to the availability of serviced land and so on.  He made clear his intentions that the houses to be provided under the programme would be bigger and of better quality than the present dwellings provided under the guaranteed order project.  He also said there should be emphasis on soundness of construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout today's debate there has been quite an amount of criticism. If some of the things that were alleged prove to be true, then the criticism is quite justifiable.  But <Col N="170" /> whether those things are taken care of when this Bill is before the House for approval, whether the £10 million is adequate to meet all of the demands, it is fair comment to say that more money could be looked for.  I think it is a great step considering the maximum borrowing power was only £2 million; then it went up to £5 million, and now it has been increased by £10 million.  It has been a very substantial jump.  It is not a bottomless purse. Consequently, having regard to the substantial jump in the amount of money, to the other conditions the Minister laid down in his statement, in regard to advertising and the fact that the people who tender will have to have their tenders properly evaluated&mdash;not like in the past where there may have been some deficiencies, which were criticised&mdash;to my mind he has to a great extent dealt with many of the problems that have been raised here today.</P>
    <P>The question of drabness of design and so on has been referred to repeatedly.  That was discussed at length in the Dáil.  The Minister in his opening address today mentioned it.</P>
    <P>He said:</P>
    <P>The Bill was generally welcomed in the Lower House where a helpful debate raised some important matters directly connected with the purposes of the Bill.  Concern was expressed, for example, at the drabness and lack of variety of many housing schemes.  A complaint which could fairly be levelled at many private and public schemes besides those built by the agency. Deputies also echoed criticism in Press reports of alleged defects in some agency schemes.</P>
    <P>The question really before us is: has the Minister, in the light of those criticisms in the Lower House, as he described it, and the criticisms that have been made today, gone far enough in seeking £10 million?  And when you relate that to the conditions he has laid down, is he doing the job properly?  The answer you must come up with is that it is a great step forward and a brave adventure.  Consequently not only would I welcome the <Col N="171" /> Bill for its content but also for the anticipation the Minister showed of the measure that would be needed.</P>
    <P>Senator West felt that the Bill did not describe how the money would be spent.  The statement made by the Minister in May, 1973, went a great deal of the way towards saying how the money would be spent.  On that basis I welcome the Bill, and hope that it will have a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to comment on a few points that arise from the Minister's speech.  In relation to the development of Galway city I am always pleased when people propose to release more money for the building of houses.  I have always held the opinion that a roof over one's head is a basic right a minimum to which one is entitled if one is adequately to participate in society.  The point I want to make concerning the proposed development of industrial houses is this: I am concerned that there are different kinds of houses being built by the National Building Agency.  In the public Press the phrases &ldquo;executive-type housing&rdquo; and &ldquo;workers' houses&rdquo; have been used.  In other words, there is a class difference between the type of house required by an executive, a managing director of a company, and an ordinary worker.  What this means is that there is a land use dimension to the traditional class difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would welcome the Minister's assurance on another point as well. In the present case of Galway city over one-third of the population is living in an area to the west as one goes towards the north-western side. They have totally inadequate recreational facilities.  It is proposed, I believe by the National Building Agency, that the existing open spaces will be made available for&mdash;this is a quotation from the local paper&mdash;&ldquo;executive-type homes&rdquo;.  This means that some people who have struggled hard to purchase their houses under the exploiting building societies may have dashed whatever hope they might have had for recreational facilities for their families by the activities of <Col N="172" /> the National Building Agency.  I would hope that there would be an assurance that any future houses built would not decrease the limited area of recreational space in Galway city.  I should also like to seek an assurance on this. I do not see why money being spent should be spent in this manner of having a distinction between ordinary workers' houses and what I could call &ldquo;executive homes&rdquo;.  In Galway city and on its outskirts, towards the western side particularly, we see many £20,000 bungalows and £30,000 bungalows built by executives and for executives. I am, admittedly, worried about the manner in which the money will be spent.  I am asking the Minister first for an assurance that the activity of the National Building Agency will not perpetuate a class difference&mdash;and I am sure I am speaking for all Senators&mdash;and that the quality of houses built for workers will be equal to the quality of these executive homes; secondly, I am making the point that the activity of the National Building Agency, where they decide to build, should not cut across the very limited space available, and I am speaking here about that section which refers to proposed development in Galway. Finally, in so far as what is proposed here is expenditure of sums of money in relation to housing industrial workers, I want to suggest that is not sufficient in itself.  It is a limited step, but if it involves the building of more houses, then it is to be welcomed but there are certain provisos which I would make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Begley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate.  It was refreshing to see so many participate in it.  I suppose it was inevitable, having heard Senators McGlinchey, Garrett, Lyons, William O'Brien, Russell and Kerrigan that the Senators in the eastern counties might feel that they were left out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the NBA are concerned, if they are asked by the IDA to do a <Col N="173" /> particular job in an area they will be only too glad to do so.  I hope that the next time we are back here the Senators from the eastern side of the country will be getting as much as the Senators from the west are getting now.</P>
    <P>Senator McGlinchy made a number of points.  He dealt at some length on the Minister's statement in Dáil Éireann about housing output.  I do not propose to range over the whole field of housing as he did.  I should like to point out that the NBA are being effectively used by the Government in their efforts to step up the housing output.  As far as industrial housing is concerned, the agency are stepping up their programme for the coming five years to 600 houses annually.  On the local authority side, the agency programme provides for 2,250 houses this year, increasing to 2,500 next year.  In 1972-73, 1,700 local authority houses were built by the NBA.  I hope that in the coming year the local authorities will build at least 6,500 houses.  That is a 12 per cent increase on the number built in 1972-73.  The average annual increase over the preceding six years was only 7 per cent.  It is now 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>Senator McGlinchy also raised the question of the NBA building houses for gardaí.  The Department of Justice have made it clear that they do not want any extension of the NBA activities in the provision of houses for gardaí.  The Department are fully aware that the agency's services are available to them should they change their minds.  The Department of Defence are considering whether more houses are needed for Army personnel.  If they come to us we will be only too glad to provide the houses where they are needed.</P>
    <P>Senator McGlinchy referred to the 90-house scheme planned by the NBA in Letterkenny.  I understand that this is the first part of a major development which will include a mixed housing development.  We hope adequate open spaces and community services will be provided.  The plans have been fully discussed with the local housing and planning authorities who have to be satisfied with the provisions.  It is <Col N="174" /> open to these authorities to require back passages and wider roads if they want them.  So far as the Minister is concerned, the reasonable requirements of the local authority will always be met by the NBA.</P>
    <P>Senator McGlinchy also referred in passing to a scheme built by the agency in Milford, County Donegal.  I agree with the Senator that there were genuine grounds for grievance about some houses built by the agency under the previous administration. Because we realised this, the present Minister has laid down policies which should avoid any repetition of poor quality planning and poor quality building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>

      <P>The Senator knows what to do it he wishes to come back to the Minister.  I am quite sure the Minister will be sympathetic towards any point he has to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Russell said he had never been convinced of the need for the agency.  He thought that local authorities, if they had the funds, could do the job equally well.  The role of the National Building Agency is supplementary. They are only doing what is not done by local authorities.  There is no overlaping between the agency and other bodies concerned with housing. The close consultation between the agency and other bodies ensures this.  The 200 houses to be built in <Col N="175" /> County Limerick only represent the programme put forward by the Industrial Development Authority.  If more houses are needed they will be built. Houses for Alcan workers will be built in the county area of Limerick.</P>
    <P>The Senator also spoke of the need for amenity centres.  The Minister has given instructions that there will be proper provision for amenities in housing schemes in future.</P>
    <P>Senator Dolan spoke about roads. He said that the NBA should build roads where they are needed.  The NBA have nothing to do with roads except those in their housing developments. Senator Dolan also pointed out that greater attention should be paid to places in the north and east. I said at the outset that the NBA are only an agency.  They do not take the initiative in industrial housing, but act on the advice of the IDA.</P>
    <P>Senator Dolan expressed an interest in finding out where the agency are building industrial houses.  The details are shown in our annual report and copies are available in the Library. If he or any other Senator wishes to get any further information, we shall be only too glad to provide him with it.</P>
    <P>Senator McAuliffe and a number of other Senators spoke about the monotony of housing schemes.  I would hope that there would be a greater variety in NBA schemes in future, although it will be appreciated that in large schemes there must be a degree of standardisation in order to keep up production and the speed of building, and inevitably to keep down the cost.</P>
    <P>Senator Seán Brosnan referred to the people who were coming back from England.  If the IDA recommended to the NBA that houses should be built for people who are coming back, we will be only too glad to investigate their recommendation and, if possible, build the houses for them.</P>
    <P>Some Senators made the point that the Minister is too modest in seeking only £10 million extra.  I am satisfied that this amount should be sufficient for the next four years or so.  The <Col N="176" /> Oireachtas can then decide if the agency are worthy of support.  This money is being used to finance houses provided for industry, a branch that represents only about 1 per cent of total housing output.  In the present year the agency will spend about £1 million on industrial housing but the Government are providing a further £6 million or £7 million in the public capital programme to assist other aspects of the national housing programme. The £68 million this year represents an increase of practically 50 per cent over the £46 million provided in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>Senators Lyons and Garrett referred to low cost NBA houses.  The NBA are already in close contact with the IDA as far as Mayo is concerned. We hope to acquire land there to provide the necessary houses which will be needed for industrial purposes.</P>
    <P>Senator Cowen and other Senators pressed to have more houses built by the NBA in Midland counties.  If we take this area as comprising the counties of Cavan, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Offaly, Roscommon and Westmeath, we find that the agency have recently completed industrial houses there and that further building is in progress or being planned in these countries.  The total number is 123.</P>
    <P>Senator Garrett said he would like to see the NBA building flatlets in County Mayo.  This has been fully examined by the NBA, the Department, the IDA and the county council. The difficulty is that it would be impossible for the NBA to manage them from Dublin.  We believe management is much more appropriate to housing authorities.  The NBA are just a construction agency.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey again made the point about the east coast versus the west coast.  At the outset I said to you that we will build houses if the IDA ask us to do so.  If houses are needed in a particular locality, the NBA will be only too glad to do the necessary investigations and build the houses if the investigations prove to be that the houses should be built there.</P>
    <P>Senator Keegan said that there <Col N="177" /> should be some new thinking in regard to house design.  The Minister has this whole question under review.  At present An Foras Forbartha and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards are examining the whole matter and I hope we will have a report within the next six months.</P>
    <P>Senators Keegan and West recommended that local authorities and the National Building Agency should acquire land well in advance of requirements.  It is the Minister's view that this is a job for the local authorities. The local authorities now hold sufficient land to accommodate something in the region of 36,500 houses, apart from 15,000 more sites on which housing schemes are already being planned, making a total of more than 50,000 sites.  More land is being acquired all the time by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Senator Killilea also said there was need for more housing.  The NBA have a scheme at the moment for four houses in Tuam.  Normally the agency get advice from the IDA.  At the end of December there was a firm order from the IDA for a number of houses needed for industry in Tuam.  The figure they have come up with is four.</P>
    <P>Senator West said local authorities and the NBA should be encouraged to pay special attention to landscaping in housing schemes.  I could not agree with him more.  In particular we have asked that existing trees be preserved wherever possible.  That is the hope of all of us here.</P>
    <P>Senator Michael Higgins referred to the building of executive type houses in Newcastle.  I think Senator Higgins must be aware that the agency must provide the type of house which the IDA ask to have built. Their programme is geared to meet the specific needs indicated by new industrial concerns or expanding industries. The NBA will not build if private enterprise housing is already meeting that need.  The fact must be faced that key executive or managerial personnel may be vital to the success of a new industrial enterprise. As the Senator knows, if the IDA request that type of house the NBA must provide it for them in order to <Col N="178" /> ensure that the person remains in that locality.</P>
    <P>I have not much more to say. Again I want to thank Senators for their contributions to this Bill.  We are delighted that everybody is in earnest about it.  We hope to play our part in keeping the NBA going.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise on this section because I am not satisfied with the reply the Parliamentary Secretary gave to me in connection with a scheme of industrial houses to be built by the National Building Agency.  We are being asked today to provide the sum of £10 million for industrial houses. All of us would wish that these houses would be of the best possible quality and design.  I gave the Minister an example of a scheme that I consider very badly designed&mdash;a scheme that certainly is not looking to the future. I did so having quoted the Minister's speech last week when he assured Dáil Éireann that as long as he is Minister for Local Government the mistakes of the past will not be allowed to be repeated.  When I tried to show him that those mistakes are being repeated this very week the Parliamentary Secretary told me in his reply that it was the responsibility of the planning department of the local authority to ensure that this would not happen.  I agree that the planning authority have a heavy responsibility in this matter. When one studies the plan&mdash;a plan for 100 houses to be built immediately and for a further 100 to be built at a future date&mdash;and when one takes into consideration that the roadways in this plan are only 20 feet wide in the year 1974 and that there are no provisions for open spaces for playgrounds or for anything else, I believe that it is the responsibility of the Minister to have <Col N="179" /> immediate discussions with the National Building Agency to ensure that the assurance that he gave Dáil Éireann last week is implemented. There is no point in making statements such as he made last week without the proper follow-up.  I should like to have an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that the Minister will take steps to ensure that not alone the houses in Donegal but the Houses to be built by the agency in other parts of this country have standards similar to those insisted upon from private developers.</P>

      <P>To a certain extent I should like to support Senator McGlinchey on this.  Knowing the Minister, I believe he will honour the statement he made in the Dáil.  I have no hesitation in saying that.  However, I support Senator McGlinchey in his request to the Minister that he should call in the NBA and point out to them what is required.  I am glad that Senator McGlinchey has brought this particular plan to the notice of the Seanad.  We have sufficient concrete jungles throughout this country at the moment without adding to them.  While houses are important I think it is equally as important that we should have open spaces and parks and not just a conglomeration of houses that can be built on every open space available. I am sure this debate will bring it to the attention of the Minister.  I would suggest that any member of a local authority who has the same problem should bring it to the attention of the Minister, because while the Minister wants houses built he also wants facilities available to those who live in those houses.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator McGlinchey, the scheme of industrial houses in Letterkenny cannot be built, as I said at the outset, unless it is approved by the local planning authority.  The plans have been submitted to the local authority.  The ball is in his court.  If the scheme is objectionable, they can refuse permission or furthermore appeal to the Minister against granting <Col N="180" /> permission.  The width of the roadway was decided by the NBA in consultation with the local officials.  The Department's inspector has seen and approved of the plans.  I should like to point out that under the previous administration the width of these roads was 18 feet.  We have made it 20 feet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did not state where roadways of 18 feet were constructed. It is true to say that during the war housing schemes with 18 feet or indeed 16 feet roadways were permitted.  The people living in these areas have suffered ever since.  I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary was present earlier this evening when I gave an example of a housing application made by Letterkenny Urban Council to the Department of Local Government some seven or eight years ago.  On that occasion the width of the road was 20 feet.  The Department of Local Government refused to sanction it on the grounds that it was much too narrow.  The Department then insisted that the width of the roadway should be 24 feet.  We now have the situation where possibly in all schemes being built by the NBA roadways are to be 20 feet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the parking of cars and so on, this will become a dangerous hazard for young children in the years to come.  Now is the time to stop it.  I have the feeling that the NBA are still attempting to provide schemes as cheaply as possible.  It does not matter which Government are in office, all of us want to see schemes built with the proper amenities for the families that will have to spend the rest of their days in them.  If I were playing politics I would have kept quiet at this juncture and waited until the scheme was built and then point out to the Minister the mistakes that were made despite his assurance.  This would be very wrong because I accept that everyone in public life, irrespective of his political views, wants to see the people housed, and housed properly. I still think that the standards being set by the National Building Agency throughout the country may require, and I emphasise the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, <Col N="181" /> reviewing at this stage before mistakes are made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic purpose of the Bill is to change the Exchequer financial year and the local financial year, both of which end on the 31st March under present law, so that as from the 1st January, 1975, they will coincide with the calendar year.  As a transitional measure, the Bill provides that the nine-months period from the 1st April, 1974, to the 31st December, 1974, will form a separate financial period for both Exchequer and local authority purposes.  The nine-months financial period will have its own estimates, budget, accounts and local rates.</P>
      <P>The Government have also decided in principle to change the income tax year, which ends on the 5th April, to coincide with the calendar year but provision for this is not however included in the present Bill.  Having regard to the complexity of the income tax code and of the detailed arrangements which will have to be made for a transition to a calendar income tax year, it will be appreciated that lengthy preparatory work will be needed.  An example of a practical aspect involved in a change of income tax year is the effect on the agreements which we have negotiated with other countries for the avoidance of double taxation.  Of particular interest would be the implications for our agreement with Britain where the authorities have not yet indicated a timetable for adopting the calendar year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even without a change of tax year <Col N="182" /> at this stage the change of Exchequer and local financial years will be in our best interests, nationally and internationally.  Our own budgetary preparations will of course be facilitated since much of the economic statistics and projections which guide policy formulation is already on a calendar year basis.  The finances and accounts of the original six member states of the European Communities and of the EEC Commission are on a calendar year basis so that a change to the same basis in our case will be of considerable practical advantage to us in our dealings with the Communities and the Commission.</P>
    <P>More important still, the changeover will help in the co-ordination of the economic and budgetary policies of the member states which is an accepted aim of the Communities and is of course essential for progress towards economic and monetary union.  I am sure that our changeover will be welcomed by the Communities.</P>
    <P>Because of the very close relationship between the Exchequer and local authorities it is obviously necessary to continue to have the same timing for financial and accounting purposes. Otherwise unnecessary complications would arise which would impede the smooth operation of the work of the Exchequer and of the local authorities.  The inter-relationship between local and central finances in this country is illustrated by the fact that over one-half of the moneys spent by local authorities and health boards is derived from State grants. This proportion may be expected to increase.</P>
    <P>At this point I should like to mention the arrangements approved in respect of health and housing charges in the nine-months period.  As Senators are aware, it is the policy of the Government to relieve the rates of liability in respect of health charges and local authority housing. The first instalment of easement towards this end was provided by the Exchequer in the present financial year 1973-74.  As a result, local authorities needed to levy a rate for health charges and housing subsidies <Col N="183" /> in 1973-74 equivalent to only 75 per cent of the rate levied in respect of them in the year 1972-73.  For the transitional nine-months period from 1st April, 1974, to the 31st December, 1974, the Government have decided that the rates contribution towards health charges and local authority housing will be cut to 37½ per cent of the rate levied in these respects in the year 1972-73.</P>
    <P>Senators will, I am sure, be interested in the implications of the proposed changeover for the business of the Seanad.  As I indicated earlier, separate Estimates and a separate budget will be prepared for the nine-months period from the 1st April, 1974, to the 31st December, 1974. The Finance Bill will come about the usual time.  The Appropriation Bill, 1974, will need to be enacted before the close of the nine-months period.</P>
    <P>As regards calendar financial years from 1975 on, assuming that the budget is presented in the other House within the first couple of months of the financial year&mdash;as has been the usual timing&mdash;this would mean that the budget would be introduced in January or February each year.  If there were Financial Resolutions involved the annual Finance Bill would then require to be enacted by about May or June.  Following enactment of the present Bill I propose to have aspects of the change in financial year affecting parliamentary business referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of both Seanad Éireann and Dáil Éireann for consideration.</P>
    <P>As regards the effects of the proposed changeover of the local financial year on local authorities and ratepayers, the position will be as mentioned earlier that a separate rate will be struck based on the requirements for the nine-months period from 1st April, 1974, to the 31st December, 1974.  The rates for the period will be payable in two parts&mdash;two-thirds on demand and the remaining one-third on the 1st October, 1974, except of course where arrangements for the payment of rates in monthly instalments apply.  A substantial number of ratepayers usually have their full rates <Col N="184" /> paid by the end of December.  For those ratepayers there can be no difficulty about the transitional nine-months period.  People who have in the past been often late in discharging their rates liabilities will have to make an adjustment but in the vast majority of cases this should be readily possible.  Local authorities and rate collectors will as usual exercise discretion and will endeavour to avoid any element of hardship.</P>
    <P>Needless to remark, local authorities must rely on the prompt payment of rates to meet their bills as they arise and to ensure that no disruption occurs in services or employment. Prompt payment of the full rates for the transitional nine-months period will improve the cash flow position of local authorities.  In 1975 and subsequently such improvement can benefit ratepayers by reducing local authorities reliance on costly overdraft facilities the need for which is increased by delays in payment of rates due.</P>
    <P>As the Bill is accompanied by an Explanatory Memorandum I do not at this stage propose to comment in detail on the individual sections of the Bill.  However, I should like to mention one provision in which Senators may be interested, namely, section 5 which provides for the making of orders to effect a wide variety of consequential adaptations to existing statutes and statutory instruments. This is necessary so that the changeover to a calendar financial year for Exchequer and local authority purposes takes place smoothly.  Examples of the matters to which such orders will apply are the statutory provisions relating to the making and collection of rates, the dates for the submission of estimates, demands and accounts, the apportionment of sums of money over the transitional nine-months period and the adjustment of provisions relating to rates remissions for housing and industrial buildings to compensate for the fact that in the transitional nine-months period a full year's rates remission of the appropriate amount will not be available.</P>
    <P>The number of statutory references to be amended is considerable and while all Departments and offices are <Col N="185" /> completing checks to ensure that all are identified it is impossible to guarantee that no such reference requiring amendment will escape notice for a time.  Provision is therefore included in subsection 7 of section 5 to make a change retrospective if necessary.  This is essentially a precautionary measure to ensure that no anomaly or inequity, particularly one which might affect adversely a member of the public, will be allowed to arise.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House for a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which we will support fully, from the point of view of our group, on the basis that it rationalises the whole system of Exchequer financing, accounting and auditing as far as our membership of the EEC is concerned.  This is the fundamental basis of it.  As was mentioned by the Minister in his opening speech, the old system dated back to the procedure of the last century, designed for the times of that period, and we followed on with it.</P>
      <P>There are only a few matters I should like to mention.  Now that we have the Exchequer and local authorities going on to the calendar year, business in general should follow suit. This makes tremendous sense.  If we are to have a European system and if members and local authorities within member States are to co-ordinate in this respect, generally as far as business is concerned the same thing should obtain.  Whatever the date, it should be one date.  Now apparently that the calendar year is accepted as the appropriate time, that should be the same, right through business as well as through the State and local authorities.  I am certain business firms will fall in with this arrangement. It would lessen the confusion in the public mind as far as the State, local authorities and private enterprise activities are concerned, if there was a single year for all activities.  If the calendar is accepted as such, then let it be the calendar year from 1st January to 31st December and stick to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems that made way for another separation in times past are <Col N="186" /> now gone.  We should stick with this, the European way, which is one further step towards the closer and more rational organisation of our affairs not alone internally but within the Community to which we now belong.  I have nothing to say on the transitional problems mentioned by the Minister.  These are being met in a sensible way within the context of the Bill.  As far as it is concerned generally, it is welcomed by this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make only one or two points.  Obviously this follows from our membership of the European Economic Community and it will be generally welcomed as a nationalising step, falling into line with the other eight members of the Community.</P>
      <P>One point struck me in the Minister's speech.  In Great Britain there was some dragging of the feet, and having regard to our close relationship economically with the British economy, I am wondering if there is likely to be any disruption of this relationship. Further, Mr. Harold Wilson has stated that if he is successful in the forthcoming British election he proposes to renegotiate the terms of accession to the European Economic Community. In other words, we may have to visualise a situation that if there is a change of Government in England the British may not follow the example of the other members of the European Economic Community.  I am wondering if this is likely to have any adverse effects in our financial relationships with Great Britain.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, the Revenue Commissioners' year will also change in due course.  It would be very advisable that all business firms and others affected by this change would be notified well in advance of the change so that they can make the necessary adjustments in their own affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pose a query to the Minister.  I take it that the reference to the alleviation of the rates in respect of liability for health and housing charges is an announcement of the continuation of the Government's policy to eliminate progressively <Col N="187" /> these charges on the rates in conformity with the undertaking given by the National Coalition in their 14-Point Plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members, I welcome this Bill.  It is very necessary that we should keep in line with our partners in Europe.  I had intended to ask the same question that Senator Halligan has just asked the Minister.  Perhaps he would tell us if the percentage given in his speech, namely, 37½ per cent, is in line with the cuts promised by the Government?</P>
      <P>There is one part of the Minister's speech that I am slightly concerned about and that is where he tells us that in the nine-months period the rates will be collected in two stages but that two-thirds will be sought on demand and one-third on the 1st October, 1974.  It is true to say that many ratepayers do not pay rates until the months of February or March.  Although this may be a bad practice, it has existed for many years.  This has existed possibly because the rate collector has sufficient rates collected to earn his bonuses and has left certain ratepayers until the end of the financial year.</P>
      <P>I have often wondered if a discount system for rates could be introduced and in this way encourage ratepayers to pay their rates at an earlier date. For these people in particular this requirement of the Minister could be a hardship because next month they will pay either one or two moieties in the present financial year and in the month of May or June they will be asked to pay two-thirds of their demand for the coming financial year. In the month of December they will be required to pay the balance so that in this year alone these people will have to pay two complete rate demands. It could be argued that this is their own fault but in many cases this situation has arisen as a result of the rate collectors themselves.  I hope the Government's undertaking will be lived up to in the way that they promised.  Unfortunately, Fianna Fáil were beaten in the last election.  If we had been re-elected this problem would not have arisen.</P>

There is one question I should like to ask the Minister. How does this affect tenants in local authority houses?  If the rates are calculated on a nine-months basis, will the situation not arise that from 1st April the weekly rates paid with the rent will be increased considerably as a result of this?  I know that the full rate struck will be based on a nine-months figure.  Nevertheless, in the first nine months it could have the effect of a weekly increase in rates and cause hardship to tenants in local authority houses.  When the Minister is replying I should like him to explain that.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the House for the manner in which they have commented upon the Bill and I shall endeavour to answer some of the queries raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lenihan referred to getting rid of the procedure which dated back to the last century.  In fact, what we are doing is getting rid of a procedure which dates back to the 16th century. People are often amazed and bewildered that we have a tax year from 6th April to the 5th April in the following year, which is an oddity. The reason we have that oddity is because we were, as we know, at one time under British rule and they apparently had some suspicion of Popish practices.  When Pope Gregory reformed the calendar in 1582 it took <Col N="189" /> the British Exchequer 170 years to overcome the suspicion of Popish practices and, accordingly, some time elapsed and there had been some movement of the moon and days in between and we ended up with that peculiar tax year of 6th April to 5th April of the following year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was only statutory form in the last century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Exchequer financial year however and the local financial year do not correspond with the tax year.  They operate from 1st April to 31st of the following March, which is another peculiarity.  We would like if we could do so to bring the tax year and the financial year into line, but there are multitudinous administrative and technical difficulties in the way of doing this.  We are making a study in depth of them and we would hope that in the not too distant future we would have both the tax year and the financial year in line.  In the meantime we are proceeding towards the calendar year for the financial year and the local financial year.  This will not involve any disruption.</P>
      <P>Senator Russell posed this question. He wanted us to consider whether there might be any disruption in our business relationships with Britain. There should be no disruption whatsoever because of course the ordinary commercial relations are conducted without regard to the business of the State or still less the concern of the tax collector or the worries of a tax inspector.  Business will go on as heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion was made by Senator Lenihan that we might get everybody in the business community to operate on the calendar year.  It might, in fact, be disadvantageous if everyone was to go on to the calendar year.  It certainly would not be welcomed by the accountancy profession. Anybody who has ever submitted their business problems to the care of that very distinguished profession must already have enough concern about the long delays which can sometimes <Col N="190" /> occur due to the tremendous peaks of work they have at different times of the year.  At least under the present system, where they are free to operate under any year that they wish in any particular business from February to February or from July to July, it spreads out the work; but if everybody was obliged to conduct all his accounts on a calendar year basis you would have a tremendous glut of work at the end of the calendar year and at the commencement of the following year.  There would also be a huge valley in between.  It is probably better to have this freedom for business concerns and individuals to manage their own affairs on whatever annual basis or whatever period they want themselves.  There is certainly a great deal to be said for the State in bringing their own financial year into the calendar year because as I said in my opening remarks, much of the statistics upon which we base our decisions as a State are collected on a calendar year basis.  It is better that we should make our decisions on the most upto-date information.</P>
    <P>There is another reason which impelled me, when I was in Opposition, to urge upon the then Government to adopt the calendar year, and it was one which I was only too delighted to translate into action when the Ministerial responsibility was put on my shoulders.  I am sure I will get a responsive note from the Seanad when I say that it is wholly undesirable that we should be discussing the State's financial business in the hot days of summer when Senators and Members of the Dáil are anxious to go on vacation. By changing the financial year to earlier in the year and by having our budget in January or February we should be able to get rid of the financial business long before the temptation to get out into the heat and sun.  That should also enable the Seanad to get away to an earlier vacation than has been possible in the past.</P>

      <P>Senator Russell also posed the question as to whether our financial relationship with Britain might be upset were a change of Government to occur in Britain and a Government take office in Westminster which would seek to renegotiate the terms of Britain's association with the EEC.  I would not like to look into that crystal ball and come out with an answer at this stage.  I have sufficient practical political experience to forecast that whatever Mr. Harold Wilson might say in Opposition, he might not find it so easy in Government to renegotiate the terms.  Anybody who is in the EEC would have a great deal more to lose by leaving it than by staying in it.  That is a reality which affects Britain just as much as it affects this country.  Even if Britain were to succeed in renegotiating her terms or even if she did succeed in leaving it, it would be in Ireland's best interests to stay within the EEC. If such a situation did arise I am sure the EEC would realise Ireland's particular difficulty.  We have no doubt that the overall terms which would be worked out between ourselves and the EEC would be considerably to our advantage.  Briefly, I would say that we would not be particularly concerned if Britain did leave the EEC, but practically I do not think it is on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is untrue and the Senator knows it.  Perhaps we could deal with the nine-month period that will come into operation by virtue of the passing of this Bill.  My original statement said, and I repeat, that we intend that the nine-month period would be a period which would have its own budget, its own estimates and its own revenue and that it would be comparable to threequarters of a 12-month period, that is to say, nine months; and when I said that our patern of the relief of local rates was similar to that of last year, I meant just that.  The rates will carry 37½ per cent of the 1972-73 level in respect of health and housing subsidies.</P>
      <P>If we were going into a 12-month period now the rates would be required to pay only 50 per cent of that portion of the 1972-73 rate which was attributable to the subsidies on health services and housing.  Last year the local rates carried 75 per cent and the Exchequer carried 25 per cent.  If it were a 12-month period we were going into the local rates would carry 50 per cent and the Exchequer would carry 50 per cent and you would continue the reduction at that rate until the local rates were all relieved.  But as we are going into a nine-months period the rates are being asked to carry during that nine-months period only threequarters of 50 per cent, which is 37½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have said and we have urged upon local authorities&mdash;the elected representatives and their officials&mdash; through discussions that are taking place between the Department of Local <Col N="195" /> Government and the local authorities that they should ensure that nobody is any better off or anybody any worse off as a result of this change, be they an institution, or an authority, or an individual.  There is no reason why anybody should be worse off or indeed why anybody should be better off.  We want the transition to take place as smoothly as possible.  Now we must not fear change in this country.  It is perhaps because we had for so long administrations which did fear change that we did not make the kind of changes which were necessary.  During the course of any change there will probably be a little bit of upset and a bit of misunderstanding.  That is inevitable in the course of change in an imperfect society, but we will do everything within our power to ensure that the upset is as small as possible and we do not think there should be any.</P>
    <P>On Senator McGlinchey's point about the pressure which might be applied to people to ensure payment of their total rates liability during the nine-months period, I just want to say this.  Rent and rates collectors have discretion. They exercise it discreetly and with sympathy and in a humanitarian way.  I have no reason to anticipate that they will be any different this year.  If any local representative believes there is going to be any undue pressure or suspects that any undue pressure has been applied on the ratepayer then it is up to that person to bring it to the notice of his own local authority and have the matter put right.</P>
    <P>We will not be collecting the full year's rates in the nine-months period but only nine-months rates during that period.  The two-thirds which will become payable on demand is equivalent to half of a full year's rates because two-thirds of nine months is six months and half of 12 months would be six months.  As everybody knows, that is payable on demand; but we equally well know it is not always paid promptly even by the most outstanding of citizens.  But of course when they do not pay promptly it means that the local authority, as every member of a local authority knows, has to borrow the money at pretty <Col N="196" /> high rates of interest nowadays in order to meet the shortfall until such time as rates come in.  Therefore, if people paid their rates punctually all local authorities could save a substantial amount&mdash;it might be from as much as 5p to 25p in the £&mdash;which at present has to be paid in high interest charges to meet the shortfall pending receipt of rates.  But that is just the general approach and I do not think there should be any difference this year in the approach or attitude of rate collectors.</P>
    <P>The second portion which they will be asked to pay, which as in all years is due on the 1st October, will this year be only half of what they would normally be called upon to pay on the 1st October, because on the 1st October every year they are asked to pay for the balance of six months.  In this year they will be asked to pay only for three months.  The majority of people pay the second moiety of their rates before the 31st December, so those people will this year be in a much better position.  They will have to pay only one-quarter of the normal annual rate before the 31st December instead of as in the past having to pay half of it.  In fact we are lightening the burden on people in the year 1974 and it should on that account be a year of relief.</P>
    <P>Now it is up to every local authority to co-operate with the central Government and with their own local people in ensuring this change goes through smoothly.  We have no reason to anticipate that there will be any particular difficulties, but if somebody is aware of them and if they bring them to the notice of the Minister for Local Government or if they are in my field of responsibility as manager of the Central Exchequer, I can assure you that you will find a great readiness on our part to smooth the difficulties.  We do not anticipate them but if they should arise we are there to help to smooth them.</P>

      <P>This refers to the application of section 1 in relation to the calendar year.  I dislike the attitude of the present Government in relation to many measures coming before this House and the other House in that they seek to import into measures of this kind something that really is not there, because the reality of this measure is simply what I was saying: that we are now seeking by this legislation to make the financial year run from 1st January to 31st December in accordance with the EEC situation.  There is nothing more to it than that so far as this legislation is concerned, with the consequential provisions relating to the adjustments to be made by local authorities and other State institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see the same thing apply in relation to tax but, as the Minister said, that is a matter of some difficulty.  I should also like to see private companies adopt the same procedure, and in general this makes sense.  But I do not like to see imported into both the Minister's statements <Col N="198" /> and his subsequent remarks much tendentious nonsense about Government policy in regard to the relieving of rates.  Let us face it: there is no question of anything in this Bill being in any way designed to relieve rates in any form.  Let us have this loud and clear.  The Minister just now has categorically said that.  He tends at times to be too glib in matters of this kind. He has stated that this Bill is in some way in ease of ratepayers.  It is not. This Bill is simply a measure which we had prepared more than a year ago.  It is another example of legislation which was in the pipeline and which was designed to follow as a result of our membership of the EEC. This legislation has nothing to do with the relief of rates in any way.  If the Minister confined himself in his speech to the main issue this Bill would have got a very easy passage. However, it is quite obvious from page 3 that the public relations man was at work.  We have a different type typescript in page 3 than we have in pages 1, 2 and 4.  It is quite clear from that that there was again this political nonsense&mdash;political nonsense imported into a very sensible script prepared by the Department of Finance, given to the Minister for Finance, which, if he had delivered it to this House of the Oireachtas, would have enabled this Bill to be dispatched in very quick time as a reasonable measure flowing from what we had already prepared. Instead we have the tendentious nonsense here in paragraph 3, and again repeated by the Minister in an audacious way orally here in the House a few minutes ago, that in some way this Bill is in relief of rates.  This Bill is not in relief of rates.  This Bill is a simple straightforward Bill, as is said in the first sentence prepared by the Department of Finance, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The basic purpose of the Bill is to change the Exchequer financial year and the local financial year, both of which end on the 31st of March under present law.  As and from the 1st of January, 1975, they will coincide with the calendar year.</P>
    <P>That is all that needed to be said about this Bill.  That flows from our membership <Col N="199" /> of the European Economic Community. There is nothing in this Bill that in any way relieves rates and it is codology for the Minister to suggest to people that, because they are paying a lesser amount in nine months by way of rates, they are being relieved in some way, when they will have to pay 12 months' rates eventually.  Again why cloud the issue over?  This happens in regard to so many Bills that have come to this House from Ministers of the present Government that I begin to despair about reality.</P>
    <P>The first sentence I have quoted there is, in fact, the reality of this Bill. There is no more involved in this Bill. We are changing from a certain annual system to another calendar year system which is in accordance with EEC regulations.  I feel that we should universally follow the calendar year in regard to all accounting, auditing, and taxation&mdash;although there are difficulties, as the Minister has said.  That should be the situation from the point of view of easy procedures as far as people in business, finance and taxation are concerned.</P>
    <P>It is a totally fraudulent approach for a responsible Minister of an Irish Government to come in here and suggest that in some way this Bill is associated with any other scheme of reducing rates or making things easier for people or a new initiative on their part.  It is none of these things.  Let us get away from this miasma of public relations and get down to the facts. This Bill is about a procedural matter &mdash; in my view a very sensible procedural matter, one that I would like to see adopted more generally.  It is certainly not going to involve any easement for people in regard to payments of rates whether under the health charges category, the housing subsidies category or any other category.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister go back to his Departmental briefs and in any further submission to this House he should ignore the importation into sensible Ministerial statements of obviously Press relations and public relations-organised sentiments as expressed in page 3 of the memorandum before us.</P>

      <P>In addition to what Senator Lenihan has said, which is absolutely true, not alone is the Bill not giving any relief to rates, but there is a point about which the Minister should now warn the public. After he had made his statement here in reply to the first debate he said there are people who do not pay their rates until the 31st of March.  I know that that is a true statement.  This year not alone will they have to pay up to the 31st of March but they will also have to pay the remainder of the rates before the 31st of December. In fact there is no relief.  With all the propaganda that is printed here, particularly in page 3, this point has not been mentioned at all.  There will be two demands in this year.</P>

      <P>I wonder could I get some sense of reality and perhaps respect for the House.  I should like to apologise to Senator McGlinchey and the Members of the Fianna Fáil Party in the other House who asked a question in the course of debate on this Bill about the Government's relief of rates.  The reason why that is contained in the opening statement which I made in this House is that very specific questions were directed to this by Members of the Fianna Fáil Party in the other House.  I thought it would be of interest to Senators and it was out of courtesy to people who might have been interested in that that the information was given. I am in politics and I am prepared to take as much abuse as anybody flings at me when it is justified and even when it is not justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is unfair to the Members of Senator Lenihan's own party that he proceeds to abuse them for asking questions which are of interest to them and the people they represent in Seanad Éireann, Dáil Éireann and the local authorities throughout the country. If they do not want these matters discussed in this debate, very well; I will not object.  But if they include them in the debate they can hardly object if the answers are given.  If they do not like the answers and if they anticipate that the answers which they get are not going to be to their liking they should not ask the questions, but <Col N="201" /> if they do, they should not complain when they get the answers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify a point which I think is relevant to this section. It has been suggested that because it is a shorter year people will feel there is a decrease in the amount of rates they will have to pay.  I have visions of headlines across provincial papers saying that the rates have been reduced this year.  People would want to be very wary that this is only a nine-months period.  In actual fact rates have been increased.  The point I want to make is that at our county council rates meeting yesterday we were very concerned that we were asked to make provision in our own charges so that the county council would be able to borrow money to pay compensation under malicious injury claims for bomb damage that took place in our county.  This happened over 12 months ago.  The people in the Border area and in Belturbet have suffered serious damage and nobody can tell them whether they will receive the money and, consequently, their business has suffered.  At our meeting Senator O'Brien said, when I pressed him, that the Government were thinking about this and that this would be dealt with.  If the Government have that information they should tell the local authority that they have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last Government were very quick to ensure that compensation was paid and that there was a county-at-large charge regarding Nelson's Pillar when it was blown up and when the British Embassy was burned.  It is now 12 months since these people in Belturbet suffered this agony and this financial loss and loss of people. The Minister for Finance should come clean with Cavan County Council and the other Border counties who have suffered and tell them where they stand so that we will not be forced at our rates meeting to put in a token estimate to ensure that these people <Col N="202" /> will get paid.  I should like the Minister to clarify that for me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to one matter in connection with the financial year.  I want to speak directly to the section on the point raised by Senator Lenihan, and repeated by him subsequently, urging business firms to change their financial year to conform with the calendar year.  I think it would be chaotic if that suggestion were to be adopted.  May I, as a businessman, say this: a number of firms arrange their business year to coincide with the date on which they have the lowest stocks in their firm or warehouses.  This is a practice going on for many years.  For that reason I do not think they would change. Apart from that, if every business firm in the country was to complete their accounts on the 31st December in any year the rush on accountancy firms for the next couple of months would be such that they would not get their accounts for at least 12 months.  I have no doubt that what Senator Lenihan had in mind would be a nice tidy operation which would make everything coincide with the calendar year.  In fact it is highly impractical. I do not think it should go out from this House as a sensible suggestion that should be followed by the business community.  It just could not be done.  It is completely hopeless.</P>

      <P>In the course of his speech the Minister told us that the rates for the period will be paid in two parts&mdash;two-thirds on demand and the remaining one-third on the 1st October, 1974.  That is the position for 1974.  We do not appear to have received any information about what will happen after 1974.  Local authorities will strike their rates in the month of December.  Demand notes will be issued in January and I presume that the first moiety will be payable then. Would the Minister tell me when is it proposed to collect the second moiety? I cannot see any reference to it here after 1974.</P>

I am not a farmer but I feel the position of the farming population should be taken into consideration when arriving at a date.  The 30th June, which would appear to be the logical date to use, would in my opinion not be suitable for the farming population.  The harvest is not over until the end of September or October. I think that the farming population would experience tremendous difficulty in paying the second moiety at that stage.</P>
      <P>I presume that an order will be made under this Bill at some stage fixing the date of the second moiety after 1974.  Would the Minister consider the plight of the farming population when fixing that date?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is a hint I can take it now with the leave of the Chair. On the point raised by Senator Dolan, the Government have already given an assurance that any bomb damage in border counties arising out of the unhappy disturbances in the North of Ireland will not become a charge on the local rates.  This was again confirmed by a statement made in Belturbet this week by the Minister for <Col N="204" /> Lands.  The law in relation to malicious damage to property is under review by the Minister for Justice at the moment.  I am sure Senator Dolan appreciates that any claims in relation to malicious damage have to be dealt with through the courts.  It is no reflection on the people who file claims when I say that in most cases the compensation actually awarded is a great deal less than the claims made when they originally come in.  I have no doubt that whatever difficulties exist can be smoothed over and people who have been at a loss or their neighbour ratepayers need not have any fear that any damage arising out of the unhappy events in the North of Ireland will be left as a liability on the local rates.</P>
      <P>Now I will deal with Senator McGlinchey's question about the date of payment.  At the moment the first moiety is payable on demand and the second moiety is paid on the 1st October.  It has been acknowledged by all sides of the House here that a large proportion is not collected until six months afterwards.  If the 1st of July is the date for this second moiety&mdash;I am not going to encourage people not to pay on demand&mdash;and if they do not pay for several months later, that is a matter for the people themselves, the local rate collector and the local authority. Of course what suits one person might not suit another.  The 1st of July might be suitable for some and a bad time for others.  The local rate collector, with all his knowledge of local habits&mdash;the peak and valley periods&mdash;can make the necessary adjustments.  We do not think there should be any change in the system for time of payment.  It is a matter for negotiation between the local rate collector and the individual payer.</P>
      <P>I am sure if local representatives have any particular views to offer to their own local authorities about changing the time of payment it would be appropriate that they would express their views in the local authorities where everything would be taken into account in accordance with local customs and needs.</P>

    <Title>Family Planning Bill, 1973: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides the first opportunity for a full debate in either House of the Oireachtas on the subject of family planning.  It allows the Seanad to discuss the general principles involved in any changes in the law and it also allows the Seanad to consider the specific framework which Senators Horgan, West and I have put forward in this Bill for such amendment.  I should like to appeal to my fellow Senators: let us approach this subject with compassion rather than dogmatism and with open-minded concern rather than bigotry.  Family planning involves the most intimate relationship between a man and a woman.  It is a subject matter which has been discussed very broadly outside Parliament in recent times.  It is also a subject which was taboo for discussion for a very long time.  It is now to be debated inside Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth noting that family planning is now supported positively by all the Christian churches.  This includes the Catholic Church which is in favour of responsible parenthood, in favour of family planning.  The difference between them relates only to choice of means.  This Bill would create the possibility of a wider choice <Col N="206" /> of means of family planning and the possibility of getting full information on the subject.  It is in other words an enabling Bill.  It is in fact entitled &ldquo;An Act to facilitate family planning and for that purpose to amend section 17 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, sections 16 and 17 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929, and sections 7 and 9 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946.&rdquo;  It would not compel any person to use contraceptives, or any doctor to prescribe contraceptives, or any chemist to stock contraceptives.  It would facilitate family planning by allowing choice to the individual citizens concerned.</P>
    <P>When an attempt was made by Senators Horgan, West and me to introduce a similar Bill in 1970, four years ago now, there was a significant resistance both in the Oireachtas and in the general public to any change in the law.  In the intervening period no Government Bill was introduced either by the previous Government or by this Government.  When we tabled this Family Planning Bill there was a similar resistance to any change.  Meanwhile however the Supreme Court has acted on one section of the existing law, that is subsection (3) of section 17 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, and has deemed that section to be repugnant to the Constitution. This was one section which we had repealed in the framework of our Bill, which certain bigoted, unthinking people opposed, in a blanket form&mdash; opposed in many cases without having read the Bill because they opposed any change in the law.</P>
    <P>It is from this unthinking approach that I want to move us to an approach of being open to discussing family planning, open to the possibility of changing the law.  I want to refer to the judgment of one of the judges in the Supreme Court, Mr. Justice Henchy, on this section to bring the subject into a human context and out of an academic or dogmatic context.  I quote from the text of Mr. Justice Henchy's judgment in the recent Supreme Court decision in the McGee case, where he says:</P>
    <P>Section 17, in my judgment, so <Col N="207" /> far from respecting Mrs. McGee's rights, violates them.  If she observes this prohibition (which in practice she can scarcely avoid doing, and which in law she is bound under penalty of fine and imprisonment to do), she will endanger the security and happiness of her marriage, she will imperil her health to the point of hazarding her life and she will subject her family to the risk of distress and disruption.  These are intrusions which she is entitled to say are incompatible with the safety of her life, the preservation of her health, her responsibility to her conscience and the security and wellbeing of her marriage and family.</P>
    <P>Those who in a dogmatic and blanket way oppose any change in the law have opposed a change which a Supreme Court judge was able to look at using that sort of phraseology, and I emphasise that this is a subject matter on which we must be compassionate and which we must look at without closed minds.</P>
    <P>I submit that we have a twofold task before us in considering the subject of family planning.  We have the task, firstly, of regularising the position following the Supreme Court judgment in the McGee case.  We have the task, secondly, of examining the law as it stands in relation to family planning and deciding whether it is adequate to promote the basic human right and promote the right of information on this subject matter.</P>
    <P>I want to turn first to the more limited task of regularising the position as a result of the Supreme Court judgment.  It is my contention that the law as it stands is unsatisfactory and could not be supported by any responsible Member of either House of the Oireachtas, whatever his party affiliation or whether he be independent of the political parties.</P>
    <P>I would submit that the case which I shall make for the unsatisfactory nature of the law should make it clear that, whatever the details of the Bill to amend the law on family planning, there could be no doubt of the obligation and duty on this Oireachtas to regularise the legal position by bringing <Col N="208" /> in a law.  I believe that it is not a time for short-term party advantage or playing party politics.  The subject is too important; it is too basic; it has too significant human consequences.</P>
    <P>Let us turn then to an examination of the present state of the law.  As the law now stands, any person, married or unmarried, and with no age limit, can use contraceptives, manufacture contraceptives, distribute contraceptives and, since the recent judgment of the Supreme Court in the McGee case, import contraceptives.  Also, the pill is regarded not as a contraceptive but as a cycle regulator and therefore does not come within the legislation prohibiting the sale of contraceptives. More than 38,000 Irish women, be they married or unmarried, use the pill under a prescription every month. However none of these people can inform herself fully on on the subject. As the law now stands, they cannot acquire responsible literature describing the various forms of contraceptives, warning them of the potential danger of the contraceptives which they are importing from abroad, warning them of the conditions which make it unsafe for them to use the pill and generally advising them in a full manner on the whole question of family planning and of the choices open, if the person wishes to exercise choice, in the methods of family planning.</P>
    <P>The present situation is one of lack of coherent regulation.  There is a very real danger that citizens will suffer injury to their health through lack of responsible information.  It is an untenable situation in that the only way in which people can get certain types of contraceptives is by importation from abroad, with no control and no safeguards.  It is a most unsatisfactory and dangerous state of the law in that people could rightly say that the country might be flooded with literature and with these devices.  Anybody looking at this country at the moment could well think that we have a contraceptive mentality, so much has the matter been discussed in general outside Parliament, but until now, alas, not within Parliament.</P>
    <P>As well as that we have incidents <Col N="209" /> like the prosecutions in the District Court yesterday, which bring the law into hatred, ridicule and contempt.  It is not good for law itself and for the institutions of this State that responsible and reputable doctors, gynaecologists and professional people should be hauled before our criminal courts on such a matter.  The only good result from the prosecutions yesterday was that they were dismissed. There is no doubt that such examples are unhealthy for the institutions and laws of our State and bring them into contempt.</P>
    <P>The argument is very strong that the law in so far as it regulates or controls the whole subject of family planning is not satisfactory, is no longer a coherent structure and has very real dangers built into it.  I would hope that the Members of the Seanad in the course of this debate, and also the Members of the other House, in examining either this Bill or a Government Bill, when that is forthcoming, will have the courage to face up to this situation, because they have the advantage over their constituents. The average Irish person is not faced in the same way with the opportunity to examine the present state of the law and to consider a proposal for change.  The average person may very well be confused, is obviously concerned, and rightly so, and may in consequence be resisting change.  This is a very good example of where there must be leadership from the representatives of the people, and not a rather cowardly fear of the grassroots opinion and fear of change, lest it might translate into a turning away either from a particular politician or from a party.</P>
    <P>Therefore I would submit that we ought to take this subject matter out of the realm of party politics by agreeing to the concensus view that there is a need for the law to be regularised in the public interest.  We can differ perhaps on the degree to which there might be liberalisation or the degree to which there might be restrictions and controls built in.  But on the fundamental proposition of need for regularisation of the position through an Act of this Oireachtas, I would <Col N="210" /> submit that no Senator or Deputy examining the position can dissent from that in good faith.</P>
    <P>In addition, so far I have been examining the precise state of the present law, but I would submit that persons reading in full the judgments of the members of the Supreme Court in the McGee decision would not be content to leave it at that.  They would have to take into account that the judges made it clear that they ruled on the unconstitutionality of subsection (3) of section 17, because that was the only section which was strictly relevant to the decision, and they left it very much in doubt as to whether the other sections were constitutional.  I shall quote from the judgment of Mr. Justice Walsh to illustrate this:</P>
    <P>As this particular case arose primarily out of the ban on importation, I think in so far as Article 41 is concerned, the declaration sought should only go in respect of subsection (3) of section 17 of the Act of 1935.  That does not necessarily mean that the provisions as to sale in subsection (1) cannot be impunged. If, in the result, notwithstanding the deletion of subsection (3), the prohibition on sale had the effect of leaving a position where contraceptives were not reasonably available for use within marriage then that particular prohibition must also fall.  However, for the moment I do not think it is necessary to make any declaration in respect of that.</P>
    <P>This is a clear indication from a Supreme Court judge that he is not ruling on the constitutionality of the section because it is not strictly relevant to the case before him.  He is only declaring the ban on importation unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>With that particular extract from the judgment of Mr. Justice Walsh one should read a short extract from the dissenting Supreme Court judge in the McGee case, the Chief Justice. Mr. Justice Fitzgerald was the only member of the Supreme Court to dissent from finding that subsection (3) of section 17 was repugnant to the Constitution, but he said in his judgment:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="211" /> It is, I think, well to realise that the plaintiff's claim here is as a citizen, and that if any portion of section 17 of the 1935 Act is declared unconstitutional the benefit to be derived from such a decision is equally to be enjoyed by every other citizen, be they married or not.</P>
    <P>In other words, Mr. Justice Fitzgerald was making it clear that any ruling was on the basis of the citizen's rights and applicable to all citizens, married or not.</P>
    <P>There is one possible way in which the law in relation to family planning in this country could continue to be changed.  We could continue to have people bringing individual cases before the High Court and Supreme Court and testing the constitutionality of the prohibition on sale of contraceptives and the constitutionality of the prohibition on being able to read about family planning in the relevant provisions of the Censorship Acts.  We could have over a period of a number of years&mdash;because law suits take a length of time&mdash;a series of decisions which chipped away in a piecemeal fashion at our law, leaving an unregulated and unco-ordinated situation and one which gradually liberalised&mdash;probably more than many legislators would wish&mdash;the law relating to family planning.</P>
    <P>I would submit that this would be a very sad state of the law if legislators abdicated their responsibility and left it to the courts; so that we would be dependent on individual plaintiffs bringing their single problems before the court, to gradually chip away at the existing law.  We must face up to our responsibilities as Members of this Parliament.  We must restore the balance by providing a properly planned and properly considered framework within which we regulate the whole subject matter of family planning.</P>
    <P>Action by the Oireachtas is necessary for two reasons: first, because of the nature of the subject matter. If it becomes necessary for individuals <Col N="212" /> to bring actions in the courts the results will be pragmatic, piecemeal, unco-ordinated and will result in a bad overall situation; secondly, because political scientists observe it as a weakness in the system if one leaves the legislating to the judges.  It is not the function of the Judiciary to legislate. It is the function of Parliament. We must not abdicate to the Judiciary the function of gradually finding our laws unconstitutional and, therefore, in effect legislating.  We must take upon ourselves the primary responsibility.  We must exercise the function of legislating without fear of the grassroots, without fear of misunderstanding and with a compassion and a concern for the human beings who are affected in their daily lives &mdash; in their intimate relationships&mdash;by the laws which we pass.</P>
    <P>This is the first task before the Oireachtas; to regularise the unacceptable nature of the existing law. The second task I believe goes further. It is to consider the objective of the proposers of this Family Planning Bill.  We seek to amend, for positive reasons, the law relating to family planning and to protect and sustain the right of individuals to use contraceptives and to plan their families and also to ensure that they have the proper access to information in this regard.</P>
    <P>In describing family planning as a basic right we find that Ireland has clearly recognised that the right of family planning is a basic human right when it voted in favour of Resolution No. 18 of the United Nations Human Rights Convention in Teheran in 1968.  This was a commitment by Ireland at the international level, made in 1968.  The relevant passage of the resolution is worth quoting.  It reads:</P>
    <P>Couples have a basic human right to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and a right to adequate education and information in this respect.</P>
    <P>We have seen other examples of where we put on a good international face.  Outwardly we are in favour of <Col N="213" /> the right to family planning and full education and information on this. Inwardly, in our national law and institutions, we do not always comply with what we regard as a basic right and obligation we are happy to subscribe to on the international level.</P>
    <P>The implications of the Teheran resolution is that the law of the state should protect this right; it should ensure that there is access to adequate information and to a choice of means of family planning.  In his judgment in the Supreme Court Mr. Justice Walsh made it clear that this right is recognised by the Supreme Court and recognised in a very substantial and unqualified form.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The sexual life of a husband and wife is of necessity and by its nature an area of particular privacy.  If the husband and wife decide to limit their family or to avoid having children by use of contraceptives, it is a matter peculiarly within the joint decision of the husband and wife and one into which the State cannot intrude unless its intrusion can be justified by the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>The question of whether the use of contraceptives by married couples within their marriage is or is not contrary to the moral code or codes to which they profess to subscribe or is or is not regarded by them as being against their conscience could not justify State intervention. Similarly, the fact that the use of contraceptives may offend against the moral code of the majority of the citizens of the State would not <i>per se</i> justify an intervention by the State to prohibit their use within marriage.  The private morality of its citizens does not justify intervention by the State into the activities of those citizens unless and until the common good requires it.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to say that the majority of Irish people do not want to use or do not approve of contraceptives. It is not possible to justify any State intervention on those grounds.  The Supreme Court has made it clear that <Col N="214" /> there is a basic right to plan a family, a basic right to use contraceptives to do so, and that the State cannot justify prohibiting this right on the grounds that it offends against the views of the majority in the country.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of authority in the Constitution for this basic right. In Article 40, section 1, it is provided that &ldquo;all citizens shall, as human persons, be held as equal before the law&rdquo;.  This article has been interpreted in various judgments of both the High Court and the Supreme Court as referring to equality in their human personality rather than equality in an economic sense.  The State in Article 40.3.1 &ldquo;guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable by its laws, to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen&rdquo;.  Here again the court has defined what these personal rights are and has made it clear that they are not confined to personal rights as set out specifically in other sections of the Constitution but can be stated from time to time by the courts.  The obvious example is that the Constitution at no stage guarantees a freedom of movement around the country and yet this would be regarded by the courts as a personal right of the citizen.</P>
    <P>In the case involving fluoridation of drinking water some years ago the Supreme Court decided that a person has a right to bodily integrity, and in the McGee case the judgment of several Supreme Court judges&mdash;and here one notes the judgment of Mr. Justice Griffin&mdash;recognised a right to privacy.  I would submit that the rights of the citizen include a right to medical safety and that as the law stands at the moment too many women&mdash;and it is women in this case &mdash; are at risk on medical grounds because of the law relating to family planning, because of the exclusion of choices in methods of family planning.</P>
    <P>The pill is the only cycle regulator or contraceptive available.  It is not a type of contraceptive which is medically sound for all of the women who might wish to use contraceptives.  For example, the pill is unsuitable in many cases for medical reasons: if there is a history of deep vein thrombosis <Col N="215" /> or pulmonary embolism&mdash;and this will usually have been associated with a previous pregnancy&mdash;or if a woman suffers from hypertension, high blood pressure, diabetes, liver disease or from varicose veins or even migrane. Very often these are problems of older women, women who have already had a number of pregnancies and who are now high-risk women for this type of contraceptive.  It is not enough to give the simple viewpoint: &ldquo;What is the problem?  The pill is freely available.&rdquo;  The pill is not medically suitable for physical conditions of a large number of women who may be the very women who most need to be fully informed on the methods of family planning in order, if they wish, to be able to regulate their families in this way.</P>
    <P>We need to provide in our legislation for the availability of full medical advice and for full information on the various methods of family planning, showing the dangers of certain contraceptives for certain conditions. This choice is not provided by allowing people to write away to England or elsewhere and to import devices for their personal use without the medical protection to which these people are entitled.</P>
    <P>I would submit that if the State is really protecting the personal rights of the citizen it must also protect their health, particularly that of women of a certain age who have already had a number of pregnancies. These are the women at greatest risk, already mothers of families.  These are the particular women at the moment who are in great medical danger because of the state of the law.</P>
    <P>In other provisions of the Constitution we have further support for a change in the law in order to fully defend and vindicate the rights of the citizen.  Article 41.1 recognises the family as &ldquo;the natural primary and fundamental unit group of society&rdquo; and guarantees that the State will &ldquo;protect the family in its constitution and authority.&rdquo;  This article was used extensively in submissions before the Supreme Court.  It must be obvious to <Col N="216" /> anybody who is genuinely concerned about family life in Ireland that a very crucial factor in protecting the family is to enable a choice in family planning methods to be available.  It is basic to the family structure in Ireland that we make the choice in methods of family planning available to those who wish in conscience to use contraceptives and also that we educate and inform by amending our Censorship Acts to allow responsible literature about family planning to be available.</P>
    <P>Article 44.2 provides that &ldquo;Freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion are, subject to public order and morality, guaranteed to every citizen.&rdquo;  We went to very elaborate trouble not so long ago to remove from Article 44 of the Constitution the provision relating to the special position of the Roman Catholic Church.  We did this with the best of motives.  That particular provision had been interpreted as being evidence of discrimination in favour of the Roman Catholic Church in our Constitution.  We wished to remove it to ensure balance within the society of the Republic, and also to show our goodwill to the Northern part of the country in allaying fears which had been expressed there.</P>
    <P>For the same reason but with much more significance we must ensure that the laws of the State do not reflect the morality of a particular religious denomination.  It would be useless hypocrisy for which we would be rightly condemned if we removed a declaratory section which appeared to discriminate in favour of a particular church and left in our laws the actual teeth of that discrimination by favouring the denominational approach of one church in its views on family planning.  We cannot afford to leave such legislation on our Statute Books.</P>
    <P>It would be bad for our own community in the South, which is what we are primarily concerned with and where we find adequate reason for changing and amending our laws; and it would be bad in a context where discussions are in progress for establishing <Col N="217" /> a Council of Ireland.  We would have no right to the respect of those in Northern Ireland&mdash;nor indeed to our own self-respect&mdash;if we could remove a declaratory section which gave a particular church a privileged position but did not remove the laws which supported the privileged position of that church by repeating the denominational moral outlook of that church which is in conflict with the moral outlook of other Christian churches in this State.</P>
    <P>We can have no doubt that on this question of family planning the official views of the churches are different and that their official moral outlook is different.  Any doubts which members of the Seanad might have had on this point must have been allayed by communications received from the various minority churches.  Members of the Seanad would agree with me that to receive such communications is highly unusual.  Members of the minority religions in the South do not readily express an official view on legislation coming before the Oireachtas. This is not their usual pattern. It is very heartening that they have expressed their official position by informing every Senator and every Deputy of the authoritative view of these minority churches.  Their views should be respected and should be given equal standing with others who might have a different moral outlook also supported by the authority of their church.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record the views of these minority bodies, beginning with the statement of the General Synod of the Church of Ireland sent in a letter to Members of the Seanad dated 1st February, 1974. It reads:</P>
    <P>The Archbishop of Armagh and our committee have been following with keen interest the proceedings in the Seanad and the public discussion on the Family Planning Bill, 1973.</P>
    <P>Because of our deep concern regarding the personal rights and freedoms involved in this issue we would like to draw your attention to the views of the Church of Ireland on this and related matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> These views are most clearly embodied in the terms of the following Resolution passed by the General Synod of the Church of Ireland in 1971 without a single dissenting vote:</P>
    <P>That this house welcomes the efforts being made to amend the legislation concerning contraception in the Republic and fully supports the Archbishop of Dublin in his affirmation of the declaration of the Lambeth Conference of Anglican Bishops in years 1958 and 1968 which concluded that &ldquo;the responsibility of deciding the number and frequency of children has been laid by God upon the consciences of parents everywhere; that this planning, in such ways as are mutually acceptable to husband and wife in Christian conscience, is a right and important factor in Christian family life.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Indeed, the whole question of family planning and related issues has been the subject of comment in this Committee's Reports and appendices thereto since we were first established.  The relevant extracts are attached for your information.</P>
    <P>We believe that the sum total of these extracts combined with the 1971 resolution quoted above will make the Church of Ireland views on this whole subject abundantly clear.  We would, however, be glad to elaborate if so requested.</P>
    <P>This is not a letter from a member of the Church of Ireland in his individual capacity.  It must be regarded by Members of this House as the official view of the Church of Ireland on the subject of family planning legislation in Ireland, requesting a change in the laws, requesting that their views&mdash; their different moral outlook, their attitude towards family planning&mdash;be given equal consideration and respect by our laws.  This should not be a matter on which they find their normal viewpoint is in conflict with the criminal law of the State.  Because that is really what we are talking about: the use to which we put the <Col N="219" /> criminal penal law of the State.  In these circumstances the official view of the Church of Ireland body is that the criminal law is in conflict with their moral outlook, their moral attitude on family planning.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the letter sent by the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, dated 4th February, which states:</P>
    <P>Dear Senator:</P>
    <P>It has sometimes been suggested that it is only some individuals who have protested at the legal prohibition of modern family planning or use of contraceptives as an infringement on the rights of those who conscientiously and responsibly believe this to be both moral and desirable.</P>
    <P>The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland having considered over a two-year period a report on Christian Sexual Ethics, which included a discussion of birth control, in June, 1961, resolved as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the General Assembly approves of the following statements:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  The world population trend demands that the question of family limitation be faced realistically, and that the attempts made by Governments to encourage voluntary methods of birth control be viewed sympathetically.</P>
    <P>(b)  Family planning is in itself a good thing.  While persistent abstinence may be practicable for some married couples it is fraught with dangers for most.</P>
    <P>(c)  The use of contraceptives within marriage should not be regarded as in itself wrong. Nevertheless the decision to use them should not be taken lightly or unadvisably, nor should they be made a means of avoiding parenthood altogether for purely selfish ends.</P>
    <P>In view of the Bill upon this matter presently before your House it is deemed desirable that you <Col N="220" /> should be informed of the official position of our Church.</P>
    <P>So here again, in a direct letter to each Member of the Seanad so that none of us can have any doubt about it, we have the official view of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland as well as the official view of the Church of Ireland.  This is not some tiny minority speaking in their individual capacity and possibly dissenting from the official view.  It is the official view expressed publicly by these churches who ask us to respect their moral outlook.  We do not at present give them equal treatment before our laws. We do not respect their conscience. We do not respect their right to have their own moral viewpoint and the moral authority to teach that viewpoint and to hold it in relation to family planning.  We deny that by our criminal law; we deny it in our censorship laws.  We should be acutely aware that our laws at the moment do have this restrictive and inhibiting effect.</P>
    <P>Finally I want to mention the third of these minority religions which has seen fit to put its views officially to the Members of the Seanad.  The Religious Society of Friends, the Quakers, in a letter dated 15th February, 1974, communicated with Members of the Seanad as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Dublin welcomes the decision of the Government to introduce a Family Planning Bill in the current session of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It trusts that the question of the use of contraceptives for family planning will be left to the individual conscience and therefore hopes that the Bill will not include any unrealistic limitations on their availability.</P>
    <P>In addition it is considered important that information and education on family planning should be freely available.  It urges that the Censorship of Publications Act 1946 be amended so that publications should not be banned simply because they advocate the use of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>That letter is signed by the clerk of the Dublin monthly meeting of the <Col N="221" /> Religous Society of Friends.  Again it illustrates an unusual intrusion into the public sphere in what has become a political issue; showing the concern of these minority religions that their official voice be heard, be understood, be uncontradictable.</P>
    <P>There is a danger in quoting from these clear statements by the representative bodies of the minority religions that this may be regarded as a question of a religious minority. But of course this is not so.  The minority concerned in seeking change to allow choice of means in family planning is not a religious minority. I hope we will not have the hypocrisy <Col N="222" /> to try to maintain that it is a religious minority.  It may be a minority of the citizens of the State; but they span all religions and none.  This is clear from the number of women who are using contraceptives, from letters from all around the country sent by women who are prepared to sign their names and state their religion.  It is clear not only that this is not a religious minority but that it is, in fact, a more significant proportion of the population than had been realised heretofore.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 21st February, 1974.</P>
