    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill makes certain legislative changes arising from the proposal that title to children's allowance under the Children's Allowances Acts should be vested in the mother of the child rather than in the father as at present.  The actual change in title itself can be effected by amendment of the normal residence rules under the Children's Allowances Acts, but because increases of benefit, pension or assistance in respect of qualified dependent children under the other social welfare schemes are at present also governed by the children's allowances rules, legislation is necessary to ensure that there will be no change in the existing position regarding the payment of these increases. The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill will, I hope, help to clarify the provisions which are of a rather technical nature and assist Senators in their examination of the Bill. <Col N="494" /> At present, title to children's allowance is vested in the child's father and this has been the position since the scheme commenced in 1944. In most cases&mdash;about 85 per cent&mdash; the fathers nominate the mothers to receive the allowances but I have received from many quarters representations, including recommendations in the report of the Commission on the Status of Women, that the mothers should have title to this allowance in their own right.  This is the position in many other countries, and I am sure that there are few in this country nowadays who would not agree it is high time that we too should adopt this more enlightened approach.</P>
      <P>The matter is governed by the normal residence rules made under the Children's Allowances Acts which set out the person with whom a child is to be regarded as normally resident, and accordingly with whom title to the children's allowance rests. Amended rules will be made to provide that a child shall be regarded as being normally resident with his mother in the first instance and accordingly title to the allowance will in future be vested in her.  The existing rules, however, while specifically made for the purpose of children's allowances have also over the years been applied by statute for the purpose of determining the normal residence of qualified children under the other social insurance and assistance schemes.</P>
      <P>When the children's allowances rules are amended it will, at the same time, be necessary to ensure that the legal position regarding the payment of increases of benefit, pension or assistance in respect of such children, where the beneficiary would usually be the father rather than the mother, will not be altered in consequence. Otherwise the increases in respect of children could not be paid to the father.  What is proposed, therefore, is that the amended normal residence rules to be made under the Children's Allowances Acts will in future be applied only for the purposes of the children's allowances scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New regulations will be made under powers provided in this Bill for determining the normal residence of <Col N="495" /> children for the purposes of the social insurance schemes.  These regulations will, with some minor amendments, follow the lines of the existing normal residence rules, so that the position regarding the payment of increases of benefit in respect of qualified children will remain unchanged.  The Bill provides that these regulations when made will also apply in determining the normal residence of children for the purposes of the social assistance schemes other than the children's allowances scheme.  As in the case of the benefit schemes, therefore, the existing position in regard to the payment of increases of assistance in respect of children will not be disturbed.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be appropriate at this point to say that during the Committee Stage of the Bill in Dáil Éireann, Deputy Faulkner asked if the actual vesting of title to the allowance in the mother could not be incorporated in the Bill itself.  His point, I think, was that since the Bill, when it becomes law, will have severed the connection between the children's allowances normal residence rules and the other social welfare codes which at present also use these rules in determining entitlement to increases of benefit or assistance for children, it would therefore no longer be necessary for a future Minister for Social Welfare to come before the Oireachtas if he wished to reverse the decision vesting title to children's allowances in the mother and give it back to the father. As I have said, this could be done by amending the normal residence rules made under the Children's Allowances Acts.  I accepted that the Deputy seemed to have a valid point and promised to look into the matter before the Bill came to the Seanad with a view to seeing if anything could be done by way of a simple amendment to meet it without delaying the passage of the Bill into law.</P>
    <P>Since then I have had the matter fully examined and I find that to bring about this change by way of legislation would, in effect, involve incorporating the proposed new normal <Col N="496" /> residence rules in their entirety into the Bill.  These rules, as anyone who has had occasion to study them will appreciate, are, in fact extremely complex, providing, as they must do, for a great variety of domestic and other situations apart from what I might term the typical family one, where a child is living with his own mother and father.  The present rules, for instance, run into something like ten articles and a number of pages in the printed version of the text.  Their incorporation into the Bill would obviously not be a simple matter and it is doubtful if anything would in fact be gained by it.</P>
    <P>The principal thing and this, perhaps, is somethng which the Deputy might have overlooked, is that in making and amending the normal residence rules, the Minister and any future Minister likewise, is bound by the provisions of the Children's Allowances Acts themselves.  If I may quote from section 5 (3) of the 1946 Act which it the relevant provision in this instance:</P>
    <P>Rules prescribed under subsection (2) of this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are prescribed and if a resolution is passed by either House of the Oireachtas within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the rules are laid before it annulling the rules, the rules shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under the rules.</P>
    <P>In other words, even if a future Minister were foolhardy enough to think of restoring title to the father against the tide of modern thinking on the subject, it would be a simple matter for Deputies or Senators to raise the matter publicly, have it fully debated, and set aside the rules if a majority of either House were in favour of that being done.</P>
    <P>I hope I shall be forgiven for dealing with this matter at some length but, as I said, the Deputy who raised it undoubtedly had a point which was worth consideration and Senators and other persons apart from the Deputy <Col N="497" /> concerned might wish to be reassured that what we are now proposing to do cannot be lightly set aside at some future date simply as a result of a ministerial whim.</P>
    <P>There are two further provisions in the Bill designed to simplify matters for the beneficiaries so far as existing payments of children's allowances are concerned when the title becomes legally vested in the mother.  There are about 300,000 or so mothers who have been nominated by the fathers to receive the allowance and it would clearly be unreasonable to require these mothers to make fresh claims for the allowances in their own right. What the Bill proposes to do is to treat them as having made the original claims, and the allowances can thus continue to be paid to them without interruption.</P>
    <P>The second provision deals with those existing claims where the records of the Department show the father as the payee.  Under the amended normal residence rules the allowance becomes legally payable to the mother in these cases provided, of course, she is still alive.  In many of these cases she could have been dead for some years, or living outside the country altogether.  In other cases the mother has been content, for any one of a number of reasons, such as the state of her own health or distance from the nearest post office, to let the father handle the children's allowances and would prefer to allow this situation to continue even when she is the person legally entitled to receive it.</P>
    <P>Normally she would arrange this by nominating the father as payee.  The Bill provides, however, that unless the mother otherwise elects, the father will be regarded as having been nominated by the mother and the allowance will continue to be paid to him thus avoiding the necessity for such formal nomination in these cases.  The mother will, of course, be the person entitled to the allowance and if, by a simple notification to the Department, she elects to receive payment it will be made to her as of right.  This will also provide the most effective means of dealing with that <Col N="498" /> minority of cases where the father, for his own reasons, has not taken any steps to nominate the mother as payee even though she would have wished it so, and has continued to handle the allowances himself.  In these cases the mother, as the person entitled as of right will now be able to arrange to receive payment of the allowances herself by simply letting the Department know her wishes, without the necessity for what could possibly be embarrassing intervention by the Department in the matter.  In the case of future claims, the allowance will automatically be paid to the mother unless she nominates the father or some other person to receive it.</P>
    <P>I have much pleasure in recommending this measure to Seanad Éireann for speedy and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very desirable measure of social improvement and indeed is consistent with the whole thinking of the times in regard to the independence of women and is in line with another legislative measure currently being debated in the House.  It is giving legislative effect to the reality that already exists in 85 per cent of cases where at the moment the mother is the recipient of children's allowances. It is proper that her title to such allowances should be embodied in statutory form.  I appreciate that the Minister must do that under the normal residence rules.  It is desirable that this should be so rather than complicating the actual statute itself.  It is better to have legislation as clean as possible and to incorporate what is being done here under the normal residence rules in legislation would unduly complicate the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear that legislation of this kind, simple legislation enabling the normal residence rules to be changed, is necessary in order to extend the children's allowances to the other areas of social welfare benefit so that in respect of qualified dependent children under the whole social welfare code, it will be quite clear that other increases under the code will be in the same situation as children's allowances. They will be governed by the normal <Col N="499" /> residence rules proposed, giving the mother title over the whole area of social welfare allowances in regard to her children.  For this reason the Bill is welcome.  It will apply in the manner I have mentioned to all future recipients.  In cases where at present the father is receiving the children's allowances the procedure proposed in the Bill which will allow the election by the mother, if she so wishes to change that procedure, is more effective than any embarrassing situation that might arise were that to be written in in a mandatory way into either regulation or legislation.</P>
    <P>As far as the future is concerned, the entitlement to children's allowances resides with the mother and this legal entitlement is there in respect of child allowances under the whole social welfare code.  In the case of existing children's allowances this is giving legal effect to what is the reality as far as 85 per cent of mother recipients are concerned and as far as the 15 per cent of cases where the father is the recipient are concerned, the mother has the right now to elect, if she wishes, to adopt what is being made legal as far as future recipients are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very desirable and one that is completely non-controversial. The point that was raised by my colleague in the Dáil has been met by the Parliamentary Secretary and I would agree on balance that the way we have adopted it is better than any form of incorporating complicated regulations into statutes.  I am against that in principle.  Statutes are complicated enough as regards interpretation. A far cleaner way to do it is in the manner suggested.  If something very foolhardy is done by some future Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;which is highly unlikely&mdash;the order must be laid before the House and must be challenged within 28 days in the Dáil.  The Bill represents clean, expeditious and effective legislation and the principle behind it has the backing of this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much I want to say except to thank Senator <Col N="500" /> Lenihan for his remarks.  This legislation is a highly desirable development so far as mothers are concerned.</P>
      <P>I might just mention very briefly the position regarding the father nominating the mother.  It is true that this applies in 85 per cent of the cases. but, in fact, there is another 5 per cent made up of widows, deserted wives, <i>et cetera</i>, who receive it.  The actual number of fathers who are claiming the children's allowance is approximately 10 per cent.  I should make it quite clear that that does not necessarily mean that 10 per cent of fathers are in conflict with mothers and are misusing the children's allowance in any way.  Actually the vast number of the 10 per cent of fathers collect the children's allowance as a matter of convenience where the mother may not be able to do so, through ill health or because she lives in a rural area and is not near a post office.  The father, on other business, would have occasion to be in the vicinity of the post office.  Therefore, purely by mutual agreement and without any tension or conflict within the household, the father collects the children's allowance.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately there is a small percentage of fathers who do misuse the children's allowance where the mother could well do with the allowance for the benefit of her children.  This is denied to her and undoubtedly misused by a small percentage of fathers. I would like to emphasise that despite all the talk about the mother's entitlement, with which I agree entirely, it would be wrong to give the impression that the vast majority of fathers are irresponsible and misuse money which was provided by the State for the benefit of the children.</P>
      <P>I would just like to conclude by thanking the Seanad for receiving the Bill.</P>

      <P>Is there any prospect that at some time in the future there will be some codification of all the social welfare legislation which is steadily getting more and more complicated? We have in section 5 a more or less identical new subsection being inserted in five separate Acts.  As this goes on, year by year, it is going to get more and more difficult for anyone to find his way around the Acts. I can see that it would be a long-term job.  Are there any proposals at all before the Department for doing some kind of codification of this in years to come?</P>

      <P>Tá gach duine anseo i bhfabhar an Bhille seo chun níos mó airgid a thabhairt do forbairt ins na limistéir Gaeltachta.  Na Seanadóirí a bhí ag caint inné bhíodar ar aon guth comh maith faoin Aire&mdash;sé sin go raibh sé ag déanamh a dhíchill don Ghaeltacht.  Ba mhaith liom féin cur leis sin mar tá gach cosúlacht, de <Col N="502" /> réir na scéimeanna atá déanta aige ón t-am a ceapadh é, go bhfuil sé lán dáiríre faoin obair atá ag teastáil ins na limistéir.  Sé mo thuairim féin go bhfuil an iomad focail curtha i gcló faoin gceist seo agus níl aon fhonn ormsa cur leo ach an méid seo a rá.  I 1925 caitheadh £625 ar Tuarascáil Choimisiún na Gaeltachta a chur i gcló.  Sé mo thuairim go raibh a lán céille le moltaí an Choimisiúin sin ach an chuid is mó acu tá siad le cur i gcrích fós.</P>
      <P>I 1963, nuair a cuireadh an Tuarascáil Choimisiún um Athbheochaint na Gaeilge i gcló, bhí meath na Gaeilge agus meath na limistéirí Gaeltachta le feiscint go soiléir.  Bhí tuitim mór i daonradh na limistéir sin go háirithe sna aois grúpaí faoi bhun 30 bliain d'aois.  Deir tuarascáil Bhreandán Mac Aoidh go bhfuil Gaeltacht na Gaillimhe mar a chéile.  Tá mé féin cinnte go gcaithimíd níos mó airgid a chaitheamh ins na limistéir Gaeltachta mar atá luaite sa mBille seo.  Mar sin ba mhaith liom fáiltiú roimh an mBille ach ní ghlacaim go bhfuil sin mar deireadh leis an scéal faoi fhorbairt na Gaeltachta.  An t-aon réiteach ar fhadhbanna na Gaeltachta ná an méid is mó cumhachta agus is féidir thabhairt ar ais do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ina gcúrsaí féin, i riaradh a gcúrsaí féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deireann an tAire féin ina ráiteas go bhfuil sé chun Údarás a cheapadh chun cúrsaí na Gaeltachta a riaradh. Tá súil agam go mbeidh breis cainteanna idir an tAire agus iad sin nach bhfuil sásta glacadh leis an Údarás mar a bhfuil sé leagtha amach ag an bpoinnte seo.  Tá súil agam go gcuirfear na cainteanna sin ar bun sar i bhfad.  Mar léirigh an tAire ón lá ar tháinig sé chugainn go bhfuil sé sásta comhairle a ghlacadh agus go bhfuil sé sásta caint leis na heagraisí éagsúla atá ag obair sa Ghaeltacht.  Nuair a thosnóidh an tÚdarás nua ag obair tá súil agam go mbeidh siad sásta airgead a chaitheamh ar chuile ghné sóisialta den Ghaeltacht.  Ní cheart go gcuirfeadh siad an béim ar thionsclaíocht amháin.  Tá mé féin i bhfabhar an t-airgead a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta chun é a <Col N="503" /> chaitheamh sa tslí is fearr a gceapann siad í a chaitheamh.</P>
    <P>Le blianta ba é dearcadh an Rialtais ná gur ceist teanga amháin a bhí i gceist againn nuair a bhí muid ag plé leis na Gaeltachtaí, ach tuigeann chuile dhuine anois go bhfuil fadhbanna móra eacnamaíochta agus sóisialta i gceist agus ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh arís don tuarascáil 1925.  Fiú amháin i 1925, san litir a chuir an Coimisiún ar bun glacadh leis an tuairim sin.  In Alt 10, ar leathanach 2 de Thuarascáil Choimisiúin na Gaeltachta, tá sé ráite: &ldquo;Is eol dúinn gurb éinní amháin, geall leis, na ceanntair sin agus líomatáistí tuatha áirithe in Éirinn ina bhfuil fadhb cruadh casta eacnamíochta le réiteach.  Tá dlúbhaint ag ceist na Gaeilge agus an ceist eacnamíochta len a céile agus iarrtar ar do Choimisiún iad a bhreithniú i dteannta a chéile&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Sé sin, glacadh ag an am sin go raibh dlúbhaint idir fadhbanna eacnamaíochta agus sóisialta na Gaeltachta agus fadhbanna ó thaobh teanga de, ach tugadh cúl ar an dearcadh sin agus tá a riocht le feiscint i gCamden Town agus Boston san lae inniu.  Tá sé thar am dúinn go léir, ceapaim, a bheith macánta faoin Ghaeilge agus faoin Ghaeltacht agus ceapaim an tslí is fearr chun Gaeilge a fheabhsú ná slí bheatha ar aon chéim le slí bheatha aon áit eile sa tír a chur ar fáil ins na limistéir Gaeltachta.  Rud eile, an cheist seo faoi fhorbairt na limistéir Gaeltachta, ní féidir an cheist sin a dheighilt ón gceist ginearálta faoi fhorbairt réigiúnach.</P>
    <P>Tuigeann an tAire, tá súil agam, go bhfuil géar ghá le polasaí réigiúnach fiúntach san tír seo faoi láthair, go háirithe toisc go bhfuil teipthe ar chuile iarracht polasaí réigiúnach a cheapadh ar scála an Euróip.  Más rud é go bhfuil polasaí faoi na réigiúin á cheapadh, tá sé tábhachtach go dtuigimíd go léir céard atá i gceist.</P>
    <P>Níl muid ag caint faoi chúrsaí eacnamaíochta amháin&mdash;tá muid ag caint i bhfad níos leithne ná sin. Caithfidh muid tosnú le comhacht a thabhairt ar ais do na réigiúin agus <Col N="504" /> forbairt eacnamaíochta a úsáid mar uirléis i bhforbairt réigiúnach.  Tá sé i n-am deireadh a chur leis an chaint agus polasaí fiúntach sin faoi na réigiúin a chur i gcrích, a chur ós comhair an phobail.</P>
    <P>Mar focal scoir, go minic deirtear go gcaithimíd an Ghaeltacht a chothabháil de bharr cúiseanna cultúrtha. Ba mhaith liom rud amháin a dhéanamh soiléir, agus sé seo go bhfuil sé mar polasaí Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre a gceartanna a thabhairt ar ais do mhuintir na Gaeltachta&mdash;ní mar fabhar ar bith ach go mba cheart é a dhéanamh.  Nílimid ach ag tabhairt a gceartanna do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, rud nár tugadh dóibh le fada.  Fáiltím roimh an mBille.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liomsa mo fhíor bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí a labhair ar an mBille anseo.  Cé nach raibh ach Bille beag ann, mar sin féin bhí díospóireacht suimiúil cuidiúil agus réalíoch againn. Is ábhar misnigh dom é go bhfuil fonn mór ar na Seanadóirí ó gach páirtí sa Teach seo go gcuirfí leas na Gaeilge agus leas na Gaeltachta chun cinn ar na bealaí is éifeachtaí.</P>
      <P>Mar a fheicimse an scéal anois tar éis bliain a chaitheamh mar Aire na Gaeltachta, is é an rud is tábhachtaí agus is práinní don Ghaeltacht ná lánfhostaíocht agus caighdeán maireachtála a chur ar fáil do muintir na Gaeltachta ins na seachtóidí.  Cabhróidh an Bille beag seo chun an fhostaíocht sin a chur ar fáil.</P>
      <P>Mar adúras, is é na cuspóirí atá leis an mBille seo ná £4 mhilliún breise a chur ar fáil do Ghaeltarra Éireann. Caithfear an t-airgead seo ar fhoirgnimh agus ar ghléasa nua do na tionscail atá á reachtáil ag Gaeltarra féin agus ar réamh-mhonarchain, is é sin, monarchain le cur ar chíos do thionscail nua.  Freisin caithfear cuid den airgead ar scaranna i gcomhlachtaí ina bhfuil Gaeltarra agus daoine eile i gcomhar le chéile chun comhthionscail nua a bhunú agus a reachtáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar adúras, táim an-bhuíoch do na Seanadóirí a labhair sa díospóireacht. Ar dtús an Seanadóir Brosnan: rinne sé tagairt do a lán rudaí a bhaineann <Col N="505" /> leis an Ghaeilge agus leis an Ghaeltacht. Rinne sé tagairt do cheisteanna a bhaineann le leathnú na Gaeltachta agus áiteanna ar imeall na Gaeltachta. Rinne cúpla Seanadóirí eile tagairt don fhadhb chéanna.  Dúirt an Seanadóir Brosnan gur thug mé geallúint go ndéanfadh an Rialtas ordú chun ceantracha éagsúla a thabhairt isteach sa Ghaeltacht.  Le déanaí, cúpla seachtain ó shin d'fhógair mé go hoifigiúil go raibh sé beartaithe ag an Rialtas Gaeltacht na Rinne i gContae Phort Láirge a leathnú agus ceantar beag i gCorca Dhuibhne, sé sin, an paróiste Clochán Bréanainn.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Seanadóir Brosnan tagairt do áiteanna i gceantar Eochaill, go háirithe Baile Mhac óda.  Do thugas cuairt ar an pharóiste sin le déanaí agus bhí an-áthas orm a fháil amach go raibh spiorad an-mhaith sa pharóiste, agus dúras sin ag an chruinniú a bhí againn an oíche sin. Má leanfar ar aghaidh leis an obair atá ar siúl i mBaile Mhac Óda, beidh mé in ann moltaí a thabhairt don Rialtas i gceann bliana nó mar sin chun an paróiste sin a thabhairt isteach sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Seanadóir Brosnan agus Seanadóirí eile tagairt chomh maith do cheist na gcoláistí samhraidh sa Ghaeltacht&mdash;go raibh laghdú ann anuraidh.  Bhuel, tá an-áthas orm a chur in iúl don Teach go raibh méadú ar líon na ndaltaí a bhí ag freastal ar chúrsaí samhraidh anuraidh agus tá áthas orm chomh maith a rá gurab é an scéal is déanaí atá agam ná gur cosúil go mbeidh níos mó daltaí ná ariamh ag freastal ar na coláistí Gaeilge i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Seanadóir O'Toole Gaeilge éigeantach.  Sílim go bhféadfadh díospóireacht an-shuimiúil a bheith againn ar an ábhar sin ach arís ní bhaineann sé leis an mBille seo. Luaigh an Seanadóir O'Toole chomh maith fadhbanna eile atá sa Ghaeltacht. Níl aon dabht ar bith ná go bhfuil fadhbanna an-mhór ann.  Ins na ceantracha iargúlta atá ann níl an bun structúr ann.  Mar shampla, tá fadhbanna a bhaineann le leictreachas agus uisce agus gach rud mar sin. Mar adúras, sé an rud is tábhachtái <Col N="506" /> ná lánfhostaíocht a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Is furasta é sin a rá ach is deacair é sin a dhéanamh. Mar sin féin, tá dul chun cinn ana-mhaith á dhéanamh ag Gaeltarra Éireann chun an fhostaíocht sin a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Bhí sé d'onóir agam cúpla seachtain ó shin an cúigiú monarcha a oscailt go hoifigiúil ins an estát thionscail i Ghaoith Dóbhair i gContae Dhún na nGall.  Chomh maith leis sin tá monarchana nua á dtógáil ins na ceantracha Gaeltachta eile, ach caithfimid an bunstructúr a chur ar fáil. Caithfimíd na háiseanna a chur ar fáil chomh maith leis na postanna.  Rinne an Seanadóir Yeats tagairt don cheist tábhachtach seo, sé sin, ceist an lánfhostaíochta agus dúirt sé, agus bhí an ceart aige, go mbeidh orainn na mílte postanna nua a chur ar fáil roimh 1980.</P>
    <P>Cé mhéad postanna a bheidh ag teastáil?  Le déanaí, rinne Gaeltarra Éireann suirbhéireacht iomlán i ngach paróiste sa Ghaeltacht agus tá meastacháin againn anois maidir leis na sprocanna postanna, sé sin the job targets, a bheidh ag teastáil.  Taispeánann an suirbhéireacht go mbeidh ar Ghaeltarra timpeall 1,200 postanna nua a chur ar fáil gach bliain idir 1974 agus 1980.  I 1973, chuireadh 1,150 postanna nua ar fáil agus maidir leis an mbliain seo, ó Mí Eanáir go deireadh Mí Bealtaine chuir na tionscail nua tímpeall 500 postanna nua ar fáil.  Tá súil agam, ós rud é anois go mbeidh airgead breise ar fáil ag Gaeltarra Éireann, go mbeidh siad in ann postanna breise a chur ar fáil.  Tá géar ghá le fostaíocht ins na ceantracha Gaeltachta.  Tá géar ghá le gach iarracht chun cosc a chur leis an tíde imeachta.  Ach mar adúras, ní furasta é sin a dhéanamh.  Tuigimse na deacrachtaí atá ann.  Tá ar intinn agam gach iarracht a dhéanamh an obair sin a choimeád ar siúl agus é a bhrostú.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Seanadóir Dolan tagairt do rudaí b'fhéidir nach bhfuil ceadaithe i díospóireacht a bhaineann leis an mBille beag seo.  Mar sin féin, thug sé ráiteas ana-mhaith agus rinne sé tagairt don obair a rinne na daoine a chuaigh romhamsa, na hAirí Gaeltachta <Col N="507" /> a bhí ann romhamsa.  Aontaím leis.  Tá creidiúint ag dul do gach Aire agus do gach Rialtas as ucht na n-iarrachtaí a rinne siad chun leas na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn.  Rinne sé tagairt chomh maith do Radio na Gaeltachta nach bhfuil sé le cloisteáil ar fud na tíre.  Tá deacrachtaí ann ach tá sé le cloisteáil ar VHF i ngach áit sa tír agus bheadh fonn mór ormsa, más féidir, é a chur ar fáil in gach áit sa tír.</P>
    <P>Rinne sé chomh maith tagairt do Chomhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  Tá an Comhaltas molta agam go poiblí go minic as ucht an dea-obair atá á dhéanamh acu chun ceol na tíre a athbheochan.  Bhí sé d'ónóir agam cúpla seachtain ó shin Fleadh Ceoil na Breataine a oscailt go hoifigiúil i mBirmingham i Sasana agus bhí íonadh orm go raibh níos mó ná 5,000 daoine i láthair ar an ócáid sin agus bhí beagnach 800 daoine páirteach sna comórtaisí a bhain leis an fleadh.  Tá an-áthas ormsa a rá go bhfuil cabhair airgid á thabhairt ag mo Roinnse don Chomhaltas gach bliain.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Seanadóir Dolan tagairt freisin do Chómhaltas Uladh.  Is cuid de Chonradh na Gaeilge iad agus tugann mo Roinnse cabhair nach beag dóibh tríd an Chonradh gach bliain.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir O'Brien nach furasta obair a chur ar fáil in áiteanna iargúlta sa Ghaeltacht agus tá an ceart ar fad aige.  Cabhróidh an t-airgid faoin mBille seo chun an fhadhb sin a réiteach.</P>
    <P>Rinne cúpla Seanadóirí tagairt do Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Mar adúras i mo ráiteas, tá sé beartaithe ag an Rialtas go mbeidh údarás mar sin ann.  Táimíd ag obair faoi láthair ar an mBille agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an Bille sin ós comhar na Dála agus ós cómhar an tSeanaid sa bhFómhar.  Tá súil agam chomh maith go mbeidh an t-údarás nua bunaithe i Mí Eanáir, 1975.  Sílimse, mar adúras i mo ráiteas, go bhfuil sé fíor-thábhachtach go mbeidh guth láidir ag pobal na Gaeltachta san údarás nua.  Tá sé beartaithe agam boird cúige le hionadaí Gaeltachta a bhunú agus go n-ainmeóidh gach ceann de na boird sin duine lena <Col N="508" /> ceapadh ar bhord an údaráis.  Is é mo thuairimse go mbeidh deis nua ag muintir na Gaeltachta páirt iomlán a ghlacadh i bhfoirbairt na Gaeltachta nuair a bheidh an údarás nua bunaithe. Mar adúras, beidh deis againn, nuair a bheidh an Bille sin ós chómhar an tSeanaid, díospóireacht iomlán a bheith againn ar chúrsaí Gaeilge agus cúrsaí na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir Higgins go mba cóir dúinn moltaí an Tuarascála um Athbheochan na Gaeilge a chur i gcrích.  Aontaím leis.  Deir sé freisin go mba chóir dúinn cumhacht a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta féachaint i ndiadh a gcúrsaí féin. Tabharfaidh an údarás nua an deis sin do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Nuair a dfhógair mé an údarás ar dtús bhí mórán mí-thuiscint ann ach tá an-áthas orm a rá go bhfuil formhór muintir na Gaeltachta i bhfábhar an údaráis sin, agus bhí an-áthas orm a chloisint go bhfuil na Seanadóirí ina bhfábhar freisin.  Beidh lá eile againn chun an cheist sin a phlé.</P>
    <P>Rinne Seanadóiri eile tagairt do cheisteanna nach bhfuil oiriúnach do dhíospóireacht ar an mBille beag seo. Maidir leis an údarás, chomh maith, dúirt an Seanadóir O'Toole go mba chóir go mbeadh ceangal díreach idir muintir na Gaeltachta agus an Rialtas.  Leis an údarás nua beidh an ceangal díreach sin ann faoi bhoird cúigíocha an údaráis agus ansin díreach go dtí an Rialtas trí Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Rud eile a luaigh an Seanadóir Dolan go mba chóir dúinn deontas beag a thabhairt ar mhaithe le daltaí a théann go dtí an Ghaeltacht. Anuraidh rinne muid an deontas sin a dhúbailt agus tá breis agus £300,000 á chaitheamh againn ar na deontais sin in aghaidh na bliana.  Dúirt sé chomh maith gurb é mo Aireacht an ceann is deacra agus is tábhachtái dá bhfuil ann agus go bhfuil anam na tíre faoi mo chúram.  Tugann sé an-áthas dom é sin a chloisint agus is ábhar misnigh dom é.  Tá súil agam go n-eireóidh liom, mar adúras, leas na Gaeltachta agus leas na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá maidir leis an bhforbairt atá ar siúl sa <Col N="509" /> Ghaeltacht faoi láthair.  Go luath tar éis mo cheapachán mar Aire na Gaeltachta is é an treoir a thug mé do Ghaeltarra Éireann ná pleananna a ullmhú chun forbairt iomlán a chur ar siúl ní amháin ins na monarchana ach forbairt talmhaíochta, iascaireachta, garradóireachta, agus pleananna chun forbairt na n-oileán a chur chun cinn. Tá na pleananna go léir sin leagtha amach agus tá cuid acu a feidhmiú faoi láthair.  Tá monarchana nua á dtógáil ins na ceantracha Gaeltachta. Tá réamh-mhonarchana á dtógáil ann. Chomh maith leis sin tá forbairt talmhaíochta ar siúl agus forbairt garradóireachta.  Tá forbairt talmhaíochta an-thábhachtach ar siúl i nGaeltacht Mhaigh Eo faoi láthair.  Tá comhlacht nua bunaithe i gceantar Iorras ina bhfuil Gaeltarra Éireann agus Comharchumann lorrais páirteach. Is obair an-thábhachtach í sin agus forbairt an-thábhachtach.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin tá ionad beathaithe uan oscailte in Acaill, agus tá ceann eile á thógáil faoi láthair i gceantar Seóighe i gConamara agus tá deontas ceadaithe againn chun an tríú ceann a chur ar fáil i nGaeltacht Chiarraí, sin forbairt talmhaíochta. Mar gheall ar fhorbairt iascaireachta, tá monarcha próiséala éisc nua oscailte in Ailt an Chorráin, Contae Dhún na nGall agus ceann eile sa Daingean.  Tá obair ar ché Ros a' Bhíl ar siúl faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an ngarradóireacht, tá cúpla tionscail ana-mhaith i nGaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne.  Tá ceann nua á chur ar siúl ann faoi láthair.  Maidir leis na hoileáin, chuir sé an-áthas ormsa cúpla mí ó shin a fhógairt go hoifigiúil go raibh tionscail nua bunaithe ag Gaeltarra in Oileán Árainn Mhór i gContae Dhún na nGall agus Oileán Inis Mór i gContae na Gaillimhe.  Is céimeanna ar aghaidh ana-mhaith iad sin.</P>
    <P>Tá a lán deacrachtaí ann ach tá Gaeltarra ag dul ar aghaidh leis an obair.  Mar adúras in mo ráiteas, ní beag a bhfuil déanta ag Gaeltarra ó bunaíodh é cúpla bliain ó shin.  Rinne mé tagairt do na fadhbanna atá ins na ceantracha Gaeltachta maidir le bunstructúr. Tá fadhbanna eile ann maidir le cúrsaí iompair agus eile.  Tá <Col N="510" /> siad sin an-thábhachtach ar fad.  Tá deacrachtaí móra ann, ach mar is eol don Teach tá Comhlacht Aer Seirbhís nua bunaithe ann anois agus tá aerstráicí le cur síos ins na hoileáin agus ins na ceantair Gaeltachta.  Chabhróidh an t-aer seirbhís sin go mór chun forbairt na Gaeltachta agus forbairt na n-oileán a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Níl mórán eile le rá agam ag an am seo ach arís mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí a labhair ar an mBille, mo bhuíochas a ghabháil don Seanad faoi fháiltiú a chur roimh an mBille beag agus tá súil agam, le cúnamh Dé, go mbeidh díospóireacht fada iomlán againn nuair a bheidh mé ar ais arís i gceann cúpla mí leis an mBille do údarás nua na Gaeltacht.  Go raibh maith agaibh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 18, to delete &ldquo;city town, or locality&rdquo;, and substitute &ldquo;city, town, and the area within a 15 mile radius of the city or town&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is following on the discussion we had on section 1 yesterday.  The point I made was that the definition of a place which is set out in the section as including a city, town or locality was too vague.  Nobody can really know what a locality is; it would have to be decided by the Labour Court or some other court in each individual case. There would never be any certainty because at no stage would you actually be able to set out the boundaries of a locality.  All you could take would be individual cases relating to individual premises and say that this one is in the same locality as the other one and the next time the problem arose you would have precisely the same problem.  You would never get any definitiveness about it.  It would lead to a great deal of difficulty in a matter which is important because to this definition is tied the whole question of the equality of pay between different groups of workers.  If there were two factories in a locality which happened to be associated with the same holding company the whole question of equal pay between those employed in each factory would arise.  If one does not know what a locality is it makes life rather difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment suggests that while keeping the definition of a city or town, there should also be an area of 15 miles around each city or town.  It is, perhaps, not entirely satisfactory in the sense that there might be areas where you would prefer to have a locality which is bigger than this or even smaller than this.  At least it lends itself to consistency and definitiveness. The Minister was interested in Bray.  It would bring Bray within the ambit of the locality of Dublin.  In most cases I think it would be satisfactory enough.  Certainly it would be more satisfactory <Col N="513" /> than the very vague definition set out in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>This section defines a place as a city, town or locality.  This definition was included by way of an amendment moved on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  Its purpose was to remove any doubt regarding the definition of &ldquo;place&rdquo; and to indicate clearly the full scope of the provision.</P>
      <P>The intention is that entitlement to equal pay would arise in respect of employment by the same employer in a particular city, town or locality.  The difficulty regarding the amendment suggested by the Senator&mdash;the area within a 15-mile radius of the city&mdash; is that it would not have the full scope that we envisage by the use of the term &ldquo;locality&rdquo;.  Comprehended under &ldquo;locality&rdquo;, the definition used in the section, is the idea of a pay region, one well understood by the Labour Court, by the employers or trade unions in any particular area.  The reality of equal pay claim situations is that claims would be negotiated by both sides of industry.  Both sides of industry would, of course, be well aware of pay areas and what exactly was intended in a particular area to be the catchment area for such locality.  The setting of a mileage limit as suggested would not provide the flexibility of interpretation which is necessary in this matter. One could enter into finer debating points such as whether it was 15 miles as the crow flies, whether it was in the centre of the city or town and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact what we wished to have included under this idea of locality was where you would have an industrial estate outside a town, where a suburb was really an integral part of the town or locality and where somebody might argue, if you had an arbitrary mileage limit, that in fact it was somehow outside this particular circle even though the area was understood by all to be within the area and even though all <Col N="514" /> wage rates within the area had previously been negotiated as a unit.  For that reason I would not be in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister today has given a much more elaborate and comprehensive explanation as to what precisely he means by &ldquo;locality&rdquo; than he gave us yesterday.  While I am still worried about the vagueness of the term on the basis he has set out, that there are these particular pay districts known both to management and unions, now that he has said that this is what he has in mind, the matter becomes clearer and I am prepared to withdraw this amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 42, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;if the employee consents&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This matter was raised by Senator Ryan yesterday and I think it is a matter of some importance.  The present situation is that under section 7 (2) the Minister has the power to intervene in an equal pay situation where the woman concerned has not done anything herself.  The section says:</P>
      <P>either no dispute has arisen in relation thereto or it is not reasonable to expect the employee concerned to refer a dispute in relation to such a clause to an equal pay officer.</P>
      <P>We have a situation, in other words, where the Minister feels that a particular woman is being paid less than she ought to be paid on grounds of sex, that she is for some reason unable or unwilling, or most likely is afraid, to bring the matter forward and get involved in what she might feel would be the controversy and possible difficulties that might arise. The Minister can, therefore, enter into this and refer the matter to the equal pay officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would all agree in theory, as a matter of principle, that where an employer is paying a worker less than she is entitled to get the matter should be referred to the various <Col N="515" /> procedures set out in this Bill.  In principle one would agree with this and support such a decision by the Minister to intervene.  However, many workers, particularly underpaid workers and perhaps also women workers who are not always as aggressive as men, are less inclined to get themselves involved even in ordinary trade union activity and certainly less inclined to get involved in anything which could involve them in disputes. We may regret this but it is a fact to which one must have regard.  We have, therefore, the position that a worker might be most unwilling to have this matter raised at all.  The question is, therefore, in such a case should one bring the whole matter into the realm of discussion and dispute with an equal pay officer and later the Labour Court in spite of this unwillingness of the employee, or should one, on the other hand, ask the employee to agree.</P>
    <P>There is something to be said on each side but on the whole one ought to accept that if an employee does not wish one to intervene, even though in theoretical terms as well as in principle the employee might be wrong, nonetheless an individual worker has the right to refuse to consent to a proceeding of this kind.  If a worker is unwilling to take an action herself and is unwilling that the Minister should take any action, it seems wrong that the Minister should in a sense go over her head and go ahead with the procedures under this section.  It is not as if there is any need for the employee's consent to be published or anything of that kind.  The employee does not need to take any action.  The Minister ought to get some kind of private written consent from the employee before going ahead under this section.  Otherwise, you are in the position that the Minister is intervening, potentially, against the wishes of the employee.  If the employee agrees then there is no problem at all.  If the employee does not agree and does not want the Minister to act then it seems quite wrong that the Minister should have the power to act.  Therefore, we are <Col N="516" /> proposing this amendment to insert the words &ldquo;if the employee consents&rdquo; in the subsection which would then read:</P>
    <P>Where it appears to the Minister that an employer has failed to comply with an equal pay claim but that either no dispute has arisen in relation thereto or it is not reasonable to expect the employee concerned to refer a dispute in relation to such a clause to an equal pay officer, the matter may if the employee consents be referred to an equal pay officer...</P>
    <P>and so on from there.  I think it improves the subsection.  I do not think it would really reduce in any practical way the powers of the Minister, powers which we all agree he should certainly have.  It would eliminate the possibility that a particularly nervous or anxious worker might have her case thrown into controversy against her wish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be in order in asking the Minister a question?  If a male worker leaves his job of his own accord, the labour exchange contacts the employer who says that he left of his own accord then he is automatically debarred for six weeks whereas the female does not come back ever.  She has no right at all.  I had a case a couple of years ago of a lady who left her employment after nine years' continuous service, with stamps, to look after her sick parents and for the simple reason that she was a female&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, I will.  I undertake to get in touch with the Senator on the point he raises.  It is not appropriate to this section but I will be in touch with the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Yeats's amendment arises from the fears he expressed yesterday that I might take action under this section despite the fact that (a) the woman concerned did not wish such <Col N="517" /> action to be taken and (b) that the woman might, as a result of my action, becomes involved in legal expenses.  His amendment, therefore, suggests that any action to be undertaken by me should be only with the consent of the employee concerned. As I pointed out yesterday, there is discretion both on my part and on that of the equal pay officer acting on my behalf and I would, of course, have regard to the circumstances in each individual case and where any injury would be likely to arise to a woman no such action would be taken by me.  I would point out that what we are attempting under this section is to act on behalf of the woman who is in the unorganised job, who is afraid to press forward the claim that she could make under the legislation, leaving it possible for me to act on her behalf where the circumstances warrant it and using full discretion in so acting.  To accept the Senator's amendment would have the effect of preventing me from referring the case of a group of workers under this legislation if one or two took exception to action being taken even where the circumstances warranted that action should be taken.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Senator earlier was very anxious to see that we fully adhered to the EEC directive on equal pay, where the State would have a supervisory function on the implementation of equal pay, and I believe that if I accepted his amendment it would certainly dilute the State's effectiveness in fulfilling our obligations under that directive.  For these reasons, I find that the Senator's amendment would not make the legislation more effective as I am sure it is his wish that it should be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not even remotely convinced by the reference to the EEC directive.  I do not think that this very minor change would in any way undermine the Minister's position with regard to the draft directive.  I do not think the absence of supervision by the State would be affected by an amendment of this kind.  However, I am more convinced by his point about a group of workers.  I can see that if the Minister <Col N="518" /> wanted to act on behalf of a group and if one or two people, for whatever reason, refused to agree and if this meant that no action could be taken for the rest of them then obviously this would be a highly undesirable situation.</P>
      <P>I am not altogether clear about the meaning of his reference to the equal pay officer.  After all, the equal pay officer acting for him will only proceed if it is not going to do the worker any harm.  I may have a totally erroneous view of the provisions with regard to equal pay officers.  I thought that the duty of an equal pay officer would be to look into a case and if someone was being paid a wage that was too low, on grounds of sex, he would have a duty to go straight ahead and make a decision that this was so, and which could be appealed to the Labour Court.  I certainly would not like to think that an equal pay officer could look into things and decide &ldquo;this woman is being paid too little but all the same she is a nervous kind and she does not want much done about it so I will not take any action&rdquo;.  I would much prefer to feel that an equal pay officer has no power of judgment of his own in that sense of the word, that he has to find out whether equal pay is being operated and to say firmly if it is not and that that is the position.  Therefore, I feel that under section 7 (2) once the Minister has referred the matter to an equal pay officer he ought to go straight ahead and not have any regard to the Minister or anyone else but find out what the facts are.</P>
      <P>However, on the whole it seems that there could be arguments on both sides and because of the Minister's point about the group of workers who could be held up by one or two people who refuse to consent, I am withdrawing this amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 5, to delete lines 29 and 30, and substitute &ldquo;A party to a dispute determined by the Court under subsection (1) may, notwithstanding <Col N="519" /> section 17 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, appeal to the judge of the Circuit Court in whose circuit the party lives or carries on business, as the case may be&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This arose from a discussion we had yesterday.  I pointed out on Committee Stage that the Minister has provided a form of appeal which is almost identical with what I have in the amendment, under section 10 (5).  Section 10 deals with the dismissal of a worker who has been held by the Labour Court to be dismissed from employment solely or mainly because she claimed equal pay from her former employer.  The Labour Court decide as a matter or right that this dismissal was wrongful and instruct the employer to pay the worker the amount due.  If the employer does not pay the amount due then he is brought to the District Court and may be convicted of an offence.  From this direction of the Labour Court initially deciding that the dismissal was wrongful, the employer has an appeal to a judge of the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>In section 8 we again have a direction made by the Labour Court to the effect that certain wages ought to be paid to a worker or group of workers and the employer is directed to pay these wages.  This is on all forms with section 10.  In section 8 the employer is told by the Labour Court to pay wages and, indeed, arrears of wages to an employee.  In section 10 the Labour Court tells the employer to pay arrears of remuneration to a worker who has been dismissed.  But in section 10 there is an appeal to the ordinary courts while in section 8 there is no appeal except a very limited appeal in subsection (3) to the High Court on a point of law.  For practical purposes, the employer is in the position that he has no appeal at all against the Labour Court on foot of the decision that they have made with regard to the amount of pay due to the workers.  The Minister has provided an appeal in section 10 and it seems to me that it is only justice and consistent with the provisions in section 10 that the provisions should also be entered in section 8.  I am, therefore, proposing that in section <Col N="520" /> 8, instead of the very limited appeal to the High Court on a point of law, there should also be an appeal to the judge of the Circuit Court in whose circuit the party lives or carries on business, as the case may be.  It would be an appeal in this case either by the employer or by the worker concerned. That is why I mention both of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Yeats pointed out what he saw as a different mode of legal procedure as between section 8 and section 10.  I made the point yesterday that the sections relate to two vastly different roles.  In section 8 there is the appeal on a point of law and in section 10 an appeal to the Circuit Court on a point of fact. It relates to industrial relations in section 8 while in section 10 there may be other matters involved including, possibly, the question of the judicial function of the court and there is, therefore, an appeal on a point of fact.</P>
      <P>Mainly, and I emphasise this, it has been the practice under industrial relations to designate the Labour Court as the final arbiter in industrial disputes.  As a matter of policy I wish to continue this practice.  That is why you only have the appeal on points of law in section 8.  Even on points of law under section 8 there is considerable protection given to persons who may feel aggrieved by the determination of the Labour Court on equal pay matters.  On a point of law it is conceivable that it could be the interpretation of the equal value concept itself as determined by the court.  Mainly, it is on the basis of the different functions of both sections and primarily on the necessity, as I see it, of preserving the Labour Court as the final arbitrator in the area of industrial relations proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not appear to realise that this Bill is bringing about a very radical change in the functions and activities of the Labour Court.  Until now the Labour Court have had very considerable activities to carry out in the field of industrial relations but until now they had been a voluntary court.  If the Labour Court make a pay award, <Col N="521" /> they say that in their opinion a group of workers should be paid certain wages and an employer can ignore that.  It may involve him in a strike and other untoward consequences but there is no criminal law involved. Nobody is going to say to the employer that he will be brought before the District Court or Circuit Court and fined.  An employer, just like a trade union, can completely ignore any decision of the Labour Court.  It is purely voluntary.</P>
      <P>This Bill will bring about a radical change, as far as equal pay is concerned, in the activities of the Labour Court.  As far as equal pay is concerned it is no longer an ordinary industrial court as has been the case in the past.  The situation now is that the Labour Court will set out, not as a recommendation but as a direction, what pay is to be given to workers. The employer must pay that; it is not a voluntary matter; it is not a recommendation; it is a direction to an employer to pay certain wages.  If he refuses he can be found guilty of an offence.  Section 8 (4) (b) states:</P>
      <P>If, where an order is made by the Court under paragraph (a), the direction contained in the order is not carried out within two months from the date of the making of the order (or, where there is an appeal under subsection (3), within two months of the date of the order of the High Court on the appeal) the person to whom the direction is given shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100 and, in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding £10 for every day during which the offence is continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a case of the Labour Court acting as an ordinary court in industrial relations.  There is a clear situation where a direction, not a recommendation, is given to an employer who commits a criminal offence making him liable to considerable fines in the event of there being a large group of workers involved and yet he has no appeal.  If the Labour Court decide, on a false criterion&mdash;if the recommendation is not in order he has an appeal on a point <Col N="522" /> of law&mdash;on the basic question of the amount of wages they fix, the employer has absolutely no redress at all.</P>
    <P>If an employer wished to suggest, for example, that a second factory was not in the same locality, as defined in section 1, as the first factory, and the Labour Court held as a fact that it was, he would have no redress against that either.  There is no element of law there.  The matter has been left so vague that the Labour Court would be able to decide the facts for themselves and the employer has no appeal.  That is unjust.  I am reasonably confident that any employer who is not particularly keen on this legislation would be able to upset this in the Supreme Court.  It is clearly unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>One can argue about the Constitution indefinitely and no two people will agree until ultimately a decision has to be taken by the Supreme Court. It is the only way of getting a definite result.  I think it is a very serious fault in this Bill that on an important matter of this kind there should be no appeal.  There is no basic difference in principle between the situation under section 8 and section 10.  In each case the matter in issue is that the Labour Court give the employer a direction to pay certain moneys to a worker.  That is the basic result achieved in each case.  There is no difference in principle that justifies the omission of an appeal from section 8 and the inclusion of an appeal in section 10.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 32, to delete &ldquo;104&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;156&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said yesterday, we have in this Bill the problem that while it is a general rule, particularly arising out of subsection (5) of section 8, that the limit on the amount of arrears of wages that can be awarded to a worker is three years, in one limited case the rule is different: it is two years.  Under section 10 (1), where the Labour Court find that a woman was unjustly dismissed the amount of compensation payable is limited to 104 <Col N="523" /> weeks' remuneration.  This seems inconsistent.</P>
    <P>If the employer is prosecuted for wrongfully dismissing a woman under section 9 the court are empowered to give her three years' arrears; equally, if an employer has been instructed by the Labour Court, in respect of a case where an employer was not prosecuted, to pay the maximum of two years' arrears in remuneration and this is disregarded by the employer and he is prosecuted for not paying this amount, the court can pay the worker up to three years.  It would be very much in a worker's interests to persuade an employer not to pay and allow himself to be prosecuted thus getting herself an extra year's wages.  I am suggesting that for two years, 104 weeks, she would be subject to 156 weeks or three years, which would then equalise in all parts of the Bill the amount of arrears of wages that the worker can get.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The section provides that where a woman is dismissed because she sought equal pay the Labour Court may by order direct the employer to pay to the woman by way of compensation for such a dismissal a sum up to 104 weeks' remuneration. The Senator proposes 156 weeks' remuneration in his amendment.  It would appear that the Senator is chiefly concerned to get consistency with section 8 (5) which provides that a woman may be awarded up to three years' arrears of remuneration.</P>
      <P>The two provisions are not strictly comparable.  The three years in section 8 (5) refer to arrears of the difference between the pay a woman had been receiving and the extra money she would have been getting under an equal pay award.  The 104 weeks in section 10 (1) refer to the full pay a woman would have been receiving if she had not been dismissed.  Therefore, there is no inherent inconsistency in retaining 104 weeks in section 10 (1) (d) and three years in the longer period in the other case where in fact what is being sought is the difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister is giving an interpretation of his own of subsection (3) (a) of section 10 which seems to me to be totally erroneous.  We have in subsection (3) (a) of section 10 a situation where an employer is being prosecuted for not paying the arrears on a dismissal that was set out by the Labour Court.  It states in that subsection that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... in addition to any other punishment, a fine not exceeding the amount which in the opinion of the court the plaintiff would be entitled <Col N="525" /> to recover against the convicted person in respect of such arrears of remuneration.</P>
    <P>If the Minister will look at page 6, there is another subsection (3) (a), only this time it is subsection (3) (a) of section 9.  It is absolutely identical from start to finish with the wording of this particular paragraph.  In this instance it is where a woman is dismissed, the employer has been prosecuted for dismissing her and brought before the court and the court, in addition to any other punishment, may impose a fine not exceeding the amount which in the opinion of the court the plaintiff would be entitled to recover against the convicted employer in respect of such arrears of remuneration.</P>
    <P>If I were to ask the Minister here what this meant, how much the employer would get out of this section, he could hardly say 104 weeks as set out in the section because it is not set out in the section&mdash;it is set out in the following section under a different heading, section 10.  I would say that the sensible way of looking into that would be that the worker is entitled to three years remuneration in accordance with the general rules set out in section 8 (5).  Certainly it cannot be 104 weeks because that does not arise anywhere in the Bill up to and including section 9.  If it is three years in subsection (3) (a) of section 9, it clearly is also three years in subsection (3) (a) of section 10.  These subsections are absolutely identical.</P>

      <P>I know the Senator is transferring this Report Stage into a Committee Stage and I am inclined to go along with him a little but I cannot enter into this debate all over again.  The case is initiated in the civil court in section 9 and I have <Col N="526" /> pointed out the situation in relation to section 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so initiated.  It has nothing to do with a civil court. I am referring to subsection (3) (a). Section 9 provides that where a woman claims equal pay from her employer and afterwards she is dismissed:</P>
      <P>.... subsequent to the making of the claim the employer dismisses the woman from her employment solely or mainly because she made the claim, the employer shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100 or on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £1,000.</P>
      <P>That is subsection (1) which relates to a criminal offence committed by the employer and he is charged in a criminal court.  This is not a civil proceeding at all.  He is charged in a criminal court and arising out of this criminal charge it is provided in subsection (3) (a) that the court may award three years, and the Minister concedes that it is three years' arrears of remuneration.  In section 10 we have a similar position.  Again, the employer is brought before the court for, in this case, not paying the correct arrears on grounds of dismissal and we had the same provision that the court may impose a fine not exceeding the amount which, in the opinion of the court, the plaintiff would have been entitled to recover, and so forth, in respect of such extra amount of remuneration.  I do not think that any lawyer or any barrister or solicitor would have very much trouble in getting three years' arrears for an employee in these circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have absolutely no doubt that three years is what she would be entitled to under either of these paragraphs on either page 6 or page 7, and that being so, it is totally inconsistent with the provision in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 10 when the Labour Court can only give 104 weeks.  There is complete discrepancy in the Bill and we have the position therefore, that if an employee is awarded the maximum <Col N="527" /> of two years' back pay, if the employer does not pay it and he is brought into court and convicted, then she will get three years.</P>
