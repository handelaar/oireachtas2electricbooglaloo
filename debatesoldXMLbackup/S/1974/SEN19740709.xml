      <P>I mentioned on the last occasion, when the Second Stage of the Adoption Bill, was being taken that I should like to see No. 8 on the Order Paper, that is, the Illegitimate Children (Maintenance and Succession) Bill, 1974, taken when the Committee Stage of the Adoption Bill is being taken.  At that stage the Leader of the House was not in a position to tell me whether this would be possible.  I would be grateful if he would indicate if it will be possible to take this Bill when the Committee Stage of the Adoption Bill is being taken.  The subject matter is very much tied in with whatever reforms we bring about in the adoption procedure.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion I did not move a formal amendment to this effect because I wanted to give formal notice that I intended to do more at the Second Reading at the same time as the Committee Stage of the Adoption Bill was being taken.  At that time I thought that that would be this week but we are resuming the Second Stage of the Adoption Bill to-day.  Perhaps I could give formal notice on the Order of Business today that I propose to move the amendment when the Committee Stage of the Adoption Bill is being taken.</P>

      <P>I thought I had made this clear the last day.  I am sorry if I did not.  I do not think it will be possible to take No. 8 before the Recess but what I suggested last week was that if the subject matter of the Illegitimate Children's Bill should be relevant to sections of the other Bill, Senator Robinson might find herself in a position to raise the points in relation to the Committee.  I did not intend to give the impression that this other Bill would be taken with the Adoption Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Leader of the House for clarifying that point.  Normally the reason given for not taking the Second Reading of a Bill is because the Minister concerned cannot be present in the House, but as the Minister will definitely be here for the Committee Stage of the Adoption Bill I fail to understand why we cannot have a Second Reading given to the Illegitimate Children (Maintenance and Succession) Bill which has been on the Order Paper for a number of weeks and the subject matter of which is very important.  It is linked with any rounded attempts to improve adoption and family law in this area.  Therefore, I am surprised not to have had a more concrete reason for not taking it before the Recess.</P>

      <P>I did not give the reason that was suggested by Senator Robinson.  I hope the Senator appreciates that.  If I am asked to give a reason I would refer the Senator to the fact that there are present on the Order Paper five Government Bills.  There will be more before the end of the month. As things are, we must make up our minds that Government business this month will have to receive a certain degree of priority.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned on the last sitting day, I was referring to a document which had been sent to me and, I suspect, to other Members of this House on the adoption <Col N="905" /> legislation by an organisation called Children First.  I do not propose to go into it in any detail except to say that in many respects I found their arguments compelling and certainly worthy of attention.  I should like to place on the record of the House my appreciation of the work they have and are doing for children in our society.</P>
      <P>As I said on the last occasion, this Bill is a good one so far as it goes, but it does not by any means go far enough. This is probably the last occasion for a long time on which we shall have an opportunity of amending adoption legislation&mdash;legislation which was thought to have been adequate when it was passed first and amended in 1964 but which still is a very conservative piece of legislation.  It needs a certain number of important loopholes so that the situation with regard to adoption generally can be improved.</P>
      <P>There are three main areas which I will leave at this stage to the House's consideration, while serving notice that I intend to put in some amendments to cover them for Committee Stage.  The first of these is the rights of children who cannot at present be adopted owing to the unsatisfactory state of the law. These are children whose parents are still alive or are presumed to be alive and who are in many cases, almost universally in the case of the children of whom I am thinking, in institutional care.  I ask this House whether it is right and just that we should have healthy children cooped up on the basis of a legal technicality while there are capable and willing adoptive parents only too anxious to give them a home.  This is not said in criticism of the institutions concerned.  They are administering the law as it exists.  They have no option in the matter.  If it were not for them the situation of these children would be a great deal worse, but my point is that it can be better.  The law as it stands needs to be changed in order to improve it.  The present Bill does not, unfortunately, propose to amend the law in order to make these necessary changes. That is the first main area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two minor areas which I would also bring to the attention of the House and which can be the subject of appropriate amendments.  The first is <Col N="906" /> concerned with children who are adopted legally abroad by parents, both of whom or one of whom is Irish.  Under the present law if they were adopted in Ireland these children would become Irish citizens <i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i>; but as the law stands at the moment, if these children are adopted abroad, no matter how legal the process of adoption through which they go, they are not entitled to this Irish citizenship.  I believe that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  It we are going to give Irish citizenship to legally adopted children of Irish couples in Ireland, we can without any difficulty at all extend this to include legally adopted children of Irish couples living temporarily or even permanently outside Ireland.</P>
    <P>The third area is the area which concerns the natural father.  The present adoption legislation almost totally ignores the natural father.  It virtually excludes him from serious consideration. Indeed there is a section which would enable the Adoption Board to exclude him from any considerations regarding the future of the child which he has fathered.  It seems to me we are unlikely to be accused of fostering licentiousness if we make some change, however modest, to recognise the role and perhaps even the rights, if they can adequately be defined, of the natural father of any illegitimate child which is in an adoption situation.</P>
    <P>These are the three areas in which the Bill, for all its good intentions, is seriously deficient.  I propose to table amendments at the appropriate time to attempt to deal with these deficiencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  The original Adoption Act was a very important piece of legislation. It is more than 20 years ago since that was passed.  It was inevitable that certain defects and omissions should have disclosed themselves over that period.  It was also evident that an evolution of thought should have taken place as to what is appropriate in regard to adoption at present.  Consequently this Bill is an important Bill in bringing the Adoption Act up to date.  In so far as it does that it is a very worthwhile Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> There are a number of amendments which I think should be considered, but I propose only to deal with one.  This is one to which Senator Horgan has already referred.  It is in connection with the complete omission of the rights of the natural father in cases of adoptions.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Adoption Act, 1952, says the following persons, and no other persons shall be entitled to be heard on an application for an adoption order:</P>
    <P>(a)  ... the applicants,</P>
    <P>(b)  the mother of the child,</P>
    <P>(c)  the guardian of the child,</P>
    <P>(d)  the person having charge of or control over the child,</P>
    <P>(e)  a relative of the child,</P>
    <P>(f)  a representative of a registered adoption society which is or has been at any time concerned with the child,</P>
    <P>(g)  a priest or minister of a religion recognised by the Constitution...</P>
    <P>(h)  an officer of the Board or</P>
    <P>(i)  any other person whom the Board in its discretion decides to hear.</P>
    <P>In case one might be under the impression that the father was omitted through inadvertence or just forgotten, it is quite clear that the original Act very positively has excluded the father from any consideration.  In section 3, which deals with definitions, it says that:</P>
    <P>... &ldquo;parent&rdquo; does not include the natural father of an illegitimate child</P>
    <P>Again, a relative is defined as a grandparent, brother, sister, uncle or aunt, whether of the whole blood, half-blood or by affinity, relationship to an illegitimate child being traced through the mother only.  Therefore there was a very definite policy decision to completely exclude the natural father from consideration when an adoption was taking place, not only to exclude any rights he might have to consent to the adoption, but even the right to be heard when an application was being heard. It seems to me that this was a rather Victorian attitude.  It was based on the impression that the fathers of illegitimate children are, first of all, unwilling <Col N="908" /> to admit that they are the fathers, or, even when it is clear that they are, that they are completely unconcerned with the fate of the child.  While this may be true in many cases, it is something which should not be taken for granted. It is entirely wrong that the Act should have prevented the father from even being heard in such an application.</P>
    <P>There was a very important and interesting case dealing with this point heard in the courts in 1966.  It was the case of The State (at the Prosecution of Leontis Nicolaou) v. An Bord Uchtála. It is reported in <i>The Irish Reports</i> for 1966 and I quote from page 567.  The facts of the case are briefly set out in the head note which says:</P>
    <P>The applicant, Leontis Nicolaou, was the natural father of a child born in London to a woman of Irish parents who was a citizen of Ireland. The applicant wished to marry the mother of the child but for various reasons out of his control and not of his desire he was unable to do so. Most of these reasons flowed from the mother's unwillingness to marry the applicant for various reasons.  The mother, with the applicant's consent, took the child to her parents' home in Ireland and then commenced making arrangements to have the child adopted.  The applicant was at first unaware of this but when he became aware of it he indicated very strongly that he was not agreeable to having the child adopted and that he wished to provide for the child himself.  He wished to have the child with him and was ready and willing to give the mother a home with himself or else to marry her, whichever she wished. Notwithstanding the applicant's views on the matter the mother arranged for the child to be adopted and an adoption order was made, unknown to the applicant, who, after some considerable difficulty, obtained information as to the adoption order. He thereupon applied to the High Court for a conditional order of <i>certiorari</i> to have the order brought up and quashed...</P>
    <P>Subsequently the case was heard, not only in that particular action, but in further proceedings in the High Court, and was argued in the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> The argument was that, as a matter of natural justice and equity, the father should at least have been heard and that the Adoption Board failed to exercise their discretion in a reasonable way by failing to hear the father, even though they knew the father wanted to be heard and that he disapproved of the adoption order.  Even though he was not in the list of those who must be heard, in fact he should have been heard.  However the fact of the matter is that the Supreme Court eventually held that the Act did not provide for a natural father to be heard, that the board in the circumstances were not obliged to hear him and that the Act was not unconstitutional, a matter which was argued among other points made in the case.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the Supreme Court held that that was the position.  That does not mean however that the Supreme Court agreed with the Act or agreed that the father should not have a right to be heard in such circumstances. They were merely dealing with the law as it stood.  I am quite satisfied that it would be clear from the Supreme Court decision that they were not expressing any decision as to whether in ideal circumstances the father should have the right to be heard.  In my view, there is no doubt that he should be heard.  Obviously it is not a situation which will arise often but in so far as it is going to arise, the father should have the right.  Consequently section 16 should be amended to deal with that.</P>
    <P>It is clearly equitable and natural justice that where a father not only admits to paternity but claims paternity, is a fit person to keep the child and objects to its being adopted, he should have the right to do so.  This, of course, would be a matter for the board and a matter for very serious consideration, but at least he should have the right to be heard by the board on such an application and put his point of view forward.  It is arguable&mdash;but perhaps this is going too far&mdash;that he should also be included under section 14 in the people who must give consent to an adoption.  However that is something that is perhaps going a bit too far.  In my view it is quite clear that he should be included under section 16 and the matter of whether he should be included <Col N="910" /> under section 14 is open to some discussion.  My point at this stage of the Bill is merely to give notice to the Minister that I intend to put down an amendment to deal with this point and to give him an opportunity to have a look at it in the meantime, but I do intend to put down an amendment under section 16.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that there is an Adoption Bill before the House because it gives us an opportunity to resume a debate which was in a sense postponed over two years ago, to be precise on the 29th June, 1972, when the Second Reading debate on the Adoption Bill of 1971, sponsored by Senators Horgan, Owens and myself, was withdrawn in favour of the promise of a Government measure.  I am glad that now at long last we have this Government measure before the House. Although I shall be critical of it, although I regard it as inadequate in many respects, although I will join with other Senators in putting down amendments to it, I am glad that there is a Government proposal to amend our adoption law.  Nevertheless, I differ from the view put forward by the Minister both in introducing this Bill and in statements outside the House, that all is reasonably well in adoption in Ireland and there is not much of a problem.</P>
      <P>In his Second Reading speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>Let me say for the record that while some of the changes that were advocated were likely to be improvements a lot of the criticism of the law in practice of adoption was being made by people on the periphery of the adoption scene here and was exaggerated and ill-considered mainly through lack of real knowledge.</P>
      <P>In a speech in Limerick at a seminar in April he made much the same point at slightly greater length.  The speech was given to the Irish Adoption Workers' Conference in Limerick on April 25th, and I quote from a text issued by the Government Information Services.  On page 9 of this speech the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been almost 20,000 adoption orders made in this country <Col N="911" /> since 1952 and, while we cannot say on a scientific basis or on the result of research that our system is successful, we can as a matter of subjective judgment by those who work in the field say that it has worked well and that our society is better for having it.  If our system had not been successful the volume of adoptions&mdash;20,000&mdash;would surely have produced adverse social consequences that would have been apparent long before now.  This may be a simplistic approach but I would suggest that it is one of commonsense and I think too it can be taken as a proper basis for congratulating all who have been involved in adoption work, the members of the Adoption Board, the officers of the board and the members and workers attached to adoption societies.</P>
    <P>I have to say that I do not share the Minister's complacency.  I do not share his general satisfaction that adoption is working well in Ireland. Many voices have been raised including the voices of social workers, of members of adoption societies, of adoptive parents and even of members of the Adoption Board, who went to the point of resigning from the Adoption Board in disgust when proposals that they made for reform were not considered and were not going to be implemented.  The numbers of people directly involved who have been dissatisfied with our adoption law and the number of those who expressed concern were far from the periphery, far from voicing either emotional or unsubstantiated grievances.  However, if this is the way in which the Bill is being put before the House, that there are only a few minor problems and that this Bill deals satisfactorily with them, I think the only way to counteract that is by trying to give some case histories of what has happened.  In my view many such cases will continue to happen even after we pass this Bill unless it is substantially amended.</P>
    <P>The reason that one has to rely on case histories to try to show the way in which adoption is working in this country is because there has not been an overall study of adoption procedure. Before looking at the specific histories <Col N="912" /> I should like to refer to <i>The Irish Times</i> of April 1st, 1974 and quote from a man who has been very closely involved in adoption and in calling for reform of adoption in this country, namely, Rev. John O'Mahoney, vice-chairman of the Central Council of Catholic Adoption Societies.  In this quotation from <i>The Irish Times</i> he calls first of all on the Government to implement the recommendations of the Kennedy and Devlin Reports and, in addition, to set up a child care section to deal with adoption. Let us note this call to implement the recommendations of two Government reports, not directly on adoption but which touch on adoption and both of which recommended that adoption should be taken out of the Department of Justice and put into the Department of Health and Social Welfare and that it should be treated as part of our child care services with a radically changed approach.  There is no reference of this in the Minister's introduction of this Bill.  It was as though neither the Devlin nor the Kennedy Reports had made these specific recommendations, because it would be my submission that if the Minister did not accept them he might at least have referred to them and given us the reason for not accepting them.  I continue with the quotation from Fr. O'Mahoney:</P>
    <P>It is quite extraordinary that the Department of Justice or the body appointed by it to supervise adoption work, namely the Adoption Board, has not been able to see fit to institute any type of research into the adoption services.  One must take it that the view of the Department and the board in this matter is that expressed by the former Minister for Justice last year in the adoption debate in the Senate.  He was so certain about the success of our adoption procedure that in reply to a demand for research on the lines carried out in England he could say that while research might be necessary in countries like England he was satisfied there was no need for it in this country.  This view was later described in the English adoption magazine, Child Adoption, as &ldquo;living in cloud cuckoo land.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>If <Col N="913" /> the Senator would read the rest of my speech in Limerick to see my views on research&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in fairness to the Minister he does now appreciate the need for research and he&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I always did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and indeed, more importantly, he is also prepared to provide moneys to the adoption societies. But I would put it to the Minister since he makes this point, this research is a long time coming.  The adoption procedure is 22 years in existence and there has not been any governmental research.  When the Minister became Minister for Justice he did not immediately set up a departmental committee to look into the question.  The Adoption Bill before us is not the subject of a detailed survey at governmental level. It is not adequate for the Minister to say that he is interested in an academic sense in research.  One has to be more convinced in practical terms of the acknowledgment of the very real deficiencies in our present adoption law and of a genuine intention to both set in motion the necessary research and also bring about much more radical reforms than we have here.</P>
      <P>Again the Minister gives the impression that it is a tiny vocal lobby of rather emotional people who are concerned about reform in adoption.  I should like to refer the House to a letter which we all received from the Joint Committee of Women's Societies and Social Workers, dated April, 1974. I shall just quote the first paragraph:</P>
      <P>Dear Senator,</P>
      <P>The joint committee of women's societies represents at least 50,000 women.  This committee was responsible for the first move towards pressing for legal adoption long before the passing of the Adoption Act, 1952. Since then the committee has followed progress and when amendments to present legislation were needed sought the opinions of affiliated societies. The results of the survey show an urgent need for...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It lists 14 amendments.  Many of these are not included in this Bill.  The first <Col N="914" /> one I will deal with in great detail later&mdash;&ldquo;Statutory Regulation for the registration and supervision of adoption societies&rdquo;. There are a number of others that I may refer back to in a later context. Any committee representing 50,000 women in the country who feel as strongly as the wording of that letter suggests are not an emotional fringe on the periphery of something they do not understand.  They reflect a very deep concern for reform in our adoption code and reform which goes a good deal beyond the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some case histories of what happens in our adoption code about which there has been so much complacency and satisfaction expressed.  The first of these illustrates a problem of an adoption which did not go through any adoption society.  It shows what can happen in relation to adoption practice even where there is goodwill.  It concerns the adoption of two children aged 12 and nine years who were born before the marriage of the mother.  The mother subsequently married a man who was not the putative father, but he was anxious to adopt his wife's two children who were living with them.  This was therefore a straightforward adoption which did not need to come through an adoption society.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the inadequacy of the system, the case took over two years for the adoption of the mother's two children to be completed.  This caused much unnecessary suffering to the older child, who was very upset.  That is a long time lag, given that there were no real problems involved.  Secondly, the mother related that a visitor came from the Adoption Board at 7.0 p.m. one Friday evening without any appointment or forewarning.  The prospective father was in a public house and this visitor forced the child to take her there in order to contact him.  She then stayed in the house talking to them for a few hours.  She took the older child aside and discussed with her about her being born before the marriage of her mother.  The mother was very angry on hearing of the questions she asked and felt she had intruded on them and had exceeded her position.  Both the mother and her husband as well as the older child were upset.  This visitor from the <Col N="915" /> Adoption Board is not a qualified social worker.  The case illustrates the vital need for using only trained professional people in this delicate region of human relations.  That is an example of a problem which can happen in the least complex case of all&mdash;where the children had been for a long time with their natural mother who married and it was their joint intention to adopt the children.</P>
    <P>Another case history illustrates the insensitivity of some workers in registered adoption societies to the adoptive parents' feelings in some cases.  I am using initials to preserve the anonymity of the parties concerned, and I am grateful to a social worker working in adoption for providing me with these cases.  I make no apology for putting them on the record of the House.  Unless we have specific examples of what goes wrong in our adoption code, we do not know where the real need for reform is, and since we do not have any overall governmental research we must rely on the case histories, and also on a private survey which was made, and from which I intend to quote later.</P>
    <P>In 1971 Mrs. W was very upset by the attitude of an adoption worker, when the child she hoped to adopt needed to be hospitalised during the statutory probationary period.  The child was with the adoptive parents during the probational period when it became ill and needed hospital attention.  Mrs. W telephoned the adoption society which had placed the child with her in order to inform them of the child's illness.  She was immediately told &ldquo;There is no need to worry about this, if the baby is not healthy, we will take it back and give you another&rdquo;.  Mrs. W was very upset at this attitude and was unable to discuss her feelings with the adoption worker and needed help. When the social worker contacted the adoption worker on Mrs. W's behalf in order to communicate to the worker the adoptive mother's feelings about the child's illness and her wish to adopt the child, she was again told &ldquo;There is no need to worry.  If the baby is not healthy we will take it back and give Mrs. W another&rdquo;.  This callous attitude was very traumatic for the adoptive <Col N="916" /> mother.  This is not the only example of such an incident as this social worker had another case this year in which precisely the same thing happened involving an adoption society and causing the same trauma and hurt to the adoptive mother.</P>
    <P>The next case illustrates that there is not always adequate selection of adoptive parents carried out by the particular adoption societies.  Mr. and Mrs. X attended as psychiatric outpatients with their only child aged three and a half years of age as they needed help in handling behaviour problems arising from conflict in the mother and child relationship.  These parents wished to have a larger family, and as no further children were born to them, they discussed the possibility with the social worker of adopting a child.  However, Mrs. X expressed serious concern about this because she was having a difficult relationship with her own child.  In spring 1969 Mr. and Mrs. X were out driving one afternoon and called to a registered adoption society in order to make general inquiries about adoption procedure.</P>
    <P>The person whom they met there talked with them for a short time and before they left told them that a baby would be placed with them.  Mrs. X was disturbed by the situation as she had not fully decided that she wished to adopt a baby.  A number of weeks later Mr. and Mrs. X were informed by the adoption society that a baby had been selected for them and awaited collection.  Mrs. X took the baby despite her reservations.  She did so because she feared that by refusing to do so they might deprive the baby of a home and jeopardise their own chance of adopting a child later on if they wished to do so. This family were known personally to the social worker who gave me the case history in a professional capacity and freely discussed the situation step by step as it took place.  Again, this showed an inadequate approach to this complex and delicate problem of adoption.</P>
    <P>Another case study illustrates that registered adoption societies do not always show an awareness of basic child psychology when placing older children for adoption.  Mr. and Mrs. Y sought <Col N="917" /> professional help with their eight year old adopted child's behaviour problems. They described the circumstances of the adoption: They had no natural children. They adopted their first child as an infant from a registered adoption society.  It was some years before they were in a position to adopt another child and when they applied to do so, it was suggested that they would adopt an older child so that that child would be close in age to the first child adopted. When, in 1967, Mr. and Mrs. Y were informed that a child had been selected for them, they went to the adoption society and met, for the first time, the three and a half year old child whom they took to live with them.</P>
    <P>The child's behaviour, as described by the adoptive parents, seemed very disturbed.  The adoptive parents do not recall any discussion with the adoption worker of the difficulties involved in adopting older and institutionalised children.  The parents did not have any supervisory visits from the adoption society before the adoption order was made, and they had only one statutory visit from the Adoption Board.  This was a totally inadequate approach to the extremely difficult problem of an older child who has already spent a considerable amount of time in an institution being adopted by parents who had no preparation for this, no awareness of the child's psychology and of the problems involved and where there has been no back-up help and support by the adoption society concerned.</P>
    <P>Another case history, which should make us in this House very concerned at the manner in which adoption is working in this country, is that of parents who had three children who died shortly after birth from congenital deformities.  A social worker was in touch with the family frequently during the third baby's lifetime&mdash;the child died at the age of five months.  The mother had many problems in caring for the child and there was the physical problem of overcrowding in the home and the presence of a difficult and alcoholic grandparent.</P>
    <P>The mother had taken the child home from hospital for a time before it died but she was herself very depressed and <Col N="918" /> the child was very ill all the time. Following this baby's death the social worker kept in occasional touch with the mother and the mother had mentioned that she would like to adopt a baby.  However the social worker concerned was very distressed to find that less than five months after the baby's death the mother was given a baby through an adoption agency.  The social worker felt that from every point of view the mother was not a fit person to undertake the adoption of a child.  She was still upset and depressed.  The conditions of the home were not at all satisfactory from a physical point of view and also the grandparent was still there, ill from a terminal condition as well as being an alcoholic.</P>
    <P>This is a concrete example of what happens when there is a complete lack of proper pre-placement supervision. It is a factual situation which can arise, and which is not catered for under this Bill, because of the absence of a proper system of creating and maintaining standards and of controlling and monitoring our adoption code.</P>
    <P>The next case history to which I should like to refer is well-known to many of us.  It reached the news media for the saddest reason some time ago. Nevertheless, I wish to put it on the record of this House while we are discussing adoption.  It may be a long time before we get another opportunity to reform our adoption code.</P>
    <P>This is the case of a husband and wife who wished to adopt.  They approached an adoption society in October, 1968. At first it was doubtful whether they could get a child to adopt, but when they went back a month later, in December, 1968, they were told they would probably be given a child to adopt.  In January, 1969, a social worker from the adoption society concerned phoned them and said they had been accepted as prospective adopters and asked them if they would consider adopting triplets. They were somewhat doubtful about this, but when they went along to the adoption society in January they fell in love with the triplets and decided they would adopt them.</P>
    <P>They brought the children home when they were ten weeks old.  They were given at that time a very firm assurance <Col N="919" /> that the mother would sign the adoption papers.  In April, 1969, they had a visit from the social worker who left the adoption papers with them but told them not to fill them in until the babies were six months old.  They were given a further assurance that the mother's consent would be forthcoming. In May they signed the papers and waited for news.  After two weeks they commenced a series of telephone calls to the society.  The society said they had lost contact with the mother and that the adoptive parents must be patient. In January, 1970&mdash;when the children had been with them for almost a year&mdash; they continued to ask why the mother had not signed, what were happening, what the adoption society was doing and so on and they were told that the mother wanted the children back.  They were deeply shocked and upset at this news and were left very much on their own to worry about what would happen to the three babies.</P>
    <P>I now quote from the case history as written by the adoptive mother:</P>
    <P>Over the next 18 months we never quite knew what was happening. We had very little news from the society and contact only seemed to be made by them after we had become particularly firm in our request for a decision.  A particular nun had been to England twice to see the mother&mdash; the natural mother&mdash;who by this time was married and had two more children.  She said she wanted them back but never did anything positive about it.  We wrote to His Grace and visited Monsignor Barrett who both said we had no claim and could not do anything about it.</P>
    <P>August 24th, 1971: 18 months later we had a letter from the person involved saying the mother wanted the children back and was coming to Dublin to get them.</P>
    <P>The mother in fact claimed the children and the adoptive parents were asked to take the children to the adoption society so that the mother could see them.  They were given the following assurances:</P>
    <P>She only wanted to see them and we could bring them home again.  She <Col N="920" /> was capable of looking after three more children.  She was in a very sound financial position and could afford domestic and necessary help to enable her to cope with five children under three years of age.  She would see a psychiatrist and discuss the problem of uprooting three two-and-a-half year olds from all they had ever loved and known.  She would have a few days' rehabilitation in the convent to enable her to get to know the children and, more important, for them to learn to trust her.</P>
    <P>I continue with the report written by the adoptive mother:</P>
    <P>August 24th, 1971: We took our little ones to the convent.  We had to leave them with a social worker and were taken to a room where I could hear the screams of my babies.</P>
    <P>Her husband was taken out and she was allowed to see the natural mother but the natural mother would not listen to her.</P>
    <P>Broken-hearted we returned to our home.  Our family was shattered and the other children were also desolate.</P>
    <P>On the next day, August 25th, we went to Dublin to discuss any possibilities of having the children returned to us.</P>
    <P>They agreed to the £5,000 bond.  They phoned the adoption society but there was no way of getting the children back. In September, 1971, they were phoned by a priest who broke the news:</P>
    <P>One of our babies had died and the other two were very badly beaten up and desperately ill.  Because the mother had reverted to her original name we did not know which of the children had died.  On September 22nd we flew to England.  On arrival in England we were driven to the inquest of the little girl who had died and identified her.  We went to the hospital and found the other children lying in bed.  One of them had an arm in plaster, broken nose, black eyes, sores, burns and appalling malnutrition; a pathetic wee scrap.</P>
    <P>Then we saw Elizabeth bruised, beaten and emotionless.  Only then did we know which of the children had died.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> Eventually, they managed to bring the children back to their home.  As from then they had problems.</P>
    <P>Louise was hysterical and Elizabeth was shocked.  They were heavily sedated night and day for many weeks.  They cried out loud all the horror they had seen and endured. They cried for their little sister and they looked for her everywhere.</P>
    <P>In spring 1972 we commenced our weekly visits to Dr. McQuaid.  Now, 12 months after the tragedy, Louise and Elizabeth are much improved but still far from their normal selves.</P>
    <P>At the end of this statement there is a little note:</P>
    <P>Now it is June, 1974, and the 1974 Adoption Bill is being heard in the Dáil and this particular point of ours has not even been mentioned.  We hope that in the Seanad there will be more interest and sympathy for adoption reform.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to another case on the same theme&mdash;illustrating the great difficulty in obtaining consent&mdash; and to discuss whether this problem is adequately dealt with in the Bill before us.  In this case a child was placed with her adopters at the age of six weeks after the mother had assured everyone that this was what she wanted.  She wrote a number of letters to the social worker involved saying that she would consent to the adoption.  However, she refused to do so and demanded the child back.  The home to which she demanded the child back was under the supervision of the ISPCC officer.  There were 13 children in the house including another illegitimate incestuous child whose father was the father of the family.  He was, in fact, in jail for two years having been convicted of that crime.  The natural mother of the child had been reared in an orphanage herself and worked away from home.  She did not intend staying at the home but left her child there and disappeared.  Once again, despite all the efforts of those involved, there was no way of getting the child away from those conditions and no way of getting the consent when the consent was not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The final case history I want to give is <Col N="922" /> one which happily can no longer arise because of the recent High Court decision in another case, which found that the provisions of section 12 were unconstitutional, both in relation to the impossibility of a child being adopted unless the child is of the same religion as the adoptive parents and also in allowing any forcing of religious consequences, a finding of importance in the judgment of Mr. Justice Pringle, so that this example would now be clearly regarded as unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>This case history does not involve adoption between parents of different religions, but is one where the adoptive parents were of the same religion.  The natural mother was Church of Ireland. She had a child and subsequently married another man, who was also Church of Ireland but was not the putative father of the child, so that here the adoptive parents were of the same religion.  However, the adoptive mother had not baptised the child because she was not religious.  She did not wish to baptise her child and she wished to leave it to the child if the child subsequently wished to become a member of any church.  In November, 1970, they went along to the Adoption Board having filled in the various papers.  The child in question was old enough to be very excited about the idea of being adopted.  She was seven or eight years old, and was all dressed up for the occasion.</P>
    <P>However, the Adoption Board refused under any circumstances to make an adoption order unless the child was baptised.  There were 45 minutes of very distressed and distressing argument and protest and pleading by the parents to allow the adoption order to be proceeded with despite the fact that the child had not been baptised.  Eventually the Adoption Board agreed to make the adoption order if there was an oath by the parents concerned that they would baptise the child at the first available opportunity.  This is one case where I have spoken to the husband concerned and he said: &ldquo;We had to balance our own conscience and the effect on the child&rdquo;.  Because of the feelings of the child at that time&mdash;it would have been so traumatic for that child, who was excited about the idea, to <Col N="923" /> have been refused an adoption order&mdash; they took the oath and subsequently baptised the child.</P>
    <P>We must be aware in examining the adoption laws we have drawn up, that these are not isolated examples.  These are the case histories of one social worker and of one other contact who also works in an adoption society.  I am afraid that they are the regular type of problem that arises rather than the exception.</P>
    <P>If case histories cannot take away some of our complacency then perhaps we can refer to the report on adoption in Ireland prepared by Miss Vivienne Darling in the Social Studies Department in Trinity College.  I understand that this report will be published by CARE and will be available soon.  It is a very valuable report indeed.  It is admitted that the scope of the study was a fairly narrow one&mdash;with its focus on how adoption works essentially.  It illustrates the very different pattern around the country: the different standards and, on the whole, the inadequacies of the overall administration and procedure in adoption in this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote one or two brief extracts from this report, particularly at page 24, dealing with pre-placement procedure and office interviews. The report refers to the <i>Guide to Adoption Practice</i>, the guide issued for adoptions in England and says:</P>
    <P>In the Guide to Adoption Practice it is recommended that adoption workers should have several interviews by appointment and that these assessment interviews need skill, patience and persistence.  The interviews should include at least one joint interview and a separate interview with both husband and wife. One of these could be combined with the home study.  In the course of my investigations I discovered that 25.9% of the adopters in my survey claimed to have had no office interviews before placement but this proportion varied from 19.6% in Dublin to 30% in the country.  This variation is understandable as some of the rural societies only interview in applicants' homes because of the distances involved <Col N="924" /> and the difficulties in travelling. As 82.5% of the adopters in my sample survey had used an adoption society and 7% a local authority and only 6.3% and 0.7% were third party or private placements, it would appear that not all applicants are interviewed in the societies' offices.</P>
    <P>It goes on as follows:</P>
    <P>It emerged that 48.3% of couples had one office interview only, while 12.6% had two interviews and 10.5% three interviews.  Only 35% of the couples interviewed were seen both separately and together.</P>
    <P>Throughout this report, particularly in relation to the pre-placement visits to the home mentioned on page 26, it was disturbing to note how the practice varied dramatically around the country, and especially between Dublin, Cork and rural areas.  This is hard to understand in the light of the claim made by all adoption societies that at least one, and possibly two visits, are made in each case.</P>
    <P>I could take up more time, except that it would be unfair to others who are listening and who want to contribute, in showing that this report is an indictment of standards in our adoption services.  I hope that when it is published we will have a more realistic awareness of the many problems involved. I shall refer back to the report on Committee Stage in moving amendments to this Bill.</P>
    <P>To summarise the points made so far, the first is: why have we not accepted the recommendations of the Kennedy and Devlin Reports to change the whole control of adoption from the Department of Justice to the Department of Health, and with that to have a better emphasis on the child care aspect of it? Secondly, in the light of the sort of evidence that I have been trying to give, can we be as complacent as was suggested?  The third point that I want to discuss is the question of the category of children who are eligible to be adopted.</P>
    <P>I should like to introduce an amendment to broaden the category of children to include abandoned children or children neglected and illtreated by their parents who are not fit to have <Col N="925" /> the custody and control of such children, in cases where the parents were married and the children were born during marriage.  The first prelude to this would have to be a section&mdash; which again I would hope to introduce as an amendment&mdash;that the welfare of the child in all adoption procedure is paramount.  I believe that this ought to be stated, showing where our emphasis is and allowing the courts&mdash;as they do in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964&mdash;to interpret constructively a statement in the Bill itself to this effect.</P>
    <P>In his Second Reading speech and in Limerick, the Minister said he has been advised that to broaden the category to include abandoned or neglected children of a married family would be unconstitutional.  I would submit that no judgment of the High Court or Supreme Court has ever made a finding on this exact point, nor do the existing cases allow for an obvious inference that this is the case.  There are clauses in the Constitution pointing indeed the other way, and in a moment I shall attempt to elaborate on this a little.</P>
    <P>If that be the case, if there is at least a doubt about the matter&mdash;if not, as in my submission, a very strong case for extending the category of children who may be adopted in quite a constitutional manner&mdash;I believe there is an onus on us as legislators to draft the appropriate section and to include it in this Bill and, if necessary, to have the Bill itself referred to the Supreme Court by the President under Article 26.  If there was some doubt, surely the proper course is to take the necessary legal steps to extend the category of children who may be adopted to include abandoned and neglected children and to clarify the constitutional issue by referring the section of the Bill to the Supreme Court under Article 26, for determination as to its constitutionality.</P>
    <P>It is argued that the difficulty arises from the wording of Article 41 of the Constitution.  I will not deal with this point at great length now.  To begin with, I anticipate that another Senator will deal with it&mdash;though perhaps not in the same way&mdash;and in any case it would be more appropriate to argue the point at length on Committee Stage in the light of the amendment proposed.  Very <Col N="926" /> briefly, Article 41 deals with the family and section 1 provides as follows:</P>
    <P>The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit of the society and as the moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
    <P>Nothing in that section lays it down in an authoritative way that parents have, for all time and in an absolute manner the right to custody and possession of their children of which they can never be deprived.  Nothing there says that if a mother and father, reject the child from the moment of its birth, put it in an institution and never want to see it again, that they nevertheless have inalienable and imprescriptible rights. The truth is that the courts have never interpreted this section in its direct sense and have never set out what are these &ldquo;inalienable and imprescriptible rights&rdquo;.  I would suggest that subsection 20 of the Constitution:</P>
    <P>The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority...</P>
    <P>is a guarantee against legislation either abolishing or interfering with the family.  It is not any authority for what it is being put forward as authority for. It is being put forward as authority to say that in some strange way, which is out of line with a great deal of legislation in other countries, there is a natural right in parents&mdash;no matter what they do to their children&mdash;to the custody and control over those children and that no laws we draft can prevent that.  I cannot accept that.  Senator Ryan has referred to the Nicolaou case.  I have read with great care the judgment in that case and I do not believe that there is provided any authority for this point.  Rather than dwell on the point here, I shall come back to the argument when moving an amendment.</P>
    <P>I reject emphatically&mdash;and it is a part of this whole question of how the <Col N="927" /> family provisions in the Constitution are being interpreted&mdash;any possible line of development which would tend to suggest that the single mother and her child are not a &ldquo;family&rdquo; under the Constitution.  This would be very bad and would be a most cruel and perverse way in which to develop our family law.  It is the family based on marriage which is referred to in subsection 3º of Article 41:</P>
    <P>The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack,</P>
    <P>and then:</P>
    <P>No law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage.</P>
    <P>But that section must be confined precisely to what it says, which is:</P>
    <P>The State pledges itself to guard... the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded...</P>
    <P>It does not say that it is only when you have a family based on marriage that you have a family.  We must not fall into the trap of drawing a conclusion when no such conclusion ought to be drawn.  The common law has never confined the family to a family based on marriage.  We would not just be a cold, callous society but a blind one in this modern day and age if we were to say that our reading of these phrases is that the family is confined so far as the Constitution, and constitutional rights are concerned to the family based on marriage.  I will return in more detail to these arguments when drafting an amendment to broaden the category of children.</P>
    <P>We hear too often that there are more adoptive parents wanting to adopt children than there are children to be adopted.  We forget that the reason for that is because the category of children is so narrow.  There are many children who lead an institutionalised life in this country or at best are involved in a system of fosterage which may or may not be successful and in which they do not have the full legal rights which they <Col N="928" /> ought to have.  When we have broadened the category to comply with social justice then there will be many more children who will be suitable for adoption and able to avail of the hopes which adoptive parents would provide for them.</P>
    <P>The overriding constitutional consideration in that context is the guarantee in Article 40, section 1:</P>
    <P>that all citizens shall as human persons be held equal before the law.</P>
    <P>The citizens who have been abandoned and rejected by their parents and who have been put in institutions or in fosterage on a temporary basis are not being treated equally as human persons before the law, because we are not allowing them to avail of adoption into a substitute family thereby giving them what they are being denied by their natural parents.</P>
    <P>In looking at this question of the child to be adopted we must consider in much more detail the relationship between the single mother and the child. That is very much a family relationship. The child who is loved and desired by the single mother is a lucky child.  It will have love and affection and will be brought up, probably against the odds in this country, in an environment of love and affection.  I should like to pay tribute to the members of &ldquo;Cherish&rdquo;, the organisation formed by single mothers in their concern to help one another, for the way in which they have argued their case, often against the odds and without much public sympathy.  I should like to encourage them in what they do and to support their line of argument.  They are not given a real choice in economic and social terms. They say that they are willing to see reform in the adoption consent procedure provided society will give them a real choice: a choice either to keep the child and bring it up with the love and opportunities which they want to give it or, alternatively, to place the child in adoption in order to give it the advantage of a better life in that way.</P>
    <P>Looking at the problem from this overall context, I should like to refer briefly to the question of the figures for illegitimate births and the number of children who are kept by their natural mother.  These particular statistics are <Col N="929" /> slightly out-of-date.  There is now a much stronger move by single mothers, helped by the provisions of the Social Welfare Act, 1972, to retain their children.  I wish to quote from an article in <i>This Week</i> of 12th February, 1971:</P>
    <P>In 1970, there were some 1,800 illegitimate births registered in Ireland.  That represents close to 3 per cent of all live births.  Some 400 of these girls entered Dublin's National Maternity Hospital at Holles Street to have their children.  These were the girls who did not choose to enter homes and had kept the fact of their pregnancy a secret until the last moment.  During 1970, some 400 girls gave birth in Holles Street.  Of this number some 42 per cent were under the age 20 and 24 per cent under 18. Of the general hospital population of married mothers, only five per cent were under 18.  One in six of all births in the hospital to mothers under the age of 20 were to unmarried mothers. Girls who entered the hospital were in general simple but poorly educated girls, 70 per cent of them were in domestic service of one sort or another.  The most serious factor concerning the 400 girls treated in the National Maternity Hospital was that 20 per cent did not receive any medical care until labour pains had begun.  Presumably, many of them were not even sure they were pregnant. Some 50 per cent received no ante-natal care until the last four weeks of pregnancy.  Less than 17 per cent received any care before they were five months pregnant.</P>
    <P>The same report in <i>This Week</i> goes on to point out that:</P>
    <P>In 1969, a total of 1,638 illegitimate births were registered in the State. The adoption rate at almost 90 per cent of these represents as near as nothing the maximum possible adoption level.</P>
    <P>Later on there is reference to the position in Scandinavia.  Let us look at the position of the single mother in some of the Scandinavian countries with their advanced welfare state systems: &ldquo;In Denmark some 93 per cent <Col N="930" /> of unmarried mothers keep their babies.&rdquo;  In 1969 90 per cent of Irish unmarried mothers gave them up, while 93 per cent of Danish unmarried mothers kept their children.  That is an extraordinary reflection on the way in which the system can determine social conduct.  What can be more crucial than the decision by a single mother whether to put the child in adoption or not?  I cannot believe that you can explain that by saying that in Scandinavian countries, where there is more advice on family planning, the child is likely to be a wanted one. This is true to some extent, but it cannot explain the extraordinary variation in the graph that in 1969 in this country over 90 per cent of single mothers put their children in adoption and in Denmark in the equivalent year over 93 per cent kept the children. The report goes on to say that</P>
    <P>In Denmark the single mother must identify the father and then legal efforts are made to ensure that the person named is the father and that he accepts his responsibilities to the child.</P>
    <P>A good deal more of this information is more relevant to the Illegitimate Children (Maintenance and Succession) Bill, which I still hope may be moved before the end of this session.  Despite what was said by the Leader of the House when this was mentioned on the Order of Business, I should argue very strongly for having that Bill taken before the Recess.  It is very difficult to see how we can convince ourselves that we are reforming the adoption code unless we also reform very dramatically the position of the so-called illegitimate child.  I regret that we must use a word like illegitimate, because it has a pejorative sense; but, forgetting any such meaning, it is essential that we redress the existing balance of society against the single mother and her child.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we give her the legal machinery and protection by improving the affiliation proceedings.  It is essential that we give the child concerned equality before the law as a human person and as an Irish citizen which at the present moment that child is denied.  It is essential that the illegitimate child have the same property <Col N="931" /> rights, inheritance rights and rights of identity, as any other child.  It is essential to know who the father is and to have a relationship with the natural father in the circumstances.  It is high time that our society got rid of any stigma or any reproach against the single mother with her child.  It is time we had a much greater willingness to explore the ways in which the community, where the single mother wants to bring up her child, can make it easier for her to do it.  It is only when there is this balanced relationship that we can talk about having an adoption code which has any regard for the principles of social justice.</P>
    <P>I made the point that I propose to broaden the category of the children to be adopted.  Also, no discussion of adoption can be a balanced one unless there is either firm Government intent to accept the Illegitimate Children (Maintenance and Succession) Bill or to bring in a Government Bill in order to improve the situation of the single mother who wishes to keep her child and improve the status and rights of that child.</P>
    <P>I now wish to look at another matter. That is the question of the role of the Adoption Board in controlling adoption societies.  I am very disappointed that the Minister has expressed a view that the Adoption Board do not &ldquo;want&rdquo; to have the power to make regulations governing adoption societies and that he is content that they are right and that there is no need for such power.  I believe that there is a very strong need for the statutory authority to make regulations which would be binding on all adoption societies.  I propose to introduce an amendment to that effect.</P>
    <P>Anybody reading Miss Darling's Report could have no doubt of the need for regulations imposing standards on adoption societies.  The Minister has expressed the view that it is not possible, through legislation and regulation, to impose standards.  At least one can create standards.  Then, by a proper system of supervision and, if necessary, of de-registering adoption societies, one can go a long way to imposing standards. Reading the cold print of Miss Darling's Report, nobody with concern for adoption procedure could deny the <Col N="932" /> need for improving these standards.  I would ask the Minister why he made no reference to the fact that&mdash;not in his time, admittedly, but in the comparatively recent past&mdash;three members of the Adoption Board resigned on this issue.  They resigned, among other reasons, because the Minister for Justice of that time would not bring in legislation giving the Adoption Board the statutory power to make regulations.</P>
    <P>It is worth examining what happens in other jurisdictions.  In this context I wish to make reference to another jurisdiction about which we talk at great length in another context, namely, Northern Ireland.  It is always interesting to see the many areas in which we can learn from the legislation, particularly in the family law area, which exists in Northern Ireland.  Also, Northern Ireland has the latest Adoption Act of these islands, the Adoption Act (Northern Ireland) 1967.  Section 32 of that Act provides:</P>
    <P>The Ministry may make regulations&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  for regulating the conduct of negotiations entered into by or on behalf of registered adoption societies with persons having the care and possession of infants who are desirous of causing the infants to be adopted, and in particular, for securing&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  that, where the parent or guardian of an infant proposes to place the infant at the disposition of the society with a view to the infant being adopted, he shall be furnished with a memorandum in the prescribed form explaining, in ordinary language, the effect, in relation to his rights as a parent or guardian, of the making of an adoption order in respect of the infant, and calling attention to the provisions of this Act, or of any rules made thereunder, relating to the consent of a parent or guardian to the making of such an order, and to the provisions of this Act relating to the sending or taking of infants abroad; and</P>
    <P>(ii)  that, before so placing the child at the disposition of the society, the parent or guardian shall sign a document in the prescribed form certifying that he <Col N="933" /> has read and understood the said memorandum.</P>
    <P>It goes on:</P>
    <P>(b)  for requiring that the case of every infant proposed to be delivered by or on behalf of a registered adoption society into the care and possession of an adopter shall be considered by a committee (to be called a &ldquo;case committee&rdquo;) appointed by the society for the purpose, and consisting of not less than three persons;</P>
    <P>Some adoption societies have case committees in this part of the country. Many other do not.  Here there is a statutory requirement for case committees</P>
    <P>(c)  for prescribing, in respect of every such infant as aforesaid, the inquiries which must be made and the reports which must be obtained by the society in relation to the infant and the adopter for the purpose of ensuring, so far as may be, the suitability of the infant and the adopter respectively, and, in particular, for requiring that a report on the health of the infant signed by a fully registered medical practitioner must be obtained by the society...</P>
    <P>I will not continue reading the relevant provisions of the Northern Ireland Act. I only want to refer to it as a jurisdiction where it is thought necessary and desirable to have statutory authority to make regulations.  These statutory regulations were made as the Adoption Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1969. They are very detailed and comprehensive and undoubtedly create standards. By doing so they ensure that it is more likely that these standards will, in fact, be maintained.  Despite the Minister's indication that he is satisfied that the Adoption Board do not wish to have statutory power to make regulations, I feel that is a very narrow base from which to conclude it is unnecessary to give the Adoption Board the statutory power.  Those involved, particularly the adoptive parents and social workers, feel the need exists for statutory regulations. If there is a need&mdash;and the case histories which I have just put on the record and conclusions of Miss Darling's <Col N="934" /> Report emphasise it&mdash;then it is up to us as legislators to insert in the Bill the statutory power to make regulations.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I want to mention is the consent of the mother.  It may come up again on Committee Stage.  This Bill proposes that the mother can consent after six weeks.  An organisation like &ldquo;Cherish&rdquo; and those who are concerned about the imbalance at present in our adoption procedure will say that we cannot in conscience put in a cut-off limit of six weeks&mdash; which for so many reasons is desirable&mdash; unless we improve the position of the single mother; unless we give her the sort of help and support, leading to the real choice in economic and social terms which she ought to have.</P>
    <P>I am greatly in favour of the provision which allows an application for custody to be made to the High Court. In the light of that application an adoption order can then be made without consent.  But once again, who would be objecting to that application being made to the High Court?  In very many circumstances it would be the single mother.  As the law at present stands, what position is she in to dispute custody in the High Court?  What does she know about it?  Where is she going to get the advice about it?  How is she going to be able to pay for legal advice about it?  In this respect the intended provision of the law is in social terms a very inadequate one.  For it to be realistic, there would have to be a guarantee of adequate and free legal advice in the matter.  There must be the possibility of hearing in camera, a provision which the Minister, himself, mentioned in his Second Reading speech.</P>
    <P>I should like to support the Senators who raised the problem of the nationality of the adopted child.  I have been approached on several occasions by Irish citizens who adopted a child in England, or indeed it could have been any other country.  When the adopted child who had lived for most of his life in this country applied for a passport he was told he was not an Irish citizen and was requested to take out naturalisation in order to become an Irish citizen. It is a very shattering experience for one who has already come to terms <Col N="935" /> with the idea of being adopted, who has Irish parents and has lived all his life in this country, to get a letter from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the effect that he is not an Irish citizen.  I believe it would be possible, if we amend the relevant part of the 1952 Act, which talks about the legal rights of the adopted child to remove this anomaly.  We ought to extend the existing section so that it would apply to the case where the parents are Irish and adopt outside the country.  I am confident the appropriate section can be extended to cover that.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I want to touch on briefly is the question of the role of the local authority in adoption. I think the local authority should be brought in under any provisions for making regulations and creating standards. Section 39 of the Adoption Act, 1952, should also be extended to cover local authorities.</P>
    <P>Above all, provision should be made for the situation where the Adoption Board had decided not to complete the adoption order.  In other words there is a problem where the adoption order is not finalised, although the child has been for some time during a probationary period with the adoptive parents. At present there is no machinery for getting that child out of that situation. The inference to be drawn from the fact that the adoption order is not finalised is that they are not suitable adoptive parents.  However, in many circumstances, the child just stays there.  No final adoption order is made, and the child is at risk in a family environment which is considered unsuitable for processing an adoption order.  At present the board have no function in this sort of circumstance.  I believe that it should have a function of ensuring that the child is removed from the adoptive home which was not found to be suitable and where a final order would not be given.  It should have power to ensure that the child either be returned to the adoption society or, in cases where it is relevant, to the care and custody of the local authority.</P>
    <P>I should like to support Senators Horgan and Ryan on the question of giving a statutory right to the natural father.  I believe that once again it <Col N="936" /> would be a most retrograde step to continue to deny in our legislation the right of a natural father in these circumstances.  I should like also to include widowers in the category of potential adopters.  I note that widows are already included.  I think widowers should also have the possibility of adopting.  They should not be excluded from even being considered, as they are at the moment.</P>
    <P>A final point which I should like to raise and which has been mentioned many times by those concerned with adoption is the question of why it is necessary to have a different birth certificate for the adopted child.  Can we go as far as other jurisdictions have gone, particularly America, to remove any difference between the adopted child and the natural child of parents, so that the long certificate does not give rise to hardship later on when the child has to produce such long certificate and therefore admit to being adopted and even risk being discriminated against on that ground?</P>
    <P>I notice that in Northern Ireland the Hague Convention on Adoption of 1965 was ratified by legislation in 1969.  I should like to ask the Minister whether it is intended that we would also adhere to this convention?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility of the adoption of children is a splendid new feature of modern social legislation in securing as fully as possible the admission of a child into that enterprise of charity known as the family and securing for him as fully as can be secured the benefits, the encouragement and love that are there to be experienced. We were not early in the day in the introduction of that legislation.  It came a quarter of a century later than its introduction in the United Kingdom. There have been criticisms of the legislation and its operation and there has been praise of it, too.  In particular a feature which has received praise is the benefit of the centralised administration made possible under our code which is absent from that of Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite unable to make an assessment of the sort of matters to which, at a certain point of her contribution, Senator Robinson referred.  I simply limit myself to noting that the <Col N="937" /> Adoption Law Reform Society on the whole praised the operation of adoption legislation in the formal report and memorandum it submitted to the Minister.  I wish also to note that it expressed criticism in its recommendations.</P>
    <P>The first two of its main recommendations have been received by the Government and are reflected in this legislation.  These are the sections removing the provisions relative to the religion of the parents and the religion of all the parties involved, which of course featured in the Act of 1952 and has been since retained&mdash;understandably featured in that Act having regard to our history.  That particular affair led to a great deal of injustice to which attention was drawn.  The Bill removes the ground for that type of injustice. It also deals with another matter for complaint&mdash;the provisions relative to the lower and upper age limits for adoption.</P>
    <P>I should like to just say these words of welcome for these provisions because I intend today to direct my remarks to an area where there is a weakness in the legislation.  It is an area to which Senator Robinson has referred, a weakness which&mdash;I think it is common case&mdash;exists and which arises from the fact that under our code only illegitimate children and orphans and, in certain circumstances, legitimated children can be adopted.  The benefits of adoption, the full admission to a family and all the rights attendant on that, are not being extended to all the other children&mdash;and we have no estimate as to how many there may be&mdash; who might benefit from adoption but who are in the position that one or both of their parents live, and who by this apparently happy circumstance are deprived of the benefits of the social legislation of the Legislature.</P>
    <P>It seems to be common case that this is a weakness.  It is argued on behalf of the Government by the Minister that the weakness is one which cannot be removed.  It cannot be removed because of the provisions of the basic document governing our affairs.  We cannot here extend to children whom we can assume are in need the benefits of the legislation <Col N="938" /> which can be extended in other countries because we have here a document preserving the fundamental rights of Irish citizens.  As a result of this view children who are abandoned by their parents, grossly neglected by them, or who are in circumstances where one or other or both of the parents cannot financially or because of psychological reasons provide a happy stable environment for them&mdash; these children are so positioned that they are denied a possibility of experiencing and enjoying the normal home and upbringing and enjoying financial, social and psychological security.</P>
    <P>If there are these children in need, the evidence is that there are, side by side with these children, people who seek in all the ways of their daily lives to obey the maxims of their Lord, who seek to assuage the need of these people, who themselves have a compensating and correlative need for the company of these children.  Is it to be the position of this Legislature when we find in our laws&mdash;even if it be in our basic document&mdash;an obstacle to love, that we are to stand idly by and do nothing about it, that we are not to challenge in any way the provision which it is thought may exist creating this obstacle? It seems to me a very heavy burden to impose for a principle, a very heavy burden to impose for a doctrine.</P>
    <P>To raise immediately the question of the truth or the falsehood of the principle, to raise questions about the obliging nature of the doctrine, I do not think my own position would be other than this, that if our Constitution so provides, our Constitution should be changed.  But what I say today I hope will prove to be a little more helpful than that.  Should we not first challenge by the legislation we enact in these places what may be a wrong and narrow interpretation of the Constitution which, in the name of personal and fundamental rights, deprives many children perhaps of their rights to life and happiness&mdash;as these words can be profoundly understood&mdash;which in the name of the sanctity of the family refuses entrance to that reputedly happy circle to many who will suffer for the rest of their lives by that refusal and make others suffer too?  We do not do <Col N="939" /> our duty here if we do not legislate to meet the needs, as we see them, of our society.  And if we do enact legislation declaring an observed need such as this with, if necessary, the unmistakable language of a preamble which describes it and contains a scheme for its removal, is the fact of our enactment of such legislation not relevant to, in the interpretation of what are the rights of our citizens, if we here legislate for the good, the common good?</P>
    <P>We are dealing with human beings, and the judges of the Supreme Court are human beings too and must take account of the decisions made here.  If we recognise in particular circumstances the right to the benefit of adoption, of all its security and potential for good, as one of the inalienable and imprescriptible rights of the child, his right in justice to have his welfare regarded as paramount by this Legislature and our courts, is this piece of legislation not legislation which the judges themselves would have to take account of?</P>
    <P>I venture to suggest that the narrow view of what these Articles 41 and 42, which speak of the inalienable and imprescriptible rights of the family and of the child, mean is not necessarily correct nor do I believe it necessarily follows that the Irish people sought, when they enacted the Constitution, to provide that all the children of the nation are not to be cherished equally.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court has not so pronounced.  It has not held that these words &ldquo;inalienable and inprescriptible rights&rdquo; are not capable of another wider, stauncher and more useful meaning in particular, in the context in which these words occur.  I think it is possible to argue in relation to this, first&mdash;I ask the House to be patient with me as I set these points out one by one&mdash;that the Supreme Court must apply, if our liberties are to be preserved, the undoubted truth that the Irish people have no right to do wrong, that they did not seek to do wrong and that the Constitution must be so interpreted that they are not seen to have done wrong.</P>
    <P>Secondly, as the Supreme Court has ruled that, while it was extremely slow to depart from its own previous decisions on constitutional cases, it may do so.  The whole range of judicial decisions <Col N="940" /> at Common Law and equity, which stretch back very far, with regard to the family and welfare of children need to be judicially reviewed in the light of this new social institution of legal adoption, which was not there when these principles were applied to all the different sets of facts that came before these judges but in entirely different circumstances to those existing in 1974.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, it is not to be assumed that there is a necessary clash between the Common Law and the constitutional provision for the protection of fundamental rights.  The Constitution, it has been held by Judge John Kenny, a very learned judge, in one of the most important decisions ever handed down, does not exhaust in its statements the number of personal freedoms it exists to protect.  The Common Law after all&mdash; and it is worth reminding ourselves of this&mdash;is only a body of law which established what were the common practices and customs and rules of Christian peoples.  In the ascertainment of what are these rights to be protected by the Constitution regard can properly be had to the provisions of the Common Law itself.  The Constitution should not displace or correct the Common Law but clarify its meaning and strengthen the protections that the citizen is in any case entitled to look to it for.</P>
    <P>The Constitution should be seen as a dynamo for human progress, an inspiration in a way in its statement of right principle, not be experienced by this House or the other House, not be experienced by the citizens in need as the Procrustean bed prohibiting improvement. Our laws must not be like the laws of the Medes and the Persians which change not.  They must be constantly renewed.  The Constitution itself contemplates a constant renewal, a constant readaptation to new economic and social institutions of which, incidentally, legal adoption is one.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, it is possible to argue that the Constitution is a notable and quite noble statement against the spirit of the age in which it was adopted.  I would remind you that it was adopted in 1937 when tyrants, with the support of multitudes, held sway all over our old <Col N="941" /> Europe.  It restated and challenged by its terms the old Stoic and Christian notion of the natural law according to which laws, positively enacted by tyrants however numerous&mdash;and the Plebs can be a tyrant too&mdash;and not binding in conscience as they seek to deprive man of essential liberties which, by natural reason, he can discover he must have and which he enjoys by virtue of a fundamental law, that law, antecedent and superior to all positive law.  The Constitution cannot be used to justify the deprival of the right to join a family&mdash;the natural, primary and fundamental unit group of society.  If it were so used&mdash;and the Supreme Court has not so held&mdash;it would become a positive law and stand rebuked by its own robust and wholly acceptable claims.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, the finding of Judge Kenny provides a further avenue of escape from the restrictions of the narrow view.  The Constitution contains no definition of what are the inalienable and imprescriptible rights, either of the family or of the child.  They both need interpretation and each must be construed in harmony with each other.  The rights of the family cannot be given a definition which deprives a child of his basic right in justice to have his welfare considered as paramount.</P>
    <P>Sixthly, these words appear in Articles which are set in the context of fundamental rights generally and the spirit and tone of the context in which they appear make it difficult to sustain a narrow interpretation, restrictive of rights, rather than enlarging their scope and increasing their reality.</P>
    <P>Seventhly, it is in the interpretation of ordinary documents usual, helpful and proper to construe words most strongly against him who uses them. This Legislature and the Government's law officer should contend that the rights here recognised, these inalienable imprescriptible rights, are rights which the family and the child have against the State, against all institutions, agencies and powers which lie outside the family and the child, which entitle the family not to be interfered with or obstructed in any way in its constitution or authority.  It can be contended, and I so contend, that a personal right which <Col N="942" /> may be alienated freely by its possessor is greater than one which cannot be.  If a right is sought to be exercised by free alienation&mdash;no one is arguing for a non&mdash;consensual deprivation or an alienation&mdash;if a right is sought to be exercised by alienation, and alienation is a mode of exercise of a right, under the constitution and authority of the family is it not an obstruction and interference with the family to prevent it, if it can be shown that this is the manner best open to the family to perform its duty to have regard to the welfare of the child?</P>
    <P>Eighthly, is it not a monstrous inversion of true values to cite the Constitution as an obstacle to this Legislature legislating as well for the welfare of children, one or both of whose parents are living, as for the welfare of illegitimate children and orphans?  The misery and the sin&mdash;call it what you wish&mdash; which lead to the birth of the one and the tragedy which leads to the bereavement of the other become then happy faults which exalt and elevate the hopes and prospects of the illegitimate and the orphan over the hopes and prospects of those excluded from these experiences, the legitimately-born who can only win their future happiness on this view if death deprives them of their parent or parents.  Natural law should not be so adumbrated as to lead to so unnatural a conclusion.</P>
    <P>Ninthly, it is true that there is legal difficulty as to what is a family.  Senator Robinson has referred to this.  There is the difficulty caused by the terms of Article 41.3.  One of the worst criticisms which we levelled against it&mdash;and there are many others more frequently voiced &mdash;the one relative to the dissolution of marriage, is that it purports or may purport to deprive natural children of the protection of natural law as if their rights at nature can be lessened by some lack of solemnity, some legal impediment to the union which led to their being.  Despite this difficulty as to what is a family caused by this language, I do not think that the Article can properly be used to justify the denial to the adoptive parents of the adoption of an altogether suitable child both of whose parents are not dead&mdash;a denial of their opportunity to complete their family where they are, <Col N="943" /> through some mishap, childless and the area of whose authority spoken of in the Constitution can only thus be naturally expanded.</P>
    <P>Tenthly, the Constitution recognises in the terms of Article 2.5 that the State may, in exceptional cases where the parents fail in their duty towards their children, endeavour to supply the place of parents.  If the State can do this for the lesser matter of the formal education of children, can it not permit dutiful parents to do the greater matter of securing for their own children a proper home.</P>
    <P>For these, among other reasons, legislation should be introduced forthwith and referred to the Supreme Court relative to the constitutionality of legislation extending to children other than orphans and illegitimates.  I understand why the Minister in his anxiety to bring these worthwhile improvements &mdash;I congratulate the Minister on introducing the legislation which contains them&mdash;does not wish to delay further their coming into effect while this Bill is being examined by the Supreme Court. Would he introduce a separate Bill dealing with this point or give a welcome to one if I introduced it and received the necessary support of the two Houses?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to refer to a few other matters so that I may if necessary deal with them in Committee. I resent and think it wrong that the category of persons who can adopt is so limited.  Under our law the Blessed Virgin before her marriage could not adopt.  It would be no surprise to anyone in the House to hear that Mary Magdalen could never have adopted and Jesus Christ Himself would not be acceptable under our code as an adoptive parent of any of our children.</P>
    <P>I share the criticisms which have been expressed with regard to the absence of a provision entitling the natural father to be heard.  The Nicolaou decision itself was one of the least tacit decisions of the Supreme Court.  That decision presumably would have been different if we had legislation entitling him as a right to be listened to.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy about the provisions of section 40 of the Principal Act.  I think I am correct in understanding that this <Col N="944" /> Bill does not contain any amendment&mdash;I am always afraid of assuming anything &mdash;of section 40, but its provisions will be well known to the Minister.  If somebody else has referred to this section, I shall not continue, but I heard no reference to it.  Subsection (1) provides as follows:</P>
    <P>No person shall remove out of the State a child under seven years of age who is an Irish citizen or cause or permit such a move.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) says:</P>
    <P>That subsection shall not apply to the removal of an illegitimate child under one year of age.</P>
    <P>It does if the child is over one year of age, so it is a bad moment when he moves to his second birthday.  It does not apply to such child removed by, or with the approval of, the mother or, if the mother is dead, of a relative, for the purpose of residing with the mother or a relative outside the State.  Neither does subsection (1) apply by virtue of the provisions of subsection (3) to removal of a child not being such a child&mdash;that is illegitimate and under one year&mdash; where it is by or with the approval of a parent, guardian or relative of the child.</P>
    <P>The effect of this is that an illegitimate child in the custody of its foster parents or prospective adoptive parents cannot leave the country.  If, for example, a foster father, having custody of the child, is offered employment abroad, he may have to make up his mind between refusing employment or abandoning the child.  Of course there is no doubt about what happens: he commits a crime and takes the child.  Should we have on our Statute Book the law creating such an unnecessary criminal offence if there is some other way of securing the elimination of the abuse or the dangers which the section desires to combat and prevent?</P>
    <P>What of the position of a child who needs medical attention that is not available here?  I do not know what may be the experience of other Senators in this matter, but I know of people who are alive and well today because they could go out of the country to get skills not available in the country.  Is this to <Col N="945" /> be the fate of such a child?  What about a nervous, timid, perhaps craven doctor who is afraid of what might be the consequences of co-operation in this situation?  I do not know how real these situations may be, but that they can exist is clear.  A child under one year may go to stay temporarily or permanently with a relation of his mother; he could not go after his first birthday.  Could he go at any age, if this is not the object of his visit?  I should like the Minister to give thought to the possibility of improving that particular section.</P>
    <P>Finally, I do not think anyone has expressed unhappiness about the provision&mdash;a new provision&mdash;in the present Bill which disallows private adoptions. I hope that the full implications of this have been measured.  I have been written to&mdash;perhaps others have received a like representation&mdash;by the Joint Committee of Women's Societies and Social Workers.  The Assistant Honorary Secretary signed that letter and I should like to quote from what she has written:</P>
    <P>... the Bill disallows third party&mdash; that is private&mdash;adoptions.  Natural mothers and adopters in the view of this Society&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I am presuming it is the society's views she is expressing&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;should be free to choose between the Society and private placement. The latter is often their doctor who knows more about the background of both parties than most of our adoption societies would.</P>
    <P>No research has yet been carried out, so it cannot be said that one has been more successful than the other, especially where our adoption societies are not governed by regulations.</P>
    <P>I shall end with that, with an invitation to the Minister to reconsider the section and express a view on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>After the songs of Apollo the words of Mars are harsh. Therefore after that, what only can be called noble speech by Senator Alexis FitzGerald, I propose to adopt a very low profile by being extremely brief <Col N="946" /> indeed.  But among the very admirable things in that speech, which is the kind of speech I think brings credit to this House&mdash;and I am sure others did, too&mdash; was the manner in which he dealt with natural law, a concept which has been so badly abused and eroded in recent years, and has been largely brought into disrespect by a very narrow and arid interpretation of the whole concept which has grown up in modern life.  He has humanly and charitably interpreted in terms of both constitution and the law.  The point I want to make is this. I think I am right, but the Minister will correct me if I am wrong.  We recall the old days when illegitimacy was stamped on the birth certificate.  We then had the introduction of the short certificate. But I am strongly of the view that it should not be mentioned at all on the birth certificate.  The only person who has the right to appeal is the child himself when he grows up.</P>
      <P>I should like that as far as possible&mdash; and I mentioned this in reference to the Maintenance Orders Bill&mdash;the words &ldquo;illegitimate child&rdquo; be removed from our vocabulary.  As I pointed out on that occasion, of the three parties involved in his coming into the world, the child is the one who is totally innocent and he is the only one who gets a pejorative label attached to him. That is only a small point, but a point in which our language often reflects our morality and our sensitivity.  Very often, perhaps as in the case of an English speaker, the use of language frequently corrupts and coarsens the quality of thought.  I do not know how far a word such as &ldquo;illegitimate child&rdquo;, which is so immersed in the whole web of law, could be withdrawn.  We should constantly be on our guard against genuflecting to such a concept.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill absolutely.  However, I recognise&mdash;as does the Minister, because one cannot wait forever&mdash;slight defects.  I think in terms, particularly of Senator FitzGerald's suggestion of a Bill which might run parallel to it. If the Minister needs my support, I now solemnly pledge it to him at every point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation in itself is good but it cannot succeed just by being voted into existence.  I should like to reiterate a point I made in reference to the <Col N="947" /> Maintenance Act, that is, that the good effects of this Bill will require a great deal of social service on the ground. Everybody knows, and the Minister has expressed himself as knowing, that the number of social workers we have in the entire field of married life, family life, dealing with the unmarried mother, the absconding father, the neglected or derelict child is not adequate, but this is not because we do not produce excellent social workers. I would urge the Minister to increase the whole base of social advice and supporting activity for the unmarried mother and for everybody involved in what Senator FitzGerald called the misery and pain which accrues from unwanted children.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unwanted children&rdquo; is a phrase wrongly used.  There are very few parents who do not want their children but social circumstances frequently force them to abandon their children.  If we could alter these social circumstances the phrase &ldquo;unwanted child&rdquo; would disappear from our vocabulary.  If we are to cherish all the children of the nation equally the phrase &ldquo;unwanted child&rdquo; should be as repugnant to us as the phrase &ldquo;illegitimate child&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention in this connection to the growing discussion of the whole area of abortion which became involved in the area of contraception. This is not irrelevant.  Like Perry Mason in court, I hope to make all this evidence relevant to the issue. The point I am making is that some years ago, when the Abortion Bill had been passed in England, the Catholic Bishop of Shrewsbury said that all the resources of his diocese would be put at the disposal of any girl of any denomination, in any circumstances and from any place, who wanted to come and have her child rather than be subjected to the social pressures involved in the Abortion Act.  That illustrates the point I am making: that this whole notion of social service and social back-up is the true and charitable approach to adopt towards children coming into our society.</P>
    <P>It should be enshrined in active social support work that no social or moral pressure would be put on an unmarried <Col N="948" /> mother either to have her child adopted or not or to put her child into an institution or in care.  In other words, the support I am speaking of is, first of all, the support for her own conscience to choose freely and, secondly, the ancillary support to help her in her choice, so that no woman would be expected to abandon her child through any pressures which might arise from a defective social service within our community.  That is the point I am making.  It is one which is absolutely essential to a Bill such as this.  You can enact Bills until the cows come home but it is even more important to devise means by which the good effects of these Bills can accrue to the common good of society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say merely a few words on this Bill.  Much of what I would have liked to have said has been said already and I do not wish to be repetitious at this stage of the debate.</P>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister for having introduced this measure which, as some Senators have rightly said, is now long overdue.  It is understandable in a country such as ours, which has the reputation of being a child-loving one, that we should have particular regard to our laws concerning children.  This Bill deserves the closest and most constructive scrutiny by the two Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I read through some of the debate in the other House and I was greatly impressed by the way in which the Deputies responded to the Minister's appeal to treat the Bill as being above politics and by the way in which they accepted his invitation to make constructive proposals for the improvement of the Bill.  I hope the Minister appreciates that the Bill is being accepted in a similar spirit in this House.  From the speeches I have heard this afternoon it was the wish of every Senator who contributed to the debate to be sympathetic and helpful while at the same time rightly criticising certain aspects of the Bill which they thought required amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is inevitable that after 22 years some important amendments should <Col N="949" /> now be made to the 1952 Act, one which notwithstanding its limitations&mdash;now highlighted by the hindsight of some critics&mdash;worked well on the whole and helped to find a good home for some 20,000 children.  I should like to join with the other Senators who paid tribute to the Adoption Board and to the various adoption societies who have performed such wonderful work down through the years to help solve a very human and pressing problem.  Nobody could commend them too highly for their charitable and Christian work. Public representatives should avail themselves of the opportunity to pay them a well-merited tribute.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has been guided largely by experienced organisations such as those I have referred to and by persons experienced in dealing with adoption cases.  It is proper that the views of organisations which claim to represent a significant section of our society should be heard.  In the final analysis it is proper that those who speak with the voice of experience should be the guides of the Minister's proposals to amend the Act of 1952.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that in criticising the 1952 Act and seeking to improve the 1974 Bill we should take into consideration the changing attitude to adoption in a generally conservative and almost entirely Catholic State.  It has been said of the earlier Act that it was too mother-centred and therefore, that, the new Bill should be more child-centred.  It is proper that the Bill should give primary consideration to the rights of the child and the great need to provide it with a good home and loving parents, legal if not natural.  We should not emphasise too much or exaggerate the urgency of finding a home for an unwanted child&mdash;I hesitate to use that expression and I agree with Senator Martin that it is time it was abolished from our vocabulary&mdash;and we should not be over eager in trying to encourage a woman, perhaps in distress, to part with her child.  Before this stage is reached every possible encouragement through State, local authorities, private organisations and experienced personnel should be given to the mother to keep her child.  While we rightly talk of making the adoption <Col N="950" /> of a child easier, both on the mother and for the child in after life, I emphasise again the necessity of making it easier for the mother to keep her child in after life, of making it easier for the mother to keep her child in comfort and ensuring that it will have the same opportunities as any other child in our society.  It is most important that we ensure that the mother's rights are protected and that she is given full and ample opportunity to make one of the most difficult decisions of her life&mdash;the decision to part with her child to another woman, to other parents.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the indecisive or procrastinating mother whose case it is proposed to deal with in the High Court.  He has acknowledged that this is a difficult and emotive situation, involving a mother who may not be entirely capable of making a rational decision, for various reasons such as mental strain, desertion by the father or perhaps the knowledge that the child she may offer for adoption is the last child she will ever have.</P>
    <P>As the Minister stated, family courts would be the ideal tribunal to deal with such situations.  In their absence some other agency must be used.  Possibly a solution might be to set up small consultative committees on the lines of family courts&mdash;consultative or advisory rather than having any legal standing&mdash; comprised of experienced persons including people who themselves have adopted children and whose advise would be available to the court.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senators Ryan and Horgan, who stated that no provision appears to have been made in the Bill for at least consulting the father.  No doubt the Minister will refer to this.  It seems strange that one party to the birth of the child is not consulted, at least when the transfer of the child from its natural parents to adoptive parents is under consideration and arrangements are being made which will affect its whole future life and career.  I am glad the Minister has decided to assist adoption societies financially and to provide funds for research into the whole field of adoption in this country. Obviously more specialists and social workers are needed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> Perhaps the greatest need is the continuing involvement of ordinary, kindly, child-loving people who are prepared to give their services freely, gladly and without any desire of recognition on the committees of various adoption societies.  I hope the Minister, while finding a rightful place on the Adoption Board for qualified personnel, will continue the policy of having voluntary workers represented on it also.  Among the provisions of the new Bill, it is proposed to pay a deputy chairman when he acts on behalf of the chairman.  I suggest that the vice-chairman also be paid a salary.  Perhaps his services could be availed of in provincial centres, having regard to the amount of work available outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>These are the only comments I wish to make.  At this stage I should like to congratulate the Minister on introducing such a Bill.  I hope we will not have to wait another 22 years for an opportunity to help the adopted child by way of legislation.  I hope the Minister will take cognisance of the comments made in this House.  I think he will agree that they were helpful and constructive.  They were given in a manner which ensured that we all have &mdash;what Irish people have a great reputation for&mdash;a love for children and a desire to do our best for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank all the Senators who spoke for their views which were very constructive, and deeply researched and thought out.  They were given in a completely non-partisan, non-political fashion.  What was said was of immense interest to me and has been an education in many ways.  That, of course, is the purpose of having a Legislature and debates in both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill ranged over the whole field of adoption.  I will deal with the various points, not necessarily in the order in which they were raised.  Some of them overlap and it might not be possible to deal tidily with each of them.  The first one here is the question of the standards to be applied.  A point expressed by some Senators, but principally by Senator Robinson, was that the opportunity was not taken in the legislation <Col N="952" /> to provide for statutory regulations for the procedures to be adopted by the societies and by the Adoption Board. This is a matter to which I gave a lot of thought during the lead-up to the preparation of this Bill.  It is a matter on which I had discussions with the board, with representatives of the adoption societies and with individual social workers.  I was well aware of the call for the introduction of statutory procedures, of the insistence of that call and of how loud it was.  I was anxious to tease out its validity with those actually operating in the field.</P>
    <P>Lest it might be thought that I consulted only with what I might term the conservative elements in the adoption field, I want to say that that is not so.  I had discussion with workers of all shades of opinion in this area.  Views were wide-ranging, but the view that I formed has been the very positive view of the board themselves, the people who for the past 20 odd years have been operating adoption in this country and who would be best qualified to know the requirements; and that view is that statutory procedures would be a mistake. I am satisfied that there are sufficient checks present in the existing code to ensure good procedures and, more important, good standards.  As I said in my opening speech, good standards cannot be prescribed by a statutory instrument.  They depend on the training, education and supervision of the people in this field and on the level of efficiency at which the individuals operate.  I am satisfied that in the system as we have it there are sanctions, conventions, checks and balances present which ensure that high standards of procedure are being implemented.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson in the course of her contribution gave several case histories of adoptions that went wrong. I do not know how old those case histories were or how far back in the history of adoption they were dredged up from.  Unfortunately, in the experience of more than 20,000 cases of adoption there were some that went wrong.  We do not have the research facilities to know precisely why they went wrong or what was the error in the placement procedures but it is a matter for regret that some adoptions went wrong.  Implicit in arguing from <Col N="953" /> case histories is the old fallacy of arguing from the particular to the general.</P>
    <P>I have no way of knowing how old these case histories were.  I am well satisfied from the discussions I had within the adoption world that the procedures which are being implemented nowadays are satisfactory to ensure a uniformly high standard of adoption procedures.  This is secured in two ways: the adoption societies and the Adoption Board have certain procedures and the board have to be satisfied that these procedures are followed. Should there be any fall from this level the board have the sanction of withdrawing registration to the society in question.  The threat of this sanction being present in the background is adequate&mdash;it has not been necessary in a serious way&mdash;to ensure that procedures are followed.  There is also a new sanction available to me: subventions are now being paid by the Department to societies.  I have indicated that I would like to see these subventions spent on the employment of social workers so that a high standard of protection and expertise will be available in adoption procedures.  This is something that can be monitored. Should I be of the opinion at any time that the money is not being spent in the way I believe it should be spent, there is thus an implicit sanction available to me.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly satisfied that for these reasons there is no need to have statutory regulations to ensure proper procedures. The procedures at present being implemented are being observed consistently and uniformly throughout the country.  The adoption societies are based mainly on the churches.  Use is made by one society of the social workers of another in another part of the country.  For example, in the case of a child being adopted by parents in Donegal and placed with them by a society in Cork, the Cork society might call on a society in the north-west to carry out the visiting and pre-placement and post-placement inspections. Co-operation of this sort is common and has led to a uniformity of standards. The standards are supervised by the co-ordinating bodies and societies and by the Adoption Board.  I am satisfied <Col N="954" /> that the procedures being implemented are of a high standard.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been made from time to time that the workers working for the societies are not always professional social workers.  My answer to that is that the subventions now being made available to societies are geared to enable them to employ people of a high expertise.  I do not want to enter into an argument as to the relative merits of a graduate as against the non-graduate. Adoption is a very specialised field and expertise is only acquired by working in it under proper supervision. It is probably correct to say that expertise would be picked up more quickly by the person with a diploma or degree in social work.  That criticism is now answered by the unspoken condition attached to these grants.</P>
    <P>Despite what was said here today I am satisfied that the decision not to have statutory instruments regulating procedures is the proper one.  Let me say that these Acts are not immutable. Granted it has been 20 years since the Principal Act was passed and it has been ten years since it was amended.  I would hope that if the experience of the amendments now being debated shows that the Acts require further changing, we would not be slow in coming back to the Legislature for authority to make these changes.</P>
    <P>Linked with this question of standards is the question of research. No research has been carried out in this country, except one private piece of research referred to by Senator Robinson.  That was carried out by Miss Darling of the Social Science Department of Trinity College.  She deserves our best thanks for her energy and initiative in doing that particular job.  Miss Darling admitted that her research was necessarily narrow, possibly because it was private and she did not have the access to information that an official research project would bring with it.  Nevertheless in her research she discloses some very interesting facts. Research in the field of adoption is difficult because of the time element involved.  It would have to take place over a number of years&mdash;five, ten or perhaps even a longer number of years. <Col N="955" /> The conclusions reached at the end of that period might no longer be valid for children becoming available for adoption at that time because of differing social mores or any other reason that might pertain at the time.  Therefore research is difficult but nevertheless essential.  There has been no official research in this country.  As I indicated, I am keen to see that this is rectified and that research projects get under way.  Such projects will possibly confirm what has been discovered by research in other countries.</P>
    <P>In this context I should like to refer to the position of the illegitimate child, adopted and non-adopted.  When I addressed social workers in the adoption field in Limerick some months ago I made the point that on the whole, in my opinion, adoption was better for the illegitimate baby.  I was criticised for this sentiment on the grounds that we should encourage single mothers to keep their babies and rear them themselves. I am well aware of the good work the organisation &ldquo;Cherish&rdquo; are doing in this regard.  So well aware of it am I and my colleagues that in the Social Welfare Act, 1973&mdash;not 1972 as Senator Robinson said&mdash;for the first time provision was made whereby the State would give financial assistance to the unmarried mother who was rearing her child.</P>
    <P>However, I am of the opinion that for the good of the child&mdash;and we keep constantly preaching that our attitude should be child-centred and not adult centred&mdash;it should be placed for adoption. Of course the reason for this is that the illegitimate child is still marked in our society and the dilemma is how to remove that mark and at the same time cater for the welfare of the child, because in removing that mark it would be necessary that the single-parent family should become a norm rather than an exception.  In my opinion, and I have some research findings to support it, the good of the child is normally not so served.  Naturally there may be exceptions to that, but by and large I think that is a valid proposition.</P>
    <P>What I said in Limerick is that the consensus of opinion in our society is to the effect that adoption is better for the illegitimate child.  I said that there <Col N="956" /> might be some weakening in that consensus by virtue of improving community attitudes towards the unmarried mother and her child.  But I pointed out&mdash;and I think I am correct in this&mdash;that this is marginal and that for some time to come one-parent families will raise eyebrows in this Christian society of ours.  That is not just my personal opinion.  What research has been done validates it.</P>
    <P>Research has been done in England in a study entitled <i>Born Illegitimate&mdash; Social and Educational Implications.</i>  It was carried out by The National Foundation for Educational Research. A second study was done called <i>Growing Up Adopted</i> by the same foundation. The findings of that study were quite clearly in favour of the adoption of the illegitimate child.  The study showed the fate of adopted children to be basically better than that of those not adopted. A large sample number of children were taken and they were surveyed over a period of seven years.  Comparisons were made between illegitimate and non-adopted children, illegitimate adopted children and a control group of legitimate children.  Quite clearly the finding was in favour of adoption.  The children were materially, culturally and psychiatrically better off than their counterparts who were not adopted.</P>
    <P>So, while I sympathise with the bravery of unmarried mothers who wish to keep their children and feel they should be encouraged to do so in the hope that the mark of the illegitimate will disappear from our society, the fact is that adoption is available and should be availed of.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson mentioned the fact that in this country the vast majority of illegitimate children were adopted.  She contrasted this with the position in one of the Scandinavian countries, I think she mentioned Denmark, where the opposite is the case and the vast majority are kept by their mothers.  I do not know the position in Denmark but I came across the position in Sweden when I attended a conference for Ministers for Justice there last year. A paper was presented by the Swedish delegation on Family Law and I think the experience in Sweden would probably be comparable to that in Denmark. <Col N="957" /> The paper explains why so many illegitimate children are kept by their mothers there.  It is a different society.</P>
    <P>In Sweden, it is interesting to note, marriages fell from 60,000 in 1966 to 40,000 in 1971.  The number of illegitimate children in Sweden increased from 11 per cent of all children born in 1960 to 21 per cent in 1971.  Two-thirds of unmarried mothers lived with the fathers of their children.  The two situations are not comparable.  In Sweden marriage as an institution appears to be declining and the family as we know it is declining, because while there are informal marriages, if we may call them that, there are fewer and fewer formal marriages and those that are formalised are susceptible to divorce.  Marriage and the family as we understand it in our society are different here and I think this explains why, on statistics, there is the difference mentioned.</P>
    <P>The question of abandoned children was raised in very strong and moving terms by Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  I made the point in my opening speeches in this and the other House that there was a constitutional bar against affording the benefits of adoption to abandoned children, that is, children who are neither orphans nor illegitimate. Before discussing it further we would want to consider what, in fact, adoption is.</P>
    <P>Adoption is giving to what were foster children in the old days a new legal status.  It need not affect the care that is available for them at the hands of their new parents.  It does not affect their spiritual, economic, material or psychological situation.  What adoption does is to formalise their legal status as children of that household.  It is a legal change and in so far as it is a reassuring legal change it may affect the physical well-being of the child in the new home. To that extent it is peripheral to the welfare of the child.  The child's welfare is determined by the standard of care and love afforded to it in the new home and the amount of security it has in the new home.</P>
    <P>One must concede that the very fact of adoption may strengthen the sense of security and in that sense may <Col N="958" /> increase the physical well-being, but it is not essential to it.  Stable parents can provide that sense of security without the necessity of a legal act because the sense of security comes essentially from the relationship that is established between the parents and the non-blood child and the general stability of the domestic environment.</P>
    <P>Adoption, then, is not the be-all and end-all for the child's happiness.  It is a contributory factor, but it is essentially a formal legal act.  The human area behind the formal, legal act does not depend on the law.  It depends on the relationship established between the parties.  Prior to the Adoption Act of 1952 illegitimate children could be taken by adoptive parents&mdash;we use the term as it is familiar to us.  The children could be reared by and spend their lives with the adoptive parents.  This is still the position in the case of legitimate abandoned children.  They can be taken into a new home and given all the love, care and attention which their natural parents failed to give them.  They cannot be removed from that home if it is in their interest to stay there.  This is provided by Statute by the Guardianship of Infants Act which directs that the welfare of the child shall be permanent. Should feckless natural parents seek to recover a child they had previously abandoned and it is in the child's interests that he should not be returned to them, that child will remain with his foster parents and have all the benefits of security and whatever material comforts are provided.  It will also have the benefit of real affection.</P>
    <P>Those who deprecate the constitutional bar&mdash;indeed I have sympathy with them&mdash;want to add to the benefits enjoyed by that child the legal benefit of status.  This is important, but it is a legal matter on the periphery of the child's welfare.  The abandoned child can be taken into a home, given all the security and all the comfort and love of an illegitimate child capable of being adopted under the Adoption Act.</P>
    <P>I have listened closely to the arguments put forward.  I sympathise with the argument which asks: what kind of a Constitution do we have if it gives rights which prevent justice being done to these children?  This is an argument which is difficult to resist.  One answer <Col N="959" /> would possibly be to seek an interpretation from the Supreme Court on the Bill, suitably amended to cover this point, before it becomes law.  I will give this matter consideration.  There will be a question of delay but, as Senator FitzGerald stated, that might be overcome by a separate Bill dealing with this point.</P>
    <P>I foresee a serious drafting difficulty. When one talks of a drafting difficulty one is inclined to dismiss it as a legal technicality, but in this case I suggest it is more.  When is a child abandoned? When is the act of abandonment final and complete?  At what stage can the law or society say to the natural parents &ldquo;You have now abandoned your child forever&rdquo;?  Is society entitled to say that to natural parents who, possibly for reasons beyond their control such as financial, psychological, physical, had at some stage to part with a child either to a foster home or to an institution? If it should happen that the causes which provoked such parting with the child were removed or disappeared and that a stable home was then available for the child with its natural parents, possibly with brothers and sisters, who are we to say that that child would not be better off back in its own home rather than to be left in the foster home?</P>
    <P>This is a serious problem and it may not have been adequately teased out by people who say: &ldquo;It is inhuman of you to say that abandoned children can never be adopted&rdquo;.  I ask those who say that to bear in mind that abandoned children can have all the benefits of security, stability and love in a foster home without the legal formality of adoption.  This is the other side of the coin and these are two sides which we must consider when deciding if it is feasible to set about seeking to overcome the constitutional inhibition, indeed setting out to see if there is in fact a constitutional inhibition.  If it should be ascertained that there is, we then face a more difficult situation still. I am not insensitive to the case made for the abandoned child.  Who could be? Even at the risk of being accused of being insensitive, I state it is important to point out that there is another side to that particular picture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> Another point made during the debate concerned the rights of the father of the illegitimate child.  Senators Ryan and Horgan mentioned that it appeared wrong to fail to give the same rights to the father as the mother has. No reasons were advanced to support this case.  The existing law is probably adequate as it does not exclude the father: it permits him to be heard if the Adoption Board so decide.  I do not know if it would be a good thing that he be entitled as of right to be heard. In stating this I am conscious of the natural reaction: &ldquo;Surely the father has rights?&rdquo; Let us not forget that the mother, because of the illegitimacy of the child, must have the rights and if we were to put the father in the same position and allow him to be heard as of right we would be cutting down her position in relation to that child in this adoption situation.</P>
    <P>It is questionable if the natural father is entitled to be placed exactly on a par with the natural mother in that situation. It would be difficult to differentiate between worthy and unworthy fathers. One could begin by stating that all such fathers are unworthy, but this might not necessarily be the case.  Who would argue that the father of a child who was the result of a casual commercial union should be entitled to have the same rights as the natural mother?  The Act as it stands is adequate.  The father is not excluded and the board can hear him if the board in their discretion wish to have the full picture in relation to that particular adoption before them if they so decide.</P>
    <P>The question of birth certificates was raised here and in the other House&mdash; why should the long form of birth certificate have any mention of the word &ldquo;adoption&rdquo; and thereby announce a stigma to a stranger who might have occasion to inspect that certificate?  At first, let me say that for most purposes the short form of birth certificate is acceptable.  It does not contain any reference to adoption or illegitimacy. For some purposes the long form of the certificate has to be insisted upon.  If a child does not know that he is adopted it can be upsetting, and even shattering, to learn his status is not that of the natural son of his parents.  This should <Col N="961" /> not be so because good adoption practice demands that adopted children be informed as early as possible of their status.  When people who have adopted children inform those children from the beginning that they are adopted, the children have no difficulty or hang-ups in regard to their status.  Therefore, if care is taken by parents and if the proper adoption procedures are involved, the fact that the certificate carries the word &ldquo;adopted&rdquo; should not cause any difficulties.</P>
    <P>There is a further reason.  It is a legal reason and whether we like it or not we have to consider legal reasons.  The birth records of this State are part of the official records of the State and they must, in my opinion, be factually accurate on their face.  Birth records have to be searched sometimes to prove ancestry for genealogical or inheritance reasons.  It is important that anyone coming to search such records should be able to do so with confidence that they are factually accurate because blood descent could be important.  I think it is essential that the records of the State be factually accurate on their face.  If we were to exclude the fact of adoption from the birth records our records could be impugned and would be unreliable. This is a legal reason, and I am always conscious that putting up a legal reason as an argument for not conceding an emotional request of necessity appears insensitive.  However, it is an occupational risk.</P>
    <P>Another question that was raised was that of consent&mdash;the prevaricating mother or the mother who delays unnecessarily in giving her consent or who withdraws her consent just before the adoption order comes to be made. It is proposed, as I indicated, to deal with this by allowing the adoptive parents to seek a custody order from the High Court.  If this order is granted by the High Court the Adoption Board may then make an order for adoption notwithstanding the absence of consent on the part of the mother.</P>
    <P>This was criticised by Senator Robinson who asked how on earth could a mother contest such an application&mdash;how could she get into the High Court to contest it unless there was legal aid available?  I assumed in <Col N="962" /> that that Senator Robinson accepts that the principle is correct but the mechanics have to be looked at.  As she knows, the committee to advise me on the institutional system of legal aid are in being and have had their first meeting. I have no doubt that sooner or later we will see a system of legal aid in civil cases in this country and that should remove that difficulty.</P>
    <P>Where the question of custody is involved, the High Court is the proper tribunal.  Hopefully at some stage we will have, as many people want, a family court where questions of the custody of children, separation and maintenance between husband and wife can be dealt with.  When it comes, I think it will have to be a court of superior jurisdiction because these things will be serious legal matters.  In the meantime, pending the setting-up of such a court, I have no doubt that the High Court is the proper tribunal. This is the best way to deal with this question of the prevaricating mother.  I do not think a committee could deal with the matter because it is a question of custody of a child.  This is a serious matter and constitutionally it would have to be done in a court established under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan raised the question of the period of probation&mdash;the period from the time the board or the society placed a child with its adoptive parents until the adoption order is made.  There is no statutory period.  It is a matter for the board to decide what is proper in the circumstances of each case.  As a general rule the board insist on a probationary period of six months.  In exceptional cases this may be shortened or lengthened, but generally the probationary period is six months.  Experience has shown that this is a reasonable period to wait, a reasonable period to allow the child and the parents to adjust to each other and to enable the social workers to observe the adoption in practice and see if the signs are that it will be successful.</P>
    <P>The period can, of course, be shortened.  As a result there is provision in this Bill for reducing to six weeks the age at which consent can be given. It could be that the Adoption Board might make a final order for adoption <Col N="963" /> seven weeks after the birth of a child. That would be unusual but it could be done.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan raised the question of the age at which a married couple may adopt.  He was anxious to reduce this to 18 years&mdash;in other words, to provide that a married couple aged 18 years would be entitled to adopt.  I do not think this is practical.  While young people are becoming more and more sophisticated and marrying at earlier ages, I do not think it would be right to allow a couple as young as 18 years of age to adopt.  I think a couple should be married for a number of years before they could adopt so that the marriage can be seen to be stable.  Again, if there are to be natural children they should be born: it would be known to the couple that they were capable of having children and in that light they could make the decision as to whether they wanted to adopt children in addition.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan was anxious about the definition of &ldquo;child&rdquo;.  Under the Adoption Act a child is any person up to the age of 21 years, but Senator Horgan felt this should come down to 18 years.  This is not a matter of great importance in the context of adoption but I think we should leave it at 21 years.  It is still the age of legal majority and I think it should be the age up to which children can be adopted.</P>
    <P>Another point made by a number of Senators was the citizenship of children adopted abroad by Irish citizens.  Unfortunately, I think we would have to maintain the position where they have the citizenship that is conferred on them by the laws of the country where they are born and adopted.  I do not think we could intervene here to give them a citizenship other than that given to them by the domestic laws of that place.  It could be embarrassing for us to attempt to do that and wrong for us to do so.  It would be an interference in the domestic affairs of another State. There is no difficulty here because as soon as an application for naturalisation of such a child is made it is granted virtually automatically.  Indeed I understand that in the case of children who find themselves in this situation no fee is charged by the Department of Justice for the service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="964" /> That covers all the points that were raised in the Bill.  I hope I dealt with them adequately, but possibly not to the satisfaction of everyone who made them.  At least I have given the arguments against some of the motions also, which is what debate is about.  I shall be giving them more consideration between now and the next Stage and I look forward to seeing the amendments which have been indicated.  I wish to thank Senators again for their constructive approach to the subject.</P>

      <P>The purposes of this Bill are to increase the limit of authorised capital expenditure by the ESB for all purposes, including rural electrification, from the existing limit of £450 million to a new figure of £700 million and to delete detailed provisions dealing with the terms of pension schemes for wholetime members of the board of the ESB.</P>
      <P>Under existing legislation the ESB are authorised to incur expenditure for capital purposes up to a limit of £450 million.  By the end of June, 1973, the total capital expenditure approved by the board had risen to £420 million, which will cover generating plant and transmission and distribution equipment due for commissioning up to the end of the present decade.  However, over the next few years the board will have to decide on details of future generating capacity which will require capital expenditure exceeding the present statutory limit.</P>

    <P>The long-term forecast of the demand for electricity is based on the growth rate of 10 per cent per annum which existed for some years prior to the recent energy crisis.  It might be argued that the increased prices of electricity <Col N="965" /> could lead to a falling-off in future demand, as prices are unlikely to return to anything like their former levels in the foreseable future.  Electricity conrumption at the present time is in fact sunning at the same level as in the corresponding period last year.  At this stage it is not possible to predict the future rate of growth.  The high price of electricity must necessarily mean greater economy and care in its use but on the other hand electricity is relatively no dearer than other forms of energy and consequently there is no likelihood of a significant shift to other forms of light, heat and power.</P>
    <P>Electricity consumption has increased in the past at a greater rate than other forms of energy and it is expected in most countries that this tendency will continue in future.  In all the circumstances I consider that for the present at any rate it is prudent for the board to base their plans on a growth rate of 10 per cent per annum over the medium term we are dealing with in the context of this Bill and that the statutory limit on capital expenditure should be fixed on this basis.  Should it prove to be the case that growth does not take place at this rate, the board's plans are sufficiently flexible to allow postponement of some elements of the new capacity so as to keep capacity and requirements in reasonable balance.  In such an event the statutory limit on capital expenditure would suffice for a longer period. A sufficiency of electricity is of such importance to the country both socially and economically that we must not run any risk of finding ourselves without adequate capacity to meet our needs. The board's programme within the statutory limit on expenditure is required to be submitted in detail for my approval from time to time and in that way the position will be reviewed at regular intervals in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>The present generating capacity of the ESB is 1,798 MW and additional generating stations approved for construction total 1,392 MW.  These are due for commissioning between now and 1980 and comprise four 250 MW units &mdash;two at Tarbert and two at Poolbeg; a 60 MW plant at Marina; the pumped storage plants totalling 292 MW at <Col N="966" /> Turlough Hill and a 40 MW extension to Shannonbridge milled peat plant.</P>
    <P>To cater for the growth in demand additional generating capacity of some 1,100 MW will require to be brought into service in the period 1980-82.  The board will soon have to enter into the earlier of the various contracts involved. The total capital expenditure to which the board expect to have to commit themselves in the next few years is estimated at £250 million at present day prices.  The actual expenditure will be spread over a period extending somewhat beyond 1982.  The addition of £250 million comprises expenditure of:</P>

    <P>As Senators will be aware, this country at present depends on imported oil for almost 70 per cent of our primary energy requirements.  The recent oil crisis has made two facts very clear: that the era of cheap oil is over and that countries can no longer plan their energy programmes with the assurance of uninterrupted supplies of oil.</P>
    <P>The recent unprecedented increase in electricity charges was a direct consequence of the rise in oil prices.  The Government are fully conscious of the heavy impost which the increased charges represent for the householder and for all sectors of the economy. These charges are particularly felt because of the pervasive role which electricity plays in all our lives.  As I say however the increased charges are a direct consequence of the rise in world oil prices and there was no practical alternative to the introduction of electricity chages commensurate with the new oil prices.  I might add that despite these very substantial increases electricity charges in this country compare favourably with the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>The energy crisis has served to reinforce our present policy in two areas: the resolve to maximise the contribution of native resources and to move away from our present overdependence on imported oil.  Prior to the onset of the energy crisis it had been accepted that <Col N="967" /> Ireland's native sources of primary energy&mdash;hydro, turf and a small amount of coal&mdash;were being fully developed. The position has been reviewed in the light of the changed energy situation, particularly the increased price level of all forms of energy.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna carried out a reexamination of bog areas which had previously been considered unsuitable for economic development in the face of low-cost imported fuels.  Bord na Móna and the ESB are now drawing up plans for a new turf development programme under which greatly increased quantities of peat would be produced for electricity generation.  It is envisaged that additional turf-fuelled generation plant of about 160 MW capacity will be provided capable of producing 700,000 units of electricity annually.  The ESB are also reviewing the possibility of using a low-grade home-produced coal which had hitherto been regarded as too costly.</P>
    <P>In addition, the ESB are converting some of their generating plant to dual firing which will allow the use of coal or oil depending on availability.</P>
    <P>Marathon Petroleum Ireland Limited have confirmed the presence of a significant deposit of natural gas at a point 29 miles to the south-east of the Old Head of Kinsale.  The find is described as relatively small in comparison with offshore finds currently scheduled for development in the North Sea and is not sufficiently large to justify a grid distribution system for use of the gas as a fuel throughout Ireland.  The present intention is that the gas should be piped ashore in the neighbourhood of Cork city and that priority should be given to the use of the gas for the generation of electricity and the production of ammonia for the nitrogenous fertiliser industry.</P>
    <P>It is calculated that the deposit when fully developed should be capable of supporting a daily flow rate of 125 million cubic feet of natural gas for about 20 years.  The ESB propose as a first step that a 75 MW gas-fired plant should be provided at Marina in 1977, with an initial production of 300 million units of electricity in that year. In subsequent years up to 1982 a <Col N="968" /> number of gas-fired gas turbines will be provided at Whitegate with the subsequent addition of steam turbines using the waste heat to give a total capacity of approximately 500 MW at the Whitegate plant.</P>
    <P>The use of the natural gas for the generation of electricity may be objected to on the grounds that this is not the most efficient use of a high-grade fuel. The combination of gas-fired gas turbines with the subsequent addition of steam turbines using the waste heat will however give the highest possible efficiency for the use of natural gas in power stations.</P>
    <P>Having regard to our heavy dependence on imported oil and the necessity to ensure the greatest possible security of sources of energy in the event of another emergency similar to the one we had last winter, I think that the use of a large proportion of the gas for the generation of electricity can be fully justified.</P>
    <P>I understand that the gas is of excellent quality and is suitable as a raw material for the manufacture of ammonia.  It is proposed that approximately 52 million cubic feet a day should be used for an ammonia plant which Nítrigin Éireann Teo are setting up at Cork.  This would meet the potential demand for ammonia, for the following decade, of the nitrogenous fertiliser industry for the whole Irish market.  Gas used for the production of ammonia will replace oil which normally would have to be imported for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Nuclear energy has now emerged as the best large-scale alternative to oil for electricity generation.  Since the Government approval in principle of the ESB proposal to construct a nuclear power station the board have been proceeding with their plans.  Their aim is to issue an inquiry, towards the end of 1974, for a reactor in the 600 MW range with a commissioning date of 1982. The estimated cost of the reactor is £130/150 million.  The selection of a site for a nuclear station is primarily a matter for the ESB.  They have recently indicated a preference for Carnsore, County Wexford.  A final decision on the siting of the station will not however be taken until further detailed investigation <Col N="969" /> by the ESB is completed, a recommendation has been received from the Nuclear Energy Board and formal approval is given by the Government. The Nuclear Energy Board have wide powers to ensure that adequate control is exercised over nuclear material and the operation of the nuclear station, and will oversee all stages of the design and installation of the plant.</P>
    <P>It is also a function of the board to prepare safety codes and regulations taking into account the experience of nuclear power in other countries and the standards recommended by international bodies dealing with nuclear energy.  There are about 150 nuclear reactors in commission elsewhere and the ESB are satisfied that techniques are now sufficiently developed to make nuclear power safe.</P>
    <P>In the present world energy situation diversification in the forms of energy used for electricity generation is of paramount importance.  The recent crisis has clearly demonstrated this.  We in this country have been particularly vulnerable because of our very high and growing dependence on imported oil. Our present plans will do much to remedy this situation.  Considerable diversification and security will be achieved by our plans for the greater use of peat, use of natural gas from our own shores and finally nuclear power. All this will bring about a much greater spread in our electricity sources.</P>
    <P>Having outlined the ESB's future supply plans, I should now like to bring Senators up to date on progress of one of the board's current programmes&mdash; rural electrification.  As Senators will be aware, the four-year crash programme designed to achieve the completion of the rural electrification scheme is in its final year.  It is expected that supply will have been offered in all the 792 rural areas by 31st March, 1975, although the work may not be completed perhaps for several months afterwards.  At the beginning of 1974 applications for supply had been invited, either by canvass or by advertisement, from residents in 552 of the 792 rural areas.  The ESB expect that they will have made 60,000 new connections by the end of the crash programme, compared with the original estimate of <Col N="970" /> 36,000.  The character of the rural electrification scheme has changed significantly since the original programme was devised in 1946.  Then it was simply a matter of connecting houses already built to the supply.  Now it is also necessary to cater for new houses, industrial developments and the increasing demands of the agricultural community.  In the year ended 31st March, 1974, capital expenditure on rural electrification was approximately £4 million, bringing the total invested in the rural electrification scheme at that date to over £59.5 million, of which £21 million was by way of Government subsidy.</P>
    <P>The present capital expenditure figures for the ESB and the magnitude of future expenditure give some indication of the growth of the electricity industry and the important role the ESB play in the life of the community.  The operation and running of the ESB have been the subject of two major inquiries in the last few years&mdash;the Fogarty Report, which specialised in the board's industrial relations; and the Fletcher Report, which was a general investigation into the affairs of the board.  In both these cases the recommendations of the investigating committees have been fully implemented in so far as lies within the board's competence.  The findings of the Fletcher Committee were quite complimentary to the ESB's performance and planning.</P>
    <P>Certain recommendations in the Fletcher Report which would require new legislation are under consideration. These recommendations are of a long-term nature and mainly relate to the financial regime within which the board are required to operate.  The existing framework was laid down in the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927.  That Act requires the board to operate on a break-even basis after making provision for all charges properly chargeable to revenue.  The board are statutorily precluded from making a profit.  The mandate laid down in the 1927 Act has worked well down the years and has stood the test of time. However it is being reviewed in the light of the Fletcher recommendations to see how far it should be modernised to conform with present-day thinking on <Col N="971" /> more sophisticated financial structures for State companies.  Any change will require legislation and the House will then have an opportunity of considering the matter.</P>
    <P>Fuel efficiency is now more than ever a matter of particular concern to the ESB in the design of stations, the control of their operation and the allocation of loading to the more efficient plants.  It is heartening to note that the board's new Poolbeg station has achieved a level of thermal efficiency which is a record for the board plant and indeed is excellent by any standard in the world.  I am satisfied that both in this matter and in the management of their own affairs, the ESB are in the forefront of electricity authorities throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the second section of this Bill is to delete sections 17 and 18 from the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1961.  Section 16 of the 1961 Act provides for the making of pension schemes to cover whole-time members of the board.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 and 18 and the Schedule of the Act outline the provisions required to be included in every pension scheme or amending scheme for whole-time members of the board.  The detailed provisions outlined in sections 17 and 18 and the Schedule to the Act are not sufficiently broad to permit the pension scheme for whole-time members of the board to be brought into line with the superannuation rights which the board's employees enjoy.  It is therefore necessary to delete these provisions from the Act.  This will facilitate the amendment of the scheme from time to time to keep it in line with developments elsewhere in public service pensions.  The deletion of the provisions of sections 17 and 18 and the Schedule would bring the statutory provisions in line with those governing the superannuation schemes for the whole-time members of other State bodies.</P>
    <P>I might mention that the chairman of the board is the only whole-time member of the board.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa ar an gcéad dul síos fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo.  Tá an-athas orm go bhfuil <Col N="972" /> an tAire ag tabhairt isteach Bille mar seo chun deis a thabhairt don Bord Soláthair Leictreachais níos mó airgid a sholáthar dóibh féin agus mar dheontas chun leanúint ar aghaidh leis an dea-obair atá á dhéanamh acu.</P>
      <P>I want to say I welcome this Bill and we in this side of the House have no objections whatever to it.  I should like to compliment the Minister on his opening speech.  It contained much useful information.  A Bill such as this gives a Senator an opportunity of making a few remarks pertaining to the subject of the ESB and their operations during the years.  It is only fair to say that the ESB since their foundation have been an outstandingly progressive State body.</P>
      <P>History will record that by their industry and diligence the ESB have done more to further the advancement of the ordinary people of this country than any other group within the State. They have pioneered many worthwhile schemes.  Since the foundation of the ESB the whole pattern of life, not only in our cities but also in the rural areas, has changed completely.  They had many difficulties to reckon with.  People were not sufficiently educated to the merits of electricity.  It was difficult to persuade them to avail of the services provided. They considered it dangerous so far as fire hazards were concerned.  It has only been in the last 20 or 30 years that they have educated themselves to the immense benefits that flow from the system.</P>
      <P>We in this young nation have provided a broader basis for electrical services than any other modern country. We got very little assistance from outside countries.  We had to stand on our own feet.  The ESB have extended the rural electrification scheme all over Ireland.  The comforts and blessings which electricity brings to the city dwellers are also obtainable to people in remote parts of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge the ESB&mdash;despite the fact that they have announced they have completed connections in areas under the rural electrification scheme&mdash; to ensure that people in the more remote areas get connected to electricity. Considering they have done such a magnificent job for rural Ireland so <Col N="973" /> far and that people are so well versed and educated in this matter, they should give everybody the opportunity of availing of this great gift.  Because of the tremendous emigration from these remote areas many homes are left with one or two old people living in them. These people do not want to go to institutions.  They want to stay in their own homes.  They would be delighted to have electricity and as a social service, the Government should provide them with it.  This might have the added effect of ensuring that these homes will be occupied in the future.</P>
    <P>Our population is now on the increase.  Emigration is not as widespread as it was previously.  People are being educated how to make a living for themselves in their own country.  Rural electrification has played a tremendous part in spreading the advancement of the industrial age within our island. Industries are springing up in our smaller towns.  These industries play a vital part in the life of the nation. Great credit is due to the ESB for this, because if we lacked electrical facilities and amenities industrialists would be reluctant to build factories.  We should lean over backwards to provide electricity where it is not available at present.  Even though we might think the cost exhorbitant at present, this cost would be recouped by money saved and in other directions.</P>
    <P>Last year taught us a lesson regarding the provision of electricity.  I am sure the ESB and the Government have been turning their minds towards some method of generating energy without the excessive use of imported products such as oil.  The turf-burning stations were a great advance.  Were it not for them and the coal-burning stations, our position last year during those lean months might have been much worse.  It is up to the ESB and the Government to ensure that in future we will make better use of our native resources.  It has been said that peat and turf may be rather scarce and will be exhausted in the near future.  I would be prepared to gamble on that.  While the Government may be thinking of erecting huge storage tanks for oil and exploring the possibility of getting oil around our coast, I think the available resources <Col N="974" /> should be utilised.  It would provide employment in rural areas and would be a great help to the national economy.</P>
    <P>Engineers and architects who design local authority housing will have to take cognisance of the fact that the centrally-heated home is no longer the be-all and end-all of existence on this earth.  They will have to provide the old-fashioned fireplaces which use solid fuels.  It is too soon yet to get away from the traditional way of life.  We should not have all our eggs in one basket.</P>
    <P>I do not know much about international treaties, such as the Treaty of Rome and various other EEC Treaties. I thought there was an understanding that some co-operation between member countries would take place.  I thought we would help each other whenever difficulties arose, such as during the oil crisis.  We in this country experienced a possible threat that we would not get our allotted amount of oil.  We were in grave danger of being left in the lurch. The Second World War taught us a lesson in that respect.  If that lesson did not sink home, surely this last oil crisis should have taught us another lesson in that respect.  The ESB planners will be well-advised to ensure that we have a second or third outlet.  They should ensure that we will not be dependent completely, or at least to the extent of 70 per cent or 80 per cent on imported fuel to provide the energy we need to keep our industries and factories working.</P>
    <P>Mention was made by the Minister of a nuclear energy plant.  This is a matter for the experts.  The ESB have given some thought to this.  They are the professionals.  It might be impertinent of me to venture an opinion on it.  I think we should never forget that we are an island here.  Irrespective of what might be happening at present or what has happened in the past few years, there should be co-operation between the Six Counties and the rest of Ireland on this matter.  I do not know the cost of these nuclear generators or how the Government ought to approach this problem.  It is a matter for them to negotiate to have one station serving the whole country.</P>
    <P>I remember in my young days as a schoolboy speaking to a Mr. Maguire <Col N="975" /> who was then chief engineer with Bord na Móna.  He related how they at that time had been studying the possibility of using the tides along our coasts to provide some type of energy.  It seemed the Americans in those days had been taking readings of high tides along the Mexican coast.  I am sure that since then statistics have been provided regarding the rise and fall of the tides around our own coast.  I am sure they have some data on that.  I am not so sure how the costings will work out.  There is also the possibility of using the winds to provide power.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that electricity is dear when we throw in thousands and thousands of tons of coal to generate it, especially when we are importing that coal from abroad.  Perhaps we have not used our heavy rainfall and our particularly wet climate sufficiently in this respect and perhaps more use could be made of our rivers.  Once you had the hydro-plant set up and once the rains came I am sure you would have much cheaper electricity provided in a natural way rather than being dependent on solid fuels.</P>
    <P>An experiment has been taking place in the Arigna area where there is a small, thin seam of coal.  This has been working for quite a number of years. It has been said that much of the coal mined there is not of a quality to warrant its burning in ordinary open grates and with the difficulty of getting a market against imported coal from Poland, America and England.  However, more attention should be paid to any useful type of coal.  With modern techniques it probably could be mined cheaply enough to warrant erecting a second coal-burning station on the Arigna coalfield.</P>
    <P>I know that coal had been mined in Castlecomer and perhaps the ESB could consider that field also.  Irrespective of what the geography books may have said in the past we know that under the skin of our country there seem to be more minerals than we anticipated.  If geologists probed a little bit deeper they might find that we are blessed, as they have been in England, where there are coalmines practically in all the whole northern part of the country, <Col N="976" /> with a similar situation here.  These are thoughts that should engage the minds of the ESB because they are charged with providing and keeping a service in existence for the benefit of the people in this country.</P>
    <P>Scientists in other countries have adverted to the fact that perhaps in the not-too-distant future they may be able to use the enormous energy which the sun can generate.  I am sure experiments are going ahead in many countries on this.  I am sure, too, that the personnel in the ESB&mdash;most of them are top-class engineers and scientists and they do extensive study in this line&mdash;have long ago adverted to the fact that much use probably could be made out of this source of energy.  I am sure they are working in close harmony with their opposite numbers in other countries in trying to harness solar rays and solar energy.</P>
    <P>These are some sources of supply. Naturally they are a very important part of the whole picture, because when we come to talk about the price of electricity the raw material is very important. While we all know that the scarcity of oil is the main factor in the increases which took place in the cost of electricity this year, certainly the cost of the raw material pushed up the price. We are asking them to try to find other means or to augment the present means in some way so as to ensure that this will not happen again and that we will not be caught in the same way as in the past.</P>
    <P>The ESB are a tremendously important body.  They have pioneered many new schemes and their worth and importance to the city dweller is immeasurable. The same can be said for those who live in rural areas.  People now have piped water going into their homes.  They are able to instal pumps: farmers are able to milk their cows by electricity.  All these modern amenities have been provided because the ESB have been in existence and because the ESB engineers down the years have given some thought to this and have worked in harmony with the Irish people.  They are doing a tremendous job.</P>
    <P>I have received complaints regarding prices.  I know this is a difficult matter <Col N="977" /> at present for the Government.  Prices have been escalating out of all bounds and many people are concerned.  Many people would be highly perturbed and deeply annoyed if it should come to the stage when they could no longer afford electricity, because, apart from the use they have made of it to eliminate a lot of the drudgery on the farms, they get a fair amount of pleasure from listening to the radio or watching television.  It would be too bad if at any time the ESB officials or personnel would have to threaten to cut off or disconnect people or take electricity from them altogether, especially from people who have already enjoyed it.  They have known the benefits of it.  If they had never had it the story might be different. I would not like to see a situation such as that happening.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the fact that he is planning for an increase of 10 per cent.  Perhaps it is a modest enough increase.  I would like to see our population increasing and our people remaining at home, but I am certain that there is a limit to which people can go as far as prices are concerned. Eventually they will have to choose between a centrally-heated home or one heated from solid fuels.  Various things like that will arise and affect the ultimate efficiency of the ESB and their policy of trying to get across to the people the best ways of enjoying a modern life with electricity.</P>
    <P>As a trade unionist myself there is one thing I never like to refer to, and that is internal disturbance in an organisation, in particular in a State-sponsored body and one as important and vital to the whole life of the nation as the ESB.  People who are working in the ESB are very dedicated people.  They have pioneered in the past.  It can be a dangerous occupation.  Electricity is dangerous even in the home.  I am afraid that too many people interfere with wiring and so on.  Linesmen and those putting down those huge cables, working underground, boring in such places as Turlough Hill, are all engaged in a very dangerous occupation.  There are many hazards and there have been many accidents and many deaths.  Many people have given their lives to ensure that the people of Ireland would have <Col N="978" /> this great service.  It is only fair to pay them a compliment for their dedication.</P>
    <P>At the same time it is also only fair to say that those who are in a very responsible position such as that have a duty to the people of this country. There are many facilities set up already for settling strikes of all sorts, the Labour Court and conciliation.  There are various means and ways.  In the case of people in key industries such as this every effort should be made and every approach explored so as to ensure that other workers in factories and those in hospitals and other vital situations would not be deprived of this modern magic we have had supplied to us by the ESB.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The people in rural areas say the ESB banished the fairies.  If they did, they provided another form of magic for the whole country and have transformed its outlook.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to welcome the Bill particularly as an indication of the extraordinary progress the ESB have made over their life of approximately 45 years.  It is interesting to recall that the sum of £700 million to which the Minister now speaks of raising the ESB capital is approximately, if my memory is correct, 100 times the cost of the Ard na Crusha scheme in 1927.  Normally, to talk of increasing capital requirements from £450 million to £700 million would cause a gasp of astonishment.  When one realises the work done by the ESB over the past 40 odd years it is safe to assume, as the Minister does, that over the next six to eight years, their capital requirements of £250 will be exceeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his opening speech spoke of the possibility of a necessity to cut down on the capital requirements due to the 10 per cent increased demand not being reached.  I think he will find that costs will account for it if they continue to escalate at 15 per cent per annum and that his estimate of £250 million will have been on the meagre side.  One significant factor which made us sit up and take notice of our energy requirements and their <Col N="979" /> cost has been the fuel scarcity and upsets of the past two years.  Like cheap food, we had taken cheap fuel for granted.  The world will never again get either commodity cheaply.  There may be some easing in the situation.  The existing escalating prices for oil may level off.  Looking forward to the next 20 to 25 years the costs of fuel of all kinds are likely to increase rather than stabilise.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government are wise to look for other sources of energy.  We have got ourselves into a critical economic and national dilemma by allowing over the past 14 years our requirements of imported oil to increase from 25 per cent in 1960 to over 70 per cent this year.  Even if we find new sources of energy in the country and include a nuclear power station, we will still need to import large quantities of oil.  The proportion may drop from 70 per cent to 60 or 50 per cent but the total imports of oil, unless we find some oil in our own offshore waters, will still be high and may be in excess of today's figure.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that a reappraisal of the turf deposits is to be made by the ESB, but if one is realistic one cannot see either turf or coal providing anything except a small proportion of our total energy requirements.  Even a nuclear power station at 600 MW will be only a small proportion of the estimated increase in the total output over the next six to eight years.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech referred to the £250 million increase raising the total output by some 80 per cent to a figure in excess of 3,200 MW to be increased by a further 1,100 MW in the subsequent two years.  Taking a total figure of something in excess of 4,500 MW anything we can produce from our own resources will be quite a small proportion.  Unless we find oil offshore we must import oil in vast quantities. This brings up the question of the supply and origin of oil and its refining.</P>
    <P>At present we have only one refinery at Whitegate.  The refining capacity will have to be increased.  This may be outside the scope of the Bill but it is relevant to the question of energy sources.  I should like to see the Government <Col N="980" /> and private enterprise making arrangements to set up joint companies in the oil producing countries.  Ireland is friendly towards the Middle East and North African countries and we should cash in on this and come to a joint arrangement to provide for long-term supplies of oil.  In return we should be able to do a substantial two-way trade. With most of these countries we have a minimal trade.  On our side it is hopelessly unbalanced.  If an associate company could be formed with countries such as Libya there should be great potential, first, by getting a long-term supply of oil at reasonably stable prices, and secondly by providing a market for the export of Irish produce.</P>
    <P>This may be remote from the scope of the Bill but the whole question of energy is being considered.  The Government should give consideration to entering into partnership or company arrangements with North Africa and other oil-producing countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Dolan mentioned the question of tidal energy.  This was raised in both Houses some years ago.  There is also the possibility of harnessing wind. The ESB have made some tests in that regard on the north-western coast.  This has been done fairly successfully in other countries.  We should look into this possibility in view of the fact that we do have mainly constant south-westerly winds and these could be harnessed.</P>
    <P>Our water resources are almost exhausted apart possibly from tidal waters.  This is unfortunate as water is the cheapest method of producing electricity.  I think I am correct in saying that the ESB, in spite of the fact that they have been in existence for over 40 years, are still the cheapest producer of electric current in the State.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister how it is proposed to finance this enormous sum of money.  Is there any possibility of getting assistance from EEC sources? As Senator Dolan rightly says, we are a member of the Common Market and one of the attractions held out at the time we campaigned in favour of joining it was the sharing of financial and other resources and mutual help between countries.  I think it should be possible, if it has not already been considered, to secure some of the capital <Col N="981" /> requirements for this very substantial scheme from EEC sources.</P>
    <P>Other Senators and certainly many Deputies have commented on the very sharp increase in electricity costs following on the sharp increase in the price of oil.  It has been a bitter blow, particularly to domestic consumers, and one which has been very strongly resented. It is very hard to understand that such a rapid rise in prices can take place in such a short time.  Everything possible should be done to insulate the country from further increases of this size.  That can only be done, as the Government are proposing to do, by exploiting the natural sources of energy as much as possible and by making whatever long-term arrangements they can make for the importation of oil from other countries at staple prices.  I hope the optimistic estimates of finding oil off our shores will be realised.  If it is found it will have a dramatic effect on the whole situation.  Instead of being a deficit nation as regards energy sources we could, quite likely, become an exporting nation, exporting energy or products arising from energy.  That is a situation which many of us would like to see come about.</P>
    <P>We have been talking about importing oil and using coal, possibly our own coal resources, but has the possibility of importing coal from Great Britain been considered?  Great Britain still has enormous reserves of coal.  It might be easier to do that because we could be certain of a regular source of supply quite close to our own country and we could pay for it in sterling rather than going half way across the world to look for oil supplies.  Perhaps there is nothing in this suggestion.  Perhaps England has not got the coal to spare but if she has it might be well worth considering the suggestion.</P>
    <P>Finally I want to support Senator Dolan in asking the Government to act jointly with our fellow-countrymen in the North of Ireland in the development of not only nuclear but other energy resources.  This is something in which fruitful and practical co-operation could take place.  Every effort should be made to encourage the two parts of our island to co-operate with one another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the ESB are to be complimented, as are the Northern Ireland Electricity Authority, on the initiative they have shown within the past decade as regards linking up North and South to provide electricity services for all our people.  It is a joint enterprise and is one that must be commended.  I have no doubt that both the ESB and the Northern Ireland authority will continue that good work.</P>
      <P>Any debate about the ESB at the present time naturally centres around the question as to why we have placed so much reliance on imported oil as against other sources of energy.  Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but if one had the benefit of foresight everything would be perfect.  Until two years ago everybody had concluded that oil, apart from being the cheapest source of energy, was the obvious one for generating electricity in this country.  We did not foresee anything appearing on the horizon then which would detract from that opinion.  The part that world politics have played in the meantime could not have been foreseen by anyone. The ESB, who have shown commendable foresight in regard to their planning programme and their development schemes, could not have foreseen that difficulty either.</P>
      <P>The future financing of the ESB is something to which we will have to give much thought, because the greater the demand for electricity the more costly will be the plant that will have to be provided to meet that demand.  At present the cost of generating electricity is quite high.  Perhaps the only way in which any reduction in the amount of capital that will need to be imported at regular intervals or a reduction in price to the consumer can be achieved is by greater efficiency within the organisation itself.  It is good to see that the ESB engineers have come up with some thoughts on the economic viability of lesser quality coal which until recently they did not feel would be a viable proposition for the provision of energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB have always commanded a high degree of respect for the efficient manner in which they operate.  They have been commended by various bodies, ranging from independent study groups to people such as the World <Col N="983" /> Bank, whom they approached at various times for financial subventions. That efficiency has been reflected in the programme of rural electrification, the North-South electricity links and the studies they have continuously carried out to acquire greater efficiency.</P>
    <P>Anyone who travels abroad will conclude that there are very few countries which have such a density of rural dwellings provided with electricity.  The rural electrification scheme, when it comes to its conclusion next year, will leave very very few houses without an electricity supply.  I would ask the Minister what the situation will then be as regards those remaining dwellings? I know that in the final stages of the rural electrification scheme areas were asked whether they wished to be supplied with electricity.  No doubt, as has happened with the previous canvasses, there will be areas which will not opt for a supply.  I wonder if the Minister has given any thought to what will happen to those areas in, say, five years' time with increased rural development in the form of new houses and industrial development.</P>
    <P>The alternatives to imported oil are, as has been already indicated by the Minister and by other speakers, nuclear energy, natural gas and better utilisation of our hydro and turf resources. As regards the nuclear energy source, I think it will throw off a problem apart from any economic ones it may create, namely, the environmental aspects associated with it.  We seem to be running into a certain amount of difficulty as regards the Carnsore Point location for a nuclear power station. There is no doubt that people have taken the ESB for granted for so long that when they find that something associated with the ESB is likely to create environmental problems for them they become disturbed.</P>
    <P>I do not know how this problem will be solved because environmental problems are something to which people are paying more and more attention. The difficulties that are arising in the case of Carnsore Point are quite likely to arise at any other location that may be mooted.  It is a problem which needs consideration.  Perhaps a greater display of the safety factors involved in nuclear <Col N="984" /> stations will make people realise that the danger is not as great as they imagine.</P>
    <P>To have natural gas available on the seabed is one thing but to bring it ashore is another matter and a costly one.  This is a factor that will have to be taken into account in the provision of electricity supplies in the future.  We will have to find out what it will cost to bring the natural gas to the shore and how it compares with buying imported crude oil.  No doubt this is something into which the Department will go in greater detail and from which they will draw their own conclusions.</P>
    <P>We are of course limited as regards our turf and peat resources and the hydro source seems to be almost exhausted.  We owe a debt of gratitude to the ESB for not converting from peatfired stations to perhaps oil-fired stations to the extent to which most people would have said five years ago they should have, when oil was so cheap.  We are indebted to them for sticking by their original turf and peat-fuelled stations.</P>
    <P>People should be grateful for the quality of the work carried out by the ESB.  The 10 per cent annual growth rate at which the ESB have aimed, and exceeded at times over the past decade, is something which any business could well be proud of.  The present growth rate, which is very little above 1 per cent, is no doubt only a temporary feature.  I am sure the ESB will once again return to their annual growth rate of at least 10 per cent.  That is something to which we all look forward.</P>
    <P>Unhesitatingly, we all commend this Bill.  The money that is required will provide a service which we probably take too much for granted.  It is only when we are deprived of that service that we realise how important a part it plays in our lives and that it is worth the money being put into it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with other speakers, I welcome this Bill very warmly.  There is no question about the efficiency of the ESB.  The only matter of concern is the source of energy for producing power.  In the immediate future I am afraid we shall have to turn <Col N="985" /> to natural resources.  I had the pleasure of visiting Turlough Hill in County Wicklow.  Much as I admired that scheme, I admire much more the person who sold the idea to your Department. It is one thing to have an idea, but it is another thing to sell it to somebody.  I spent most of my life selling things and I know what that means.</P>
      <P>I am not conversant with the whole country but I am with my own locality. It is my opinion that advantage is not being taken of all our natural resources, such as waterfalls.  Maybe due to the physical structure of the country, we have these waterfalls.  Down through the centuries mills were powered by water.  The Shannon is one of the greatest rivers in western Europe.  It has struck me forcibly that possibly there should be more schemes like Turlough Hill on the Shannon.  I am not an engineer, but I am sure it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that there could be similar schemes on the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of the Erne, we have not similar sources of power in the north-east.  Would it be possible to harness the Erne river, which goes on to Ballyshannon?  Of course a much smaller river which does not attract the same amount of interest is the Fane.  On my own doorstep we have Lough Mucknoo.  There has been talk of draining it for the last 50 years. People have been talking a lot about draining the Shannon.  Likewise, there is always talk of draining the Fane. I know of a hill which could be another Turlough Hill, although perhaps not to the same degree of magnitude.  At least it would provide a reasonable amount of energy.  An engineer from the Department told me that if we succeeded in what we were trying to do with Lough Mucknoo, where there are about 1,000 acres, and this Border river, in which the Northern Ireland Government were also interested, this lake would completely disappear and we would drown half of Armagh.  I have no desire to drown anybody&mdash;I am only giving this as an illustration&mdash;but the water is there. Recently there was an interesting talk on the BBC about Holland.  We all know how the Dutch derive their <Col N="986" /> energy&mdash;from water and from windmills.</P>
    <P>Naturally the increases in ESB charges are annoying; nobody likes increases.  However, I am afraid they will be with us for some time.  People who are in the course of constructing new houses are very dissatisfied with the ESB.  They are making very unreasonable demands on these young people building their own houses.  In some cases the installation charges amount to £700 or £800.  I think it is unreasonable and I would ask the Minister to look into it.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Dolan on the question of tidal energy.  We have no tides worth harnessing.  For the foreseeable future the price of coal and oil will be prohibitive and the ESB will have to depend on natural resources.  I understand that the Minister for Local Government is making it obligatory on anybody building a house to instal at least one fireplace but he will have to make it two if things continue as they are.  I do not want to detain the house any longer. I welcome the Bill and wish the ESB well, but I would ask them to find another Turlough Hill or two.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKerrigan" hpid="Mr. Kerrigan Mr. Kerrigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kerrigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to join with the other Senators in welcoming this Bill.  It is a vote of confidence in the ESB.  Since the board's foundation we have taken them for granted but when the oil crisis occurred we realised the cost of our over-dependence on imported fuel.  Having listened to the other Senators and to the debate in the other House, I cannot add anything further on the question of looking for our own natural resources and using every available facility to ensure a reduction in the importation of oil.  I would suggest, as a matter of urgency, that if fuel must be imported we should import crude oil and have facilities made available for its refining.</P>
      <P>The ESB are an organisation that have had many troubles but when the recommendations contained in the various reports have been implemented, I am confident that they will help to solve some of the ESB's troubles.  They should be complimented on the manner in which they dealt with the crisis created by the storms of last January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> Some Senators referred to ESB advertisements which advocate centrally-heated homes.  Young people who were pressured by these advertisements into installing central heating are now in a difficult situation.  I would ask the Minister to discuss with his colleagues in the Government the position regarding centrally-heated local authority houses.  Tenants have been affected very much by the sharp increases in fuel prices.  Maybe something can be done to help these people.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is a sign of prosperity and of confidence in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the other Senators in welcoming this Bill and in paying tribute to the high standard of efficiency and performance associated with the ESB in the production of power.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech was a very comprehensive one and gave us an idea of the work ahead, especially the efforts being made to diversify so that we would not find ourselves in the same position as last winter when, with a 70 per cent dependence on imported oil, we were in a very vulnerable position. It is a very difficult situation to remedy. I am glad to see that one of the first schemes announced was the further development of our turf resources. There is quite a substantial projection of turf production, an increase of 160 MW during the next five to seven years or almost 10 per cent of present production. This will mean that turf production, which is at present contributing to 25 per cent of our electricity, will continue even with the growing demand of a projected 10 per cent increase per annum.</P>
      <P>We owe a great debt to Bord na Móna and to the ESB engineers who have contributed so much to the development of our turf resources both from the point of view of the generation of power and also of the utilisation of turf and its by-products.  The success of Bord na Móna has been the most spectacular achievement in the development of our native resources during the past 50 years</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister urge a bold policy in connection with low-grade <Col N="988" /> coal.  We can expect further increases in oil prices.  Consequently we should not wait until the oil cost curb makes it feasible, to exploit our low grade coal resources.  We should be able to see whether there are many other positive aspects of the creation of home industry contained in the development of low-grade coal.  For instance, there would be the employment factor and there are many other spin-offs from this industry.  I would urge that if the technology is available we should make an act of confidence in the future and proceed with an imaginative programme for the development of our low-grade coal resources.</P>
    <P>We all welcome the confirmation of the find of natural gas.  Indeed, its size can be gauged from the fact that it is projected that it will give 500 MW in six or seven years, that is one-third of our present production and is a very sizeable contribution.  The company who found the gas have doubled their estimate of what is available.  In the next few months we will probably hear that this estimate has been doubled again. In short, we are only at the beginning of the utilisation of gas.  I hope that in the near future the findings will justify the creation of a national grid to make full use of our gas.  I welcome the fact that it will supply the total supply of our nitrogenous requirements.  That is something which is very worth while.</P>
    <P>Faced with the problem of a 10 per cent per annum increase in our requirements, which would double after seven or eight years, we will need the nuclear arm.  I am glad that the Government and the ESB are pressing ahead with the development of a nuclear power station, which I think it is intended to commission by 1982.  A 600 MW production is projected for this, roughly the same as what it is hoped to obtain from gas and about one-third of our present output. That is a fairly sizeable contribution by nuclear power.  Yet, on the other hand, it will be quite a small station in comparison with the nuclear power stations in other countries.  The average nuclear power plants must be three or four times that size.  There may be some efficiency gained from increased size.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should be satisfied <Col N="989" /> just to supply the home needs.  A great export market could be achieved.  It is now feasible to export power by direct current to England or the Continent&mdash; in short, to the EEC.  If the location which is available to us would be suitable for a much larger station than we need and the requirements, such as water, are available, we should find out if our partners in the EEC would be interested in a joint venture in the nuclear energy field, thus enabling us to export nuclear power to Europe.  A great deal of the finance for the existing station will have to be borrowed.</P>
    <P>This is an export possibility which we should look into seriously.  The overpopulated regions of Europe have very few sites on which they can put a nuclear power station.  We have many. The ESB have a preference for Carnsore Point.  There are many locations along the west coast where conditions are ideal for a nuclear plant.  There is not any real hazard attached to a nuclear plant today.  There are 150 or so nuclear plants in operation and the safety record is excellent.  I would ask the Minister to consider my suggestion and to have it looked into at EEC level as a matter of urgency.  I have no doubt that the technology for harnessing tidal power will be developed to the point where it will become competitive.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the energy crisis which disturbs me considerably is how quickly we have forgotten about it.  It is merely accepted now that there was some type of crisis some time ago.  All our good resolutions about economising seem to have vanished.  There does not seem to be any drive to cut down on our energy requirements.  I should like to see a committee with adequate technical help entrusted by the Government with the duty of trying to cut down on wasteful use of fuel, energy and products made from oil.  There is a great need for conservation. Where are all our good resolutions about economising and conservation, the recycling of waste, collection of waste paper, this and all the rest?  I understand that the United States have made considerable strides on that front and are keeping up the momentum there.  Perhaps we should learn from them and see that waste paper and so on, which is such a headache, <Col N="990" /> is turned into useful national products.  I would appeal to the Minister and the Government to try to put more drive behind their efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>The ESB have the greatest concentration of skilled manpower in this country.  There has been within the board's staff down the years a very high level of engineering training and engineering performance in utilising the various resources we have and operating hydro stations, turf stations and pump storage stations and dealing with the great complexities of all these.  About four or five years ago we had a Bill to facilitate and encourage various speciallist groups within the country to conserve on a world scale.  There was a great need for such talent in many countries and there was quite a remunerative market for such services.</P>
    <P>When we were passing that Bill I thought the ESB and Bord na Móna would be naturals for a big development in that field.  I am not aware that there has been any real spectacular development. I know certain officers are occasionally sent on secondment to carry out tasks in other countries.</P>
    <P>The time has come to ask the ESB to push ahead rapidly with that phase of their work.  The excellent concentration of technical talent in the ESB is a very good thing but if they become frustrated by lack of opportunities for the development of their creativeness and their engineering skills they lose a great deal of their value to us.  We can guard against that if we make them available on a world scale to do similar pioneering work in other countries.  African countries and many others are crying out for such skills and services.  We have it and should press ahead and use it.</P>
    <P>We have a great capacity here for getting very emotional about a crisis when it occurs.  We have all sorts of resolutions about what we will do about it but when the crisis blows over we forget them.  There was another crisis in the ESB before the fuel one. It was a more serious one.  It was the strike crisis.  We cannot be happy about the situation&mdash;this is a giant company with enormous resources and essential to the everyday life of the country&mdash; where the strike weapon was used <Col N="991" /> during the past couple of years.  The public have a right to protection from such, even if it means having to pay extra to get that protection.  It is fundamentally wrong that any small group in a major industry can hold the whole country to ransom by means of a strike.  I do not know the answer, but the Government would have the full backing of all the citizens in any steps that would be taken to ensure that a repetition of the strikes would not be allowed to occur.  The public are anxious and willing to pay a price to ensure this, particularly as we are today increasing the resources available to the ESB.  We are making them a larger company, a greater giant in our midst.  Is it safe to do that?  If we cannot control it should we&mdash;perhaps it is not feasible&mdash;diversify it?  Should we ensure that all the control is not under the one group?  We should ensure that the striking unit cannot paralyse the whole system.</P>
    <P>These are the real difficulties we face in the future in placing so much of the necessaries of life under the control of one single company.  Perhaps the Minister could reassure us that steps are being taken to ensure that the strike crisis will not recur.  The strike crisis occurred only 11 months ago.</P>

We have looked many times for an Oireachtas Committee to deal with semi-State bodies.  The Government indicated their willingness to experiment along these lines.  The time has now arrived for such an experiment.  I should like to see the Minister giving us some hope that we may see such a committee shortly to deal with the ESB.  It would make for greater involvement of the Oireachtas in the running of semi-State bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamWhyte" hpid="Mr. Whyte Mr. Whyte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Whyte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to say a few words on this Bill. It is a vote of confidence in the ESB that the Government have increased ESB <Col N="992" /> resources from £450 million to £750 million.  This is understandable with the ever-increasing need we have for current.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinlan finished on what I consider to be the most important aspect&mdash;labour relations within the ESB.  We wish for good labour relations there.  Perhaps in the past we have not done all that was necessary to ensure that good labour relations obtained within the industry.  It is fairly obvious that they did not always obtain to everybody's satisfaction and this has been apparent through those strikes. The ESB are in a privileged position as a result of having a monopoly of power for the whole country and they also have a huge responsibility.  They have responsibility to people in every walk of life, whether in their jobs, in factories, on farms or sick in hospital.  They all depend to a great extent on the ESB. Anything we say here to emphasise that are words well used.</P>
      <P>No one wants to suggest that the right to strike should be removed, that people would not continue to have a right to improvement and betterment of their conditions of employment; but this industry is so important that it ought not to be beyond the bounds of possibility for all the people concerned &mdash;workers, management, the Government&mdash;to come to an agreement which would ensure that people employed in the industry have reasonable and proper access to betterment of their conditions of employment.  As a result of that the public will not be deprived of this absolutely essential service for which they are paying well.  I thoroughly endorse what Senator Quinlan has said on that.  It needs to be said.  We ought to consider the matter very seriously not when a strike is imminent but when things are running smoothly, so ensuring that they run smoothly in the future.</P>
      <P>It is only right to welcome this Bill. In the past the ESB have done a great job for this country.  It is correct to say that there is probably no other country as well served with power in rural areas as we are.  The country owes a debt of gratitude to the ESB and the people who have worked so diligently in that body over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is still, unfortunately, a number <Col N="993" /> of people who have not been supplied with current.  Perhaps it is easy to say that they are in very isolated areas. Some of them are not so isolated.  Some of them are depending on the goodwill of their neighbours or on the lack of common sense of their neighbours who did not in the past accept power and even still may not be inclined to.  That rules out people who were anxious to have it in the past, who are still anxious to have it and who up to now have not been able to get it.</P>
    <P>I know that very many of those problems have been solved.  It was suggested that after next March we would still have 2 per cent of the people without current.  It is not a big amount but it is big if you happen to be one of the people concerned.  There are some who are concerned in that way.  I know some of them are isolated in the sense that they will not continue to be occupied there, but there are some places where business will be carried on, particularly at farm level, for the foreseeable future.  It is not a practical proposition to charge them the huge amount they would have to pay to be connected to the ESB, bearing in mind that the ESB have been subsidised over the years by all of the taxpayers to supply to less isolated areas than those. Those few people who are still without electricity have paid their fair share of that taxation.  When we have got it down to 2 per cent we will have to have another look at it to see what further can be done to alleviate the hardships that some people have had to endure for so long.  I am sure the Minister will give those few people who will be left his very sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>As one Senator already has said, the days of cheap fuel and cheap food are gone.  That is true.  They are gone for a number of reasons.  Perhaps up to now people did not consider what were, in fact, the necessities of life.  They were something they should have to provide themselves with.  They felt that the onus was on the public at large to provide them with the necessities of life.  This was a wrong outlook to have taken. Those countries and those people who are producing the raw materials have become more alive to their importance in the world and they are tending now <Col N="994" /> to charge a more realistic rate for what they have to offer.  Those things are food, fuel and energy, and we will have to go along with those things.</P>
    <P>I welcome the suggestion by the Minister that the ESB propose to use our native resources to the full.  Very many of those native resources that we had were not economic to use in the past because of costs of imports not being as high as they are.  Many of them can be used now.  A very big proportion of our country is covered by bog.  Those are areas where there is very little employment.  If they are developed, and I sincerely hope they will be, it will give very necessary employment in those areas not alone for the time they are being used for the production of energy in the form of fuel but in the years to come after that when those areas can be used for agricultural purposes.  They will add considerably to our pool of agricultural land.</P>
    <P>Referring once again to rural electrification, I think a good job has been done and, as I have said already, most houses have been connected.  It is true, though, to say that at the time the connections were made, people were looking for very little more than light on the farm and light in their houses.  We have advanced a long way since then, and on farms in particular there is need for very much more power now than there was then.  In very many cases the power that is available on farms is not sufficient to meet the modern needs with regard to milking machines, coolers and all the various equipment such as water pumps that you have on farms.</P>
    <P>I know the ESB do things as well as they can to meet the demand as it occurs; but it is accepted that when farmers cannot get a piece of modern equipment because they do not have the power on the farm, they use this as an excuse for not getting it.  They do a disservice to themselves and to the nation.  The push should come from the other side.  We should have the ESB in a position to push sales.  If we had two or three ESBs and we had competition within the trade I do not think anybody would be left in a position to say: &ldquo;Well, you know I cannot get this because I have not got power.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> The ESB should be in a position to go out and sell current, and I do not mean to waste current.  It has been said here already that we have forgotten about the days of the shortages and we have forgotten that we ought to economise. We ought to economise certainly, we ought not to waste, but we ought to use power where it can be used productively, and certainly on the farm it can be used productively in modern farming methods.  It should be more readily available on farms and the ESB should try in so far as they can to set themselves to make power more readily available more quickly and to push the sale of that power on farms.  It would be in everybody's interests if this were done.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say much more on this subject but at the same time I should like once again to emphasise what Senator Quinlan finished on, that is, labour relations within the ESB. This is important.  Everybody in the country depends on it to a greater or lesser degree.  An extra special effort should be made by all of the people concerned in the industry and the Government to ensure that strikes will not happen in the future.  When a strike happens it has to be fixed&mdash; people have to come together and iron out their problems.  In this particular industry the problems ought to be ironed out before strike action is taken and I am sure the Government would have the goodwill and support of everyone in the country if they could ensure that this will happen in the future.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to welcome this Bill and to compliment the ESB on having done a good job over the years.  I am sure that, with the sanction of money that is available to them now and with the goodwill of the people and the Government towards fixing good labour relations, we can confidently look forward to progress in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, take this opportunity to welcome the Bill and to agree that extra capital should be made available: £700 million might be sufficient now but in the distant future it may not be sufficient.  I imagine that if the Minister had to come back here after five or six years, another Bill <Col N="996" /> would be welcomed increasing that amount.</P>
      <P>I should like to support the contributions of Senators Whyte and Quinlan and to speak for just a few minutes on the strike situation.  Over the past number of years, as Senator Quinlan has said, the nation has been held up to ransom by the strikes that have taken place by a few people.  Maybe ten or 12 people held up the country to ransom and this situation should not be allowed to happen again.  I would suggest to the Minister that he would ask representatives of the ESB to sit down to formulate some kind of a board within the ESB and that all the unions within the ESB should be represented on that board so that consultation would take place immediately the strike was introduced. Consultation is necessary at all times. If anything is happening that would create a danger, then consultation should take place.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour is to introduce a Bill to help unions to amalgamate.  I agree that this should be done as soon as possible.  There are too many small unions at present.  I should like the Minister for Transport and Power to make known the wishes of Senators to the Minister for Labour to have this Bill introduced speedily. We should have larger unions which could meet at Labour Court level to discuss their problems before a strike takes place.  The cost of a strike cannot be estimated; it must be costly on the State and on those concerned. If there is a strike in the ESB, the aged and infirm suffer most.  During consultation this should be brought to the notice of the proper authorities.  Those people deserve all the assistance they can get and this is one way in which to do it.  Let them consult and communicate with each other and then there will be fewer strikes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the workers in the ESB for their great work after the storm during January last.  Within a few weeks we were back to normal. Anyone who travelled through the country, especially in the south, during that time could not imagine we would be back to normal in so short a time. <Col N="997" /> These workers are to be congratulated on their efforts.  They worked night and day to restore power to the country.</P>
    <P>Before speaking on the subject of supplying electricity to rural areas, I should like to state that it is time the ESB insisted on having posters removed from ESB poles throughout the country. In my area during the local government elections posters were put up by each party and the town was a disgrace. Within two days all posters were taken down by ESB workers.  I congratulate them even though I am a member of one of the parties involved in the election.  I hope the same will happen in the future as towns are disgraced by posters stuck on poles and left there until the ESB eventually remove them. It is more difficult to take them down after weeks than to take them down the day after they are put up.  I should like to ask the Minister to look into this matter with a view to getting the ESB to have posters removed sooner.</P>
    <P>I must again congratulate the ESB on the canvass being carried out on rural electrification, but I am not totally in agreement.  Every house in the country should be canvassed even if it is difficult to reach.  Everyone in the country is entitled to equal opportunities.  People in out-of-the-way places are being penalised.  Old age pensioners in the towns and cities get free electricity and television.  Those living in the remote areas do not get these amenities.  Even if it costs the State some extra millions of pounds we should get the opportunity to help those people.  After next March only 2 per cent of householders will be without electricity.  Some of these may refuse to have electricity in their homes but they will be few.  When rural electrification was first introduced many people refused it because they did not realise its value.  This is not the case now and all those who are canvassed should be told of the advantages to be derived rom electricity.</P>
    <P>There is some confusion in the dairy industry in connection with the extra charge being imposed for the installation of extra electrical fittings needed for the milking of cows, to cool the milk in bulk tanks and all the extra work involved.  There has been a canvass <Col N="998" /> by representatives of the creameries of the farmers for quality milk.  The only method for producing quality milk is to have water, cooling and the right method of producing this milk.  It is not possible to have these three things without the required amount of electric current.  I have been approached on a number of occasions to use whatever influence I have with the ESB, which is very little, to get extra electrical supplies into those houses so that the farmers may have the full benefit for their produce.  More than one-third of the farmers are not getting the full price for their produce because it is not quality produce.  The reason for this in the majority of cases is because they have not the proper facilities.  They should have the means to cool the milk and hold it over until it is collected.</P>
    <P>The ESB have a part to play while the rural electrification canvass is taking place.  There should be an inspection at the same time of the areas which have already got electricity.  With the representations that have already been made by the societies involved and with the representations that have been made by the people in the area, the officers of the ESB in those areas should know by now what is needed to allow the farmers to get the full benefit of their produce and the State to export quality products.</P>
    <P>We are now in a situation where products can be sold at a maximum price.  Cheese is getting a price that we never believed it would make.  Quality products make quality cheese.  You cannot sell anything but a quality cheese.  The market is there to take up all the cheese that can be made, but unless we can give the product required by the wholesaler we will lose out.  Not alone the farmer but the State itself will lose out.  If we could export sufficient to improve our balance of payments position and get money into the State for reinvestment we would be on the right road.  The only way to do that is to give us the electric power needed.</P>
    <P>I should also like to take this opportunity of thanking the Minister for what he achieved during the oil crisis.  Representations were made to him during the oil crisis by the concerns producing perishable products to ensure <Col N="999" /> that they would get the required amount of fuel.  He guaranteed them that they would get it.  I should like to thank him for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter of the extension of the capital of the Electricity Supply Board is something which, we all accept, is vital to the economy of the nation.  It is something which we look forward to as a means of enabling an expansion in the generating capacity of the ESB stations.  The Minister refers to the possible use of lower-grade fuels, natural gas and nuclear power for the purpose of generating electricity.  In a nation as small as ours, so stripped of its rural population where people are rushing to live in the cities and reneging the call to rural life, where they are fleeing from the countryside to congregate in Dublin, Cork, Galway and the other larger centres of population, it would behove all of us to look seriously at utilising electricity to bring about a more even balance of population, which would be more acceptable from a national point of view.</P>
      <P>No better means could be found towards that end than if the Minister were to have an effort made in the counties of Longford, Roscommon and Leitrim to harness the coal and peat resources there.  The peat resources in Longford, Roscommon and Westmeath should be used for the generation of electricity on a more extended and expanding scale than hitherto.  I know there is a generating station in Roscommon which gives a considerable amount of employment.  It has an output comparable to that of the peatfired station at Lanesboro.  In that area of rural Ireland an effort is being made to utilise our natural resources to give the people increased electricity supplies. The coal in the Arigna area and other areas of north Roscommon and west Leitrim is of a quality that was not as acceptable for commercial use as the imported product.  The Minister should look at the extent to which he and the Government could develop the use of this coal, create more employment and provide electricity generating plants in that area, making full use of a first-class natural product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1000" /> We have to meet the electricity needs of the teeming thousands in our centres of population, but we owe an equal obligation to the young pair who want to found a home in rural Ireland. It is tragic to have to comment that the ESB place an advertisement in a local paper indicating that current can be extended to a particular rural area on a subsidised basis, but if you are not in at the stage when this subsidised extension is being provided the cost of bringing electricity any distance or of procuring a connection at all is prohibitive.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the ESB, but this is a reality of life.  We should have constant consideration, and rightly so, for the thousands in the cities.  We should have similar consideration for the young people in rural Ireland.  Young people are getting married every year as well as the year the ESB decide to have electricity subsidised for a particular area.  It would be a more appropriate method if the Government were to make a certain subsidy available at all times in rural Ireland for the connection of new homes.  We should take a very serious look at this.  I appeal to the Minister to recognise that we must have water, sewage and a house itself.  Subsidies are paid by the Government. There are subsidies for roads.  But unless you come in on the tide in regard to the ESB current connections, you must pay through the nose for everything.  Today more than ever some help is needed.</P>
    <P>Since 1924 the Electricity Supply Board have been an ever-growing factor in the progress of our industry.  At this stage the ESB should not be curtailed or inhibited in any way.  The further development of electricity, whether generated from gas, nuclear power, coal, or peat, is to be welcomed.  It should be fostered and advanced.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government are to be complimented on the Bill. However, the ESB are not the prerogative of this Government.  Previous Governments have had the same interest in the ESB and I hope every Government to come will continue to have an interest in developing electricity for the benefit of agriculture and industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope that the fruits of the proposals in the Bill will have the same good results as have been <Col N="1001" /> attendant on the Electricity Supply Board's efforts up to now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation of the constructive suggestions put forward and of the recognition by all sides of the House of the value of the ESB to the economy and of how important the ESB have been to the economy since their foundation. By accepting this Bill, we are looking forward ten or 12 years, when it is hoped this £250 million will be spent on further development of the ESB.</P>
      <P>From time to time everybody is irritated by the size of the ESB bill, perhaps by the quality of workmanship, or maybe by the way we are treated in the ESB offices.  However we all appreciate that the stream which bore our advancing economy towards the sea was the ESB.  We all floated on that. As Senator Kilbride said, without the ESB it would have been impossible to make advances in the fields of industry, agriculture and the economy generally.</P>
      <P>Rural electrification, which has been a source of irritation, has been referred to by a few Senators.  It has been enormously complex in its planning and execution.  It has also been enormously expensive to the Exchequer.  As I said in my opening speech, it has cost the Exchequer and the taxpayers £21 million.  We are not finished with this phase of the rural electrification scheme. As I said in my speech, in the last financial year, that is up to 31st March, 1974, it cost £4 million to pay the subsidy on rural electrification.  In a small country this is no small sum.  It is quite a mark of commitment on behalf of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, as Senator Kilbride said, it is not the prerogative of any one Government. It has been a commitment of all Governments to bring modern amenities&mdash;the first of which is electricity&mdash;to as large a volume of people as possible. When the rural electrification scheme comes to a close at the end of March, 1975, there will be only 2 per cent of the people without electricity.  Senator Whyte referred to this when he said it was unique in Europe, and it is.  It <Col N="1002" /> is unique in Europe or in any country that 98 per cent of houses are wired for electricity.  We do not appreciate that at times.  We do not appreciate the necessary commitment on behalf of the Government to provide the money to subsidise the ESB to instal electricity in this large number of houses.  We do not appreciate the amount of planning required at all levels of the ESB to see that this is carried through.  We do not appreciate the amount of physical work that had to be done.  We do not appreciate the acceptance by urban taxpayers of the necessity to do this work and their willingness to provide the money to see that their rural neighbours can enjoy the same facilities as they do.</P>
    <P>I have asked the ESB&mdash;I expect to have the report before the end of this month or perhaps later&mdash;to try to identify for me what problems will remain in regard to the 2 per cent. Senator Kilbride and, I think, Senators Butler and Brennan referred to what will be one of the problems: the high cost of installing electricity in new houses in what are closed areas.  Another problem will be the connection of existing houses.  As the rural electrification scheme went back over areas again and again, sometimes three and four times, the houses that were left were those in the most remote areas and which, therefore, cost the most money to connect.  Next year we will be left with the most difficult and most expensive houses to connect.  These are some of the problems that will arise, I do not know what the others are.  I have asked the ESB to try to identify them and to present a report to me as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to what Senator Brennan said about &ldquo;selling all his life&rdquo;. He would know the kind of trouble he would get into if he sold below cost for long periods.  This is something the ESB cannot do either.  They must provide rural electrification and yet balance their expenses with their revenue.  Otherwise they would get into the same trouble as an ordinary business would.  They must, by law, balance their books year by year.  They must fix their revenue to meet their expenditure, taking one year with another.  It is <Col N="1003" /> something we shall have to look at again.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell referred to the figure of £7 million&mdash;I am not sure if he is right&mdash;for the establishment of Ardnacrusha. I would have thought it was even less than that.  The criterion and the form of book-keeping for the ESB at the time of their foundation in 1927 may have been all right then, but with the much vaster, more complex and sophisticated accounting methods employed today we would have to look at that figure again.</P>
    <P>The ESB are a very complex, far-flung and many-faceted organisation.  They have to build their own generating plant. They must generate the electricity, distribute it and make the connections for it.  In former times the ESB had to and still do encourage people to use the electricity by establishing and stocking retail premises to supply electrical appliances.  I do not think we can ask such an organisation to balance their revenue against expenditure in one year. There will have to be a longer period of time allowed and a more flexible approach to the ESB finance in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Dolan referred to the ESB as advancing the interests of the ordinary people of Ireland.  That sums up the whole story of the ESB.  It, more than any other organisation, more than the road programme or tourism, has brought modern living to people in remote areas.  I know houses which are anything up to 30 miles from any place which, even at its most flattering might be called a town and they are connected to electricity.  They have milking parlours, televisions and telephones.  This is a most unusual situation in the most advanced countries of Europe.  We should be thankful to Governments which have seen the necessity to provide money for it and to the ESB who have provided the connections.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators made reference to our overdependence on oil in the energy crisis.  I cannot say, if I had been Minister for Transport and Power when this dependence was increased from 25 per cent in 1960 to 75 per cent in 1974, that I would have made any other decision or have given any other advice to the ESB.  Senator Markey referred to <Col N="1004" /> this.  What else would you have done, with oil being almost given away by the oil-producing nations for years at prices which made it cheaper for us to import our oil, not through the Suez Canal which was closed, from the Gulf States and generate electricity at a price which was cheaper than the cost of generating electricity from our own turf resources with generating stations in the middle of Ireland?  What else would a Government or an electricity authority do in those circumstances, but to continue to buy oil.  The benefits of cheap electricity for industrial expansion and as a low-cost fuel for export manufacturing industry was of inestimable value to the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>It was perhaps, as Senator Markey said, a pity we did not have hindsight. There was also the consideration that turf bogs are thought to have a limited life and as a reserve fuel it was necessary not to use them too quickly and exhaust this valuable and as was thought only native source of fuel.  At the time 1 per cent of our electricity generation was done by coal.  There was no known gas or oil on the Continental Shelf.  In those circumstances I believe the Government did the right thing in encouraging the ESB to buy oil as cheaply as possible.</P>
    <P>Up to last October the ESB very successfully played one supplier against another throughout world markets, without entering into contracts with one or the other, and succeeded in getting oil at a price of £7 a tonne.  This is roughly one-fifth of the present equivalent. They were paying about £4 per tonne below the going rate then by having very good contracts to offer and by getting suppliers to go into competition with each other in order to have the electricity board in Ireland as one of their customers.</P>
    <P>That situation has of course changed now.  The ESB must pay a very much more realistic price on the world market now.  This is why the Government allowed the ESB to put the fuel surcharge on every bill in the hope that the price of oil might drop, but I would not be optimistic about that.  The oil producing nations do not need to sell their product now.  They have realised its value for political reasons and as a <Col N="1005" /> source of energy for the whole world. They know the panic which can be generated throughout the world in big industrial nations when this source of supply is threatened.  They know they have sufficient cash earned in the last six months and therefore they do not have to bring down the price.</P>
    <P>What may bring down the price in some years hence is if alternative sources of energy are available in other places such as the North Sea oil for England and, le cúnamh Dé, in the Celtic Sea. Certainly a gas find in the Celtic Sea, though small, is significant in value, but it is not the answer to our dependence on oil as a source of energy in the future.  As Senator Russell said, we will still have to import vast quantities of oil.</P>
    <P>Senator Butler said he hoped I would come back here in some years' time looking for another £250 million, I would be welcome.  There are two reasons why we should come back looking for more money.  One is because the rate of inflation is such that the £250 million will not last as long as it is anticipated it will.  I should not like to have to come back for that reason. The other reason for which I should like to come back is that this economy will advance at such a rate that there is a necessity to keep on installing more generating plants to supply the energy to run the industries, thus necessitating my return to provide more capital for the ESB to expand.</P>
    <P>I cannot see the fuel charge on the electricity bills being removed for some time.  I do not think the price of oil will drop to allow us to do that.  This is a shock for consumers.  I am extremely sorry it had to happen.  The price of our electricity is still competitive.  We are still comewhat below other countries in Europe.  However it is still a shock for people when they see a bill with a fuel surcharge which is sometimes 35 per cent or 40 per cent of the total bill. It would have been unrealistic of the Government not to have allowed the ESB to put this charge on the bills.  The ESB were buying oil last September/ October for £7 per tonne.  They are now paying £35 per tonne.  To pretend the choice was (a) not to let them buy it or <Col N="1006" /> say they should wait until it became cheaper would mean, with our dependence on oil, no electricity; or (b) ask those using it to pay for it and hope that people would conserve their use of energy and bring their own bills down.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt we have been profligate in our use of energy of all sorts.  Centrally-heated houses with the windows open and the temperature at 75 degrees is not a sensible use of an extremely expensive and what was then a scarce fuel, neither is having radiators on in rooms which are not used.  On several occasions I have advocated ways of saving money by the more sensible use of energy resources.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan said he thought we had forgotten our conservation policy.  That is not so.  The conservation policy initiated by the Department of Transport and Power last winter, in conjunction with the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, has been and continues to be most successful.  Many industries&mdash;it is primarily aimed at the industrial sector &mdash;have asked for advice from experts from the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards as to how they could reduce costs.  I quoted an example in the Dáil last week, and I repeat it here now, of an industry about which I was told by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  The Institute were able to point out to a modern plant how to reduce their costs and energy by 10 per cent.  If that could be done in a modern, recently-established industry, you can imagine the dramatic savings that could be achieved in older, less efficient, less well-organised industries.</P>
    <P>This scheme is still there.  There are grants available from this Department, the Industrial Development Authority and from the Institute for Research and Standards to industries to help them more efficiently to use their energy.  If Senators have influence with industries who do not know of these schemes, who are not availing of them or of advice from the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards on the conservation of energy, they should bring them to their notice.  It is very important for the industries own sake that their costs should be lowered as it helps them <Col N="1007" /> export.  It is important to the country because the less energy they use the lower will be our importation bill for oil.  This will help our balance of payments problem which is going to be severe this year.  There is no point in hiding this.  Because of the increased price of oil we shall have to meet a very much larger bill for energy sources in this current financial year, from April to December.</P>
    <P>It will require all the efforts of the Government to help to balance this as much as possible.  Because of the crisis, traumatic conditions have been experienced in Great Britain and Europe which are our principal export markets. The lack of confidence in some of these markets may interfere with our exports.  Tourism, cannot be looked at as enthusiastically as perhaps two or three months ago.  We want our credits, such as conservation, on the other side to help our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to how successful the ESB have been with regard to planning.  The figures were quoted by Senator Quinlan when he said that a growth rate of 10 per cent per annum means a doubling of the capacity every seven or eight years. Any variation on this, of course, throws the mechanism out of order as far as the ESB are concerned.  They have been significantly successful in being able to provide, when it was wanted, sufficient electricity for the country.  This showed quite remarkable foresight and planning on their part. This is one of the reasons why they are now asking for and want to establish nuclear energy stations, even though they will not come on stream until 1980 or 1982.  The first is to be a 600 megawatt station.  It will take up the growth in demand between now and then with the other things that are planned.  It is geared to co-operation between the ESB and the Northern Ireland Electricity Board.  Senator Dolan, Senator Brennan and Senator Markey referred to this.  That co-operation is there already: there is an arrangement.  The nuclear energy station in the Republic is designed and timed to come on stream first to serve both parts of the country through the <Col N="1008" /> interconnecting link with a second one being established in the North.</P>
    <P>The reverse procedure will operate in the 1990s with another station being established in the South.  They have been planning together and connecting their two programmes of generation establishment to see that the whole 32 counties is provided for on a proper basis.  This, perhaps, is something of which people were unaware but it is very valuable both from the point of view of the ESB and the Northern Ireland Electricity Board to have this co-operation.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell, Senator Quinlan and Senator Murray referred to the nuclear energy station at Carnsore Point.  Senator Quinlan said that perhaps we could raise capital in Europe and at the same time arrange markets for the export of electricity.  This is an attractive idea.  The amount of capital involved in a nuclear energy station and the amount of employment it gives are very much out of balance.  If we could raise the kind of capital required to double the size, when initially it will cost between £100 million and £150 million, from the point of view of employment inside the country we would get very much better value.  I agree that there is a number of very suitable sites.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if we could get the money.  If we could borrow money at all we should try to borrow it to establish industries here where there would be a higher employment content than there would be in a nuclear energy station. Of course there is still a loss in the transmission of electricity between one point and another.  This is one of the reasons why the ESB are keener to establish a station at the Carnsore Point area than at a point in the west where the transmission distances are greater.  This has not been cured yet. I look forward to the day, for many reasons, when people will be able to buy six packets of electricity and take them home with them.  This would remove the poles and the wires.  The snag about electricity is that it cannot be stored.  You must have enough <Col N="1009" /> generation capacity to meet peak demands between 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock in the day.  This is the value of Turlough Hill, as referred to by Senator Brennan and Senator Dolan.</P>
      <P>Turlough Hill adds to the generating capacity during the day by dropping the water through the turbines and generating electricity.  That is then pumped up into the reservoir at night when the demand for electricity is not so great.  It then generates more electricity by being dropped down at the peak demand time.  If somebody could invent a way of storing electricity it would halve the necessity for generating plants. I am afraid that day is a long way off. Somebody will probably come up with an idea.  I do not think I will ever see that day.  At the moment I must deal with things as they are and not as I would like them to be.</P>

      <P>I shall have a look at it.  My first reaction to what you said, Senator, was that if we could get money to invest in industry here, it would provide more employment.  Also, there is a loss in transmission and there would be the technical problems of getting electricity to the European grid. I will discuss it with the ESB.  My first, very amateurish layman's outlook on it is that if I could get that kind of money, £150 million, I could establish a number of industries.</P>

      <P>Thank you for the idea, anyway, Senator.  Senator Kerrigan again came back to the point about prices and ESB bills.  Night storage heaters were offered by the ESB over a number of years to customers for the same reason.  If electricity could be sold during the night, that helps to pay for the plant.  There was a certain limit however, below which they could not go, a certain basic cost for electricity which had to be met at night storage rates.  When the surcharge on oil commenced, that was a basic charge also which was subject to monitoring and to policing by the National Prices Commission in a retrospective way.  This had to be applied at a flat rate over all consumption.  We could not differentiate between electricity used at night, which was at a basic rate and that used in the daytime at a profitable rate.  Even so, the cost of night storage heating was much cheaper than the cost of other forms of heating or even electricity used during the day.</P>
      <P>It was suggested there should be a subsidy to people in local authority houses, which are centrally heated by electricity.  This at first consideration would seem to be necessary, but there is no reason to suppose that everybody in a local authority house is in more need of subsidy than those in suburban housing estates who are finding the charges for electric central heating just as expensive as people in local authority houses.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why only those with central heating generated by electricity should be subsidised.  Why not gas also? The price of gas has risen enormously as well.  The cost of central heating oils has also risen enormously.  We then go into the whole merry-go-round of subsidy and where do we stop?  These charges are extremely high.  I regret them very much.  I wish I could promise the House that they would be coming off in the near future.  Regrettably, I do not.  We will have to live with higher charges for energy.  We are finished with cheap food and cheap fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Whyte and Senator Butler made a point about electricity for bulk <Col N="1011" /> milk tanks.  Originally the only need for electricity in rural areas was for lighting. Since then there has been a demand for milking parlours, for cooling tanks and so on.  Appliances of this sort encouraged&mdash;and in many cases grants were given by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the local creameries&mdash;increased use of electricity; but, unfortunately, growth in demand for such equipment and the final stages of rural electrification coincided.  This placed a tremendous strain on the ESB workers who had to instal this equipment. Whereas some of the equipment is on single-phase wiring which was already connected to houses there was the necessity to put in transformers to strengthen that supply to meet the demand.  Farmers did not realise this. They ordered the bulk tanks and had them installed and then went to the ESB and asked them to connect them. Things did not work that way, particularly as the rural electrification was going on.</P>
    <P>It would have been better if there had been more consultation.  This is happening now because the ESB are engaged in discussion with An Foras Talúntais, the Dairy Industrial Technical Study and Working Party, ICMSA and the IFA to try to contain this explosion in bulk milk tanks so that farmers will not be misled into thinking that a bulk tank ordered today will be installed and working tomorrow.  For the benefit of the ESB, the creameries and the farmers themselves there will be co-ordinated efforts to see that the ESB are ready to provide the power when the farming community instal the cooler or whatever equipment it may be.  In the past there has been some delay in connecting these links.  I would hope, with the realisation on everybody's part that there is a certain amount of planning needed, those delays will be eliminated in the future.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered all the points raised by the Senators.  I should like to thank them for their reception of this Bill and particularly for their appreciation of the ESB and the important part it plays in all our lives and in the industrial development of this country.</P>

    <Title>Export Promotion (Amendment) Bill, 1974  (  Certified Money Bill ):   Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal purpose of the Bill is to increase the statutory limit of the amount of grants which may be made to Córas Tráchtála to enable that body to continue the work of promoting, assisting and developing Irish exports.</P>
      <P>The Export Promotion Act, 1959, under which Córas Tráchtála were established, fixed at £1 million the total amount of grants which might be made to the board out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Subsequent Export Promotion Acts raised this limit.  The latest one, in 1971, raised it to £15 million and the present Bill proposes to raise it to £25 million.</P>
      <P>It is 15 years since the Export Promotion Act of 1959 set up Córas Tráchtála as a statutory board, taking over the functions of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta.  During that period Córas Tráchtála have made a notable contribution to developments which have brought total exports from the level of £130 million in 1959 to almost £870 million in 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little need for me to emphasise to this House that moneys made available to Córas Tráchtála are well spent.  Senators are well aware of the vital importance of the board's task and of the efficiency of their operations. As industrial activity expanded in volume and range over the years Córas Tráchtála's operations were extended to provide exporters with the aids and services they needed to assist them in opening up new markets and consolidating their position in existing ones. The board have been quick to respond by the provision of new services as they saw exporters' needs for them developing, and they keep those services <Col N="1013" /> under constant surveillance to ensure that they cater for changing trends in marketing.</P>
    <P>While exports to all our markets are showing sustained annual increases, those to the original six EEC member states show the greatest rate of increase &mdash;up by 75 per cent in value terms last year compared with 1972.  In addition Irish exporters have begun to aim at new targets in Japan, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Australia and South America.  Ireland is also concerned in the movement towards free trade between the Community and other nations, and is progressively participating in a trading complex involving the EEC and more than 90 other countries. While all of these developments manifestly signify further opportunities for Irish exporters, they also create the need for an increasing degree of marketing intelligence and other facilities.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála are playing a very important role in this area.  In addition to the many and varied services provided at home, an invaluable source of assistance to exporters is the overseas office network of Córas Tráchtála which is at their disposal.  Córas Tráchtála now have 15 overseas offices&mdash;in Britain, USA, Canada, Australia, Lebanon, France, Austria, Germany, USSR, Belgium, Italy and Japan, with plans advanced for a further office in Copenhagen.</P>
    <P>All of these developments create opportunities for exporters but they also call for an ever-increasing level of expenditure on the part of Córas Tráchtála, especially as they are subject to inflationary pressures at home and abroad.  From its establishment in 1959 to 31st March of this year the aggregate of payments to the board by way of grant-in-aid amounted to £13,800,885, which left a balance of £1,199,115 out of the existing statutory limit of £15 million.  This is less than the board's financial requirements up to the end of the current financial year, which amount to £1,755,000.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Senators will agree that Córas Tráchtála must have adequate funds for their work, on which successful export promotion <Col N="1014" /> depends so much.  I confidently recommend an increase of £10 million in the statutory limit on the grants which may be allocated to Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I fully realise the important role that Córas Tráchtála play in the development of the national economy.  The Minister is looking for £10 million extra to ensure that they will be able to carry on the work they have already in progress.  Everybody must realise that, no matter how excellent or efficient our workers are, no matter what amount of expertise they possess, no matter how good our raw materials are, if we are unable to sell in a competitive market at a price that will compensate our workers and those promoting these industries it will be useless for us to continue in existence. It is true that many people could produce a variety of quality goods, could sell such products abroad but the price would probably not be up to our expectations and we would therefore, not make much of a success of it. It was for that reason that the Government in days gone by set up Córas Tráchtála, a body that have rendered a very good account of themselves.  The Minister mentioned in his speech that they have premises in some 15 countries and that is certainly to be commended because there is no salesman or no method of selling as good as having people actually on the spot meeting customers, establishing personal contacts and so selling our manufactured goods at a good price.  They are also probably able to make contacts with industrialists who might feed back into this country some of their expertise.</P>
      <P>It is a great compliment to our workers and to our industrialists that we, as a young nation are able to produce goods of a quality to sell in competition with many of these old-established industrialised countries.  It is a great tribute to those who established industries in this country and to the thinking behind that effort that we now have an industrial arm and we are able to benefit our workers and the economy as a whole by exporting such large quantities of manufactured goods in a competitive market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1015" /> There is something which I know is agitating the minds of many people in this country at present and it may, in one way or another, be connected with Córas Tráchtála and that is the price which obtains at present abroad for some of our agricultural produce. There has been a complete flop in price in the last 12 months for our cattle abroad.  I know this is aggravating to the farmers: it is something that must be tackled immediately if the farmers are not to face complete ruin.</P>
    <P>With regard to milk and butter and various other merchandise produced on the farms we have been doing reasonably well but so far as the animals themselves are concerned&mdash;and that is part of our economy&mdash;somebody must be at fault somewhere.  I do not know whether one can lay the blame on Córas Tráchtála, on the Minister himself or on those who represent us in Brussels but it is definitely true that the cattle position at present is chaotic and that very much of the economy of this country is completely tied to it.  If things continue as they are, with the scarcity of fuel and with low prices for produce there may be a drop in our milk supplies and consequently a drop in our processed foods and dried milk, milk powder and in butter.  This would be a calamity.  Thanks to Córas Tráchtála and their excellent salesmen abroad, we established a good name, not alone in England, where we had been the traditional suppliers of sausages, bacon and agricultural goods, but we also established in Europe markets for our butter and other dairy products. It would be a calamity if for any reason we lost these markets that were so hard to obtain.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála have done well over the years.  I would ask them to interest themselves in this matter.  We have built up an industrial arm in this country and although many of our industries for a long time have been only limping along, we know that a breakthrough was made in recent years and that they have improved their techniques through expertise and education, through the vocational schools and regional colleges of technology.  We know that end of it is reasonably good but we know that the agricultural end of it is certainly not <Col N="1016" /> what it should be and agriculture being our main industry it is one that Córas Tráchtála will have to keep a very sharp eye on.  They are asking here for £10 million.</P>
    <P>Some mention has been made regarding free trade between EEC countries and the rest of the world.  While we would all like a fair amount of facilities so far as free trade is concerned, and be able to get every article as cheaply as we possibly could, nevertheless we have to be rather sceptical regarding opening all the outlets and throwing ourselves completely into the mainstream of world competition.  In the last 12 months we have the experience of what has happened inside the Common Market countries and I fear that even greater calamities would await us if we ventured out into the free-for-all market.</P>
    <P>I welcome the operations of Córas Tráchtála in the 15 centres mentioned here.  There is a great amount of goodwill in the United States, Canada and South America for our products.  The benefits derived should be channelled to the producers of this country.  A former Cathaoirleach of the Seanad&mdash;go ndéana Dia trócaire air&mdash;told me that in Canada on one occasion he saw on sale at 98 dollars an Aran sweater that had been knitted here.  The cost of manufacture was £4 4s.  There must have been a slip-up to have such an exorbitant profit on goods without any benefit to the country of manufacture.</P>
    <P>A good deal can be accomplished by Córas Tráchtála by encouraging many of our people abroad to ask in the shops for products manufactured here.  The large numbers of our people in Britain could do a great service to their country if they bought Irish products such as butter and alcohol.  The same applies to America.  Many of those who are so patriotic on Saint Patrick's Day during parades would do more for their country by taking home a bottle of &ldquo;Paddy&rdquo;. This would boost our economy by helping the distillers and the farmers who grow the barley.</P>
    <P>We have many products of which we can be proud.  Those who have travelled abroad know that our shoes, clothing, whiskey and so on can compete with any <Col N="1017" /> article manufactured abroad.  The Irish workers while they may not have the same opportunities adapt in a very short time when given the chance.</P>
    <P>There are other articles produced here which should be publicised such as Beleek china, hand-knitted garments and other decorative articles of Irish design.  When presenting souvenirs to tourists or when exporting them we should ensure that they are manufactured in this country.  It is detrimental to Irish manufacture to have &ldquo;Déanta sa tSeapáin&rdquo; written on a supposedly Irish article.  We should be more patriotic in our outlook and those going abroad could dress in Irish manufactured clothing.  In other countries people ask for food manufactured in their country.</P>
    <P>Various Governments have fought hard down the years to ensure that industries would be attracted to our country.  We have just passed the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1974 and have spoken of the help received from the ESB in spreading industries throughout the country.  We have, as the Minister has stated, an excellent team of dedicated and efficient personnel abroad working to sell our exports.  I, on behalf of my party, compliment Córas Tráchtála on the efforts they have made towards helping our economy abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and should like to pay a tribute to Córas Tráchtála for their excellent work.  I suggest to the Minister that perhaps Cóas Tráchtála could be the vehicle to make the teachers in business, commerce and marketing in the regional technical colleges and in the universities conscious of the necessity for both quality and competitiveness in our products.  This could be done if Córas Tráchtála had a policy of taking on staff from those institutions for tours of duty of say, six months or one year or of recruting them on a leave basis. They could serve six months or a year in Córas Tráchtála, work abroad, and this would ensure they got something of real benefit which they in turn would communicate to the pupils when they returned.  It would be a two-way <Col N="1018" /> process and they could assist with home promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, from the sense of <i>élan</i> and <i>esprit</i> which exists inside Córas Tráchtála that the welcome and good wishes which have been expressed here are important to them.  We take for granted sometimes those who work well and hard.  All who do a good job need some praise and in this case I am pleased they got it.  It is merited.</P>
      <P>I should like to comment briefly on some of the points raised.  We are at one on the need to sell abroad as well as at home.  I was interested in Senator Dolan's statement about the value of the large number of establishments&mdash; now 15 and soon to be 16 with the opening of the office in Copenhagen&mdash; which Córas Tráchtála operate around the world.  In the recent difficulties regarding the supply of raw materials we had what one might call a lash-up temporary organisation made up of the Confederation of Irish Industry, the IDA and the CTT, both of which have an international network of offices to obtain for Irish industries scarce raw materials.  This was put together rapidly on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and it worked very well.  It is another source of pride.</P>
      <P>As an indication of my estimation of the value of the 15 offices to Irish exports I have calculated that during the period of 16 months in office I have personally visited eight of these offices. I have seen the personnel and I know the great spirit which exists and the sense of the quality of Irish goods. They do not have to sell world-wide on anything other than quality.  This reflects in their attitude and vigour and the way in which they do their work. In the five years from 1969 to 1973, while our total exports increased to nearly £870 million, more than doubling, our industrial exports in that period increased from £102 million to £420 million.  In that period of five years they trebled.  This is a magnificent performance and it has brought us to the situation where industrial exports are very nearly half of our total exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I agree with some of what Senator Dolan said in regard to agricultural produce, I ought, in fairness <Col N="1019" /> to Córas Tráchtála, point out that cattle and meat are the responsibility of Córas Beostoic agus Feola and that milk, butter and such items are the responsibility of Bord Bainne.  Could I say in defence of all those organisations&mdash;the latter two are not responsible to me as Minister&mdash;that there is a desperate difficulty about cattle?  In my view the difficulty stems from the structure of the Community in regard to beef.  I say that with regret and not to open old controversies.  I see that there have been signs of some wisdom in recent days, but I do not think it proper to attribute the desperate difficulties of people rearing, selling and exporting cattle and meat at present to a failure of the promotional organisations. They are working hard in desperately difficult circumstances not of their making.</P>
    <P>While I agree with the need of the Irish people overseas to be as proud of their products as they are of their traditional songs and dances, the overseas Irish could express our culture in our food and drink to the great benefit of Irish exporters.  While we have magnificent products in items such as shoes, drink and textiles, as Senator Dolan mentioned, we have also magnificent products in pharmaceuticals, in fine chemicals, in computer components, in hospital equipment and in certain sections of light engineering.  We have this marvellous diversification into the very forefront of world technology.  This is welcome to all of us.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Quinlan, I have <Col N="1020" /> been academid myself and am now Government, but I would happily think that if we had a different type of system I might spend a period in either commerce or in the State service as a civil servant.  We know of other countries where people move around. I think in a small country it is extremely important.  If we only had proper pension arrangements people could trade around.  In Sweden a fellow is a civil servant one year and he might be in management next year, in teaching the year after and he might be in politics the year after that.  That is a good system.  I entirely agree with the suggestion the Senator made.  The students would gain and maybe Córas Tráchtála would gain.  Anything of that nature of course presents technical difficulties, but it is an idea I will pass on with the comment I have made here: it is a sensible and practical suggestion and a very good one.</P>
    <P>I would urge that the Seanad consent to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
