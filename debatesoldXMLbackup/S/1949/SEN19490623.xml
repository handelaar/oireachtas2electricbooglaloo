      <P>It is proposed to take No. 3, the Diseases of Animals Bill, first, then No. 1, the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, and then No.2, the Trade Union Bill.  It should be remarked that these Bills have not had the necessary three days' notice prescribed by Standing Orders, but the Committee on Procedure and Privileges were unanimous that the House might be agreeable to take them to-day without objection so that the Committee Stage could be taken next week. Next week it is proposed to sit on Thursday and Friday.  It is not proposed to take the motion in the name of Senator Counihan to-day.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to permit of the replenishment of the Cattle Diseases Fund.  That fund has its origin in a statute that was originally passed into law in 1878 and the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, provided that local authorities might strike a rate not in excess of 1/2d. in the £, per annum, wherewith to keep that fund replenished.  It was the practice in that Act and in the subsequent Acts passed in 1914 and 1932, while authorising the annual levy of ½d., to fix an overriding maximum of varying sums.  The overriding maximum prescribed in the Act of 1932 has now been reached and it is necessary to permit of local authorities replenishing the fund for a continuing period.  The Seanad will notice that <Col N="1116" /> the period provided in this Bill is limited to four annual contributions of ½d. whereas heretofore it was customary to provide for ten, 12 or even 20 annual contributions.  The reason for shortening the period in this Bill is that it is not intended to introduce a similar Bill in the future because long before the exhaustion of the 2d. here provided it is anticipated that we will have brought before Oireachtas Eireann proposals for the reorganisation of veterinary services on an entirely different and more comprehensive basis which will make this procedure for compensation anomalous and unnecessary.  The principal compensatory charge upon this fund is the payment of compensation to farmers whose cattle are destroyed, at their own request, on condition that the county veterinary officer is satisfied that the beast is suffering from tuberculosis in any degree.  When speaking yesterday in the Dáil I was describing the rates of compensation available and I trust I may make this vicarious apology that in respect of one figure I mixed them up and I take this occasion, if I may, to correct that error on my part.  I said that if a beast were affected with advanced tuberculosis the owner would receive 50 per cent. of its market value.  That is not correct. If the beast is allowed to go on to the stage of extreme emaciation and chronic cough the owner will receive only 25 per cent. of its market value. If it is found to be suffering from chronic cough and, therefore, to be in a reasonably grave condition, the owner will still receive 75 per cent. of its market value.  If the veterinary officer, suspecting tuberculosis, secures the consent of the owner to the destruction of the beast, and on post mortem it transpires that the diagnosis was mistaken, the farmer is entitled to receive 100 per cent. of the full market value of the beast, plus £1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought it necessary to mention those figures in detail and to emphasise them, in order to direct the attention of farmers to the fact that they should have no hesitation in calling in the county veterinary officer if they have the slightest suspicion.  In no conceivable circumstances can they experience <Col N="1117" /> any loss or injury as a result of the destruction of their beast.  If it is destroyed in error, they get 100 per cent. of the market value and £1 to boot, while if it is in a very early stage of tuberculosis, they get 75 per cent. of the market value&mdash;whereas, if it is allowed to survive, it would eventually, of course, die without any compensation, but not before it had contaminated all the rest of the live stock on the place and very possibly the children of the household as well.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise the figures for a second reason, so that I may reiterate in public what I have done already in the course of my official duty, that is, to desire the county veterinary officers to know that I believe I correctly interpret the will of Oireachtas Éireann on all sides if I say they should not be unduly solicitous about making a mistake, that nobody would condemn them if the funds were called on to meet 100 per cent. of the value of a beast mistakenly destroyed, so long as we were satisfied that the veterinary surgeon had exercised reasonable care and had destroyed the beast through an excess of solicitude, lest contaminated milk might endanger the health, probably the life, of some child who would consume it.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is designed to give me a power by Order to widen a definition which sub-section (3) already widens to some extent.  The necessity for that is that the word &ldquo;fowl&rdquo; heretofore was deemed to have a somewhat limited meaning.  It is proposed to make the extension that our experience has shown us to be necessary in sub-section (3), but we are asking for additional power to widen it still further if the necessity should arise in order to protect the country against the possibility of the introduction of diseases from abroad from which, heretofore, by a policy of restriction, we have managed to protect our poultry-keepers. In that connection the Seanad may desire to have an example, and the outstanding example of recent times is the arrival in Great Britain of what now has come to be known as the Newcastle disease.  It was long known to poultry veterinarians that a disease <Col N="1118" /> called &ldquo;fowl pest&rdquo; was widespread on the continent of Europe and constituted a very serious problem.  As a result of reciprocal precautions which Great Britain and this country constantly maintain in consultation, we have availed of the sea to prevent the entry of contaminated materials which bring such diseases within our shores. Sometimes these regulations appear to the man in the street to be extremely pernickety and irrational, and I have great sympathy with that view, because unless you know the background it is easy to think that they are pernickety and unreasonable.</P>
    <P>Senators will understand our solicitude in the Department when I say that &ldquo;fowl pest&rdquo; on the Continent has always presented itself as a very acute condition, with dramatic external symptoms which the veriest tyro can recognise at a glance.  That meant that the veterinary authorities who were on their guard could instantly put a <i>cordon sanitaire</i> around the affected region and take effective measures to stamp it out <i>in situ</i> before it spread. When the disease was carried from the Continent to Great Britain a not infrequent complication presented itself, that while it was an acute and dramatic disease on the Continent, it arrived in Great Britain in a very low, chronic type, with the result that no one who was not a trained observer could recognise it at all and it could very easily escape the attention of a casual inspection. Before an outbreak was detected and notified, very often material that had come in contact with the diseased birds had been spread all over the country&mdash;and to follow it and beat down the outbreak became extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>I welcome the knowledge that the British veterinary service with very exhaustive measures are getting the business under control.  We hope that we will never have to share the task that they have been called upon to undertake, here in Ireland; if we have, we will.  The means are available to deal with it.  It is in order to make it as unlikely as possible that we would have to face difficulties of that kind that we are asking for this rather unusual power in Section 2. <Col N="1119" /> I do not wish the Seanad to think we are asking for these powers in informed anticipation of any impending danger.  Thanks be to God, despite the immense increases in the number of our fowl, we have been phenomenally fortunate.  We have had no serious outbreak of disease of any kind.  We have managed to organise a veterinary preventative service for bacillary white diarrhoea and if we have not succeeded 100 per cent. we are making encouraging progress.  I would not wish the Seanad for a moment to feel that I was asking for powers in the knowledge of, and in anticipation of, some secret disease of which I did not wish to speak.  There is no unknown disease or unknown threat or impending peril abroad and there is no difficulty or delicacy on my part to furnish Senators with any information they may see fit to require in any matter relating to the veterinary health of fowl or any other type of live stock in the country.  I make that reservation, because sometimes, when you ask for powers, people begin to ask themselves: &ldquo;Is there something up that we have not been told about?&rdquo; Nothing whatever.  We are just being cautious, because we are sufficiently middle-aged, I suppose, to accept the wisdom of adages and believe that &ldquo;a stitch in time saves nine&rdquo; and that &ldquo;there is no use in shutting the stable door after the horse has gone&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the introduction of this Bill and we also welcome the announcement by the Minister that, by the time the levy of 2d in the £ has reached the stage of providing for the work, there will be introduced a comprehensive veterinary service.  We who come from the agricultural areas realise the importance of such a service.  We appreciate the extent of the losses incurred by our farmers through disease and we therefore hope that the introduction of this service will be expedited as much as possible.  The amount of money our farmers lose through disease is considerable, and, apart altogether from the cash value involved, there is the danger to human life arising out of disease, particularly in milch cows. <Col N="1120" /> Provision is made in the Bill whereby a person who purchases a milch cow for the supply of milk to a town or city will be compensated if the animal is not up to standard, or if it has already contracted tuberculosis, and as a result is capable of passing on the disease to the community, provided that person informs the local veterinary officer and that officer orders that the animal be eliminated.  Provision is made for compensating such an owner in accordance with the stage which the disease has reached, but, while that may be reasonable enough in the case of a person in possession of an animal for a considerable time, there is always the likelihood of a person purchasing an animal and having it in his possession for a very short period and then becoming suspicious and having an examination carried out.</P>
      <P>The Minister will admit that the farmers are a very shrewd body of men not likely to purchase an animal in the knowledge that it has a disease, but the best of judges can be deceived, and if such a person, in all sincerity and honesty, makes a purchase and becomes suspicious after two or three weeks and reports it to the veterinary officer who certifies it as being in a very advanced stage and says that it should have been reported, six, nine or 12 months previous, it is unfortunate that that man is entitled to only 25 per cent. of the market value of the animal.  The Minister, I am sure, will admit that it is unreasonable that such a man who has conformed with the regulations should be placed in the position that he must suffer a loss of 75 per cent.</P>
      <P>As I say, we welcome the Bill and we also welcome the Minister's statement that he proposes&mdash;in a very short time, I hope&mdash;to introduce legislation providing for a comprehensive veterinary service throughout rural Ireland. There are some small details such as those I have brought to the Minister's attention which would be more appropriately dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with a provision whereby action could be taken to recover for the purchaser the 75 per cent. loss which he sustains by reason of his notification to the veterinary officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to that point, I suggest that, in common law, the person who sells such an animal is liable, if the purchaser can prove that the animal was unsound.  This Bill seems to me to be merely a modification of the Diseases of Animals Acts&mdash; with the terms of which I am not very conversant but of the practical working of which I have had experience&mdash;from 1878 onwards.  I do not think it contains any new power and I am very disappointed that the Minister is not seeking any new power to deal with the situation as it exists to-day in the matter of disease and organisation of veterinary services.  He is not taking power properly to organise such a service and to appoint more veterinary officers in the rural areas where they are badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that the county officers will do certain things under the Bill, that they will take steps to eliminate animals suffering from tuberculosis, but I suggest that the organisation as it exists at present is not such as will warrant the carrying out of what the Minister says.  I am sure that the Minister will readily agree that a thorough reorganisation is necessary and I think the country must get down to the problem of reorganisation as a matter of prime importance. I do not take the happy view that Senator Hawkins seems to take of this matter and the Minister, I am sure, is aware of the seriousness of the position. I argued with the Minister on another occasion, as a member of a committee of agriculture, that steps should be taken in the matter of dealing with tuberculosis in our dairy cattle population.  I advocated that in all good faith and sincerity on a certain occasion and I felt annoyed by the way the Minister dealt with the matter and treated me on that occasion, although he probably did not mean it.  I still <Col N="1122" /> argue that something should be done by way of having a test carried out of all our dairy cattle.  I would mention the tuberculin test and would like the Minister to say if anything can be done by such tests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>What sort of a test?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>A tuberculin test, so that we can eliminate tubercular cows. The Minister stated some time ago that 90 per cent. of our cattle would render a positive test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Just as he said that 80 per cent. of the people in the room would render a positive test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is more like it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the statement about the cattle at the Committee of Agriculture in Carrick-macross. I think the problem is too big for the Minister to handle, but why does he not say so?  I think one Minister for Agriculture seems to be worse than another in this and many other matters.  I want to know is there any provision in this Bill giving the Minister power to deal with the situation as it is.  I suggest there is not.  The Minister has promised a very comprehensive veterinary scheme and I am old enough to know that when you hear Ministers promise things like that it is going to be a very long time before anything is done.  I may be wrong in the case of the present Minister, but I do not know that yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite a long time.  I am one of those who feel that this matter should be tackled at once by the Department of Agriculture through a proper veterinary service and every step should be taken to see that tuberculosis will not spread in the country through the medium of milk. The whole question should be tackled from the foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator suggest this problem is serious?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard it as a very <Col N="1123" /> serious problem.  So long as there are cows suffering from tuberculosis I suggest that every possible test should be made and proper veterinary services organised to ensure that these tests will be made as soon as possible.  In the matter of compensation the Minister appears to have the same views as his predecessor and instead of advancing he is going backwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>100 per cent. plus £1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>For animals which have not got tuberculosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And 75 per cent. if they have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>With so much money being spent on tuberculosis by another Department surely the Minister could instruct his branch with a view to getting better results to increase the 75 per cent. to 100 per cent. in the case of animals that were not allowed to go into the jaws of death.  I take it that the Department will send circulars to the county officials.  There is only one in my County of Leitrim and it is an area of 80 miles long.  It would be difficult for one man to supervise that county.  I suggest that if 100 per cent. plus 20/- is paid for animals found to be suffering from tuberculosis there would not be any abuse.  There is no veterinary surgeon who is going to be flaithulach enough to certify animals suffering from tuberculosis when he knows that it would be regarded as a reflection on his ability if he had animals disposed of and it was found that they were not tubercular. The Minister referred recently to the employment of an X-ray department dealing with tuberculosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed I did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry then and I withdraw that.  I read the debate on the matter very scantily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>What did you think of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be a grand thing if we could do all the things that the Minister outlined.  I seriously suggest that the Minister <Col N="1124" /> should consider amending this question of compensation so that 100 per cent. will be paid in the case of animals found to be suffering from tuberculosis. In that way we may prevent other animals and perhaps human beings from becoming infected.  It is usually the poor man who has one cow suffering from tuberculosis and not the better-off farmer who has more education in agriculture.  In cases like that it would be better to have the full compensation paid rather than have the cow being put on the market.  I suggest that is happening.  There may be a farmer who will say in respect of a cow, &ldquo;She is not doing as well as she might&rdquo;, and he will put her on the market.  It is the poorer man, with the smaller amount of money, who has to take the gambling chance. He gets that cow at a lower price and he buys that cow.  That happens in many cases and it is the poor man who has the cow with tuberculosis. That man may have a family who are consuming the milk of that cow. Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that full compensation should be paid and that propaganda should be carried out by the Department of Agriculture and the committee of agriculture to ensure that anybody who even suspects that he has a cow that has tuberculosis will call in an officer and, if it is established that the cow has tuberculosis but that it is not in an advanced stage of tuberculosis, that the owner will be paid full market value.  That is the approach that I would like to see on the part of the Minister in regard to this problem.</P>
      <P>Even in the case of an animal that was allowed to go into the jaws of death, I would be sympathetic.  If, in the opinion of the authorities, it was a case of deliberate negligence, I say he should be paid 50 per cent.  If it was merely common or garden ignorance, that the man was trying to feed up and to improve the animal and did not know it was suffering from tuberculosis, if he was a poor man, I say he should be paid full market value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is my approach to the problem. I am sorry it is not the Minister's.  I would love to think&mdash;I know it is a vain hope&mdash;that I would be able to argue <Col N="1125" /> the Minister into that outlook.  I suppose I will not be able to do so.  I am seriously suggesting that he should re-examine this whole problem and, if necessary, have a consultation with the Minister for Health in regard to it, and get the opinion of the Minister for Health as to what should be done by way of tuberculin test or any other test to establish the cows that have tuberculosis and the cows that have not tuberculosis.  I am not a technician. I have been told that cows that give a positive reaction to the tuberculin test are dangerous and are suffering from tuberculosis.  I may be wrong in that but that has been my view.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I do urge that the Minister should take a different approach to this matter and that more generous compensation should be given in the case of cows suffering from tuberculosis.  I am afraid the Minister is merely re-enacting a legal procedure, that there is no advance, that he is continuing a code of law that was started, according to the Minister's figure, in 1878, in the Diseases of Animals Act.  The only power the local authority has for the appointment of a veterinary surgeon is given in that Act. They can appoint a veterinary surgeon under the Diseases of Animals Act and they have some powers of slaughter.  I suggest that there is no new power being sought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite frankly, I never heard more unadulterated rubbish about this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my opinion, and I do not live so far from the Senator. If the picture with regard to our herds were anything like it was represented to be by Senator O'Reilly, the future of the cattle industry would be dark indeed.  Senator O'Reilly comes from a part of the country where, not very long ago, a group of people in an adjoining county raised a storm about diseases in pigs.  They had very great reason to regret the unwisdom of the talk that went on at a particular meeting.  They created alarm about diseases in pigs.  What was the result? <Col N="1126" /> No farmer in any of the adjoining districts would go near one of their towns to buy a pig.  If the sort of talk that was handed out to us this evening by Senator O'Reilly were representative of the facts, a great many people would avoid the fairs in his county if they wanted to get healthy stock.  I suggest that Senator O'Reilly and people like him who talk in this fashion about disease in our stock should ponder carefully before using language that may misrepresent the facts and perhaps cause considerable loss to the people in their districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the Bill is concerned, it is a simple measure.  The Minister is making provision to compensate owners of diseased animals to a greater extent than they have been compensated in the past, when necessity arises for slaughter.  If I were to try to interpret Senator O'Reilly's remarks, it would mean that it would be almost more profitable for a farmer to have a diseased animal than to have a healthy animal.  If you were to proceed along Senator O'Reilly's lines you would encourage and inculcate disease in your herds because you would probably be better off than if you had healthy stock.  They would be more valuable to you dead than alive.  To bring in a vet and slaughter animals would be a better way of putting money in your pocket than to feed them well and increase their productivity, whether by breeding or milk production.  I shall not say very much on the subject, but Senator O'Reilly castigated the Minister by suggesting that the Minister should consult the Minister for Health on this matter, presuming.  I suppose, that in discussion with the Minister for Health, the Minister for Health would insist on good clean milk being supplied so that the human species would be properly fed.  The Minister for Health believes that you can have healthy people if they get good food and sufficient of it. What is wrong with the Minister for Agriculture suggesting to people who talk like Senator O'Reilly that one of the prerequisites to healthy live stock is to feed the cows?  There is no doubt about it that where there is tuberculosis in herds it is probably due more <Col N="1127" /> to faulty feeding and neglect on the part of the farmer than to anything else.</P>
    <P>I do not think there are so many serious cases of tuberculosis but where they exist, they are due mainly to the cause I have mentioned.  It is true that a disease can be passed from one beast to another.  If the Minister for Health were to insist on the Minister for Agriculture providing clean, healthy milk, it is reasonable that the Minister for Agriculture would expect the farmers to provide healthy food for the cows so that they would not become debilitated and be a prey to disease.  If on any farmstead, in the month of January, the cows are standing to their knees in mud, chewing the cud, cold, thin and hungry, where there is only bad hay and the cattle get nothing else, there is real danger of tuberculosis there.  If it should develop in one or two cows in that herd, it may spread to the entire herd.  Surely there is a responsibility on the herdsman to begin at the beginning, to try to keep his stock healthy.  The demand that Senator O'Reilly makes on the Minister in regard to compensation is such as to encourage a man to be careless. That would be all wrong.  Any of us who knows anything about this matter knows quite well that the number of animals in a herd that will give a positive reaction to the tuberculin test is very high but we have all used milk from cows that would react positively to the tuberculin test and we have not become contaminated with tuberculosis.</P>

      <P>That is another point. We have survived having done it. <Col N="1128" /> It is rather difficult to deal with this problem when you are dealing with a person who approaches it in the way Senator O'Reilly approaches it.  That superficial smattering of information about a serious scientific technical problem does not do much towards contributing to a solution of the problem and the Senator, if he wants to make any contribution to this problem, will have to give it a little more study.  Anybody who knows anything about this problem will tell you that the number of cows of seven or eight or nine, or six or seven years of age that will react to the tuberculin test is rather high but that the milk, under any test, is not contaminated or contaminating.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly then referred to the farmer who sells a diseased animal to another farmer.  I think he said, at the same time, that such a farmer was a shrewd man.  A farmer who goes to a fair&mdash;if he is any judge of stock and knows his business, and if he is really farming&mdash;knows by looking at a beast whether it is healthy or not.</P>

      <P>I do not agree that because a man is poor he will buy a diseased cow.  There is no better judge of the health of an animal that the poor man&mdash;because he has to be.  If he were not a good judge of the health of an animal he would not be able to survive at all.  He cannot afford to take risks and, before he buys, he will make searching inquiries, if he can, from the seller's neighbours to know what the stock is like.  In any event, the number of such animals purchased in a year would not be one in 1,000 of the number of cows that would something that does not exist to the extent of being a problem.  I regret the kind of <Col N="1129" /> speech which Senator O'Reilly made. He asked if the Minister is aware of the seriousness of the position.  He must realise that a statement such as that will be interpreted as meaning that there is a very considerable disease in our live stock and that that disease is a danger to the human population as well.  I reject that statement absolutely.  It is not in accord with the facts.  I have heard such a statement made from this side of the House in years gone by and I have always contradicted it.</P>

If <Col N="1130" /> I am not satisfied, I ask the veterinary surgeon to come out.  After watching the cow for a week or two the veterinary surgeon will make up his mind as to what is probably the trouble.  The animal may be treated and may not respond.  If it does not respond to treatment I am then instructed to go to the county veterinary officer.  He comes along and passes judgment.  If he decides that the animal is tubercular, then it may be slaughtered.</P>

      <P>There is a point in the progress of the disease of the animal when it is obvious that the disease is consuming the animal.  Then the whole system of the animal becomes affected. It is true that the veterinary officer is rather hesitant and rather cautious about slaughter.  That is one point in regard to this Bill on which I should like to have a little light.  I agree with Senator O'Reilly in that the county veterinary officer does not like to be held up to ridicule or to have his diagnosis proven incorrect.  He would not like to find himself in the position of having decided on the slaughter of an animal only to discover afterwards that the animal was not tubercular but was suffering, perhaps, from some affection of the liver.  What happens in the event of the slaughter of an animal?  Does the veterinary surgeon there and then decide whether the animal was tubercular or whether portion of it is to be sent to the veterinary college for a test?  Suppose my cow is slaughtered.  How am I to know that my animal was not actually suffering from tuberculosis?</P>

Of course, if according to the original Act the intestines can be sent to the veterinary college, that is a safeguard.  I do not know that there is anything more to be said on that.

      <P>Senator Hawkins indicated the possibility of passing on disease from dairymen's herds.  All dairymen are licensed dairymen and there is a veterinary inspection of the <Col N="1132" /> herd as well as of the premises.  If there is disease in a herd the fault is with the veterinary inspector.  The public are very well safeguarded in that respect and the dairyman is not at fault.  With regard to disease in poultry, I do not know whether the Minister has any exact information as to the control he has been able to exercise this year over B.W.D. in our flocks.  With the very considerable extension of our poultry flocks, control of this disease is terribly vital and important altogether.  The Minister's veterinary service is to be complimented on the steps taken this year to provide vans to go all over the country and check up on the spot the condition of disease in our flocks.  I would like to hear from the Minister how far we are getting control over B.W.D. because, undoubtedly, the future of the profitable production of poultry is going to be considerably influenced by that.  It is satisfactory to know that we are still immune from the fowl pest that has wrought such havoc in flocks in Britain, and I hope we will continue to keep it beyond our shores.</P>
      <P>The aspect of this measure which strikes me as not being very popular with local authorities is the fact that there is an obligation upon us to raise the rate which may go up by 2d. in the £.</P>

This Bill is necessary, and I think that criticism of the kind we have heard is not serving the interests of the live-stock industry in this country nor making a contribution helpful to the Minister or his veterinary department to grapple with their <Col N="1133" /> problem.  There is no use in exaggeration that does nobody any good.  I think it is important for all of us to examine this problem and study it closely, and if we have any knowledge to give the benefit of that knowledge in such a way that it will really help, but for goodness' sake let us not start a policy of exaggeration which indicates that we are trying to hinder.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is need for a great deal of discussion on this Bill.  I feel it is on the right lines.  A few of the statements which were made were made by people who do not understand the situation. Senator Hawkins spoke of the man who buys a beast in an advanced stage of tuberculosis at a fair, and said that that man did not know and should be compensated.  That man is an ass and has no right to try to buy a cow.  I was sorry to hear Senator O'Reilly make the statement that so many of our cattle are affected with tuberculosis. Unfortunately, a certain percentage of our cows are affected, but a percentage of cows all over the world are affected with tuberculosis, and as far as our dry stock, bullocks and heifers are concerned, we have the cleanest bill of health of any country in the world.  Take the abattoir where the worst of our cattle go for slaughter &mdash;only a half of 1 per cent. are affected with tuberculosis, and corporation vets. tell me that that is a very high percentage to quote them at.  When I hear Senator O'Reilly talk about the number affected&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming back to Senator O'Reilly's point of having all cattle tuberculin tested, I do not believe that the tuberculin test is altogether perfect.  From my experience of it, in many cases a cow may react to the test this week and in three months' time would pass the test all right.  I have had experience of <Col N="1134" /> cows of that description myself.  I had a number of cows, and when my family were young they insisted on having them tuberculin tested.  One 900-gallon a year cow reacted and I would not sell that cow.  I kept her for feeding pigs. At the time of her next calf I got her tested by the same vet. and it turned out that she passed that test.  Is there such a great danger of tuberculosis from the milk of cows affected with tuberculosis?  Some years ago the British set up what they call a Royal Commission to test that case and it was found that only less than 2 per cent. of tubercular cows gave tubercular milk.  If that is so, I think it knocks the bottom out of Senator O'Reilly's argument.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is very much to be said on this Bill.  I think it is a great improvement on any Bills we had previously, particularly the compensation in the case of reported cattle which are noticed to be affected with tuberculosis.  The principal reason why farmers did not report their cattle was that although they thought, or perhaps knew, a beast to be affected, it was not worth their while.  For all they got it was better to slaughter it themselves and put it in a hole.  Senator O'Reilly said that a man who sells a beast affected with tuberculosis should be liable to the buyer for compensation.  That is the most foolish suggestion anybody could make.  After all, if that was the law, when cattle were sent to Birkenhead or Glasgow those people might demand compensation when we would have no means of testing their claim at all.  I think this Bill is a great improvement on Diseases of Animals Acts we had in the past and it should be passed without discussion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>About the Bill itself, I want to congratulate the Minister as it is an <Col N="1135" /> advance.  It is not a very large advance but it is an advance and every advance is worth while.  The important point, to my mind, in this Bill is that the Minister is encouraging in this measure as far as possible the early notification of tuberculosis in cattle.  The higher compensation is given for the early cases. Even if the cow was not actually tubercular, if it was believed or suspected to be so and slaughtered, the compensation is 100 per cent.  Thus, as the disease advances, the compensation falls, as it should fall.  This will all tend to encourage early notification and slaughter. That is a definite and worth-while advance.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Reilly that this is only tackling a small portion of the problem and tackling it at a very late stage.  Senator O'Reilly suggests the further use of tuberculin testing as a method of diagnosis.  Senator Baxter took exception to Senator O'Reilly's remark that there is very considerable disease in our live stock. That statement of Senator O'Reilly's is perfectly true &mdash; there is very considerable disease in our live stock.  It may be unpleasant to have to confess it but I do not think the ostrich-like attitude of Senator Baxter in refusing to look at an unpleasant fact will bring us any advance.  Senator Baxter's whole lack of progressive outlook is shown by the statement he made that we have all probably drunk tuberculous milk and have survived.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor Bigger</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind saying that we all have drunk milk from animals excreting tubercle bacilli, but Senator Baxter's attitude is a selfish one.  There are lots of children who have drunk that milk and have survived, but there are many who have not survived and there are many crippled and deformed because they have drunk it.  Anything that tackles those difficulties will be useful and those difficulties, however great, should be faced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> I confess that the Minister is making advances, but I would urge on him still greater advances.  I do not say that this rightfully applies here, but I am sure it will be part of his policy. I suggest that a suitable area be taken, one or two counties, and that everything possible be done to build up in those counties a bovine population entirely free from this disease.  There is no use in saying it cannot be done. It has been done throughout Canada and in large areas of the United States, so that certain types of tuberculosis occurring in children in this country are simply non-existent there.</P>
    <P>May I try to elucidate the obvious difficulties members of the Seanad naturally have about the question of the diagnosis of tuberculosis?  The position is that the tuberculin test, if properly performed&mdash;you must have the right material and a skilled surgeon to perform it&mdash;in the human or animal reveals the fact that that person or animal has suffered from tuberculosis. In the case of human tuberculosis, it does not prove that the person at the time is suffering.  I know that I am not suffering, though in my case the test is positive.  I am quite sure that Senator Baxter's test is positive, but that he is not suffering. In the animal, you are dealing with something different&mdash;a milch cow living under unnatural conditions, with an enormous drain to produce milk in an abnormal quantity, with a short life span, which is a fifth or a sixth of that of a human being.  Tuberculosis in human beings is curable.  In the great majority of cases it is cured without any specific treatment.  Most of us have been infected and have cured ourselves without knowing it, but human beings are not lactating at the high rate at which the cow lactates, so we are not subject to this very unnatural drain to which a cow is subject.</P>
    <P>In the cow, when the animal develops tuberculosis, it starts as a very small focus quite undetectable on veterinary examination, but when the tuberculin test becomes positive, it tells us that the cow has been infected.  The cow, if put under very good conditions and on very good food and not overmilked, may recover, but that does not happen in the cow usually.  It is a fairly <Col N="1137" /> rapidly advancing disease.  When a cow which gives a positive tuberculin reaction is subjected to heavy milking, in the majority of cases the disease advances and within one or two years it becomes clinically evident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Bigger</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not come here to make this speech complete with statistical evidence, which is procurable and with which I shall favour the Minister on a later occasion.  My claim is that, in the cow, under the conditions of heavy milking, the disease of tuberculosis very easily advances.  A cow is not a danger because it gives a positive reaction.  It is only a danger when the disease advances and attacks the udder and she is excreting an enormous number of tuberculous bacilli in her milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge that, to deal logically with tuberculosis, we must do as those responsible for the health of cows have done in Canada and in the United States, in a number of European countries and in parts of Australia.  We must not be entirely ignorant of the scientific basis of the theory.  After all, <Col N="1138" /> people do not indulge in very heavy expenditure without good reason for doing so.  These people have found it worth while to free large areas completely from bovine tuberculosis.  They have found it a paying proposition, from the purely agricultural point of view and from the point of view in which I am interested in in particular &mdash;they have removed from the children this grave danger of contracting bovine tuberculosis.  It may be said: &ldquo;It cannot be done&rdquo;.  I am not urging the Minister to do that now in this Bill. I am sure it has its right place and that with his progressive outlook, he has already envisaged the possibility.  I am urging that, as soon as may be practicable, he would try to build up, in quite extensive areas, in isolated areas, a bovine population entirely free from the disease.  It has proved possible in Canada and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>My reason for speaking is that I have no cows to sell.  It seems to me from the speeches made that there is a sad fate staring most of us in the face&mdash;if we do not die of tuberculosis, we will die of fright.  We have it asserted, and contradicted, that practically the whole of our cattle are affected by tuberculosis. That has been denied, but we do know that some of our cattle are affected and <Col N="1139" /> we do know that the milk from these cattle is being sold and we do know that the Minister is taking every possible step under this Bill and under contemplated legislation to wipe out bovine tuberculosis.</P>

      <P>The milk itself may not have been tubercular infected, but the cows were.  What worries me is that, while the Minister is anxious to see that cows definitely suffering from tuberculosis are slaughtered at the earliest possible moment, it is quite likely that a farmer will keep on hoping that the cow will improve and need not be slaughtered, and need not be sold at less than its market value. In the meantime, a cow definitely suffering from it is being milked and the milk is being consumed by human beings.  I do not know whether, in the case of a visit by the veterinary officer on invitation to examine these cows, followed by a decision that a cow is tubercular and ought to be slaughtered, there is any compulsory power in the matter of slaughter, or can a farmer decide that he will keep the cow and can the milk be sent still to the cities and towns for consumption?  Are there compulsory powers to slaughter an animal?  That is not conveyed in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think that where an animal is tubercular, compensation is desirable and the infection should be diagnosed at the earliest possible stage, and in order to assist in getting rid of the animal as soon as possible the compensation should be as near as possible to the market value.  I think it would even be better to adopt the suggestion made and pay full compensation for an animal which had tuberculosis in its early stages, just as for an animal which had not and which was slaughtered.  It would be better to run the risk of having to pay a few shillings extra than to let the cow go on until it had to be certified as suffering from tuberculosis, because in the meantime it might do an incalculable amount of harm.  I want the Minister to allay our fears, because we have been frightened. Senator Baxter talked about these diseases and the cause of them and I was glad to hear him say that his experience as a farmer bore out our experience as citizens in Dublin, that cows get tuberculosis because of bad housing conditions and bad food&mdash;the fact that they live in bovine slums.  I am sorry that we cannot as effectively wipe out tuberculosis amongst the human population, but I do not say that the same remedy, slaughter, should be adopted.</P>

      <P>We are really dealing with compensation to be paid in respect of cattle condemned, and I would have preferred if some Senator had put down a motion which would give us an opportunity of discussing this matter in a more effective way. I have made inquiries and I believe that a very small percentage&mdash; probably not more than 2 per cent.&mdash; of cows which react give live tubercle bacilli in their milk.  I want to make that statement, because people are very much afraid in this respect.  Statements have been made with regard to <Col N="1141" /> milk which is not good being fed to pigs.  Our system of pig inspection&mdash; and I have some experience of it&mdash;is based on the Scottish system, which is the most elaborate system in the world, and it is more efficient and effective than the Scottish system.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he intends to bring in a comprehensive Bill and I hope, when that is done, that the causes of the disease in many cases will be removed and that the cooperative societies and others supplying skimmed milk to the farmers for feeding cows and pigs, will be induced to pasteurise it, as is being done in many other countries.  In that way, we could reduce in great measure the incidence of tuberculosis in our cattle and also in pigs and other animals which use milk as a food.  I know that the Minister, in his reply, will remove from the public any fears they may have with regard to food.  My chief reason for rising was my anxiety that many of the things said in this debate would give rise to fears in the minds of people which, in my opinion, are entirely groundless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. M. O'Dwyer Mr. M. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I approve of the principle of the Bill and I think it is a good idea to increase the compensation in the early stages, because, if the disease is to be tackled at all, it is in the early stages, and especially in the dairying districts, that it should be tackled.  I was very interested in Senator Bigger's remarks.  We all know that there is more disease amongst dairy cows than we would wish.  He has given a very clear explanation of the reason and it is a reason which must stand for all time &mdash;that the drain of the milk on the ordinary cow has a tendency to give rise to the disease.  That stands to reason.  In addition, bad treatment multiplies the chances of the disease spreading, and it explains why dairy cattle are more liable to infection than other cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the danger of infection of human beings from bovine tuberculosis is at all so real as people think. I remember a German scientist coming to this country many years ago and demonstrating in the course of a lecture that it was not possible to transmit <Col N="1142" /> bovine tuberculosis to the human being.  I think that has since been contradicted, but in County Limerick and other dairying counties there is considerably more milk drunk by children than in any other part of the country&mdash; many times more than is consumed in the cities and towns&mdash;and in these places there is no such thing as inspection of milk.  The milk is simply produced for the creameries and there is no such thing as inspection or tuberculin testing.  It is produced under the most careless conditions and still tuberculosis is very rare amongst the children there.  Very rarely do we hear of a case and scarcely ever a case which could be shown to have been caused by drinking milk infected with tuberculosis.  It is quite possible that the children in the cities may not have the same powers of resistance to the disease, but the fact remains that young children living in the country who drink a lot of milk are quite healthy.</P>
    <P>One reason why the disease should be attacked in the early stages especially in dairying districts is that when the disease develops in a cow the milk from that animal is mixed with that from other cows and the whole lot is brought to the creamery.  The separated milk which has been standing for some time is then brought back and fed to the cattle.  In that way even a few cows could infect the whole area by spreading the disease amongst all the other cattle.  I would suggest that the separated milk should be sterilised or pasteurised.  That would mean that the milk would be going pure to the calves and in that way the disease would soon die out or be reduced to a minimum.</P>
    <P>It is a good idea to compel farmers to report cases of the disease in the very early stages.  Scientists should decide definitely whether the disease is transmitted from the animals to human beings.  The disease is a very serious matter from all points of view, but particularly from the point of view of the farming community.  I am sure that anything that can be done to remedy the situation will have the wholehearted co-operation of the entire community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally I believe that the more milk is drunk the better but I do not agree with anybody who talks about pasteurisation, whether it is pasteurisation of skimmed milk or pure milk.  Milk like wine contains living objects which pasteurisation destroys.</P>
      <P>The Minister has spoken of the slaughter of cows believed to be suffering from tuberculosis.  Under the scheme the owner is to get 100 per cent of the market price.  There are public-spirited farmers who in the interest of the community will report a cow at once.  Very often it is a cow giving a heavy yield of six and a half to seven gallons per day and which for that reason is very thin.  That cow may be worth anything from 90 guineas to 100 guineas as a pedigree animal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EdmundSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Bigger has referred to the matter of early notification. Farmers would be encouraged to give the earliest notification if compensation were given on a reasonable basis as distinct from the purely commercial value.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of the case that has not been referred to and that is that very shortly in England and in Scotland there is going to be a very strong drive for tuberculin tested herds.  In Scotland at the moment such cattle are being sent into England.  That market is still open to us and I think the Minister will be forced very shortly to ensure that all animals leaving this country are tuberculin tested before they are shipped to England.  The British Government are going to insist on this.</P>

I have not got the statistics but I understand that in the <Col N="1144" /> state of Maryland in America they had secured all tuberculin tested cattle down to 1 per cent. and in the following year the incidence of tuberculosis in human beings went up by 2 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that this is only the beginning of steps which the Minister will take to co-operate with the Minister for Health in clearing the country absolutely of tuberculous cows. Senator Baxter had said that any farmer would know the tubercular cow by looking at it.  I saw a cow belonging to the late Minister for Agriculture, Dr. James Ryan.  A test indicated she was suspicious and her milk was not used.  A later test proved she was a reactor.  If reaction means tuberculosis, Dr. Ryan could have sold that cow and no farmer who might have purchased her would have suspected her. Instead, Dr. Ryan had her slaughtered. Few farmers would have had that public spirit.  It seems, therefore, that Senator O'Reilly is correct when he stated that a farmer could purchase a tuberculous beast without recognition of the fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Milk and public health are definitely related.  Senator Sweetman has no faith in pasteurised milk.  I have not had much experience of it but I know the American Army, when in Europe, were ordered not to consume milk unless they were sure it was pasteurised. I saw an American paper with a chart on tuberculosis with the present Minister for Health at Newcastle Sanatorium when he was there, and the chart showed tubercular meningitis before and after milk was pasteurised the chart fell to normal.  So that even pasteurisation is important. We should arrive at the stage&mdash; and I hope the Minister will aim at it &mdash;where every milk supplier will have to have his cattle tuberculin tested. The reason they do not have them done at present is that it costs a guinea each time the beast is tested and they will not go to that expense.  The ordinary farmer who is sending milk to the creamery or elsewhere will not go to the expense.  Therefore, the State would have to undertake to do it.  I think Senator Bigger's suggestion that a few counties should be isolated and that an effort should be made to clear <Col N="1145" /> those counties first as an experiment, but I hope that the process will be extended to the whole country because, as Senator Bigger pointed out, it means the health of human beings.</P>
    <P>I saw with Professor Boyle, Professor of Agriculture in Cork University, heifers that were sent from Clare by as shrewd a dealer as Senator Counihan or as shrewd a farmer as Senator Baxter.  They were bought for the university.  There were 75, as far as I remember.  They were all beautiful animals which were to be used for milk. Professor Boyle had them tuberculin tested and three out of the 75 reacted. These were eliminated and were not put in for milk.  It shows the importance of tuberculin testing, for milk supply at any rate.  The present Minister has plenty of energy and plenty of honesty and is anxious to do the best for the country and I hope he will have Senator Bigger's suggestion put into force and that he will have it carried out, not only in a few counties, but throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Even though many Senators may not have agreed with Senator O'Reilly's proposal that the full amount of compensation should be paid, every Senator should agree on that.  If some poor unfortunate farmer finds that his cow is diseased, he should be paid the amount in full.  Otherwise, if he is a poor person, a person who does not sell milk but who uses it for his family, he is not in a position to make up the difference in the price of a new cow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not sufficient. Where will he get the other 25 per cent.?  Where is it to come from, if the person is poor?  I am thinking of the peasant farmer in County Mayo.  A £5 note is a big amount of money for him.  If what Senator Baxter has said is true, that there is so little of this, the amount involved would be small. I would ask the Minister to be more generous with these people and to give the full 100 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> In connection with the point that was raised by Senator O'Reilly about somebody selling a tubercular cow, I am satisfied that no tenant farmer, particularly in rural areas, will buy a milch cow without asking for a warranty and, if he gets that, he can recover the price of the cow.  I am not afraid on that point.  I do not agree with Senator O'Reilly in that connection.  The person is protected in that case.  But, in the other case, we should do everything possible and the Minister should do everything within his power to eradicate tubercular cows.  I am not saying that the number is large but I do not agree that it is as small as Senator Baxter thinks it is.  Unfortunately, it is not.  Whether the number be big or small, the Minister and the Government should take immediate steps to put them out of existence and they should compensate the people who would suffer loss.</P>
    <P>On the question of the valuation, I take it that it is a veterinary officer who will value?</P>

I am glad the farmer is protected in that way.</P>
      <P>As far as the whole question of veterinary service for small tenant farmers is concerned, I would appeal to the Minister to take up that question at an early date.  I know people who cannot afford to pay the veterinary officer, with the result that they have had loss that could be avoided if a veterinary surgeon were at their disposal at a more reasonable price.  I would make a final appeal to the Minister to give 100 per cent. of the market value of a cow that has to be destroyed because that will help to put these cows out of existence.</P>

      <P>In view of that statement would it not be desirable to fix some figure in between more than 75 and less than 100 per cent.&mdash; perhaps 90 or 95 per cent.?  If it is contended that 100 per cent. would make farmers too easy going, and not anxious to get rid of tuberculosis, then what about 90 or 95 per cent.?  I agree with those Senators who have stated that for a farmer on a small holding £5&mdash;the figure which Senator Tunney mentioned&mdash;is a large amount.  Many of these farmers have a very low standard of living and a loss of even 25 per cent. of the value of a cow represents a big sacrifice.  I would suggest that the Minister would consider some figure in between the 75 per cent. and the 100 per cent. if he considers it unwise for reasons already stated, to give them 100 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think perhaps it is necessary in order to restore proportion to our approach to this problem that I would recapitulate my views on a farmer who has a tubercular cow, and well knowing it to be tubercular brings it to the fair with the intention of selling it to his neighbour.  I was asked in another place if I would not compensate such a person for any loss he might have sustained by the depreciation of the value of the beast he sold and I said that I certainly would not. I said: &ldquo;There is such a thing in this world as a moral law.  It is not the function of this House to make blackguards into honest men.  A farmer who brings a tubercular cow, knowing it to be tubercular, and sells it in a fair is lower and more contemptible than the man who commits murder.  I would like that to be recorded.  The farmer who sells a tubercular cow in the fair to his neighbour is a low, crawling thing, compared with a man who would <Col N="1148" /> go into his neighbour's kitchen and murder his neighbour's child in that kitchen.  I am not now talking of the man who makes a mistake.  The Deputy was talking of the man who well knowing his cow to be a tubercular cow, rather than suffer the loss of a fraction of its value will bring it to the fair and sell it to his neighbour, hoping his neighbour will not discern what he has perceived.  I want to say that the man who does that is a lower creature than the man who goes in and murders his neighbour's child.  That man will at least face a jury of his peers and take the consequences of his act, but the man who murders his neighbours child by passing into his possession a tubercular cow well knowing it to be tubercular is a murderer and will answer to the God Who made him some day for what he does.&rdquo; That is my view of any farmer&mdash;rich, middling or poor&mdash;who, in order to line his own pocket would destroy his neighbour's family without qualification or reservation or excuse.</P>
      <P>But Senators may have noticed that I reacted briskly when Senator Bigger came prancing into the fray.  This is a country where learning is greatly venerated.  Our people instinctively attach to the <i>obiter dicta</i> of a professor in this country a reverence which is, perhaps, unique.  Therefore, I suggest to Senators who are professors that they ought to be careful about what they say.  Senator Bigger delivers himself oracularly of the declaration that almost all cows which would react to a tuberculin test within 12 months are suffering from clinical tuberculosis which is virtually certain to proceed to a fatal termination.  Did you ever hear such raiméis?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I accept the Senator's correction.  &ldquo;Almost all cows which would react to a tuberculin test within a year or two years are suffering from clinical tuberculosis which is <Col N="1149" /> virtually certain to proceed to a fatal termination.&rdquo;  Where did the Senator get a statistical foundation for that proposition?  Is there a record anywhere of any general application of the tuberculin test to a wide number of cattle whose history was subsequently traced, and a record kept of the percentage of those reactors that proved to have clinical tuberculosis thereafter and those that did not, over a period of five years?  The Senator makes that declaration just like so many other people who say that there is not room in the one hide for milk and meat. That sounds so true that everyone bows the head respectfully and nobody dares to ask why&mdash;because it is a sort of <i>Lése-majesté</i> to ask why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I first came to this House I hesitated about engaging Senator Bigger in an argument.  I felt that one should always think twice before taking him on.  But imagine a man in his position delivering himself of that allegation to anybody of a scientific mind.  It is pure tripe.  It has no relation to the truth.  It is just shooting off the mouth.  I do not mind Senators doing that when it is not going to do grievous injury to the country where they are getting their living.  Everybody in this House&mdash;poor, rich, distinguished or insignificant&mdash;is ultimately getting a living out of the farmers of this country and those who are getting it, as we all are, ought to think twice before we strike down the people out of whom we are living.  Nobody is more vigilant or deeply concerned than I am about the problem of bovine tuberculosis infection in children.  God knows, I have every reason for it.  All belonging to me have been deeply engaged in the effort to control it and to correct it.  It makes me all the more exasperated when I hear people shooting off their mouth and making a difficult and troublesome task which must be done more difficult and more complicated to grapple with than it already is.  Nobody wants to deny the incidence of tuberculosis in cattle in this country.  We have nothing to hide.  We have nothing to be ashamed of.  The incidence of reactors to the tuberculin test is relatively high.  It is common knowledge that a very large number of cattle <Col N="1150" /> who react to the tuberculin test never develop clinical tuberculosis. It is common knowledge to all, but the most wooden-headed, that there can be tuberculosis foci in a cow's carcase and that if you are milking her till the cows come home her milk would constitute no greater source of danger than if she were proved to be a non-reactor to the tuberculin test 444 times in a lifetime. To attempt over-simplification of these things is pernicious but to get up on your hind legs in order to look down on the ignorant Irishry&mdash;&ldquo;Really, it is high time that the ignorant people of this country realised the position and what was being done in Maryland and here, there and everywhere...&rdquo;&mdash;and that if we were not a lot of ignorant people we would have done it a long time ago.  That just makes me go to the limit of my patience.</P>
    <P>What an insult to suggest that we should be determined to take measures to protect our own children and that we should not neglect, through ignorance or reluctance, to face a public duty which has been undertaken by the people of Canada, of the United States and the people of here, there and everywhere.  That&mdash;from the very people who, manifestly, from their own conversation, have not the faintest notion of the considerations that are operating upon our mind.  There is the difficulty of attempting to eliminate tuberculosis on the basis of a test when you know the test is not by any means a proven infallibility.  It is one thing to say that in an excess of solicitude &mdash;to rush out and, if you have 40 per cent. reactors in the country to slaughter all reactive animals.  If it was certainly true that every cow that reacted was capable of giving bovine tuberculosis to a baby I would come to Oireachtas Éireann for leave to go out and do that thing to-morrow because the life of one woman's child is to her worth all the cattle in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Senator is not the only person who spoke in this House. There is ample protection which, I entirely agree, must be rigorously enforced, unless and until we can satisfy ourselves that the source of our milk supply is clear of tuberculosis.  In my opinion, until we can satisfy ourselves that there is not any cow suffering from any form of tuberculosis in the herds supplying our milk for human consumption, we must aim at giving universal pasteurisation pending the higher perfection of having a milk supply so certainly sure of being free from all infection as would justify passing it for human consumption without a previous pasteurisation.  Let us, however, remember what we are up against when we talk of our liquid milk supply.  Suppose you satisfy yourself beyond all doubt that there is not a cow in the herds which supply milk for human consumption suffering from tuberculosis, are you sure that there are not any dairy maids coughing into it?  Now where are you going to stop? Is it the Minister for Health's and my duty to leave the milk pure on the lintel of the door because the girl of the house may have tuberculosis and she may cough the germ into it?  Am I to be told that I am to go into every house and examine everyone in the house?  Where am I to stop in my solicitude?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the Minister for Health and I.  Where are we to stop? I think we should stop at the threshold of the home.  But remember that the mother who gives that milk to her child is not safe because that milk may become the vehicle of typhoid, tuberculosis, and more than one form of food poisoning from the time I leave it at the door, or rather the time when it is left on the door under my supervision, and the time the child gets it.  These problems are not as simple as they look and the fools who think that they are are the people who play havoc with their well-intentioned maunderings. Everybody here believes that no expense is too great to wipe out tuberculosis among cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see my way to deal with clinical tuberculosis; I can see my way to deal with more than that and I say to every veterinary officer in this country: &ldquo;If you suspect that bovine tuberculosis is there, deem it to be there.  Do not be afraid that anybody may say: &lsquo;That fellow is ould maidish to kill a whole lot of cattle that we have to pay 100 per cent. for and £1 to boot&rsquo;.&rdquo;  I have told them if any local authority says that: &ldquo;Tell them from me I asked you to do it.  As long as you in good faith believe a cow to be suffering from tuberculosis, although the regulations say that to justify slaughter the cow must have a chronic cough and show evidence of emaciation, give her a punch in the side and make her cough. If that does not make her cough, give her a pinch of snuff and that cough is good enough for me for you to take her out for slaughter.&rdquo;  Whether that cow has tuberculosis or not, the farmer will get 100 per cent. of its total value and £1 to boot if she has not and 75 per cent. if she has.  Let him go and buy a cow to replace the one that has been <Col N="1153" /> slaughtered, but no one must condemn the vet who has excelled in caution.  It would be far better that a dozen cows not suffering from tuberculosis should be slaughtered than that one should contaminate a human being.  On a much lower level, one affected cow could go into the byre and affect three or four more cows before the vet comes to destroy that emaciated cow, only to come back a few months later to destroy a couple more.  Let us get out of the habit of acting at times when our heads are as soft as our hearts.  It is so easy to be maudlin about these affairs and so easy to do desperate damage if a maudlin well-intentioned busybody flounders around desiring to do benefaction to everybody.  But, in fact, he raises powerful vested interests in this country who may greatly increase the difficulty of those who are resolved to proceed inexorably to the real end we have in view.  I do not see any way round the question of tuberculin tested cattle.  All tuberculin tested cattle do not develop clinical bovine tuberculosis.  That is one of many problems.</P>
    <P>Of course, when I came to examine this and consulted my veterinary staff, I said to them: &ldquo;This system of waiting until a cow becomes emaciated or has a chronic cough is suicidal.  While that cow is waiting to get emaciated enough to be killed under the regulations, she is effectively infecting two or three cows.&rdquo;  What about authorising a veterinary surgeon to destroy a beast if she is a reactor?  The problem is how you would justify that.  We have no reason to believe that half the cows that react would ever develop clinical bovine tuberculosis.  How can you go out and massacre as condemned cattle every beast that would react while any statistical material you have, which is not much, would suggest that not 20 per cent. would ever develop clinical bovine tuberculosis?  If you try to do that, the only result will be that you will range up a wall of resentment and opposition in this country that will prevent you from doing the things we can do.  It was to overcome that dilemma that I said to the veterinary officers: &ldquo;Very well, we have to go another way about it.&rdquo;  We have to say to the county veterinary officers: <Col N="1154" />&ldquo;To blazes with the cough and the emaciation; if you believe the beast is tuberculous, dispose of it and we will get around the problem of the absence of the chronic cough and the emaciation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is there anything we can do beyond that, which is calculated to achieve our purpose without precipitating a situation in which we will not carry the public with us?  Let us not get into our heads, whatever position we occupy in the public life of this country, that we are the lords and masters of the people.  We are not.  Our function in Seanad Éireann, in Dáil Éireann, in the Oireachtas and in the Cabinet, is to interpret the wishes of the people, to do what we believe to be right and, if we find ourselves at hopeless variance with the people, then to stand aside and let them choose other representatives if, on matters of fundamental principle, we can no longer reconcile our conduct with the people's wish.</P>
    <P>If we want to get the authority and the will of the people behind us to do the things we know are necessary, we will not get it by going out and telling them they have got to do it.  We must bring them with us and get their assent.  We must try and lay the case before them in a form which may involve some simplification but which will command the assent of the average reasonable man.  You will not get the assent of the average reasonable man to any such deft proposition as that we are to slaughter every such beast in this country that reacts to the tuberculin test.  My aim is&mdash;and I do not despair of achieving it&mdash;to keep up the pressure on clinical tuberculosis, until the sight of a beast with emaciation or chronic cough will become unknown in this country.</P>
    <P>If veterinary science advances a step further to make the tuberculin test less delicate than it now is, if we can get some test which would. give us the signal of early clinical tuberculosis, in the commonly accepted sense of that word, we will have made great progress.</P>
    <P>Suppose that our parents ordained that the precautions requisite should be taken in respect of every one of us and that all the community should be <Col N="1155" /> submitted to whatever is the corresponding test in human beings to the tuberculin test in cows, how many of us in this room to-day would not have spent two years in a sanatorium?  I found a most beautiful tubercular lesion in the apex of my left leg when I was X-rayed for spinal rheumatism recently.  Thanks to the mercy of God's Providence, it was not found 20 years ago or I might have been spending two years of my life on my back in a sanatorium.  Is it worth it?  Let us be practical about this.  The theory is that every person with a tuberculous lesion should be put to bed in a sanatorium for two years and yet on the most conservative basis, though that is prudent, is it practical politics? Would the Senator consider it the proper thing to do to-morrow?  He will agree with me that once a test reveals the presence of clinical tuberculosis, where there is a high probability of deterioration if it is left untreated and a very low probability of its being overcome if it is left, there should be available to every creature in this State, no matter how poor, how low or how insignificant, just as good a chance of shaking the disease off as there is to anyone.</P>
    <P>In exactly the same way, show me a way in which I can discern, in its early stages, a form of clinical tuberculosis with a degree of certainty that there is danger of deterioration, danger to the consumer of milk, danger of death, and I will come to Oireachtas Eireann for any power necessary to authorise me to proceed with elimination of that type of beast.  But do not suggest that, unless I ask the Dáil to order that every beast in the country who reacts to tuberculin test must be slaughtered, I am failing to do so for a mercenary reason, and am sending to death a neighbour's child in order to save money, if I do not proceed to act now. Do not tell me that I am accepting the standards of lowly, peasant, ignorant peoples, inferior to those in Canada or elsewhere&mdash;because, despite the decorum of the Seanad, I am damned if I will listen to that kind of tripe in silence.</P>
    <P>Some Senator desired a more full <Col N="1156" /> expose of the veterinary services already available and regretted that the Minister confined himself to these problems.  He made a great mistake if he imagined that the veterinary services are confined to the topics to which I thought it proper to refer to-day, but I may be allowed to give these few statistical details, in part answer to the queries that were addressed to me.  One Senator inquired as to number of units now available to deal with bacillary white diarrhoea in fowl. This time 15 months ago, we had none; then we had ten, and now we have 20. We feel that we have equipment now to cover effectively every supply farm in Ireland.  If the expanding fowl situation should require further units, they will be trained and provided, but we propose to see what 20 units will cater for.  If 30 or 40 become necessary, they will be provided; but while we resolve to provide all that is necessary efficiently to complete the task, it would be a mistake, I think, to waste public money on ostentation.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly makes a good, rousing speech, not caring very much whether his observations are coherent or not.  He said I paid less respectful attention to what he said in Carrick-on-Shannon. I felt like murmuring: &ldquo;Et tu, Brute&rdquo;, as I think he asked me at Carrick-on-Shannon to make good veterinary provision for the residents of Mohill.</P>

      <P>I should be very sorry to criticise the Minister for any good he has done and I would not do it.  I quite honestly advocated the tuberculin test.  The Minister stated something with which I did not agree and I based my argument here on what he said, although I did not accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator must have been suffering from some tinnitus in the ear.  The real source of tuberculosis amongst cattle in this country is, as I think Senator Counihan said, very largely inadequate winter feeding, because, unhappily, our people have a most deplorable tradition of allowing their cattle very nearly to die of starvation and it is a regular, common phrase in the whole dairying industry: &ldquo;Did the cows not come out to the grass in great fettle?  Of course, it was a soft winter,&rdquo; the presumption being that, if the Lord Almighty did not provide the wherewithal to keep them alive at the butt of the ditch, they would get it nowhere else.  There is that deplorable tradition that our people have the idea that, if a cow is amply provided for with abundant grass from March until October, she ought pretty nearly to live on her own fat, with the result that you get, particularly in the calving cow, a very low condition which undoubtedly is conducive to tubercular infection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remedy for that is not the purchase of expensive feeding-stuffs but simply to ensile grass, and that can be done in a hole in the ground.  There is no expense, no equipment wanted and no investment of capital.  If they will <Col N="1158" /> dig a pit silo, put the grass into it and pile the clay on top, they will have for the feeding of their cattle a better food than any imported concentrate whencesoever they bring it and whatever they pay for it.  If they are not able to do it and if they will only be good enough to let me know, I will be happy to send a man down so that he may do it for them, so that he may show them how to do it and stay with them until I have satisfied myself that they all know how to do it for evermore&mdash;with molasses or without molasses, with A.I.V. or without A.I.V. plain or in any other way they want to make it.  We have a most versatile body of instructors in the Department and we are looking for people to ask them to come. I propose to put an outpost in every three parishes in Ireland, so that the people will become familiar with them moving about and so that we will get over their seeming reluctance to call upon their salaried servants to do the work.  So far as their salaried servants are concerned, we want to go and our only difficulty is that we cannot find enough people to ask us to do for them the things we could do, if they would permit us to serve them.  One of the most important things is to learn how to make grass ensilage and replace imported concentrated feeding-stuffs.</P>
    <P>There is another vital consideration and we have some statistics to support it.  Fifty per cent. of the calves which die in this country from natural causes every winter&mdash;I am omitting the calf factories because they used to take their toll one day&mdash;die from lack of feeding, because it is true to say that husk is a disease of hunger.  Husk is a parasitic disease, but the universal experience is that if you bring a calf suffering from the husk parasite in, keep him in and feed him oats and milk, his own constitution will overcome the parasite.  If the calf is moribund when you bring him in, he will not come back to life, but nobody need miss the husky calf.  You can detect hoose at a very early stage if a young calf is coughing painfully.  Bring him in and keep him in and that is where 90 per cent. of them go wrong&mdash;they bring them in at night and let them out in the day.  Bring him in and keep him in; give him milk and oats and he <Col N="1159" /> will shake off the parasite.  That one gesture without the intervention of vet, or anybody else will prevent 50 per cent. of the calf mortality every winter. For stomach worms, for fluke, we have specifics, and not a single beast need die if every calf, as a precautionary measure, is treated in July or August for stomach worms and fluke.  They are two specific remedies, and, if repeated a second time during the year, not a single calf need die.  If those three simple precautions could be taken 85 per cent. of all the calves that die each winter could be reared.</P>
    <P>Here, in my opinion, is one of the really effective contributions we are going to be able to make right now to the ultimate elimination of tuberculosis, that is, under the farm buildings scheme, to bring home to our people the knowledge that, in North Dakota, where the temperature can fall to 40 below zero, cattle have been milked in open and heated sheds side by side and to date no difference in the milk yield has been discerned.  If we could get our people to substitute for the traditional pattern of cowshed, the dark, four-walled shed with the dirty cobbled floor and inadequate window, a three-walled milking shed with the back wall directed towards the prevailing rainy wind, and to milk their cattle and feed their cattle always under shelter in the open, I do not think there is any more effective measure we could take for the reduction of the incidence of tuberculosis amongst cattle.</P>

      <P>You would bring out a hot-water bottle and sit them on it. One way in which we in public life can make our contribution to this matter, and I appeal to Senators to help me, is when talking to the farmers, to try and convince them that there is nothing old-maidish, fussy or silly in sending for the veterinary surgeon if a cow coughs.  There is the cough which we all get to know caused by a grain going against the cow's breath and which will be ignored.  The <Col N="1160" /> wise man knows there is a difference between the tuberculous cough and the other kinds.  There is the type of man who will not send for the vet., but surely the one thing a sensible man will do when a cough develops is to send for the county vet.  By doing that he would give valuable help to us in our efforts to eradicate tuberculosis. If you can persuade him that it is not old-maidish, silly or stupid to do this and that he is doing a sensible thing it will go a long way to contributing to the desperate problem confronting us.</P>
      <P>I am not sorry to have had this chance of saying a few words about the views of this Government on tuberculosis and of saying how bitterly I would resent any suggestion that this Government would withhold anything on monetary grounds which would put in jeopardy the life of the child of any person, rich or poor, in order to save the money.</P>

      <P>Before returning the Bill to the Dáil I would say I welcome the Minister's announcement that he is going to increase the veterinary services. However, having listened to part of the discussion I have changed my mind and I have concluded that it is not necessary to increase our veterinary services at all because we have had such a very elementary lesson on the care of stock for the last half-hour, and I think as a result there is no need to go to the expense of more vets, in the country.</P>

    <P>The Minister in the course of his closing statement made reference to the farm buildings scheme, and I am glad he appreciates the importance of this scheme.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, it will be seen, deals with a number of matters which, while unrelated to one another, have the feature in common of dealing in one way or another with electricity supply.</P>
      <P>The first matter to which I may refer are the provisions relating to general regulations under Sections 33 and 34 of the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1927. The board are empowered to make regulations for various purposes and did in fact make regulations in matters relating to the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity When made, the board found that the absence of any specific provision in regard to the publication of the regulations made by it created a position in which any of its regulations would not be judicially noticed in the courts.  It would, accordingly, be necessary for the secretary of the board to prove the regulations in a court of law on each occasion on which they might come into reference.</P>
      <P>Apart from these considerations, it has for long been regarded as objectionable in principle that the board should be enabled to make regulations enforceable mainly against itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object, therefore, of Section 2 of the Bill is to enable the board to make regulations for various necessary purposes and, having made them, to submit them to the Minister for Industry <Col N="1163" /> and Commerce who may then, if he approves the regulations so made, by Order confirm them.  This procedure has at least a double advantage. Firstly, confirmation by Order gives the regulations the force of law and, secondly, since the Order and the regulations attached to it as a schedule will be published as a statutory instrument under the imprint of the Stationery Office production of a copy of the Order must, in accordance with the provisions of the Documentary Evidence Act, be accepted <i>prima facie</i> in any proceedings before a court as being a true and valid copy of the regulations as made and confirmed.  The Bill also provides in Section 17 and a schedule for the repeal of Sections 33 and 34 of the Act of 1927 referred to earlier.  It may be pointed out that every Order made by the Minister confirming these regulations will be laid on the table of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Another important matter dealt with in the Bill is the establishment of a tribunal to arbitrate in the case of disputes which may arise between general employees of the board and the board. This tribunal will be on exactly the same lines as that for manual workers which was set up under the provisions of the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act of 1942.  The experience of that tribunal to date shows that it has functioned smoothly and effectively and has been the means of removing many possible causes of friction between the board and its manual workers in regard to conditions of employment.  It should also be noted that the representatives of the general employees of the board have by an overwhelming majority voted in favour of the establishment of such a tribunal.</P>
    <P>In the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942, the board has power to pay allowances supplementary to the pension payable from the board's pension schemes to employees transferred from the services of other electricity undertakings with pension rights at the date of their transfer.  It has similar powers in regard to certain elderly employees recruited directly to the board's service and at the date of the passing of <Col N="1164" /> the Superannuation Act in 1942 were over 40 years of age.  By reason of their age at the date of the establishment of the pension scheme the rate of contribution required of them was very high and the maximum benefits obtainable by them were less than the maximum benefits normally payable under the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in the present Bill to give both these classes of employees power to seek a declaration from the board as to the extent to which it intends to apply its discretionary powers in regard to supplementary allowances when these employees are due for retirement on pension.</P>
    <P>The next matter to be considered is Section 9 which deals with the superannuation of certain persons formerly employed by local bodies.</P>
    <P>Provision was made in the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, that on the acquisition by the Electricity Supply Board of an undertaking formerly owned and administered by a local authority the pension rights of any employees who possessed such rights at the time of the transfer should be preserved to them in respect of their service with the former undertaker.  In other words, they were to suffer no loss of pensionable service by reason of their transfer.</P>
    <P>In the year 1929 the Electricity Supply Board acquired certain electricity undertakings owned by local authorities, notably those of Rathmines, Pembroke and Dún Laoghaire and on acquisition the electricity staffs of those authorities became employees of the board.  Those employees had no pension rights at the time of transfer. Subsequently, the urban districts of Rathmines and Pembroke were merged in the Dublin County Borough and that of Dún Laoghaire with other local authorities in the newly formed Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  Following this rearrangement the employees of the various bodies constituting these new authorities who possessed no pension rights up to then acquired them under the statutory provisions covering the mergers, both in respect of their service with the dissolved authorities and such later service as they might have with the newly created boroughs. These benefits did not, however, extend <Col N="1165" /> to those of the former employees of the dissolved bodies who had, prior to the mergers, been transferred to and entered the service of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>At a much later stage the responsibility for public lighting in the Rathmines, Pembroke and Dun Laoghaire areas, which had been assumed by the Electricity Supply Board on its acquisition of the relevant electricity undertakings was, by arrangement, retransferred to the two boroughs concerned and, in consequence, a certain number of the former employees of the Rathmines, Pembroke and Dun Laoghaire Urban Councils who had been engaged upon maintenance of public lighting were retransferred to the service of the bodies which had succeeded the urban councils, namely, the Boroughs of Dublin and Dun Laoghaire.  By the provisions of the Local Authorities (Electrical Employees) Act, 1937, the employees so retransferred were given the benefit of their (i) past service with the local authorities; and (ii) service whilst with the board; and (iii) later and future service with the relevant boroughs, the aggregate service under the three heads counting for pension purposes on ultimate retirement.</P>
    <P>Those of the transferred employees who had no option but to remain in the service of the board made representations pointing out that their former colleagues who at no time had left the service of the local authorities concerned, and, more particularly, those who had been transferred with them to the service of the board and later retransferred to the two boroughs, had acquired pension rights for their entire aggregate service whilst they who were still in the service of the board had obtained no such corresponding rights. Following these representations, which were supported by the board and by the Arbitration Tribunal established under the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942, it has been decided that it would be only fair and equitable to give to the transferred employees remaining in the service of the board the same pension rights as have been acquired by their former colleagues.  The number of persons <Col N="1166" /> concerned is 32 and the cost, which will be borne by the board, will be relatively small.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill relates to the superannuation of certain persons who were employed at the Pigeon House generating station when it was closed down following its acquisition by the board and is framed to meet the case of a few former employees of the Dublin Corporation who were compensated by means of lump sum gratuities on the termination of their employment by the board following the acquisition by the board of the Pigeon House generating station.  Other such employees who had longer service at the relevant time were compensated by way of pension in respect of their service up to the closing of the station.  At a subsequent stage the board found it necessary to reopen and maintain continuously in commission the Pigeon House station, the former employees being reemployed.</P>
    <P>Those who had been compensated by way of pension were, on re-employment, paid at the appropriate rate for the work on which they were reemployed, the pension being abated during their employment.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out in the case of these persons that the break which had occurred in their service during the short period in which the Pigeon House station had been closed by the board operated to deprive them of the pension rights on ultimate retirement in respect of service after the reopening which they would otherwise have possessed under the Dublin Corporation pension scheme.  Provision was, accordingly, made in the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1942, to enable, on final retirement, the pension already awarded at the time of the closing of this station to be terminated and a fresh pension substituted, the latter being based upon the aggregate service: (a) up to the closing of the station, and (b) from the date of re-employment to the date of final retirement.</P>
    <P>The position of those persons employed at the station who had been compensated by means of gratuities has only recently been brought to notice and it is felt that these persons should not, through no fault of their <Col N="1167" /> own, be prejudiced by losing pension rights in respect of their service from the time of re-employment by the board.  In their case, however, since these persons were awarded lump sum gratuities in respect of their service up to the closing of the station it was felt when the Bill was drafted that credit could not be given for the service in respect of which the gratuity had been paid.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Committee Stage debate in the Dáil certain Deputies, however, referred to this fact and suggested that some means should be found whereby the previous service could be counted for pension purposes, and on the Report Stage in the Dáil I made an offer which, if accepted, could be given effect to by an amendment on the Committee Stage in the Seanad. Senators will appreciate that to give credit twice for the same period of service would introduce a most undesirable principle and possibly constitute a precedent which might have serious repercussions in other directions in the future.</P>
    <P>Briefly, I offered to count the prior years of service in respect of which gratuities had been paid if the persons concerned elected to take the benefits of the board's superannuation scheme and agreed to set off against the gratuity payable to them under the board's scheme on their final retirement the gratuity which was paid to them by way of compensation for loss of employment in 1930.  I propose to have this amendment introduced on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Committee Stage debate in the Dáil reference was made to the case of a few persons at present employed by the board who formerly had been employed by the Dublin United Tramway Company in connection with the generation or distribution of electricity by that company. These persons possessed no pension rights when in the employment of the company and had no such rights on their entry to the service of the board. Nevertheless, it was pressed upon me by various Deputies in the other House that had these men's employment with the company not been interrupted by <Col N="1168" /> reason of the company taking its requirements of electricity from the board and closing their own generating station they would have eventually qualified for a pension under the scheme now operated by Córas Iompair Éireann.  In this class also, I undertook to have the matter considered in the interval between the Committee and Report Stages of the Dáil, and having done so and having consulted the Electricity Supply Board I decided to make provision in the Bill to enable the board at its discretion to pay supplementary pensions to these former employees of the tramway company on the same basis as supplementary pensions are payable by the board to employees transferred from other electricity undertakings without pension rights or prospects of pension rights in their former employment.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942, enabled the board amongst other things to establish a superannuation scheme on a contributory basis for these manual workers.  It was provided in that Act that in the event of any manual worker through wilful action on his part causing an interruption in the generation, transmission or distribution of electricity by the board or impeding the due performance of any of the functions or duties of the board, penalties by way of loss of service and of contributions made by him to the superannuation fund would be imposed on him.  This &ldquo;penal&rdquo; clause as it has been called had many objectionable features and I decided during the course of the Bill through the Dáil to remove the penal clause for the 1942 Act.  Section 12 of this Bill removes those parts of Section 7 of the 1942 Act, while retaining the remaining provisions of that section.</P>
    <P>I come now to Section 13 of the Bill which amends sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Superannuation Act of 1942. Amongst other things, that Act authorised the payment of pensions to whole-time members of the board under certain conditions.  Under the provisions of the sub-section of the Act referred to, a member of the board, in order to qualify for a pension, must have at least ten years' whole-time service as a member and that service must include <Col N="1169" /> at least one term of office of five years as a whole-time member of the board. In the case of one existing member of the board who has served as a whole-time member since the 11th February, 1935, the various warrants under which he was appointed by the Government have been for the periods of four years; 77 days one year; three years; three years; one year; and the warrant at present in operation is also for one year only.  Consequently, having regard to the terms of sub-section (1) referred to this member of the board or any other member who might be similarly circumstanced would fail to qualify for a pension under the Act as it stands for the reason that he has not completed one term of office of five years as a whole-time member and this position would continue until he had the opportunity of completing at least one term of office of five years under one warrant.  It is considered that this limitation is inequitable and Section 13 of the Bill amends the provisions of the Act of 1942 so as to provide that a pension will be awarded (a) after not less than ten years' continuous whole-time membership, or (b) after two or more periods (whether continuous or discontinuous) of whole-time membership of the board which amount in the aggregate to not less than ten years and include at least one term of office of five years as a whole-time member of the board.</P>
    <P>This amendment, it will be appreciated, will enable any whole-time member of the board to qualify for a pension provided he has at least ten years' continuous whole-time membership and without having had one term of office of five years.  A member who has not had ten years' continuous service must have at least one term of office of five years' duration in an aggregate service of at least ten years.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill amends Section 8 of the Superannuation Act of 1942 which latter section relates to certain financial provisions in relation to superannuation schemes.  Under the section of the 1942 Act referred to the trustees of the superannuation fund set up under that Act may lend superannuation moneys to the board and the board may accept such loans, the rate of interest on which must be approved by <Col N="1170" /> the Minister for Finance.  The amendment provided for in this section of the Bill merely provides that the consent of the Minister for Finance to the interest rates will no longer be required, but in lieu of that consent provision is being made that the rate of interest shall not exceed 4 per cent. per annum.</P>
    <P>The superannuation funds and the contributions thereto and the benefits payable are calculated upon an actuarial basis and for this purpose it is essential that the actuary and management of the funds should be placed in a position to know that when they lend moneys to the board as an investment that a definite interest rate will be paid.  The funds in this case have, by agreement, been based upon an interest rate of 4 per cent. and this section of the Bill will authorise up to that rate to be paid on future loans.</P>
    <P>Section 15 amends Section 11 of the Superannuation Act, 1942, which relates to the reference of disputes to the Manual Workers' Tribunal.  Under the definition of the expression &ldquo;manual worker&rdquo; as set out in the Manual Workers' Superannuation Scheme made under the 1942 Act, workers whose employment is of a casual character are excluded and there is, therefore, no means by which disputes in which they are involved can be brought before this tribunal.  The effect of Section 16 of the Bill will be to enable the Manual Workers' Tribunal to deal with disputes in which such casual workers are involved.</P>
    <P>Section 16 increases the advances which may be made to the board from the Central Fund by £16,000,000. Capital Expenditure by the Electricity Supply Board is financed by means of repayable advances made to the board by the Minister for Finance from the Central Fund.  The limit up to which such advances may be made is fixed by the Electricity (Supply) Acts and that limit has been increased from time to time according as the undertaking has developed.  Provision must be made for future commitments.  As the demand for electricity expands and it becomes necessary to provide additional generating capacity, the means of transmitting and distributing that energy, and <Col N="1171" /> the services and assets auxiliary and ancillary to the supply of that energy, the statutory limit within which advances may be made must be increased so that the necessary capital expenditure may be financed.  The current capital programme of the board referred to below requires that provision for further advances be now made.</P>
    <P>The board has submitted an estimate of the capital required for its projected programme during the period to 31st March, 1952, including capital expenditure to which the board is already committed.  This programme envisages expenditure totalling £29,500,000 (allowing for the provisions for advances in the Act of 1945), viz.:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Having regard to the magnitude of the amount involved, and in view of the uncertainty as to the trend of prices and supplies of materials within the next few years, there would be no useful result in attempting at this stage to estimate with even approximate exactitude the capital expenditure which the board may find it necessary to incur in the period in question, or the advances which the board may require.  It is, however, abundantly clear that the board's development programme within the next few years will entail very substantial commitments, if the demand for electricity is to be adequately provided for, and it is, therefore, proposed in the Bill, as an interim measure until the situation becomes clearer, that the existing <Col N="1172" /> statutory limit of the advances which may be made for general development purposes be increased by £16,000,000. It is not proposed to provide in the Bill for further advances for rural electrification, as the existing limit of such advances is considered to be sufficient for the present.</P>
    <P>The remaining two sections of the Bill deal merely with the repeal of the provisions set out in the Schedule and the Short Title, Collective Citation, etc.  The repeal of Section 33 and 34 of the Act of 1927 is a necessary consequence of the provisions of Section 2 of the Bill.  As regards sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Superannuation Act, 1942, this sub-section of the 1942 Act, relates to a case in which a whole-time member of the board is entitled to a pension in respect of other and previous service, either with a public department or under a local authority, and has the following effect:&mdash;(a) if a Civil Service or local authority pension equals or exceeds the amount of any pension calculated under the Superannuation Act of 1942, the latter pension does not become payable, and (b) if a Civil Service or local authority pension happens to be less than the amount of any pension calculated under the Superannuation Act of 1942, only the difference between the two rates of pension may be paid.</P>
    <P>This provision of the 1942 Act affects one member of the present board who is entitled to receive a pension from a local authority in respect of his services with that authority before he was appointed to be a member of the Electricity Supply Board.  If the member in question had been allowed to complete 40 years' service with the local authority, his pension, under the Local Government Act, 1925, would have been very much higher than that which he was granted when he left the local authority to take up the appointment with the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>It is considered that, although the case is an exceptional one, if the Act of 1942 is not amended in the manner proposed, this member of the Electricity Supply Board will, on retirement, be prejudiced by reason of his transfer from a local authority to the Electricity Supply Board, and it is, therefore, proposed to remove the sub-section <Col N="1173" /> of Section 3 of the 1942 Act which precludes the payment of pension in respect of service with the board in the particular circumstances of this case.</P>
    <P>The Schedule also provides for the exclusion from Section 8 (3) (c) of the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act of 1942 of the words &ldquo;or by the board to such trustees&rdquo;.  The trustees of the superannuation funds find it convenient to lend the moneys in their hands to the board and regulations made by the Minister under the Act mentioned provide for the repayment of such moneys on 90 days' notice by either party.  It has been represented by the board, the trustees, and the matter was also raised in the Dáil on an amendment by Deputy Larkin, that it is desirable that the board should be in a position to give a guarantee to the trustees that they will hold the moneys lent to the board for a reasonably long term, so that for actuarial purposes stable conditions over a period may be assured.  The deletion of the words referred to will enable the board to do this.</P>
    <P>The third matter dealt with in the Schedule is consequential on the deletion of the penal clause from the 1942 Act.</P>

      <P>We welcome this Bill, mainly because it makes provision for the setting up of an organisation which we hope will eliminate any possibility of a stoppage in the supply of such an important essential as electricity.  The Bill will be regarded by all members as one which can be more properly dealt with in Committee and I do not think there is very much we need say at this stage, except in so far as the title of the Bill suggests that we might be able to have a discussion on the importance of electricity for our people.  It is essential, if we are to develop the industrial arm here, that we should have cheap power.  There are many people who will agree with me that we have not got that cheap power and it might be in the national interest that we should have an inquiry into the present organisation, with a view to seeing whether we can provide something which is so essential not alone in the lives of the ordinary <Col N="1174" /> people but in the development of the country's resources, at a much cheaper rate than at present.</P>
      <P>We have had the experience of local organisations which were supplying light and power which were taken over by what one might describe as a nationalised board, with the result that charges were increased.  We have at present on foot a scheme to give light and power to the people in rural Ireland, and, to my mind, it is not going to achieve its object because of the charges demanded by the Electricity Supply Board.  We have, first, the installation charges, which, if compared with the prices of local contractors, will be found to be rather exorbitant.  We have, then, the charge in relation to floor space.  We all know that, in rural Ireland, the houses had large kitchens, where, before we introduced the Dance Halls Act, our people had their little dances and, in addition, there was ample accommodation for farm animals of every kind.  We find now that the charges by the Electricity Supply Board are based on floor space and I think that, if an investigation were made into the matter, some more equitable system could be devised whereby we could provide power and light at a more reasonable charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill makes provision for the workers in general.  It sets out to guard against strikes and against the curtailment of the supply of electricity and sets up an organisation similar to that which has been set up already in relation to other of the board's employees. If, however, we look at the 1927 Act, we find there a very peculiar section.  Section 3 provides that no member of the Electricity Supply Board can become a member of this or the other House.  While I agree&mdash;and it has already been embodied in legislation&mdash;that no member of a board set up by the Oireachtas should be a member of this or the other House, I would go so far as to say that it is not in keeping with the Constitution to put such a disqualification into this Bill in relation to an employee because he happens to be employed by a particular organisation or association.  Looking at it from the point of view of the membership of this House, we have here what we hope is a vocational Seanad. <Col N="1175" /> If there is in the employment of the Electricity Supply Board, as I am sure there is, a member of the engineering profession who would be a very efficient member of the House, I do not think that, because he happens to be an employee of the Electricity Supply Board, he should be debarred from being nominated to this House by the profession he represents and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into that matter and see whether that impediment could be removed.</P>

      <P>Surely, in Section 16, there is a sum of £8,000,000 allotted for the provision of additional rural electrification.  We have an extensive body operating and doing all that is necessary in regard to the provision of electricity and we are apt to look on these bodies as highly efficient.  Perhaps they are, but it is well to remember that when we have a body such as the Electricity Supply Board, a body that we find difficult to question and about which the only information we have is that which the Electricity Supply Board itself gives us, I think that while I am not casting any reflection on the Electricity Supply Board, it is well to remember that the outsider is not in a position to judge how these boards or concerns are managed.  In these matters, we have no means of getting down to detailed information other than that supplied by the Electricity Supply Board and such bodies in the normal way and published for the use of those interested.  I think that is very important because the tendency has been with the growth of extern boards as they get bigger and bigger, to give just the same amount of information each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a pity in hydro-electric development where we see very fine bits of engineering and interesting and <Col N="1176" /> sometimes very beautiful work that we have the whole effect spoiled for a ha'porth of tar.  It is only natural, especially in high-fall hydro-electric that that has to be found in beauty spots.  It is necessary to develop these high falls where you can get them because it gives you the cheapest electricity for the water available, but is there any reason why we should give complete freedom to engineers to go in and unnecessarily interfere with a beauty spot?</P>
    <P>We have at Poulaphouca a very nice piece of concrete work, but on top of it we have an abominable erection&mdash;a dam, and alongside it we have what has been aptly described as a bloated tin dustbin for research work.  In projected works published by the Electricity Supply Board, they are going to develop the Lee and eventually Tore waterfall.  I suggest we should keep one waterfall in this country as a specimen for posterity.  I suggest that the Electricity Supply Board should be asked to consider that Tore will be preserved for future generations so that the coming children will not have to look at the dictionary for a description of a waterfall.  Looking around the country I am horrified at the way some of the rural network has gone up.  I see quite constantly poles going up all over the countryside, and for economy these poles have been placed regardless of the field system.  I suggest that the country and farming operations will be hampered seriously by poles placed close to a hedge.  They should be either in the hedge or in the middle of a field, and some consideration should be given to the question of the field system.</P>

      <P>I think there is in some cases a tendency by the Electricity Supply Board to operate in a rather arbitrary manner.  It is convenient for their engineers, who because they are not under Parliamentary control, to go ahead with engineering proclivities which might otherwise be curtailed.  I would like to support Senator Hawkins, who said we should <Col N="1177" /> look into the question of the charge which is being made for electricity. Is it excessive?  Can it be reduced? We should see whether these charges are really excessive and if we can do anything to make them more acceptable to the small user.</P>
      <P>It is quite true that the two-part tariff system is probably the soundest from the point of view of the generating company.  It gets a fixed income and charge for current is low, but I notice that in the rural areas it is very difficult to get people to understand the reason for it, to accept it and to be prepared to pay, as they put it, regularly, for electricity whether they use it or not.  No doubt, as rural electrification extends, the person in the country will be more amenable to the two-part tariff system but I find extreme opposition to it.</P>
      <P>I was wondering whether the Electricity Supply Board are putting over their work in rural areas quite as efficiently as it might.  We see in a town an all-electric house as a feature.  I have yet to see an all-electric farmyard in operation as an advertisement. It would be a very useful thing to have and it might be used to try out machinery.</P>
      <P>I have been critical.  I do not want it to be thought that I am critical of the Electricity Supply Board because I do not like what it is doing.  So, let me finish on a note which is not of criticism.  I notice that the Electricity Supply Board has flooded Lower Fitzwilliam Street with offices.  I am very glad to observe that they have left the 18th century character of the frontage and they have not tried, in a utilitarian concern, to bring chromium-plated horrors around their doorways.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been so improved during its passage in the other House that there is very little, to my mind in any case, deserving criticism here, except of a favourable character.  We are all very pleased at the setting-up of this tribunal to avoid risk of strikes in a very essential national service but I was wondering if it really was necessary in a tribunal covering 400 or 500 <Col N="1178" /> people, to give the tribunal the power to examine on and administer oaths and to give them in many respects all the powers of the High Court.  The findings of this tribunal are not binding on either side.  We hope they will always be accepted.  But, why the necessity for this?  The Railway Wages Board, covering an immensely greater number of people, which has been in operation for 26 years, has no such provision whatever and there has been only one official strike in the whole of that 26 years, both sides having accepted its findings on all but one occasion.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of the superannuation fund, the Parliamentary Secretary has referred to the provision whereby the trustees of the fund may lend moneys to the board and the board have the right to pay up to 4 per cent. interest on the loans.  The actuarial soundness of the fund depends absolutely on not less than 4 per cent. being paid on all its investments. There is no compulsion on the board to accept the whole of the advances that will be available and if at any time the board did not accept the whole of the surplus then the trustees would have to seek an investment elsewhere and, at the present price of money, would certainly not be able to get 4 per cent. on a gilt-edged security.  To that extent, the fund would become actuarially unsound and both the board and its employees would have to pay higher contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity, I think, that the practice which has been adopted in all the railways on the other side of the Channel was not adopted instead.  In their case what happens is that the railway companies guarantee a minimum of 4 per cent. on the whole of the investments of the funds regardless of where they are invested.  They must be invested in gilt-edged securities.  In fact, very little of them are invested in railway stocks.  They are invested elsewhere but, to the extent that they do not earn 4 per cent., the companies make up the amount by way of special contribution. If that system was instituted as far as the Electricity Supply Board is concerned, the actuarial soundness of the fund would be far more real than it can be in a position <Col N="1179" /> in which there is no compulsion on them to accept any advance, or in which they may find that there is no necessity for the money sought to be advanced to them, which would be available every month or in which they may, if they so desire, get money elsewhere at less than 4 per cent.  However, I take it that, with a board composed of people who desire to make the fund a success, they will do their very utmost to continue this arrangement.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect regarding the spread of the network which is of some importance.  As far as I can gather, the board will not advance the network, as far as towns are concerned, at any rate, unless they find that it is a paying proposition, that they are able to recover the interest on the capital expended. For geographical and other reasons, some towns can look forward to a very dark and dismal future in that connection.  I have one example, the best I know, that is, the town of Castletown Berehaven in County Cork. The nearest part of the network is Glengarriff, 19 miles away.  The whole population of the town have been pressing for the extension of the network to Castletown but they are informed by the board that it would cost £11,000 to extend it across the mountains from Glengarriff and that the return they could expect would render that expenditure entirely uneconomic. The country in between will not be exploited for years to come, apparently, under the rural electrification scheme because, again, of the small return that might be expected, with the result that that 19 miles between the end of the network and the town of Castletown-berehaven, which itself has too big a population to come under the rural electrification scheme, must exist without electricity.</P>
    <P>These people have been terribly heavily hit economically for historical reasons.  They lived largely on the British fleet when it was there and on a garrison in Bere Island.  They have neither power nor light now and they are not likely to have it under the present policy, so that nothing but decay can face the residents of that town.  As this is a community service, <Col N="1180" /> I would suggest that a town of that size should not be deprived of electricity service any more than it would be deprived of postal service because it would be difficult to deliver over a terrain of that kind.  It is carrying the commercial side of the proposition a little bit too far to insist on that principle being applied in a particular case of that kind which, for historical and geographical reasons, requires special consideration.  I know that the board is master of its own affairs in matters of that kind.  I do not know to what extent a suggestion from the Minister would induce them to try and make a special case of Castletown.  There are probably other towns, too, but Castletown is the one I know best.  I think it would be a terrible hardship and a matter of injustice if they are to be deprived indefinitely of a great national service like that of electricity.</P>

      <P>I wish to bring to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary a letter which appeared in to-day's <i>Irish Independent.</i>  I have not a copy of the newspaper by me.  I admit frankly that the letter is not germane in the middle but it is rather important.  It is in connection with a threat by the Electricity Supply Board to erect a transformer station in St. Kevin's Churchyard.  That is one of the most historic places in Dublin.  The remains of the martyred Archbishop Dermot O'Hurley rest there.  I had the honour to write his life and I am naturally interested and perhaps I will, therefore, be excused for introducing the matter.  It would be a great pity that holy ground, in which we shall all, perhaps, rest some day, should not be given the reverence that is due to it. I think that it is just a matter of drawing the attention of the Electricity Supply Board to the feelings that would be aroused if their desire to erect a transformer station there is persisted in.</P>

      <P>We are all in favour of settlement of disputes by arbitration.  In so far as this Bill proposes to set up a tribunal for the adjustment of disputes between the Electricity Supply Board and employees <Col N="1181" /> by arbitration we must support it.  While it is practically certain that all disputes will be brought before the tribunal by one side or the other, you have thus compulsory arbitration. It is not made clear in the Bill&mdash;at least to me&mdash;whether the decision arrived at by the tribunal must be accepted or not.  I can see nothing in the Bill which makes acceptance of the decision compulsory or which provides for any alternative course, if turned down.  I see that the tribunal can, at its own discretion, refer any dispute&mdash; before it inquires into it&mdash;to, we assume, the Labour Court.  The Labour Court can be asked to adjudicate.  We know the rules governing a Labour Court decision but, where the matter is not referred to the Labour Court, as far as I can make out no provision is made in the Bill for any other stage if the decision of the tribunal to one side or the other is unsatisfactory.  I may be in error but that point has yet to be cleared up.</P>
      <P>I need not go into the question of what disputes will come before them. Other matters, I think, arise on this Bill.  While we are strongly in favour of the adjustment of disputes by arbitration and while this Bill provides for arbitration between the board and its employees it confers on the same board arbitrary powers over the public and the public have not the right of appeal. They have not even any right against the Electricity Supply Board.  Under Section 2, the board may make regulations for any purpose connected with the generation, transmission, distribution or use of electricity.  They may do anything they desire to do that&mdash;subject, of course, to the fact that the Minister may subsequently say he does not like it and refer it back.  But it is purely a matter between the Minister and the board.  The rights and desires of the public are nowhere taken into account in this Bill.  Presumably the Minister would be acting on behalf of the public but there is no provision here under which the public dislike or resentment towards a proposed Order can be brought to his notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be rather far-fetched but I can give this instance.  Remember that the board may make regulations for <Col N="1182" /> any purpose connected with the generation, transmission, distribution or use of electricity.  The board, if it so desires, could under that clause declare that only certain types of electrical machinery would be used in any house and that only certain makes of electrical machines would be used.  They could render all existing machinery not of that specified make obsolete and impose a penalty for continuing to use it.  I am not saying they would do that but they would have the power to do so.  I dislike giving statutory or semi-State bodies too much power because they will always use it.  I am afraid we are drifting too rapidly into a form of police State here.  That is borne out by the fact, referred to by other Senators, that this tribunal, when set up, has power to call for evidence on oath, to demand documents and to insist on the attendance of anybody it so desires&mdash;and contempt or refusal to obey these orders will be treated as contempt of court and a statutory penalty not exceeding £10 is to be imposed. I do not know what right any board will have&mdash;if it be not a properly constituted law court&mdash;to insist that I should go and regard these people who are set up haphazardly, as if they were judges of the High Court and that I must bow and kowtow to them, do what they say and, if they decide, pay a fine.  I might be asked before that tribunal, a mere householder, to give evidence on oath that I saw an employee of the Electricity Supply Board working, or not working, in a certain place at a certain time.  I might say that that is not my business. If I saw that a man in a certain place was not working, well, he may have had some reason for it.  Why should I be brought into it?  Unjust as it may seem, I may be asked if I saw this man smoking a pipe, say, at a certain time &mdash;and be penalised if I refuse to answer the question.</P>
    <P>It is provided that this tribunal shall arrange its own remuneration.  No indication is given as to how these gentlemen shall remunerate themselves. Indeed, in relation to the tribunal, the expenses shall be defrayed by the board as part of the general expenses of the board.  There is no indication as to what salaries or remuneration <Col N="1183" /> they will give themselves but there is a hint that they ought not be too generous with the employees.  In Section 5, the tribunal is reminded that in determining a dispute in relation to rates of remuneration they must have regard to the principle that the men employed by the board have constant work and certain pension rights&mdash;which is a hint to the effect that these men are better off at the present time than the fellows outside.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins mentioned an important matter.  This is a statutory body but it is not a part of the Civil Service proper.  Yet members of the staff of the Electricity Supply Board are debarred from becoming&mdash;if the people want to elect them&mdash;members of the Dáil or of the Seanad.  I think they should have that right.  In this age when more and more people are calling out for more and more socialisation you may find dozens of other semi-State bodies set up, including a railway State authority.  You will find that four-fifths of the population are, accordingly, in State employment and are, therefore, not eligible to make the laws of the State.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made to the cost of electricity and I think everyone will agree as to the necessity for having a cheap supply, for power purposes especially, and I think also that a number of people will agree that in this country it is more expensive than in any other country I know of.  It seems to me that this is due entirely to the method of financing the Electricity Supply Board.  As I understand it, we make these million pound advances on the understanding that eventually not only the interest must be paid but the capital must be repaid.  I do not know whether any of that capital advance has been repaid yet.  It might be unorthodox to ask why should we repay capital and should it not be sufficient to pay interest. If the capital is not being repaid now, when will it be repaid? In 30 or 40 years' time, when it will be of no interest to us?  As we are repaying it to ourselves and electricity is an essential commodity, might not only the <Col N="1184" /> interest be repaid?  It may be unorthodox on my part to make that suggestion, but I cannot understand why it should be necessary to repay the capital.</P>

      <P>There are not many matters that require to be dealt with, but I think, as Senator O'Farrell said, the Bill has been substantially improved in the course of its passage through the Dáil.  There was general agreement in the Dáil as to the changes made and it was in response to suggestions or amendments put down by Deputies that these alterations were subsequently made on the Report Stage and I think the Bill has been substantially improved as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hawkins and a number of Senators referred to general electrical development in use with particular reference to the charges.  The use of electricity has far outstripped anything that was contemplated.  Even the most optimistic forecast at the time of the establishment of the Shannon scheme did not expect that the amount of electricity would be used that is used at the present time.  In fact, one of the major criticisms of the Shannon scheme was that in was too big, too ambitious, for the country and should <Col N="1185" /> have been started on a smaller river or on a smaller scale.  Of course, time has altered that and we realise now that not only was the Shannon scheme inadequate for the present demand for electricity, but that even with the Poulaphouca scheme and later the Erne and other schemes which are contemplated, certainly not for a considerable period will the Electricity Supply Board be able to meet the demand for electricity.  Generally the charges for electricity are 40 per cent. higher now than in 1939.  Taking everything into consideration, I think that that increase bears a favourable comparison with the increases which have taken place in the cost of many commodities including most of the items which the Electricity Supply Board requires for the development and extension of electricity supply.</P>
    <P>It is true, as Senators remarked and as Deputies remarked in the Dáil, that there is no effective method by which either Deputies or Senators or for that matter the public can question the actual charges with the exception of the annual accounts which are published and laid on the Tables of both Houses or on an occasion when an amending Bill or a Bill which deals with the Electricity Supply Board comes before the Oireachtas.  At any rate, however, once a year Deputies and Senators can question the activities of the board and also the charges for electric current when the accounts are laid on the Table.  It is true that on comparing charges here with charges elsewhere, in a number of countries electricity is cheaper, but taking into consideration the cost, I think that at the present time 40 per cent. higher than in 1939 cannot be regarded as excessive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hawkins mentioned the fact that under Section 3 of the 1927 Act members of the board or employees are debarred from nomination to the Dáil or Seanad and from sitting in either <Col N="1186" /> House.  The question of political activities on the part of members of State companies is one which has received consideration in both Houses from time to time, mainly when statutory companies were being set up or when some additional powers were being conferred on existing companies.  It is not quite the same now as it was when the Electricity Supply Act was passed in 1927. The number of statutory companies at that time was extremely small, but whether it is wise to allow members or employees of State companies to take an active part in political life is a question which, I think, would require mature consideration.  Elsewhere, particularly in Britain, the practice generally is that if such a person is elected to Parliament he ceases to take any part in the activities of the State company.</P>
    <P>Of course, the growth of State companies has been much more rapid in recent times, but in some instances the person concerned resigned.  On the other hand, it is a rather unusual proviso in the 1927 Act which debars employees and members of the board from nomination.  It is obvious that if members or employees of public companies are to take an active part in politics there is a danger that that would react on the efficiency of the particular company.  I think there are a good many considerations both pro and con in the point which the Senator made, but I must say that in view of the fact that it has been raised here and in view of the reference by, I think, Senator S. O'Farrell as well, I will have the matter considered.  In the first instance it would be a matter for the Government, but I think that in general active participation by employees or members of State companies would not have desirable results from the point of view of the efficiency of these bodies, and for that reason any material change is unlikely at the present time.</P>
    <P>Senator Orpen referred to the question of beauty spots being altered to the detriment of their scenic value by the activities of the board.  I can only say to him that I will bring his remarks to the notice of the board but I imagine that in matters of that kind the board <Col N="1187" /> adheres to the necessity for taking steps rather than to considerations of retaining in its existing character a waterfall or area of the country.</P>
    <P>Senator J.T. O'Farrell referred to the wide powers which the tribunal has.  It is true that it has wide powers which in general are only granted to bodies on which there is legal representation, but the particular functions relate only to the employment of staff under the board and for that reason it is confined to a very narrow ambit.  It is governed by Section 11 of the 1942 Act, which this Bill alters only in so far as this new tribunal includes workers who were not considered under the tribunal established under the 1942 Act.</P>
    <P>The Senator also said the railway companies guaranteed 4 per cent. and in the event of the funds not earning that money they make up the difference. The Senator is, no doubt, aware that the superannuation fund established under the 1942 Act was unusual in so far as it was set up many years after the board had been established. A number of employees who had entered the service of the board or who probably had previous service with other electricity undertakings, were advanced in years and consequently the rates of contribution were high for a number of them.  In order to retain the fund in a sound position, they actually estimated that 4 per cent. on the money was essential.  It was in order to meet that position and to allay any apprehension which the trustees had that the amendment was made to which I refer, under which the board may now pay up to 4 per cent.  Formerly, the sanction of the Minister for Finance had to be obtained.  Under this Bill, that sanction is no longer required and the board can pay up to a maximum of 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>I will have the point raised by Senator Mrs. Concannon brought to the attention of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did not answer the <Col N="1188" /> point I made.  Does he think it wise to give the board such wide powers over the public, who have no appeal whatever?

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator knows, the regulations which may be made by the board in future must be laid on the Table of both Houses.  First of all, they must be put up to the Minister, who may approve or disapprove.  If a regulation had any power in it of the nature referred to by the Senator, or if it reacted unfavourably, in the opinion of the Minister, on the public, he could reject it himself; but assuming the Minister passed it and a Deputy or Senator considered it was unnecessarily restrictive on the activities of the individual or interfered with the right of people to choose their form of equipment, then when the regulation comes before the Dáil or Seanad it can be rejected.  In actual practice, the power to make regulations has been vested in the board over a long period and generally, I think, those powers are exercised in a reasonable manner. The board has to take into consideration questions of safety, suitability of equipment, and so on, but in so far as regulations are concerned in the future, they must be laid on the Table of both Houses.</P>

    <Title>Trade Union Bill, 1949&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave) Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Trade Union Act of 1941 made it unlawful for any body of persons, with certain specific exceptions, to carry on negotiations for the fixing of wages or other conditions of employment without a negotiation licence issued under the Act.  For the first time, trade unions engaging in such negotiations were required to make and maintain large deposits with the High Court.  This is a condition of the grant of a negotiation licence and the amount of the deposit depends on the numerical strength of the trade union concerned.  The scale of deposits is laid down in the Schedule to the Act.  Where the number of members does not exceed 500, the amount prescribed is £1,000; the appropriate sum for a trade union having 1,000 members is £1,400 and the scale gradually ascends to a maximum of £10,000 for the largest organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was foreseen in 1941 that, on account of the prevailing abnormal conditions, some of the Irish trade unions would be unable to make the full deposit, specified by the Schedule to the Act, and it was, therefore, deemed necessary to make provision for a variation of the requirements in favour of such cases.  Accordingly, Section 8 of the Act conferred the necessary power to grant temporary relief to trade unions registered in this State where it was established in any particular case that, on account of abnormal conditions <Col N="1190" /> due to the war, undue hardship would ensue if the trade union were compelled to make and keep with the High Court the full deposit.  This relief extended to a maximum of 75 per cent. of the sum mentioned in the Schedule, but the power to grant it was exercisable only while the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, was in force.</P>
    <P>Reduction Orders in pursuance of the provisions of this section had been made in several cases.  These Orders, however, would have expired on the 2nd September, 1947, and the trade unions concerned would then have been required, under the Act of 1941, to raise their deposits to the appropriate sum mentioned in the Schedule.  Moreover, since the repeal of the Emergency Powers Act, any trade union applying for a negotiation licence would have been required to make and maintain the full deposit whatever its circumstances may be.</P>
    <P>After conversations with the representatives of the trade union organisations it was held that the circumstances which necessitated the relieving provisions in the Act of 1941 had not materially changed, and that the withdrawal of the concession, at that time, would impose hardship and in some cases might have the effect of disqualifying trade unions from holding negotiation licences already granted.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Trade Union Act, 1947, was introduced and enacted.  It repealed Section 8 of the Act of 1941, and re-enacted its provisions for a period of 12 months as from 9th July, 1947.</P>
    <P>As the circumstances which necessitated these relieving provisions still existed in 1948, the Trade Union Act, 1948, was enacted in order to continue these reliefs up to 8th July next.  It is now considered desirable to continue to meet the difficulties of the Irish trade unions.  In 24 cases, reduction Orders have been made and, in view of the necessity to continue these powers, this Bill must be passed by the 8th July. It confers the necessary power to relieve the trade unions from the full deposit up to the 8th July, 1950.</P>
