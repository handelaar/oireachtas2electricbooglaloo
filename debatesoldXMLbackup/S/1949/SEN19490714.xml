      <P>At this stage we are somewhat disappointed that the Parliamentary Secretary has not seen fit to meet some of the points put up yesterday, particularly that in relation to the issue of a certificate of urgency by the local authority on entering into land. However, as has been pointed out by many speakers in this and the other House, it is important that the Bill should get a speedy passage and we do not therefore wish to hold it up any longer except to say that the Bill in its final form is a great improvement on it as it was first introduced.  It was first introduced to meet the situation arising from the withdrawal of the road grants, to find employment for the people disemployed as a result.  A long time has passed from February to practically the middle of July to give effect to the Bill. If serious consideration had been given to drafting the Bill and having it passed into law before the grants were withdrawn it would have been the most efficient way of dealing with the position from the point of view of finding employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, following in the steps of almost all the legislation passed through this and the other House in recent months, places the burden on the ratepayers, first to provide the <Col N="1578" /> staff to implement it and, second, to find the compensation that may arise out of damages caused by the works.  It may be a small amount, but when each and every Senator here and the ratepayers throughout the country examine their demand notes for the current year they will find a steep rise in the rates.  I take this opportunity to put our wishes before the Parliamentary Secretary that he may convey them to the Minister responsible so that serious consideration shall be given to the matter before further burdens are transferred from the Central Fund to the local bodies the result of which must naturally be a large increase in the rates.  That increase is being placed on people who in the main are not in a very good position to meet it.  If we are going to substitute some scheme for another in order to take from the shoulders of the Central Fund responsibility which it has been prepared to carry up to now and place it on the county councils and consequently upon the ratepayers we must give serious consideration to the matter.</P>

      <P>Senator Hawkins was permitted, with the approval of the House apparently, to make one or two comments and I would like to make one or two comments also.  If there has been the delay to which Senator Hawkins referred in the passage of the Bill, if it has not been available to local <Col N="1579" /> authorities to operate, who has been responsible?  Where has been the delay?  The Bill was introduced by the Government and for months it was held up in the other House by futile debate and discussion and the moving of amendments that were unacceptable. The changes made in the Bill are of such a trifling character that I do not know that they have made any difference whatever.  With regard to the point the Senator makes about the increase on the local authorities and the employment of staffs, we hope that they are not going to employ additional staff and that they will not pay their staffs any more than they are being paid at the moment so on that point I do not think the Senator has anything to fear.  I do not know why he is so afraid that compensation will have to be paid under this Bill that he must hark back to it all the time.  One gets the feeling that he is afraid that no compensation will be paid.  I think that the Bill is of value and Senator Hawkins should address himself to another aspect of it.  He should recognise the motive behind the Bill.  It is not to give an opportunity for work that disappeared because of the withdrawal of the grant.  This work which is going to be done now was there to be done during all the years the Senator's Party was in office.  Apparently you were spending more or giving greater grants and yet this work could not be done.  I believe this work will be much more fruitful than many of the works we have been engaged in in the past and that every local authority in the country will welcome the passage of this measure.</P>
      <P>Ordered: That the Bill be returned to the Dáil without amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBurke" hpid="Mr. R.M. Burke Mr. R.M. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only one small suggestion to put forward for the consideration of the Minister.  I think it would be very desirable that plenty of newspaper and other publicity should be given to this project <Col N="1580" /> throughout the country, so that every farmer who wishes to avail of it will know what procedure he should adopt. The only complaint I have heard from farmers with regard to the scheme is that it is not being put into operation as quickly as they would wish, but I believe that the Minister desires to put it into operation as quickly as possible. I have heard nothing but praise from farmers of the land rehabilitation project and I know many farmers who would like to avail of it, but who do not yet know what procedure they should adopt.</P>
      <P>I understand that at the moment the Department are inviting applications from only eight counties and that applicants from other counties should wait before sending in their applications.  If that is so, I suggest it would be well to let the public know that, by means of advertisements in the newspapers.  I believe also that it would be very desirable that farmers, in the counties in which the scheme is not yet being put into operation, should receive assurances that they will be notified in good time.  My reason for suggesting this is that I have found that some farmers are under the impression that, unless they send in an application immediately, thousands of other farmers may be before them.  I suggest that the Minister should give plenty of publicity to the scheme as soon as possible, so that all farmers will know what procedure they should adopt.  I believe that there are thousands of farmers who are anxious to send in their applications and who are hoping that the scheme will reach their part of the country as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the short time the Minister has occupied the post of Minister for Agriculture, production has increased to an enormous extent, and, in many cases, has doubled; but I feel that, when this Bill has been in operation for a couple of years, our agricultural output will not only be doubled but quadrupled.  We have some of the finest land in the world, but no land is so good that it cannot be made better.  All our land, good and bad, has suffered from neglect and want of care and improvement.  For all that, we cannot blame the farmers.  Anybody <Col N="1581" /> who understands the situation in regard to farming must agree that it is due to the land system which prevailed in this country.  During the time of the landlords, if a farmer improved his holding, the rent was raised in a short time, so that there was no incentive to him to do anything to improve his land.</P>
      <P>When he got fixity of tenure, the situation did not improve very much, because there was a provision in the British Act which gave the landlord and the tenant the right to apply to have the land revalued every 15 years, and if the farmer had improved his holding to any great extent, his rent was raised.  If he started to let it go derelict, his rent was lowered.  All that is now finished.  If the Minister wants the wholehearted support of farmers in carrying out these schemes, the first thing to do is to give them security of tenure.  The Minister will agree that, if a farmer spends a lot of money and does a lot of work on improving his land, he is entitled to the fruits of his labour.  He has no security in respect of anything he does at present and no incentive to improve his land.  There is no use in the Minister or anybody else saying that we have security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Senator might depart from that line of argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the farmers are to co-operate wholeheartedly in the carrying out of these schemes, they will have to have some incentive to do so and the only incentive they can get is security of tenure, which we have not got at present.  It is extraordinary what can be done by the adoption of the latest improvements in the matter of land reclamation.  During the war years the British, with bulldozers, tractors and ploughs, turned mountain land into arable land, very good for grazing and tillage purposes.  All that type of work could be done in this country with the facilities provided by this Bill.  I do not think there is very much to be said on the Bill, which is nearly as well drafted as if I had drafted it myself.  All I can say to the Minister is: &ldquo;Get on with the work, agus go neirí an bothar leat.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to discuss the Bill generally because there have been so many speeches in connection with it.  The Bill has been generally, and, I think, rightly, welcomed, but I should like to get a little enlightenment with regard to the finances of the Bill.  The Minister informs us that grants to the extent of three-fifths of the estimated cost will be made to the farmers concerned.</P>
      <P>Under what enactment are these grants being made?  There is no reference to that in the Bill, so I presume it is under some regulation other than the Bill that the grant is being made. The circular which the Minister is issuing to the farmers is a step in the right direction.  As Senator Burke, who evidently has not seen the leaflet, has pointed out, farmers would otherwise be mystified as to how they would proceed with a view to availing themselves of the provisions of the Bill. This circular takes nine acres of a farm as an example.  If certain work which is specified has to be performed on that farm the farmer is ensured a free grant of £140 which, presumably, is three-fifths of the total estimated cost of the work.  If, in addition, the farm requires both lime and phosphates the farmer will only get the same amount of free grant.  Obviously, the cost will be higher if, in addition to labour, the farm has to be both limed and supplied with phosphates.  Yet the grant in each case is the same.  There may be a very good reason for that and I should like the Minister to tell us precisely the reason.  If, for instance, £140 represents three-fifth of the estimated cost, then the total cost would be, roughly, £233.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The grant in that case would be £140, which would leave £93 of a loan.  I think the grant is three-fifths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two schemes: (1) whereby you charge the land and the other whereby a farmer does the work and gets a grant for having done it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that.  However, it seems to me that the free grant will not be as good in one case as in the other.  I thought three-fifths was the fraction mentioned but even on the two-thirds basis £140, representing two-thirds, would mean, that the cost would be £210, of which £140 would be a free grant &mdash; leaving £70 of a loan.  How is the remainder of it to be paid?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should prefer that the Minister would explain it.  It seems to me that there is a little inequality in the matter or that there is not consistency.  There are two different propositions involved &mdash; the first involves labour only and the second involves labour plus materials.</P>

      <P>If I were a farmer I am afraid that that would be my interpretation.  If the matter can be differently explained I should like to hear that explanation.  I am not saying that the terms are not very generous to the farmer.  I think that the whole trend of the legislation is revolutionary and progressive and that, if properly availed of, it should bring about a revolution in agricultural development in this country.  My point is that, as I was a bit puzzled in regard to this matter, it is quite possible that others might be puzzled, too, and perhaps the Minister will explain it when he is replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate <Col N="1584" /> the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  For years the question of increased production has been the theme of numerous speeches in the Dáil and, I think, in this House and in the country generally.  Invariably the speakers have ended up with the specious phrase that &ldquo;something must be done&rdquo;.  I had heard that pious exclamation so many times that I felt almost hopeless that anything would ever be done.  Thanks be to God that we have a Minister at last who has had the courage to face what I would call the momentous task of reclaiming and rehabilitating the farms of this country so that we will have increased production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has provided in this Bill for practically all that we in County Limerick could expect or hope for in the way of land improvements. However, I am rather sorry that the Minister, having gone so far, has not seen fit to include all the farms of the country in this question of improvement from the point of view of production &mdash; I cannot refer to it as &ldquo;reclamation&rdquo;.  There are two types of farms whose production could be greatly improved if they were included in this measure.  Everybody knows the farm that is run down.  Such a farm is to be found in every county &mdash; even in my own rich county of Limerick. In some other counties run-down farms are numerous because they need almost excessive fertilisation.  Many of these farms have become impoverished and many of them are producing grass of a type that is not useful in so far as the production of milk, beef or store cattle is concerned.  Such land will have to be ploughed up, seeded and fertilised in order to be brought back into a fair condition so as to yield the average production.  The cost of such an operation would be pretty near as much as it would cost to drain an average field.  If a farmer wanted to plough the land in a scientific manner, to seed it, to fertilise it, and so forth, I would say that it would be beyond his power, as a small farmer, to do so from the point of view of finance. Somebody may ask me if I am suggesting that the Minister should supply fertilisers to every farmer in this country. I am not making that suggestion. <Col N="1585" /> Obviously, it would be ridiculous that either I or anybody else should say that the Minister should fertilise my land for me.  However, everybody knows that there are farmers in this country whose financial position is in such a state at the moment that it is beyond their reach to put their lands in a proper form of production.  In those cases, the Minister should make provision in this Bill so that these farmers may be put on the proper road to production.</P>
    <P>There is another type, which may be outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is outside the scope of the Bill, the Senator had better not touch it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not mentioned it yet, so you must have considerable foresight to know what I am going to say.  There is a type of farm where the farmer cannot get proper production because he has no water.  We are providing for farmers who are flooded out with water, but in other counties there is a shortage of it.  I passed, within the last five days, over a bridge and stopped my car and wondered at what I saw.  There was a small stream with only five or six inches of water and a hole had been dug so that a bucket could be dropped from the bridge into the hole; and there was a half-mile long line of farmers with their carts, awaiting their turn.  You cannot have more production in cases like that. The trouble is accentuated by the abnormally dry season we have had up to now, but the shortage of water is there every year in some places.  Year after year, these farmers are taxed to provide water for every other individual. If there is a village of 25 people, they have to pay for water and sewerage.  If there are six &mdash; even three &mdash; labourers' cottages anywhere in a group, some county council will come forward and there will be a pump sunk for them within a month.  But if a group of farmers have no water, they can whistle for it.  I had hoped the Minister would have included those people in the efforts he is making towards increased production.  It is nothing to smile at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a bit, but who controls the county councils?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1586" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that is a job for the county councils.  It is not.  I might as well say that the drainage of my farm is a job for the county council.  That is primarily a job for myself, if I am able to do it. Unfortunately, the majority of us let our land run for years and years, until the country is in a state of rushes, and everyone is expressing the pious hope for years that something may be done, if the rushes are not to eat us up.  No one suggested, until the Minister came along, how or when that something might be done.  The Minister deserves the congratulations of everyone for his courage in undertaking such a job.  I still suggest, however, that he ought to include the two remaining classes &mdash; and they would be fairly numerous.  It is no solace to the man in Clare who has no water, to know that a fellow's land in the Golden Vale is going to be drained.  He wants help for himself, and I would like to see him get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the general terms of the Bill, I think we are all agreed that it is a good Bill and we hope it will be availed of to the full by the farmers. There are one or two things the Minister will probably explain when replying &mdash; the question raised by Senator O'Farrell about the grant is one of them.  I must say I was a bit confused also by the explanation in the little pamphlet.  I still think there is a differentiation in the possible grant, as between the man who gets a cash grant and does it himself, and the man who lets the Minister do it for him at a charge.  I think that, when analysed, it will be found that the amount of free money he gets in one case will be more than the other.  I am not quarreling with that, as I am sure the Minister would rather that every farmer should undertake the job himself.  But if the Minister has to undertake it, he knows what it will cost.  When a Government or a county council undertakes a job, it will cost a little more than it would through the private individual.  When we come to rock bottom and analyse the figures, we may find that that is the reason for this provision.  I again congratulate the Minister with all the strength I have, on the courage and foresight he has shown in introducing <Col N="1587" /> this measure.  I hope that every farmer, large and small, will be able to avail of its terms when it becomes law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdmundSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In opening this debate, the Minister put the main basis of this scheme as being an investment by the community in what he described as the best possible security, the land of Ireland, and only few people could disagree with him. I want to say at the outset that this is an investment, not in the land of Ireland as a whole, but in a certain type of land.  Taking the type of land as it is, the investment is in a type which is not the most highly productive and not even potentially the most highly productive.  For that reason, there is some little difficulty about the value of the investment.  I would like to know what dividend is expected from this investment, when it is expected that it will be paid, and what is the percentage expected.  Clearly, whatever may be said in this House or in the House below, either by the Minister or other speakers on the Bill, this is a Drainage Bill.  The main headings speak of field drainage, land reclamation, the construction and improvement of watercourses, the removal of unnecessary fences, the construction of new fences and the improvement of existing ones, the improvement of hill grazing, the reclamation of estuarine marsh land and of callows, and any operations ancillary to the foregoing. I think it will be agreed that the main work envisaged under the Bill is drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put the case of the man whose land does not require drainage &mdash; infertile land, possibly temporarily infertile, or land that has run out.  I think we may accept it definitely that that type of land is excluded from this Bill.  I want to deplore that, for the reason that this is an investment and that the community, if they invested in some of the land I speak of, would get a larger return and, what is even more important, a quicker return.  This land I speak of may be, and frequently is, in parts of the country I know very well, infertile because it was over-worked&mdash;possibly by over enthusiastic farmers, worked by farmers who have <Col N="1588" /> overcropped it, perhaps with cereal crops which were not suitable to it. That type of land and is not included in this Bill.  It is as much in need of some species of reclamation as that of the man who has neglected the fences, who has allowed hedgerow trees to overgrow his fields, or who has allowed the drains to clog up and who has been generally neglectful.</P>
    <P>In one case production of the land has been decreased owing to the work of a farmer and in the other by the neglect of the farmer.  I would like to take the matter up with the Minister when he suggests that to do a man's ploughing and re-seeding for him is to provide him with his profit which the Minister does not intend to do.  To clear the lands of fences, roll stones off the fields and to trim hedges is providing him with profit.  I find the greatest difficulty in making a distinction between the two transactons.  I will come back to this matter later but at this stage I appeal to the Minister to extend the type of land with which he proposes to deal.  The type of land I envisage is not being dealt with.  In the view of some of the greatest experts we have in this country or that we have brought into it, that land is best treated by being ploughed and re-seeded.  That in my view is an difficult, as technical and as important a type of work as having fields drained and it is much more likely to yield a high production.</P>
    <P>The Minister might well say that the farmer is quite capable of doing that work himself or that it is a job of work which he should do himself and not the type envisaged in this Bill.  The only thing that I can say to that is that a man whom we brought into this country to go into the question of grassland and pasture land, Mr. Holmes from New Zealand, has said that the ploughing and re-seeding of land is not work which the farmer could do himself.  He said it was work that would take heavy machines which are difficult for the farmer to work and he does not have the necessary heavy implements to do that work.  It is exactly the same difficulty as arises in regard to drainage.  There are contractors who will be able to do this work of drainage by the use of tractors <Col N="1589" /> and heavy machines and according to Mr. Holmes the ploughing and re-seeding is not a job which a farmer could do for himself and therefore in my view it is one which should come under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am now dealing with the question of whether these are proper types of work to come under this Bill and urging that, in my view, they are.  I believe them to be works that would be useful and necessary to the whole scheme.  At page 50 of the Holmes report he referred to the necessity for an extensive programme of ploughing and re-seeding.  He then refers to the tests and trials that were carried out and he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;During the war years, 1943-45, numerous experimental re-seeding trials were laid down throughout the country.  With the exception of one in County Mayo and several at the Department of Agriculture farms, these have proved, after one or two years to be less productive than the original turf where it received the same amount of fertiliser as the reseeded plot.  The main reasons for the failure of these attempts at direct re-seeding may be one, or more than one, of the following: (1) bad choice of land, (2) bad cultivation, (3) lack of lime and fertiliser, (4) the use of short-lasting temporary strains and (5) poor management.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is at page 51 that he says that farmers are not able to do the job themselves owing to the fact of not having the necessary heavy equipment and machinery required to do the job of re-seeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the view of Mr. Holmes the work requires the use of heavy commercial two-ton rollers, disc harrows and other machinery.  If the Minister will agree <Col N="1590" /> with me that ploughing and re-seeding is a necessary job for reclamation of farms which requires these things, then I urge on him that this work in connection with reclamation ought to be included under this Bill.  Therefore, if ploughing and re-seeding were included in this Bill it would open a whole field of work to be handed out to contractors who can own and buy this heavy and expensive machinery.</P>
    <P>When the land has been drained it is only one step forward in production from the land.  Again Senators will see that I have been reading extensively, and, for myself, with great interest, the Holmes report.  In page 12 he says in regard to land that was drained many years ago that he found it was in exactly the same state of flood land vegetation, dominantly sedge, as it was when it was drained.</P>
    <P>I do not know that it will be completely relevant to the Bill but I urge on the Minister to give us some idea of what plans he has of ridding the farms of this sedge after the land has been drained because we are considering this matter from the point of view of an investment and if the farmer in whom the community is investing money leaves his drained land in sedge and flood vegetation the investment is not going to be a benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And we will all go up the spout if the Irish farmers are going to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdmundSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We have proved from time to time, unfortunately, and I say it with regret, that some of the farmers have done this.  Mr. Holmes has referred to that position on page 12.  I do not say that in any bitter sense.  I only see drainage itself as a long term policy and only one step in the policy of production.  The need to-day is for increased production quickly.  The reason I give for that is that we want to catch the export market while the prices hold.  By providing for re-seeding and ploughing it would be an incentive to the farmers to further efforts in production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said all that, I want to make it clear that there is nothing in the Bill &mdash; I was going to use the somewhat grandiose phrase &ldquo;that offends me&rdquo;<Col N="1591" />&mdash; that I can see to disagree with.  The only thing I even partially disagree with is that there is not enough in it and it does not extend over a wide enough field.  I do see a way for the Minister, if he was inclined, to accept my argument and even under the Bill to enable much of the work in the way of ploughing and re-seeding which I suggested to be done, because Section B setting out the type of work to be done refers to land reclamation and Section H says any operation ancillary to the foregoing.  I maintain that land reclamation may and should mean ploughing and re-seeding with heavy machinery and high technical knowledge and, if land reclamation means that, any further operations required to do that or ancillary to it. Take the case of an imaginary farmer with 100 acres.  His old aunt dies and leaves him £800 with the strict proviso in the will that it must be spent on the farm within two years.  He has 70 acres which are dry, overcropped and infertile and 30 acres which are continuously flooded, in sedge and rushes. If he is a farmer who is merely interested in money and profits, in no way socially-minded or interested in whom he employs, he takes that £800 and spends £10 or £12 an acre on the 70 acres.  He increases his grass and crop production, as Senator Baxter said, by four, and carries four beasts for every three and out of the profit he drains the 30 acres.  That is because he is an individual.  It is fortunate that we have a Minister with money, courage and determination to go down into the 30 acres to do the work which I say no individual farmer could have the money, courage or determination to do.  I want to speak, therefore, for the man who has the 70 acres and is not included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>To summarise therefore, in my view this is not a plan for the entire land of Ireland or for increased production from the entire land of Ireland.  It is for certain land, over-grown or badly fenced land or hill land.  Let it be noted with regard to hill land that again the Minister has subscribed partially to my view that if hill land is to be reclaimed it must be done by heavy <Col N="1592" /> harrowing and re-seeding with suitable types of grass seed to grow on hill pasture.  If on the hill my principle can be accepted, may I not press upon the Minister to come down from the hills and extend the principle into the plains?  In fact having said all that, in one phrase will the Minister not see the value of extending this magnificent project a little further?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephMeighan" hpid="Mr. Meighan Mr. Meighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel compelled to rise to support this measure because I believe it is a very good Bill.  The fact that drainage has been neglected for a number of years was largely responsible for making a crowd of farmers organise to bring to bear on the Government of the day the necessity for such a step.  This is a matter for congratulation and a big principle is involved.  All the money spent will be of great value to the small and middle-sized farmers.  In the West, in Donegal and other counties, there is a great deal of land to be reclaimed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small farmers look upon every acre of land that is reclaimed as being of great value to them.  They have availed of other schemes in a smaller way and every reclaimed acre has been of very great value.  These are the type of farmers for whom provision must be made by the Government by way of unemployment assistance and when this scheme gets going there will be no necessity for it and the Exchequer will be very much relieved from that point of view.  The middle-class farmer, who used to be well able to live a good independent life, had a tough time for the past ten or 15 years owing to matters not necessary to go into now, the economic war and other wars.  He found it very hard even to bring up his family, and because of his valuation he was generally precluded from getting unemployment assistance.  He got nothing soft from the Government and was of a proud nature, never anxious to depend on anybody for help, but things went against him.  The land of that type of farmer has been very largely neglected, not exactly through his own fault but for the reasons I have mentioned, and I think that this scheme will mean a very great improvement to him.  We cannot put back the hands of the clock and, like it or not, <Col N="1593" /> we must realise that more modern methods must be adopted.  In every age we find people who are reluctant to adopt such methods at the start.  In my own time a number of farmers objected to the mowing machine, holding that it was not able to do as good a job as the scythe.  You had the reaping-hook before that and nobody would dream of cutting oats except with it. Eventually, however, they had to give way to modern methods.  With the labour scarcity and the decent wages which are now paid to labour, if the old-fashioned methods were employed it would be impossible to run a farm on a business scale.  I am glad to say that the Minister has shown the House that this is regarded as a business proposition. He intends to run it on those lines and employ modern methods.  I daresay it is too soon at the present time to foresee how it will turn out, but I am quite satisfied that if it bears even one-tenth of the fruit the Minister and those in a position to judge tell us it will, it will be worth the money invested in it.</P>
    <P>While I say that, there are just a few points I would like the Minister to make clear in his reply.  The value of land which is to be drained would be greatly enhanced if it were in a neighbourhood where arterial drainage is to be carried out.  I have an area in mind where it will be some time, I am afraid, before arterial drainage is carried out, and if it were carried out it would improve a very large area even without this Bill and thousands of acres in a radius of ten miles would be improved.  I take it that the example given here of a £140 grant includes draining six acres, clearing three acres of scrub and the liming and manuring of two acres.  There may be instances in which there will be no such work as clearing scrub, work which will involve only draining.  I should like the Minister to give some idea of what the grants will be.  I take it that two-thirds or 60 per cent. of the labour cost will be given to the farmer in these cases.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the point raised by Senator Sweetman with regard to very rough type of land, having light furze on it, with hillocks and so on, and I <Col N="1594" /> think there is something to be said for Senator Sweetman's argument about very heavy machinery being put in on it.  If that land could be ripped up and harrowed, I believe it would mean a very great improvement.  I should like to know also whether the reclamation of bog land, cutaway bog, for instance, comes under the scheme.  My reason for asking is that there is nothing provided for putting on reclaimed land under this scheme but artificial manure and lime.  Under the old-fashioned scheme of reclaiming land as I see it, clay and gravel were first carted out on to it and then farmyard manure spread on it.  I know cases where enough farmyard manure was put on the heather and good meadows grew without any cultivation.  There are people, as he will be aware, in the West who are interested in this matter, and, if he cleared up that point with regard to cutaway bog, it would make the position more definite for them.</P>
    <P>I personally give the Bill my whole-hearted support and I can say, speaking for the farming community as I know them, they are whole-heartedly behind the Minister.  Nobody can find fault with anything in the Bill, but we will be much better judges in 12 or 18 months' time of how things are going and it will be soon enough then to see if it is necessary to make improvements in the scheme.  I hope the Minister's efforts in this respect will be as successful as his efforts with regard to the poultry development scheme and the increase in the pig population.  These successes augur well for the success of this scheme and I have the utmost confidence that the Minister will leave nothing undone to make it the success which everybody, irrespective of Party, wishes to see it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. D. Burke Mr. D. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been more than gratified by the unanimity with which this measure has been received.  Its greatest contribution, in my opinion, will be the restoration of confidence to the farming community.  Confidence is the parent of investment and chronic under-investment has, in some respects, been the major ill which has beset agriculture in this country for at least a century.  Political ills and many other causes broke down that confidence and <Col N="1595" /> many farmers, if they made a few pounds, were inclined to put the money into the bank and say: &ldquo;We will not get a chance of making another few pounds until there is another great war.&rdquo;  This encouragement and confidence which the Government are showing in regard to agriculture will undoubtedly be appreciated by the farming community.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the fact that, in investing £2 of the people's money, he will get the farmer to invest £1 of his own.  If it is not £1 in money, it will be £1 in labour, and in that way he will help the farmer to help himself.  The good example set by the results of this great experiment will be followed by others in the farming community, and for that reason I give my whole-hearted support to the measure.  I believe that farmers living on the better class of land, as envisaged by Senator Sweetman, will be able to do many of these things for themselves, when they see that the land of Ireland and its proper utilisation will give, between wars as well as during wars, a safe return for the money and work invested in its proper utilisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing this Bill, which, in my opinion, is an excellent Bill, it is a pity that the Minister did not go one step further.  The obvious object of the Bill is to increase production and as Senator Sweetman has said, to increase it at the earliest possible date.  Increased production is impossible on a vast area of land in this country at the present time.  The only way in which increased production at an early date can be accomplished is by the application of artificial fertilisers. It would be a great relief and a great encouragement to many farmers if they knew there was included in this scheme assistance to purchase artificial manures at a reasonable figure.  Many of them are heart-broken at the present time because they cannot do so.  For the past ten years, approximately, they have been mining their land.  Economic conditions and war conditions prevented them from purchasing the necessary artificial fertilisers which they would have purchased had that been possible.  To my <Col N="1596" /> mind it is not a sound economy to spend money on the land that is least productive and omit attention to the land that is most productive.  It reminds me of the story of the foolish farmers who had two calves &mdash; one a bad calf and the other a good calf.  He devoted all his attention to trying to bring the bad calf up to the standard of the good calf by giving it an extra supply of milk.  But he would have made an excellent calf of the good calf if he had given it as much or half as much milk as he gave the bad calf. In the same way, if you are going to spend all the money on the land that is least productive you are not doing a wise thing.  In my county there is hardly an acre of land that does not require either burnt lime or ground limestone at the present time and there is hardly an acre that does not require artificial fertilisers.  If some provision could be included in this Bill to assist the farmers to procure those materials to apply to the land I think something very useful would be done.</P>
      <P>I am not attempting in any way to suggest that what is in the Bill is not going to be of great advantage to the farmers in my county.  It will.  The drainage and reclamation and the other suggestions in the Bill are definitely going to be an advantage but I think that what I suggest would be of greater advantage still.  I had intended putting forward some amendments in that connection for the Committee Stage but I understand that they would not be allowed.</P>

I should like the Minister to clarify the matter of repayment.  In the case of those who avail of this scheme by annual or half-yearly repayments, will those repayments terminate with the land annuities or will they terminate when the advanced amount has been repaid?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will examine that point very thoroughly so that there will be no slip.  We often said things since 1932 that we did not mean and that did not operate. There was always an excuse for everything except for the taxes, tariffs, rents and rates which the farmers have to pay.  They always have to foot the bill.  They have got to.  I have a big interest in the reclaiming of this wet land inasmuch as I have attempted to do it myself.  It is not as easily done as this season would permit.  When you do it and make your fields perfectly sound, to all intents and purposes, to support stock or bring forth the crop, you have to vision the effect that a week's rain will have on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind, in the case of all this land that is affected so vitally by sudden rainfall, emergency measures should be placed at the disposal of every home in those localities.  Unless the owner of such land strips it after 24 or 48 hours of rain, especially in the four darkest months of the year, all the reclamation work will vanish.  Any weighty animal from 3 cwt. up will sink in this land after three or four days of rain, and after three or four weeks he cannot lie down on it or will be unhealthy if he does.  If he sinks into it, his footsteps will leave holes, which will fill with water and these marks will freeze in frost; and when you come along after three months you will find a most glorious crop of moss, <Col N="1599" /> which will worm and wither its way through the entire land, and the land will be back to what the people tell you locally is its own produce &mdash; back to where it started.</P>
    <P>If I were the Minister, I would not be diverted to the marginal land, by talk of what they do in England and Wales.  Anyone who has marginal land has at least had the opportunity of standing on it for the last 10 or 15 years.  Thousands of acres which are not marginal, which are low-lying, have not had the opportunity in these wet seasons of permitting stock to be on it, nor have the owners had the opportunity of taking the war-time profits that the emergency brought.</P>
    <P>The Minister should think of going further.  Every haggard and yard should be made healthy and level, by a good concrete foundation being laid, such as was laid under the provisions of this last small scheme which was operating.  In addition, there should be some very considerable foundation laid, so that the property will permit the stock to be moved in without any ill-effects to them or to the ground on which they rest.  That is essential. You sometimes go round with a threshing mill and when you seek to level it in the yard you make a hole.  The following year when you come round, you see that that hole is filled with water and you see the dying chickens &mdash; I see Deputy Corry was referring to wingless chickens &mdash; and in this case the place is so bad that if the children of the household eat them they will begin to die themselves.  The Minister should see that these yards are concreted to the last and made as perfect as where we are sitting now, comparatively speaking.</P>

      <P>Yes, but the donkey is going too slow for the last five years. On the question of repayment, there is a certain uneasiness.  This must be taken with a very open mind.  I want to see the project go through and an excellent job made of it.  There will have to be give and take as to how far it will go and what the repayment will be.  I have seen very serious efforts at reclamation fail.  So much drainage must be done that the Minister may meet with disappointment here and there.</P>
      <P>I was not here when he spoke yesterday, but I notice that, according to the <i>Irish Times</i>, he said that the second substantial effect was contained in Section 5, giving the Minister power to enter on a common watercourse, where necessary, to render effective the drainage work that had been carried out on a farm.  He talked of the necessity for this power arising from the existence of cantankerous individuals. They can be politically cantankerous and socially cantankerous, but as long as the Minister has thorough powers and goes ahead with them I feel that this scheme will go on well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some counties call for more attention than others.  I notice that my own is one of those to be dealt with, and I myself am taking as much advantage as I can of this.  I would like to see the inspectors reside for a little while in the hills around Collon.  Much good can be done in that area, especially in live stock rather than in tillage, as in the period from March to September tillage would be liable to be ruined, and it is hard to ask anyone there to till.  I wonder if the Minister has thrown his eye on the background of the Cooley hills.  It will be interesting to watch the development over hundreds, <Col N="1601" /> perhaps thousands, of acres where they might be doing some little thing at present, and I hope it will not escape his attention.  Such being the case, I wish the Bill every success.</P>

      <P>No heresy is more deadly than the one that has a substratum of specious appeal.  If I believed that this Bill were a Bill to make paupers of every farmer in Ireland, I would be ashamed to have my name associated with it.  I do not believe the farmers of this country want their neighbours to go in upon their holdings, plough them, till them, seed them, fertilise them, and then stand back while the farmer collects the boodle, having sat upon his sash while all the work was being done.  I think it is a terrible disservice to the agricultural community if the suggestion is made that a rehabilitation scheme of the kind outlined by me to the Seanad is imperfect for the reason that it does not provide for a handout to everyone who wants it.  I know that Senator Sweetman will discharge me from any desire to affront such an old friend as he is but I must speak frankly on this matter. The Senator envisaged an individual with 70 acres, of, for want of a better term, what he described as infertile land, and he made the case that where that land carried one beast it could, by appropriate treatment, carry three beasts, say, next year.  But he seemed to me to go on to say that the farmer was entitled to demand that the community should pay him for the privilege of having his land made capable of carrying three beasts where it used to carry one.  What is the business of farming?  Is not the business of farming that a man owns land and in consideration of society's recognition of his unqualified right to own it that he will use it for a purpose God meant it to be used &mdash; to produce, to provide for himself and his family and to give employment to those of his neighbours who may reasonably expect employment on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are in this country a large number of farmers owning 70 acres of land and upwards and owning nothing else except the clothes they stand up in and provision has to be made for them, let us face the fact that the <Col N="1602" /> farmers are entitled to no superior consideration from the community than any other member of the community. If a man has three shops and no stock in any of them should he not go and sell one of the shops and use the proceeds of the sale to stock the other two? If he just sits down and bewails his position and does nothing about it should the State rush in and stock the shops with boots, clothes, porter or whiskey or should not a reasonable neighbour say to the man, sell one of the shops and stock the other two? Suppose the shopkeeper continued to say that there was no market for the shops then the answer is go to the bank manager and give him a mortgage on the three shops and he will advance you the money to stock them.</P>
    <P>I can see Senators straining in their chairs to say that the banks would not lend money on the land.  I glory in the fact that land is not good collateral security in Ireland because in Ireland anyone who sought to evict a farmer from his home for the redemption of a debt would be chased out of the parish where he went to carry out the eviction. God grant that it may always be so, but there are always co-operative societies in this country, and there is no co-operative society in this country which cannot have all the financial facilities it wants for the provision of all the fertilisers they care to supply. Why do they not use it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdmundSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>The capital equipment required for fertilisers is one jute bag, worth sixpence.  The capital necessary for the work of rehabilitation may cost £50,000.  If a co-operative society is catering for one quarter of a county and having in that quarter of a county 10 per cent. of farmers requiring rehabilitation of their land is it in accord with common sense that you should ask them to make a capital investment of £50,000 in order to rehabilitate approximately ten or 11 farms?  When that <Col N="1603" /> work is done is the £50,000 worth of equipment to be left on the scrap heap to rot?  As I said, the capital equipment required for fertilisers is one jute bag.  Is it to be argued in the Seanad that the business of ploughing a farmer's land is the duty of the community? If that is true the Seanad would be mad to pass this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will forgive me if I reply &ldquo;Holmes be blowed&rdquo;. He is a distinguished and honoured scientist whose report has been of inestimable value to this country and to me, but the Senator and I have forgotten more about conditions in Ireland than Mr. Holmes ever knew. Whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Secretary of State or Chiang Kai Shek told me that in Ireland it was the function of the community to plough my neighbour's land the most polite retort I could make to him was that he was unfamiliar with rural conditions in the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to warn the Seanad of this, that if a few people expect that the harrowing of the land or the rolling of a Cambridge roller over it is something that hereafter the community must do they should not put one penny piece of our people's money into the lands of Ireland or the lazy-ne'er-do wells who live on it.  I do not believe that the farmers of Ireland expect that and if I did believe it I would be ashamed to say that I was Irish. If I believe that, I will believe that my father's whole life had been wasted in a most frivolous and idiotic effort.  If I believe that, then Balfour was right and Cromwell was right.  If that is right and that is the kind of people we are the sooner we clear the land of this country the better.  But, it is not true; it never has been true and it never will be true.  I think that Senators will forgive me if I feel deeply about these matters, because I do.  I think that what Senator Sweetman means when he deplores the lack of gifts or grants is credit.  It has been a perplexing problem for many a good farmer who has become heir to a good farm of land which has been suffering <Col N="1604" /> from a deterioration in fertility how to get started.  It is certainly true that the provision of readily accessible credit has never been properly faced, I dare say, until now.  But it was not for want of credit, but for want of some effective device that would separate the wheat from the chaff.  The plain inescapable fact is that in Ireland the farmer who could do himself good by borrowing will not borrow.  That is the one farmer we cannot persuade to borrow.  That type of farmer has a perfect horror of getting into debt. Unlike the business man, who is never easy when out of debt, who knows that expanding business always calls for more capital, and who borrows whereever he can, the farmer has a long tradition behind him of apprehension of debt.</P>
    <P>It is equally true to say that there is a select company in rural Ireland who would borrow anything they could, your hat, your umbrella or anything else they could get their hands on, firmly resolved that never with God's help would they be asked to pay it back.  Show me the way whereby you can by any reasonable means segregate the farmers from the umbrella man and there is an end to the credit problem.</P>
    <P>That is why I say that the co-operative societies will help.  They need not hesitate.  No question of credit need harrass them.  They will choose their debtors, give them fertilisers or anything else they want for the proper husbandry of their holdings, and collect the money by instalments out of milk or any transactions that eventually take place.  Then, if a man wants his land examined it is for the county agricultural instructor to have the soil of the farm tested.  If the maximum return is to be got, and if the land wants phosphate, potash, lime or nitrogen, the farmer can go to the co-operative society and buy on credit all that he wants to put on the land. If that is too heavy a burden for the co-operative society to carry until the farmer begins to pay out of the growing crops, the Agricultural Credit Corporation is not only willing but eager to provide the money.</P>
    <P>I gladly avail of this opportunity to say here now, that if there is a single co-operative society in Ireland which <Col N="1605" /> knows of the slightest embarassment of a customer who wants credit, and if approach to the Agricultural Credit Corporation is not found encouraging, let them come to me and I think we will be able to find a form in which to put the application which will enable the Agricultural Credit Corporation to do what I know they are not only willing but eager to do, to make available credit to those who ask for it.</P>
    <P>Senator Finan referred to an actual scarcity of fertilisers.  They were not there and sometimes they were at a price farmers could not pay.  That is not going to be so any more, even in Senator Finan's county, as a lime-grinding plant is to be built at Boyle. The cost will be 16/- per ton at the quarry, 25/- to 30/- spread on the land. That is good value.  You will not buy it cheaper anywhere in Europe and there is not a penny of public money paid by way of subsidy.  It would have been very popular if I provided a subsidy from the Exchequer for ground lime.  The result would have been that the ground lime would cost £1 per ton, and the money I provided out of the Exchequer would be used to bring the price down to 16/- per ton. I think the plan here is a much better one.</P>
    <P>I cannot control the price of phosphate rock.  Somebody else in this country entertained the illusion that they could.  I am happy to inform the Seanad that that illusion has been shattered.  Phosphate rock will be made available at any port in Ireland at the lowest price at which it is made available the whole world over from this day on.  I should like to see it ground in Ireland.  I have been trying to get people to grind it for some time and I am beginning to get impatient. I am going to try a while longer, but if I cannot get anyone else to grind it I will grind it myself and it will be brought to the farmers at the lowest penny it can be bought and ground at. If anybody is shocked by that appalling assault on private enterprise it is going to be the first of many if private enterprise falls down on the job.  It is no crime for the people of this country to provide themselves with what they have got to have if the land <Col N="1606" /> of Ireland is to be used to the best advantage.  If enterprising individuals in our community will provide it at the lowest price no one will be better pleased than I, but if enterprising individuals imagine that by holding out on the community they will force the community to pay, they never made a greater mistake in their lives.  We will bring in superphosphate in addition to all that can be produced in the domestic factories.  We will have unlimited supplies of potash although it is not so long since we were told that we would only get what was good for us.  They have changed their mind about that and they have now asked us what quantity we would like to get with the assurance that it will be available.  We will get, I think, all the nitrogen we want, as much as we can persuade our people to buy.  I think that is a good situation.  There is no farmer in Ireland this year who need be short of artificial fertilisers of any kind and it is up to the farmers themselves to determine the quantity of dung they will use.  I know that the farmers of Ireland appreciate the urgent importance of that type of manure and will take appropriate measures to provide it for themselves.</P>
    <P>I interpret the Seanad's wish, as they engaged in a protracted and interesting debate such as we have listened to, as being that I should deal with matters raised by Senators.  That is what I am going to do and if Senators all speak they bring down upon their own heads a protracted reply.</P>
    <P>Senator Meighan, being a practical farmer, has a practical approach.  He says quite plainly: &ldquo;I am glad to see the water going off my land but I would like to be reassured as to where it is going to go&rdquo;.  When he spoke circumspectly of a certain problem he struck a familiar note upon a chord that binds us together as lifelong neighbours, the rock, Tinnecarra rock. Senator Meighan and I have sung many a duet together about Tinnecarra rock.</P>
    <P>I am in this dilemma: Ministers are supposed to be extremely circumspect and to state precisely what is certain and never dare to envisage that which may be longer postponed than is to be <Col N="1607" /> hoped.  I wish to warn the Seanad that I am neither discreet, orthodox nor circumspect in that matter.  I am going to tell the Seanad what I am hoping for.  Maybe it will come off and maybe it will not, but if it does not it will not be for want of trying.  I am hoping to get the arterial rivers of Ireland done now.  I am not in the least interested in a programme of arterial drainage to be completed in 2050.  I will be dead and buried, please God, in 2050 and posterity can deal with the problems of 2050 as they may think fit.  I want to get the water off the kitchen floor now and in getting it off my kitchen floor I do not want to pour it all over Senator Meighan's. The only place we can put it in order to make sure, even if Senator Meighan and myself keep our floors dry, that it will not flow in on some other person's is to put it into a river bed that leads somewhere to the sea.  We are doing at present a comprehensive arterial operation on the catchment area of the Brosna River.  We are about to start the Glyde and Dee.  Now I am bound to say in justice that from the point of view of arterial drainage engineers the right, prudent and safe procedure is to make a hydro-graphic survey of the catchment area to begin with, to survey the arterial river and every tributary of that river in the catchment area.  That means 2050 A.D. and I just cannot wait, that is all.  I propose, if I get the chance, to go up the main river and root the bottom out of it and we will get rid of whatever is coming down the tributaries now.  In any case, posterity can spend its time on the tributaries.  Any we can get the chance to do we will do if we can, but we will at least make rivers leading somewhere to the sea into which the water will find its way released by these operations, albeit more slowly than if all the tributaries were done in the catchment in the orthodox way. But we will have the comforting knowledge if we can get the arterial rivers done that there is room for the water to get away.  Frankly, this is flamboyant, I suppose.  If you press me too hard asking me how I am going to get it done I might not be able to tell you, but that does not qualify my certainty that I am going to get it done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> Senator Sweetman says that a rapid increase in production is the supreme need so as to catch the export market while prices are high.  Oh, no.  Such a basis for an agricultural policy, in my humble judgment, would be utter madness.  Were we to construct an agricultural policy designed to catch the export market while prices were high, what would happen to us when prices were high no longer?  Would we all go bankrupt?  We might.  No; the man who plans an agricultural policy on the profit that may be snatched in an exotic market is building up an awful lot of trouble for his children, if not for his own old age.  My aim for agriculture would be to build up markets which we would make utterly dependent upon us, to bind them to us now by the moderation of our demand and the exhaustiveness of our performance, so that as rivals present themselves we will have created a pattern of trade to make a breach in which will be almost an impossibility for those who try to cut us out.</P>
    <P>I want to make the British live-stock industry depend upon our live-stock industry for its very life.  I want to make bargains with the British people, or any other people, not on the basis of &ldquo;while prices are high&rdquo; but on the basis of &ldquo;so long a term&rdquo; so that, by the time they fall to be renewed, the ones who are trading on the high-price markets and are now insolvent and anxious to sell at bankrupt prices, if they can get them, will discover that there is one market they cannot get at any price, for it is bound to us, and, by the time renewal falls to be made, the bankrupts will be in the market no more.  I have no interest at all in the transient high-price market.  A few people will make quick profits, will get high ideas, buy motor-cars and go &ldquo;bust&rdquo;, and those who come after them will have to start at the bottom and come up again.  I think Senator Sweetman will agree with me that very few men who get their living from the land long retain the riches of high profits or high prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should hate to think there ever would be but, in this particular case, I think there is perhaps a little more than meets the eye.  I think it was also the Senator who apprehended: will farmers allow their land to go into sedge, to revert after the rehabilitation has been carried out on it?  I do not know but, if they do, if that is what they are all going to do, we are sunk.  I cannot too emphatically emphasise that to the Seanad.  If Senators believe that the farmers are lazy ne'er-do-wells, they have a solemn duty to reject this Bill.  This Bill is founded on the conviction that the people who live upon the land and get their living from it in Ireland are the only people and the best people to extract from the land of Ireland the maximum return while maintaining the land's fertility. It is madness, if you doubt that, to facilitate me in spending £40,000,000 on the land of Ireland.  It is because I <Col N="1610" /> do not doubt that, because I could not doubt it and never would doubt it, that I want a chance to spend £40,000,000 and more, if needs be, on making the land such that it will give those who work upon it a fair return for the labour they put into it.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that Senator Sweetman has been corrupted by the subtle shaft fired by Senator O'Brien when he asks: what is the dividend?  What is the rate per cent?  What is the redemption date of the investment.  Where is the revenue to meet the sinking fund? Is this the illusory Fata Morgana of a banker's mind who can only think of the consolidated stock and who, when reminded that the consolidated stock would probably be worth, in 12 months' time, about one-third of what it is worth to-day, stopped like a clock because his mental processes go no further?  Surely we have lived long enough to realise that the best security in times like those we live in is land. No one can take that away, even if he wants to.</P>
      <P>I wonder what other security Senator Sweetman has in mind where he would more safely store this money so as to be sure to have it at hand when the day of repayment comes.  Would he put it in gold bars?  They might demonetise gold and he would have to pay the junk man to take it away. Would he put it in dollars?  Does the Senator forget the repeal of the Gold Act in 1935?  Would he put it in Bank of England notes?  Rats might eat them or inflation consume them. Is there any security he can think of so impervious to malice or misfortune as the land?  I do not want to be unfair. Oratorical flourishes do not pay debts.  The question is where, on the gale day, is the negotiable instrument to come from wherewith to pacify the creditor &mdash; the taxation of the growing income of the community, resultant upon increased production.  Is it not a good source?</P>

      <P>Why do the farmers not go and stand for election before their neighbours and get elected to the county council and look after their own property?  Now I will probably get my head in a halter but the truth is that the vast majority of them are too lazy to do so.  They expect the likes of me to accept the dust of the arena and they look down their noble noses in scorn and speak of politicians.  They are damned lucky to have politicians to look after them when they are too lazy to look after themselves.  If the farmers of this country want to bring down the rates, to improve the local services and to see that the requirements of the agricultural community are adequately provided for they have the remedy and nobody else has &mdash; and it is not right that anybody else should try to take the remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local government is meant to provide that neighbours will have a right to look after their own affairs without direction from Upper Merrion Street or anywhere else.  If they want to sit down on their sashes and sneer at politicians they can travel the road for water.  But when they realise that the politician has the spunk in him to go out and face the music in order to get the work done they might suddenly begin to realise that the most honourable career that any man in this country could aspire to is politics and <Col N="1612" /> that, in politics, he can serve the noblest ends &mdash; as well as mundane needs such as pumps for the local farmers.</P>

      <P>He can repair the error next year, please God.  Senator J.T. O'Farrell asked under what enactments the grants are being made.  This Bill is an enabling Bill.  The general powers of the Minister for Agriculture authorise him to do general works in the interests of the agricultural industry. But when it comes to spending specific sums he gets the authority to do so by Estimate from Dáil Éireann.  That is why I must ask the Members of this House what I cannot but feel is some trespass upon their indulgence, to consider the possibility of giving me this Bill in all its stages for I have still to go to the Dáil with a Supplementary Estimate to get the money requisite to finance the work.  Until I get that money I am held up.  I cannot go on. The Supplementary Estimate is the actual statutory power under which I disburse money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the very specific question raised by the Senator, designed to elucidate the pamphlet.  It is strange that when we were drafting this pamphlet, albeit we did allow ourselves the luxury of buttons and bows, our prime concern was so to phrase it that it will be incapable of incomprehension. Therefore, I tried it out upon myself and then I gave it to a number of Deputies.  I asked a number of them to take it down the country.  We revised it repeatedly to meet what appeared to be ambiguities when others read it. But I suppose it is true that very often the more one tries to make a thing simple and clear the more complex it ultimately becomes in an effort to meet everybody's difficulty.  I would say, however, that some people paid the pamphlet the compliment of readily understanding it.  I can sympathise <Col N="1613" /> with those to whom it may present difficulties.  I hope Senator J.T. O'Farrell will not take it amiss if I say to him that, though not very far removed from Senator Meighan and myself in his origins&mdash;we all come from that triangle which embraces Mayo, Sligo and Roscommon &mdash; his recent familiarity with urban affairs may render the interpretation of a document of this character less comprehensive than it would be to somebody daily in contact with the land.  But there is this admitted ambiguity in it.  We calculate in each specific case the estimated cost of the work where the farmer is going to do it himself.  In operating a scheme of this kind you cannot stipulate for an estimate binding in the sense that a contractor's estimate would bind you.  It is an estimate in the liberal sense of the word.  We try to foresee what the thing would cost to do.  We then take two-thirds of that estimated sum, and that figure is the grant we offer the farmer. But the farmer is not invited to join us in calculating the estimate.  All that is preliminary work for the purpose of naming a sum.  Then we go to the farmer and say to him: &ldquo;There is work that requires to be done.  Look at it.  That is the grant you would get.&rdquo; Now it is up to himself to determine whether in all his circumstances he will be able so to handle the work as to involve himself in no monetary expense by using his own or his family's labour and employing the £140 to meet any other charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we will; but I want to reassure Senators about this.  We will consider each individual case in which we have a misunderstanding with the farmers as a very grave reflection on our efficiency.  There is a time limit fixed, for two reasons. One is that, if a scheme of this kind begins to drag on indefinitely, it just does not get done.  Secondly, where large works of this character are being done, if a man habitually employs five or six men on his land and says he will do it with his own men, we would like to fix some such time limit as <Col N="1614" /> would make it clear that, if the use of his own men for this work would interfere with normal production, he would be expected to employ extra men to get it done within some given time.</P>
      <P>This is a bit obscure until you examine it.  We tell the farmer that £140 is his grant, but that we reserve the right to pay him part of that grant in kind and part in cash.  Senator Sweetman envisaged the farmer who wanted to fertilise his land but had not got the money and I commended to him to get credit.  Here is a farmer who has the money, £140, but lest he might paper up the kitchen or whitewash the house, or build an avenue up from the gate, before he applies the fertilisers which his land requires to maximise his earning capacity, inasmuch as the purpose of our work is to render fully arable the land on which we work, we reserve the right to say to him that such quantity of fertilisers as that land requires to be made fully arable will be provided and will constitute payment in kind of a part of the grant to which he is entitled.  It has this additional advantage, of which Senators would wish to know, that by this means I think we can get it spread on his land at a slightly lower rate than if each individual had to go and deal with the lime spreader or the phosphate spreader on his own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is only one part of the scheme. The other half envisages say, where a farmer says, for some reason best known to himself: &ldquo;It does not suit me to do it, but I would like the Department to do it.&rdquo;  There we go through the same procedure, we estimate what it is going to cost and we expect the farmer to allow us to charge upon his land two-fifths of the cost.  Suppose it is estimated to cost us £30 fully to drain an acre for which we have taken responsibility, two-fifths of £30 is £12; therefore, he is getting three-fifths of the expense as a grant and two-fifths as a loan charged upon his land, payable over 60 years. That £12 is an overriding maximum. In an occasional case &mdash; and it would be an exceptional case &mdash; you might find that, in order to treat 15 acres effectively, there was one acre in the middle that would cost £40 or £50.  We <Col N="1615" /> would not charge the farmer £20, which is two-fifths of £50, in respect of that one acre since there is an overriding maximum of £12.  Suppose it only cost us £20 to reclaim the acre, or that we estimated it would cost us only £20, then we would levy only £8, not £12.  The £12 is an overriding maximum and Senators will remember that, in every case, the land must be arable or potentially arable.  There is no intention of taking the top of a mountain and trying to make fertile land out of it.  I wonder if that explanation has made the position clear.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to make this clear.  A free grant of £140 is indicated where the farmer does the work himself.  If he does not do the work himself, does the State guarantee him in service the equivalent of £140?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to make out in a very simple way.  Senator O'Farrell and I were momentarily overlooking the fertilisers.  In the case where a farmer gets the grant, he is paid for the work he does and he gets the fertilisers as part of his grant.  In the case where we do the work, we not only do it but we apply the fertilisers. Therefore, you have to add to the £210 <Col N="1616" /> the sum of £5 an acre for fertilisers, that is £45 for nine acres, making the total £255.  He is asked to pay back £108 and under that part of the plan he in fact receives £147.  That is £7 more than he gets under the grant.</P>
      <P>That is done deliberately, for this reason.  The scheme is not primarily designed to be an employment scheme, but if a farmer were so circumstanced as to permit of his employing labour, and if it were an even balance of convenience as to whether he would hire men to get it done or work overtime himself to do it, we would like to give him that slight edge, to encourage him to get us to hire labourers and not stay working until 12 o'clock at night himself, with his children or his household. I think that is a very rational proposition and I am obliged to Senator O'Farrell for bringing my attention to it.</P>
      <P>Senator Counihan says that security of tenure is the <i>sine qua non</i> of life being worth living on the land.  He is right and I hope that the Land Bill which my colleague will shortly bring before Oireachtas Éireann will provide for our people rehabilitation not only on the land but in security of the tenure by which they hold it.  I look to that Bill as being the death warrant of the grabber in this country.  There will be no more grabbers when they have to pay the full market value for the land.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Buachalla is benevolent and gracious &mdash; Guidhim an rath air &mdash; but faint praise of an avuncular doubter can be a very deadly instrument to parry.  He hopes that everything will be all right but he is full of apprehension. He does not see much difference between this scheme and schemes that went before it but he hopes that there will be a wider performance from the provisions of this one.  I hope to dazzle him.  If he is half as pessimistic as he sounds &mdash; not pessimistic so much as apprehensive &mdash; I hope to cover him with an atmosphere of security in the immediate future that will lull him to rest.  Yes, I agree with the Senator that what I want to do is to bring within the reach of our farmers a knowledge for which, as the Senator has said, our people have always had a profound love and respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1617" /> I did not get much help from the Senator's colleagues on the Galway County Committee.  One member of the council was gracious enough to tell me to go and mind my own business; another was kind enough to say that they did not want any hordes of grass inspectors there pestering the farmers of County Galway, and yet a third was anxious to inquire what did Mr. Dillon think he was going to get out of it. There seemed to be many cynics in Galway, yet may I depend on the Senator to undertake their education?  It is a hard thing to educate farmers if those whose duty it is to educate them themselves require education, but even in that dilemma I would not despair if I may depend on the Senator to undertake the herculean labour of redecorating the augean stable of Galway County Committee of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Senator is an economist but I like to think that before &ldquo;the dismal science&rdquo; he must prefer the science of sociology.  If, according to the rules of the dismal scientists, we are to evaluate every acre of land in pounds, shillings and pence the Senator will agree with me that we should evacuate one-third of this country and leave it to the seagulls. But, we do not intend to do it no matter what the economists say and I think the Senator will join with me in saying to the economists that if they do not like it they can lump it and write theses for the rest of the time, proving in theory that we are wrong. We will have plenty of time to laugh at them in the knowledge that we are right.</P>
    <P>Now, about the question of convertibility the Senator had asked how we are going to repay the American dollars.  I believe the Senator will agree with me on reflection that if the convertibility of dollars and sterling is not restored before 1955, before repayment begins, there will be a different aspect on how to find the dollars to repay the Americans.  We made no disguise when we borrowed dollars from the United States.  We told them that in the conditions regarding convertibility we could not get the dollars to repay them but that the purpose of their plan was to attain the convertibility. We did not doubt the success <Col N="1618" /> that would attend their efforts any more than they did and provided they were prepared to share our trust we could undertake prompt payment when it was due, but if the Senator foresees a world in which the United States will be the sole currency country then I think he is allowing himself to fall into the same kind of error as a political economist who says that we must evacuate one-third of Ireland and leave it to the seagulls.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will get it. So surely as the Marshall Plan succeeds and democracy and decency overthrow the Bolshevik forces of corruption, we pay dollar for dollar.  If I were as sure of everything as I am that the forces of democracy and decency will smash the attempt to overthrow Christian civilisation the prospect of not having the wherewithal to pay dollar for dollar would not trouble my mind.  Let me reassure the Senator that so surely as he and I retain the freedom we now enjoy we will have dollars to repay.  If we have not dollars we will not have freedom, and if I have got to share the Siberian solitude of a Bolshevik salt mine with Senator Ó Buachalla it will not cost me one <Col N="1619" /> night's sleep whether I have dollars or sterling to repay the Marshall loan. They can have it then in salt.  That is all I will have to offer and I will not even have that if I do not get out by the back door before the Bolsheviks get in.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter spoke of specialised problems that may arise out of land reclamation.  I never believe in consulting people on what they are paid for. I hope to retain the services of the greatest authority in the world on the problem of improvement of hill grazing in Ireland.  I am not free to mention his name at this stage because I have not yet approached him.  I believe that in the long run the best value for money is the best of whatever you want to buy.</P>
      <P>Many people are in the habit of saying that this is only a poor country and that, therefore, we ought to get along with the second- and third-rate. Inasmuch as we are a poor country I think we cannot afford to retain in our service or to pay for anything but the best.  When you get that, leave the problem in his hands and abide by the results.  Nothing is more fatal than, having secured the best, to start teaching how to do the job.  My responsibility will end when the best brains available are secured for the services of our people and the resources put at his disposal to effect the purpose he is commissioned to realise.</P>
      <P>I am sorry if I must say something that would appear gratuitous to Senator Professor O'Brien but I have a passion for the records, too.  He spoke of the solicitude that he shared with me for the land, and with the loyalty of a distinguished scholar, speaking of his intellectual masters, Father Finlay and Sir Horace Plunket, he traced his devotion to the land to their inspiration. That may be true of Senator O'Brien.  Nothing that I believe, nothing that I stand for, nothing that I commend is founded for me in the philosophy or outlook of the late Sir Horace Plunket.  My love of the land is derived from quite another source, one which is entirely unsympathetic to the philosophy of which he spoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Senator Sweetman was, probably, <Col N="1620" /> thinking of the same fundamental problem present to the ever lucid mind of Senator O'Brien when he said he questioned where all the liquid assets would come from wherewith to meet the Sinking Fund to redeem this loan.  I want to suggest, and I must say so with great trepidation towards Senator O'Brien, that even so great a mind as his may sometimes be dazzled by the illusion of the critic.  The revenue of this State is a reasonably liquid asset on which to borrow.  It would be a foolish Government that laid upon itself an unproductive burden in excess of capacity to repay.  We have got to face this, that the money to finance the redemption of this borrowing must be looked for in the growing yield of revenue derived from expanding economy, resultant from increased production on the land.  If it does not come from that, there is nowhere else to get it.</P>
    <P>If there is any better liquid asset known to any member of this Seanad I would be glad to hear of it.  The holders of most securities may have to learn that painful lesson over the next decade.  I do not think many people here require that instruction.  I thank Senator McGuire for commending the Bill and Senator Loughman for valuable suggestions.  We are already in process of taking steps to put them into operation.  I do not think Senator O'Brien is really apprehensive as to the true answer to the question about land annuities.  Does the Senator remember the rejoinder I made to our friend on the right, that there was an occasion when our people listened with little respect to a theory which was declared to be mandatory and just said: &ldquo;Theory be damned.  We are going to do it this way because this is the way we like to have it.&rdquo;  There is no Government ever to be established in this country which will dare to claim the right to convert the land annuities from terminable annuities to a permanent charge.  Any Government that attempted it would find that the grandsons of those who signed the &ldquo;No Rent&rdquo; manifesto have not forgotten how to go about that business.  I have no doubt, if the necessity should arise, that Senator O'Brien and I would sit at the table of the Plan of <Col N="1621" /> Campaign and collect the rents as material to carry on the fight to free the land from anyone's claim to levy upon it a permanent charge.  The land annuities under every land Act are terminable annuities designed to redeem the purchase price.  That done they are ended for ever more.  And there is no power in this land or in any other land who can acquire the right permanently to levy a cess upon the homes of our people.  That is a matter of very fundamental principle and I am amazed at Senator O'Brien&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Minister does not wish to answer the question that is all right, but it seems to me that it is a question quite easy to answer, to state that date at which annuities on land purchased under the Land Purchase Act, 1903, will legally expire.  That is the question which is asked by the Banking Commission and I am asking it now.  If the Minister does not wish to answer, that is all right but he should give me a clear, categorical, straight answer.  Assuming that the sinking fund provisions of the Wyndham Act were in operation the date would be 68½ years from the date of the making of the advance, but if the sinking fund provisions of the Wyndham Act no longer operate since the halving of the land annuities in 1933, when will the annuities terminate? Is the time doubled or what since 1933?  The tenant purchasers would like an answer to that question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;If the Senator will allow me &mdash; he will get a civil reply telling him the precise sum which he is required to pay for a clear bill.  If, on the other hand, the tenant purchaser says: &ldquo;My father purchased under the Wyndham Act this holding which I now have, and I desire to know for how long will I be required to pay the half yearly gale at present levied upon me&rdquo; he will receive a civil reply giving the information he wants. These are matters which I think it is a dangerous thing to pretend are ambiguous because it would be very easy to disturb the public mind in suggesting to the people that some dark conspiracy was afoot.  There is not any.  If the Senator will give me any individual holding in which he is interested himself I will guarantee the information in respect of one holding or of any number of holdings.  He knows perfectly well that I am not the Minister for Lands, but I do not want for one moment to use that explanation, so readily acceptable to members of Parliament who understand its significance for the record, as an excuse. May I give Senator O'Brien a clear and categorical reply that the annuity is terminable?  There is no question or suggestion of its being converted into a permanent annuity or its duration being extended by a single day.  Is that clear?  I want to say this of the Banking Commission: If ever their responsibility was to be judged by the idiotic performance of leaving unanswered questions of that kind, then I hope, in so far as their report contained that idiotic inquiry, the rest of its quality is not to be so judged. It is a scandal for responsible people to write down in a public document of <Col N="1623" /> that standing a query of that sort when the simplest precaution would secure a categorical reply.  They had the duty as they were a commission to ask those responsible to reveal their intentions to convert the annuities into a perpetual charge if they had the slightest suspicion that anyone had that in mind. Nothing could be more deplorable than to leave in doubt for the purpose of begetting that suspicion something that goes to the root of the everyday lives of our people.</P>
      <P>I do not know why Senator Seumas O'Farrell says that there is no free grant.  There is.  It is true that a farmer will get work done on his own land and inasmuch as the grant pays him for that labour, it is true to say that there is no free grant.  He may, if he can, get contractors to do the work for him and if they do it for less than the grant amounts to he is entitled to put the balance in his pocket.</P>

      <P>The rates for agricultural work will be agricultural rates but not for the working of elaborate machines.  I am happy to tell the Senators that already we have got our first deserter from a public authority in Great Britain who is to take up duty with us on the 21st of this month, coming home, and he is in correspondence with several other men who have a competent knowledge of the handling of these machines, whom we propose <Col N="1624" /> to bring home, if they want to come, and whom we will use as a nucleus to train men here in Ireland.  They are entitled to be paid just as much as they are paid in England.</P>
      <P>On the question of part payments, which was raised by Senator Hawkins, I think I dealt with that when I spoke of the principle of a <i>quantum meruit.</i> The farm buildings scheme is going ahead as fast as we can keep it going and we intend to carry it on year after year until the work is done. I think I referred to education and grass seeds.  I do not know why I should ask the Seanad or the Dáil to provide financial assistance for people who have good land.  I do not know how people brought in the wheat vouchers, but the recoupment of the wheat vouchers was provided for under an Act passed during my pre-decessor's administration, the provisions of which are being very scrupulously observed.  He had all the fun of giving out the vouchers, while I have all the fun of getting them in and trying to collate them, which, I can assure Senators, is quite a job.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dwyer and I are in agreement about getting the water into a river that winds somewhere to the sea. So is Senator Meighan, and every other practical farmer will have that constantly in mind.  I hope to show Senator O'Dwyer the realisation of his hopes and mine in that regard.</P>
      <P>Lastly, I ask the Seanad to expedite the passage of the Bill, if possible, because I have yet to go to the Dáil to seek the necessary finance wherewith to proceed with the job, and every day counts.

    </Speaker>
    <P>By common consent, the experiment, introduced by the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, of a court of summary jurisdiction manned by judges with the necessary legal qualifications and experience, has proved an unqualified success.  It is fitting that I should avail myself of this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to the district justices and their clerks who have contributed so much to the success of this experiment and I hope that it will not be thought invidious of me if I single out for special mention the pioneers amongst both justices and clerks who set the precedents and established the standards which have earned for the District Court as a whole the confidence and respect of the people.  It is <Col N="1626" /> in a sense, a measure of the success that has attended the working of the District Court that it is possible now to contemplate, as does this Bill, an important extension of the court's criminal jurisdiction.  For a long time it has been felt that the District Court's jurisdiction on the criminal side could be safely and usefully extended. Such an extension, by enabling cases to be disposed of summarily in the District Court which otherwise would have to be sent for trial before judge and jury after depositions had been taken, might be expected to result in an appreciable saving of time and money and in a substantial measure of relief for witnesses and jurors, while from the point of view of accused persons protracted delays in the disposal of cases would be eliminated and speedier trials ensured.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to enter into the details of the proposed enlargement of the court's jurisdiction.  These are dealt with fully in paragraph 20 of the explanatory memorandum.  Speaking generally, however, I may say that, so far as the summary trial of indictable offences is concerned, the powers of the court are being extended by Section 1 of the Bill in two ways, firstly, by adding specific offences (for example, perjury, forgery, conversion, and so on) to the list of indictable offences that are at present triable summarily and, secondly, by increasing the property value limits in cases of larceny and of malicious damage to property. The very considerable fall in the value of money is, of itself, a sufficient justification for such an increase.</P>
    <P>I want to stress the fact that the power of the District Court to deal summarily with indictable offences will continue to be subject to two conditions, namely,</P>
    <P>(a)  that the offence must be in the nature of a minor offence, and</P>
    <P>(b) that the accused does not object to a summary trial.</P>
    <P>These provisions are in conformity with the provisions of the Constitution which guarantee the right to trial by jury except for minor offences.</P>
    <P>Power is being taken in Section 1 to enable the Minister for Justice to prescribe further indictable offences as <Col N="1627" /> offences that may be tried summarily in accordance with the provisions of the section.  But an order made by the Minister in exercise of this power must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas before it can come into force.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill aims at expediting and shortening the proceedings, to the advantage of all concerned, in those cases in which the accused wishes to plead guilty.  At present, in the type of case in question, although the accused may, at all material times, be prepared to plead guilty, the full procedure must be followed of taking the depositions from all the witnesses who may be required at the trial.  The accused is then sent forward for trial and may be kept waiting for months before his case can be disposed of and, notwithstanding his admission of guilt, the depositions have to be copied and the State has to instruct counsel and to ensure that all the necessary witnesses are available in case the accused should change his mind at the last moment and withdraw his plea of guilty.  To save the waste of time and money which this procedure involves, and at the same time secure a speedier trial for the accused, is a manifest advantage if this object can be achieved without the risk of infringing the Constitutional and traditional rights of accused persons.  I think that Senators will agree that the safeguards provided in the section are adequate to protect these rights.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the section are self-explanatory and do not call for detailed comment; but perhaps two observations are called for.  The powers of the District Court under the section do not extend to the more serious crimes of murder, treason or piracy or their cognates.  It would obviously be inappropriate and undesirable to vest the District Court with the power to deal summarily with such serious crimes, or even to apply, the alternative procedure provided for in the section, of allowing the accused to sign a plea of guilty and thereupon sending him forward for trial without taking any depositions.  As regards the provision of the section which vests a discretion in the District Court, <Col N="1628" /> either to deal with the case summarily or to send it forward for trial without depositions or with such depositions as may have been taken up to the time at which the accused signs the plea of guilty, it is contemplated that the district justice, in determining which course to adopt, would, apart from any other relevant considerations, have regard to the adequacy or otherwise of the punishment which he was permitted by law to impose for the offence. If he thought that the maximum punishment which he could order would be inadequate, he would doubtless send the accused forward to the Circuit Court, which would have the power to impose a heavier sentence. The Justice's discretion is not wholly unfettered, however, because, if the Attorney-General objects, he cannot deal with the case summarily.  This is thought to be a desirable safeguard, but it is to be noted that while the Attorney-General can object to, he cannot insist upon, a summary trial.</P>
    <P>This brings me to Section 3, which provides for the punishment by the District Court of offences dealt with summarily under Section 1 or 2.  In view of the increased powers being given to the court to deal summarily with a wider range and more serious types of cases, it is necessary to give the court the power to impose correspondingly greater punishment.  Six months' imprisonment is the maximum sentence that the District Court may impose at present (unless it imposes consecutive sentences for two or more offences), while the court has no general power to inflict a monetary penalty.  Under Section 3, the court will have power to impose a fine of up to £50 or imprisonment up to 12 months, or both fine and imprisonment.</P>
    <P>As Senators will have gathered, one of the primary objects of Sections 1 and 2 of the Bill is to reduce the amount of time that has to be spent in the District Court on the preliminary investigation of indictable offences by, on the one hand, extending as far as possible the range of cases that may be disposed of summarily and, on the other hand, enabling cases to be sent forward for trial at the earliest possible stage, once the accused is prepared to plead guilty. It is only right that, in this connection, <Col N="1629" /> I should tell the House that we considered very carefully whether any other measures which might be expected to help towards achieving the same object were feasible and desirable. I might mention, for example, such suggestions as the returning of a person for trial on the establishment merely of a <i>prima facie</i> case against him and notwithstanding that all the depositions had not been taken or, where there was a multiplicity of charges, returning the accused for trial on one or two charges and preferring the remainder on indictment, although depositions had not been taken in regard to them.  Such suggestions would involve a more or less radical departure from the existing procedure for the preliminary investigation and trial of indictable charges and would not, it was felt, on the whole, be in the best interests of the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill are, as I mentioned at the outset, of a technical character and the House will, I think, agree that they can be more conveniently and appropriately dealt with in detail on Committee Stage.  If, however, there are any points which Senators may desire to raise on any of these provisions, I shall endeavour to deal with them when replying or shall give them consideration between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the concluding statement of the Minister, that this is a Bill of a highly technical nature and would more appropriately be dealt with on the Second Stage by setting up a special committee of the House to deal with it, as we have done in connection with other Bills.  In the meantime, there are one or two points I would like to mention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given expression to the point of view already, that we considered it advisable to have an extension of the jurisdiction of the district justices.  We will admit that, on the whole, the district justices throughout the country have earned for themselves and for their court the respect and admiration of the entire community.  In a very few cases sometimes justices have given way to what one might call rash statements, <Col N="1630" /> unnecessary statements, and criticisms which would be better left unsaid, in the interest of the carriage of justice in the first place and the carrying forward of respect for the court and for themselves in many other cases.</P>
    <P>There is another question that arises from the Bill, that is, in giving over to the district justices, at this stage, functions that have not been allocated to them in their original appointment, as to whether many of them have that training essential to the carrying out of the extra duties in a fit and effective manner.  Another question is that of the provision of proper facilities.  We have seen, from time to time, complaints published, in the Press and elsewhere, as to the conditions under which justice has to be administered, particularly in courthouses in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Another point is whether under this Bill, the powers of the Attorney-General are being widened and extended. Again I say that these are matters that would probably be more appropriately dealt with on the Committee Stage or if the House proposed to set up a special committee to examine them, I think we would be perfectly agreeable to that course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this is essentially a committee Bill.  There is something to be said for the setting up of a committee to deal with it, but I think it would be better to discuss it in a Committee of the House early in the autumn.  My reason for that is that while to some extent the Bill is one for experts, there are a very large number of matters in which the ordinary common sense and experience of the public might be very important. I would like to ask the Press generally to give publicity to the fact that this is not a Party Bill in any sense of the word but is introduced here in order that it might get full consideration, and I know that I am correct in stating that Senators on all sides of the House would welcome comments from experienced members of the public including barristers and solicitors, and others interested in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it seems to me that the public generally should be urged to get this Bill and read it.  I gathered from <Col N="1631" /> the whole tone of the Minister that while this Bill could be regarded as a technical measure, it is one of such very wide interest for the public generally that it is one in which views will be considered.  If this Bill is considered by a Committee of the House, which I favour, and we then find that there are technical matters that should be referred to a committee, it would still be possible to appoint a special committee to deal with some sections of it.  This Bill is being introduced now with at least two months in which interested members of the public can read it, which provides a very valuable way of examining and passing legislation on these matters.  I hope the Press will give publicity to that fact and to the fact that comments on the measure will be welcomed and would be very helpful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. D. Burke Mr. D. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to me a very useful piece of legislation which I am informed will simplify the work of District Courts and also the work on the criminal side.  I am further informed that it will reduce congestion in the criminal business of the Circuit Court.  It gives the district justice power to deal, with the sanction of the Attorney-General, with indictable offences where the accused pleads guilty.  That involves great responsibility on the Attorney-General and is a provision which might be open to abuse.  In cases where an accused pleads guilty the district justice would not go into the facts very closely when he had not the necessity of sending the accused forward to the Circuit Court.  The result might be then that a person charged with a serious offence could, without much publicity, get off lightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 will simplify matters and save a great deal of unnecessary work in many cases but at the same time it seems to have the effect of giving a wide discretion to the Attorney-General which might not be altogether desirable.  These are some observations which friends have given me on the matter of this Bill.  In view of the way the Minister has spoken in introducing it and the manner in which it has been met by the Senators who have spoken, I do think it would be <Col N="1632" /> desirable that some select committee should be set up to deal with the matter and that the Press would give the publicity that Senator Douglas has asked and that those interested in those matters would put forward their views so as to make this as desirable a piece of legislation as we all would wish it to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the House to look at Section 15 of the Bill which says that in any criminal proceedings, the court may, if it is deemed in the interest of the accused or public morality, do certain things. Under section (a) it may provide for the hearing of a case in camera.  That, I understand, is a matter of common law but section (b) makes for the prohibition of the publication of certain portions of the proceedings if the court considers it to be in the interest of the accused or of public morality.  That, I have been authoritatively informed, is a fresh power.  If that is not so, I will sit down and speak no more.  I would like, however, the Minister to say if this is conferring a new power on the District Court or the other courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be some slight extension of an existing power.  It is qualifying a power that already exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It does confer a new power to the extent that it empowers the court to prohibit the publication of certain things in newspapers if considered contrary to public morality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Then that is conferring greater powers on District Courts and creates an entirely new <Col N="1633" /> situation.  I must then criticise this section.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that this power, if improperly used, could lead to the equivalent of star-chamber courts. Secret courts, like secret police, deservedly have a bad name in this country and elsewhere.  I know that we should not offer any disrespect towards our judiciary.  Lord Acton has warned us that all power tends to corrupt, that absolute power corrupts absolutely.  I think the right to publish details is a most valuable safeguard for our civil liberties.  It may be argued that once the right of trial in camera is conceded there is no reason for granting right of publication, because that would be impossible.  That is not so.  If a trial is held in camera persons who were allowed to attend the court, the plaintiff, the defendant and so on, are at perfect liberty to tell the first Pressmen they speak to what they thought of the trial.  If these powers are conferred that most important right may be lost.  In this country especially, the freedom of the Press must be preserved as far as we can do so.</P>
      <P>It may be argued against my plea for freedom of publication, that it was found necessary in Britain in 1926 to prohibit reports of divorce proceedings. It may be asked, why not get similar powers here?  The position is not the same.  We all know that Irish newspapers differ very considerably from notorious English newspapers.  In England the problem of free publication was grossly abused.  Irish newspapers have never lowered their standard to that extent.  In fact, I hold that we have been shown that we can trust them to observe decency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak after careful consideration on this point.  While many citizens admit the need for some censorship, they feel that we have far too much censorship in this country.  We have a very active Board of Censors, as well as thousands of unofficial censors in libraries and bookshops, keeping out books that they claim are below them but are generally beyond them.  Let me prove that by referring to a letter in this day's newspapers from the Secretary of the Censorship of Publications Board in reply <Col N="1634" /> to one by a former member of the board.  The secretary refers to one of the greatest masterpieces of modern times, Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I do not think on this Bill this House should be used as a sounding-board on censorship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Chair agree?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case may I draw the attention of the House to Article 34 (1) of the Constitution of Ireland?  It reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution, and save on such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law, shall be administered in public.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I insist that the intention was the right and propriety to administer law in public as far as possible, save in specially limited cases.  It may be argued, and I shall argue, that this section confers general powers or, at least, more general powers on the courts than that Article of the Constitution intended.  In the Bill the courts would become the final authority for deciding whether public morality was involved or not.  In England, for example, by contrast these powers, are, as far as I know, limited to divorce courts.  If a similar limitation were introduced here it would be perfectly constitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all deference to the legal luminaries in the House I suggest that it might be an infringement of the Constitution to give these more general powers, especially to District Courts. I emphasise that, because in some cases a district justice may be in a hurry, he may be tired, or may suffer from some of the other failings to which human flesh is prone, and might wrongfully exercise this right to exclude publication.  District justices are more subject to local pressure than judges in the High Court.  They might have pressure put upon them to use this power.  I am quite prepared to be refuted by the Attorney-General, but <Col N="1635" /> I feel that there is a danger in this clause and I ask for enlightenment upon it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CecilLavery" hpid="Mr. Lavery Mr. Lavery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lavery</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been approached generally by the Seanad in the only possible way.  It is not a single Bill but a collection, more or less, of unrelated amendments to the criminal law which have been found by practice and experience to be necessary.  There is no doubt that the administration of the criminal law in this country at present is subject to great delay, due to the formalism necessary in the discharge of such an important part of the work of the State.  It is obvious that that cannot be avoided, and improvements can only be of a more or less limited character.</P>
      <P>That there could be improvements I think will be admitted by all who have experience of the workings of the courts.  A Bill of this kind has been in contemplation for something like ten or 15 years, and when the Minister projected the introduction of this measure, he intended, if possible, to introduce one much more comprehensive than this proves to be.  It was found on examination of various matters that we thought required amendment and improvement, that difficulties of various kinds arose.  In the end, when all the major proposals have been taken away, the Bill is comparatively minor in the effort it makes to improve the administration of criminal law.  It does something, and that is all that can be said of it.  It does some important things, but matters of major difficulty or that might be of major controversy, are untouched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the principal reason that actuated the Minister in introducing this Bill was that it was better to do something in this generation, rather than wait for ten or 15 years, or perhaps indefinitely, to achieve perfection at some distant date in the future; that it was better to do something in our time, than to spend all our lives discussing what ought to be done and achieve nothing. Therefore, I think this Bill ought to be approached by trying to get it into Committee and to recommend it to the Dáil.  Obviously, there must be close <Col N="1636" /> discussion of many of its provisions, because they are important.  At the same time, speedy enactment would be in the interest of the administration of the law, and for that reason I suggest to the Seanad that the proposal that the matter should be dealt with by a Committee of the House, rather than to refer it to a Select Committee, is the better one.  After all, this is not such a large Assembly.  The proceedings of this House are not unduly formal and it should be possible to debate the particular provisions of this Bill adequately in a Committee of the whole House and make it possible to pass the Bill in whatever form finally was approved in a shorter space of time than if we sent it to a Select Committee from which it might emerge after a period of months or longer.  Therefore, I think that that is the proposal the House should consider and, in my submission, should adopt.</P>
    <P>Having said that about the Bill as a whole, there are, of course, points of varying importance to which certain Senators have adverted.  They require consideration individually and, as has been said, it is scarcely appropriate to discuss them at all on the Second Reading. One thing that rather surprised me was that both Senator Hawkins and Senator Burke thought that there was something in the Bill to extend the powers of the Attorney-General. Senator Hawkins only referred to it asking whether it might be so, but Senator Burke apparently believes that certain parts of the Bill seek to confer great powers on the Attorney-General and great discretion.  I confess that I was surprised because it had not occurred to me that the Bill proposed to give any important new functions to the Attorney-General.  I gather that what Senator Burke has in mind is that in a case where the accused pleads guilty and the Attorney General consents, the District Court may deal with the case, but only within the limits as to penalties the District Court has, instead of sending forward the case for trial in the Circuit Court before a Circuit Court judge.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, of course, that the only function the Attorney-General has in that matter is that if the accused <Col N="1637" /> pleads guilty the Attorney-General has the option of asking the court not to deal with the case but to sent it forward; but the district justice has also got the discretion, no matter what party thinks otherwise&mdash;if one may regard in a criminal case the Attorney-General as a party on the one side and the accused as a party on the other&mdash; as to whether he will deal with it now or send it forward.  The Circuit Court has wider jurisdiction and may impose more severe penalties than the District Court, but the district justice having legal qualifications, should be thought fit to deal with the case when the accused wishes him to deal with it; the Attorney-General sees no objection to his doing so and the district justice himself feels that he may do so within the limit of imposing a sentence up to 12 months imprisonment.  I do not think, therefore, that there is very much to be feared in vesting the Attorney-General with that particular power.</P>
    <P>The only other specific matter that has been adverted to is clause 15 of the Bill on which Senator Professor Stanford has expressed certain doubts as to its constitutional character and as to its desirability.  Perhaps it is not appropriate to deal with the matter in the clause in detail here, but speaking about it generally, it is undoubtedly a very important clause.  Undoubtedly it is a matter upon which the Oireachtas, both this House and the Dáil, should greatly concern themselves. The question of the administration of justice in the public courts and the giving of proper publication to those proceedings is, of course a very important matter and must be carefully considered before it is in any way limited, but it must also be remembered that the primary consideration in dealing with courts must be the attainment of justice, the doing of justice between the parties.  When a person finds himself charged with a criminal offence, he is presumed to be innocent; he has to face a very serious situation; the powers of the State have been invoked against him; his liberty may have been taken from him; he may appear as a person in custody to answer a charge of a serious kind. He requires, and ought to get from the State, proper protection to see that <Col N="1638" /> justice is done to him and that any other consideration, whether it be the freedom of the Press or the satisfaction of the community as to what is going on in the courts, important as those things may be, should be subordinate to the proper protection of his interests.  That, I suppose, is a general proposition that would command assent.  Certainly, I suppose it will be conceded on all sides that the interests of public morality ought to be safeguarded.  That is an important thing in these days when newspapers are read by all, young and old, people of varying degrees of education and varying degrees of capacity.  Whatever Senator Professor Stanford may think about the need or otherwise for the particular form of censorship that we have, in these days when liberty and perhaps licence is so prevalent, it is not unreasonable to demand some form of protection of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I said so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CecilLavery" hpid="Mr. Lavery Mr. Lavery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lavery</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that I had no doubt that Senator Professor Stanford would accept that.  In the proceedings in the public court very unpleasant and difficult matters must of necessity be inquired into, matters relating to the personal lives of individuals, matters of a kind which are not ordinarily considered proper for discussion or report in the public Press.  Judges and practitioners in court have to do mighty unpleasant things and inquiries have to be conducted of a kind which are not fit for public consumption and which no person of ordinary standard of living or outlook would wish to read. If that is admitted, if these two ideas are admitted, that the protection of the interests of the accused is paramount and that the protection of public morality is a matter of importance, the next fundamental question we have to consider is who should be entrusted with securing these two important ideas.  The issue, I suppose, arises that as far as the publication of proceedings in court is concerned, there are two categories of persons who have to be considered.  One is the judge and the other is the editor of the paper.  We all know that what Senator Professor Stanford has said about the standard of the Press in <Col N="1639" /> Ireland was justified.  We all know that our Irish newspapers have observed a high standard of conduct in reporting or in not reporting, as the case may be, matters of the kind we are discussing here.  But, giving newspaper proprietors, newspaper editors and newspaper men generally the highest credit which they certainly deserve, there surely remains the question of whether the editor of a newspaper or the judge who is charged with the trial of the case is better able to judge whether the protection of the interests of the accused and the interests of public morality will be safeguarded by the publication or not or by the hearing of the case in camera or the hearing in public.</P>
      <P>That is really the choice.  Is it better to leave it to the discretion of a judge or to leave it to the discretion of a newspaper editor?  We can answer that, in the past, there has been no infringement of the ideas of the interests of the accused or of public morality, but I think it is not going too far to say that a judge is the more appropriate person to invest with this jurisdiction.  Senator Stanford spoke, as people are sometimes inclined to speak, of judges being, if not venal, at any rate subject to influence.  Such a thing is possible.  I suppose newspaper editors may be subject to influence, too.  It is possible that we may have in the future venal judges or judges who may yield to unworthy motives in exercising a jurisdiction given them, but this House cannot legislate on the basis that the judges will prove unworthy of their trust. Surely every organ of State in performing its functions must proceed on the assumption, well founded, it is to be hoped, that other organs of State and other functionaries will discharge their responsibilities properly also, so that we may or we ought to leave out of account any idea that judges will act improperly in the exercise of this jurisdiction which it is sought to give them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Stanford referred on more than one occasion to the District Court and it is, of course, true that these powers, if given, would be enjoyed by <Col N="1640" /> the District Court as well as by members of the higher judiciary.  This particular section, however, is not peculiar to the District Court &mdash; it is general; and it is more likely, I suppose, that these functions would have to be exercised by Circuit judges, High Court judges and judges of the Supreme Court more often than by district justices.  However that may be, it is true that district justices would have the power, if the clause became law.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to Article 34 of the Constitution, with a view to raising in a tentative manner the constitutional nature of the provision. It must be borne in mind &mdash; it does not appear from the print of the Constitution which is now published and which no doubt Senator Stanford is using &mdash; that Article 34 (1), as he read it, has been brought into that particular form by amendment.  As the Constitution was originally enacted, it provided simply that &ldquo;justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution and shall be administered in public&rdquo;.  It was found that that provision was far too wide, because, if anything I have said up to the present is justified, it is quite clear that cases must arise where trial otherwise than in public is necessary for achieving the ends of justice, the protection of the interests of the accused, or the interests of public morality.  The phrase &ldquo;save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law&rdquo; was inserted in the Constitution by amendment within the period provided by the Constitution itself for amendment, and it was, I apprehend, put in precisely in order to make possible provisions of the very kind which we are dealing with here.</P>
    <P>In passing, and in order that Senator Stanford and other Senators may consider the matter further before this Bill is dealt with in Committee.  I might refer Senators to Article 40, Clause 6, paragraph 1, which is the Article in which the State guarantees liberty for the exercise of rights, subject to public order and morality.  The first right guaranteed is the right of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.  As I am not arguing this in <Col N="1641" /> a court of law, I need not point out that it is limited to the expression of convictions and opinions and not to the report of matters of fact.  The Article goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The education of public opinion being, however, a matter of such grave import to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the Press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>The publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not say that that Article necessarily throws a great deal of light on the present matter, but I think it has to be taken into account, and I might observe that the Constitution takes pains to declare that the publication of blasphemous or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law and makes no exception in regard to the publication of indecent matter merely because it may be the publication of the report of proceedings in court.</P>

      <P>There is no such positive enactment, but the reason for that is this, that, whether we acted wisely or not, in this State we have from its institution adopted a written Constitution.  The Constitution enacted in 1922 contented itself with what is usual in Constitutions, which are to be regarded as the fundamental law, with more or less general statements. We, or the people, enacted in 1937 a Constitution of a different character.  It has caused many difficulties in the past and no doubt will cause many difficulties in the future, by reason of what some people think the unnecessary detail with which it hung around the neck of the State a series of positive provisions, not to be altered by ordinary legislation and which may prove unsuitable in varying conditions. One example &mdash; it may have been a good thing or a bad thing &mdash; is that the right of freedom of association was declared in such detailed terms that the Trade Union Act of 1941 which was considered, by some, at any rate, to mark an advance in collective bargaining and social organisation was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.  However, that is by the way.</P>

      <P>I agree.  I raised this interesting point &mdash; the Chair will agree that the House is rather informal &mdash; that it might, indeed, in the case of the Trade Union Bill, be very desirable that the provisions of the Constitution, <Col N="1643" /> in so far as the Trade Union Act was repugnant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lavery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is perfectly right.  I agree with Senator Hearne that the Constitution can be altered by a referendum.  I am pointing out that it is so detailed that without having resort to getting the opinion of the people by a referendum, it remains rigid to that extent.  However, my main point is that we have a written Constitution.  Therefore, we must find all the powers of the courts and the various organs of the State in the Constitution, or in positive law. Though we have taken over the body of the common law, if you find a provision of the Constitution such as I have just been quoting, it is not easy to contend that general powers which the courts previously exercised are still in force and have survived positive provisions of the Constitution.  It was claimed that the courts had at common law an inherent power to hear proceedings in camera, but the old idea, and perhaps the best idea of the organisation of the courts, was that the judge in his court, so far as the proceedings in his court were concerned, was more or less supreme and the court had an inherent jurisdiction not dependent on any positive enactment. That is what made it so difficult to answer the question which Senator Stanford asked of the Minister for Justice.  It is not so easy to say whether the inherent power to hear <i>in camera</i> survived the positive provision of a Constitution that justice should be administered in public save in limited cases to be provided by law. We have to take a &ldquo;hould&rdquo; of that &mdash; if I may use language similar to that used by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>I have to apologise for that informal phrase.  We have to make positive enactments.  When we come to consider Section 15 of the Bill, I am <Col N="1644" /> quite certain that the House will hear from Senator Stanford and other Senators a full discussion on the rights and wrongs of this.  Perhaps I have said enough&mdash;perhaps I have said too much, &mdash; to justify the principle of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Stanford referred to the fact that in England there are positive enactments of this kind.  The Judicial Proceedings Act of 1926 made specific provision that in certain types of cases only particulars of the parties should be given and that reports should not be published.  Therefore, we are not doing here an unprecedented thing.  I have never cared myself to resort to quotations of what is done in England as if to prove that what is done there must be right here.  However, some people like that method of approach and, if I can gain adherents by adopting it, well and good.  Sometimes we find the same idea in the courts, where decisions of English courts are quoted to the judges, even recent decisions, as if they were binding authorities.  We can get a great deal of guidance from practice in England in matters which we have to consider here where conditions are similar and where they have found, with experience, that certain provisions are necessary, and get help and assistance from seeing what they have done.  There are other conditions applicable both in England and here by way of positive enactment.  For instance, the Incest Act of 1908.  That is the law in this country as well as in Great Britain.  The statute was passed in 1908 and, under Section 5 of that Act, it is enacted that proceedings should be held in camera.  I would refer the House to another English Act which was passed in the year 1933 &mdash; The Young Persons Act.  It dealt with children's courts and with proceedings against children and matters of that kind.  It provided that certain types of proceedings should be held in camera.  It provided an exception for the attendance of <i>bona fide</i> members of the Press at such proceedings, as does the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, which also has a provision relating to the hearing of proceedings in camera.  While that Act provided an exception for members of the Press, it was careful to add that this particular <Col N="1645" /> provision was without prejudice to any other power the court might have to take proceedings in camera, in which case, if that general power were exercised, the Press, like everybody else, would be excluded.  Perhaps these are matters of too great detail.  I have referred to the Courts of Justice Act, 1936.  I think Section 37 of that Act provides for the exclusion of members of the public but contains an exception for members of the Press in certain types of cases at the discretion of the court.</P>
    <P>I should refer also to a very relevant provision in the much-abused Censorship of Publications Act, 1929.  Section 14 of that Act reads as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  It shall not be lawful to print or publish or cause or procure to be printed or published in relation to any judicial proceedings:&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  any indecent matter the publication of which would be calculated to injure public morals, or</P>
    <P>(b)  any indecent medical, surgical or physiological details the publication of which would be calculated to injure public morals.</P>
    <P>(2) It shall not be lawful to print or publish or cause or procure to be printed or published any report, statement, commentary or other matter of or in relation to any judicial proceedings for divorce, nullity of marriage, judicial separation, or restitution of conjugal rights save and except all or any of the following particulars of such proceedings so far as the same can be printed and published without contravening any other sub-section of this section...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to set out in much the same terms as the British Act of 1926 &mdash; that the information to be published shall be limited to the names, addresses and occupations of the parties and witnesses, and so forth, with the charge and summing up and the decision. It will be seen that the present <Col N="1646" /> position is not, therefore, so revolutionary and that there are positive precedents in this country and outside. It is still clear that while this section, or something like it, ought to be passed, it is a matter requiring careful consideration by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel a certain difficulty in following the Attorney-General. The case in favour of Section 15 could not have been made more ably than it has been made by the Attorney-General and yet there are still certain doubts in my mind in so far as its constitutionality is concerned.  The Attorney-General told us that this is a Bill which will apply to all courts.  I would draw attention to what I would regard as a lack of definition of &ldquo;court&rdquo;.  Until we reach Section 18 there is no definition of &ldquo;court&rdquo;.  In Section 18 (5) we read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In this section &lsquo;court&rsquo; does not include courtmartial.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As the only type of court which is mentioned in any detail throughout the Bill is the District Court I must confess that I read the Bill as applying to District Courts in particular although I accept the Attorney-General's assurance that it applies to courts in general.  I suggest it does not appear on the face of the Bill that it applies to courts in general.  As a person brought up in the legal tradition, my feeling is that the Bill is a move away from trial by jury to trial by stipendiary magistrates, and though Section 1 is hedged around with a great many safeguards, I think this is a step in the wrong direction, which should be carefully scrutinised from the point of view of the liberty of the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney-General has made certain observations regarding the relationship between the Constitution and laws made under it.  If a country elects to have a written Constitution, then, without going so far as to say that that Constitution is sacrosanct, I say it should be treated with very great respect and should not be altered except under stress of exceptional circumstances and with very full realisation <Col N="1647" /> of the fact that it is being altered.  I do not suggest that any Constitution is of such sacrosanctity that it never should be altered and never could be.  There is a growing opinion amongst lawyers and students of politics that, in the modern world, written Constitutions are necessary to safeguard individuals against bureaucracy and totalitarianism.  Many people believe that the American Constitution, with all its checks and balances, does ensure to the American public certain safeguards not ensured to the citizens of the United Kingdom where Parliament is able, by a simple majority, to alter and define the rights of the subject.  Therefore, every line of our written Constitution is important from the point of view of the citizen, and it is the duty of this House, the Second Chamber, very carefully to scrutinise any attempt to alter this Constitution &mdash; as, I suggest, certain sections of this Bill attempt to do.</P>
    <P>I wish to call attention to the power contained in Section 1 (1) (b), whereby the list of offences which can be tried summarily may be added to, subject to the consent of the Dáil and Seanad.  I accept that that means it cannot be done in an underhand way.  At the same time, I incline to the feeling that, if indictable offences are to be subject to summary jurisdiction, the most solemn procedure should be followed, and that even an Order of the Minister for Justice with the assent of the Dáil and Seanad might not be as satisfactory as if the additional offences were introduced in a special Bill, like this one, and fully debated in both Houses.</P>
    <P>In regard to Section 1 (2) (a) (ii), providing for the consent of the accused, there ought to be some provision to make it perfectly clear that the rights of the accused are fully explained to him before getting that consent. The ordinary persons charged are often ignorant and poor people, very frightened of the whole procedure, and they may quite easily give their consent without realising the full implications of abandoning their constitutional rights to trial by jury, with <Col N="1648" /> all the numerous safeguards that such a trial affords.  Therefore, I think something might be added to that clause, to ensure that it will be fully explained to the accused that he is completely free not to give his consent if he does not desire to do so.</P>
    <P>On Section 15, the major questions of constitutional importance are raised. I am not considering this question as the Attorney-General suggested from the point of view of the Press, and still less from the point of view of the curiosity of the public, but from the point of view of the district justice, and above all, the safeguarding of accused persons, whose interest must come first in any discussion on criminal procedure.  One thing which is clear at present is that justice administered behind closed doors is subject to the greatest dangers.  If our Constitution provides in Article 34 that justice shall be administered in open court, that is a right that ought to be abrogated only with the clearest realisation of what the Oireachtas is doing.  I am aware of the disadvantages of publicity in the case of certain offences, such as indecency.  Everyone agrees that they should not be reported in the newspapers and most people agree that the public should be excluded from court.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that two things are involved in Section 15 which up to this have been discussed as if they were in some way interchangeable.  One is the exclusion of the public from the court and the other is the reporting of the proceedings in the Press.  They are two different things, covering vitally different problems.  The Attorney-General has already explained that Article 34 has already been amended. He has himself cited cases where a certain amount of publicity would do untold harm.  Therefore, this amendment of the Constitution: &ldquo;Save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law&rdquo; is one with which everyone agrees.  But what layman &mdash; and, still more, what lawyer &mdash; looking at the accompanying provisions of Section 15: &ldquo;In any criminal proceedings, the court may ... exclude the public or any particular portion of the public&rdquo; and may prohibit publication <Col N="1649" /> in the Press &mdash; could argue that, if the section says &ldquo;any&rdquo; court, without any limitation whatsoever, that can be fitted into the clause of the Constitution which says &ldquo;save in such special and limited cases&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General has referred to Article 40 (6) 1º of the Constitution, which brings out a point I made a moment ago.  It deals with the question of the right of citizens to express their convictions and opinions freely and goes on to deal with the Press and the cinema.  There is nothing whatever there dealing with the exclusion of the public from legal proceedings.  I think that is very important.  There is a large range of cases where it is desirable that the proceedings should not be reported in the Press, but where it is not desirable that the public should be excluded. Reporting in the Press is one thing: the presence of a small section of the public is another.  No court of ours can hold more than a certain number of people and if even a small section of the public is able to be present during the public administration of justice, abuses and injustices are very largely prevented.  Reporting in the evening papers of criminal cases, where every child can read about them, is a totally different proposition. Therefore, in so far as Article 40 (6) could be read as interpreting Article 34, it only refers, it seems to me, to publication in the Press and does not bear in any way on the exclusion of the public from court, which is a more serious infringement of the rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>There is a distinction which is not in the Bill and which, if made in the Bill, may do something to meet some of our objections.  That is, the distinction between the reporting of preliminary proceedings leading to further proceedings, and the reporting of the final proceedings. We all know that there is this controversy about the wisdom of reporting in the Press the preliminary proceedings of murder cases which attract considerable public attention.</P>
    <P>There is a case being tried in England at the moment and there is a considerable controversy as to whether the <Col N="1650" /> preliminary proceedings of that case should have been as fully reported in the Press.  We know that in these instances the case for the prosecution is given very fully, while there are no arguments put forward for the defence, which is reserved.  When widespread publicity is given, it is suggested that a juryman, no matter how he tries, cannot clear his mind of bias, prejudice and foreknowledge.  This case may be somewhat exaggerated.  Personally, I think the more publicity the better, but I can see that there may be a case for doing something like this &mdash; while not closing the court to the general public, where only a small section can get in, to prohibit the full report of the proceedings of a preliminary investigation before a district justice, where only one side, as a rule, is presented and the defence is reserved, without the case for the defendant being put.  There might be something to be said for that, and it would be within Article 34 of the Constitution clearly as one of those special cases, where special legislation would be justified to limit the Press in some way to reporting the result of such a case, saying that such and such a person was returned for trial, without giving any details regarding the offence.</P>
    <P>It is a simple thing in the matter of publication in a case that is going for trial and the jury would then come to the box with an open mind not having heard anything of the case except what they would hear in the course of the evidence for the first time.  I can see something in that but that is an entirely different thing from prohibiting publication and excluding the public from the courts at trials.  It is to my mind a very extreme measure which requires very extreme justification. It seems to me that the onus of proof for the necessity for such exclusion of the Press or the public is one that must rest on the Government and that is a very difficult onus, so far as I am concerned, to discharge.  I can give an example of my own knowledge of a case where a full newspaper report of the proceedings in a case saved a man who would have been hanged. But, the publication of the facts at the trial brought forward an essential witness <Col N="1651" /> to support that man's alibi.  It was a case of a shooting in Mount Street where the accused before the courtsmartial tried to establish an alibi but he was laughed at by the court because his alibi was of the usual type which did not arouse much credence.</P>
    <P>He had tried to prove that at the time of the shooting he was away in another district so that he could not have been near the scene of the shooting. The point was that in order to prove that he had been elsewhere he told of having seen &ldquo;an ould one&rdquo; on an aeroplane in Merrion Square.  That was laughed at at the time, but following the publication of the facts in the papers a lady wrote to the prisoner's solicitor and said that at that time she was practising on a motor-scooter in Merrion Square and she might answer to the description given by the man in his evidence.  She came forward and established the man's alibi and that man, who would certainly have been hanged, is still alive and flourishing to-day.  His life was saved by the publication of that Press report of the case.  Since then I have always been impressed with the importance of giving the fullest possible publicity to all cases and certainly in the matter of political cases.  I am certainly in favour of even a limited report in the case of preliminary proceedings in indictable offences.</P>
    <P>I certainly think, however, that any attempts to suppress reports of non-indictable offences or proceedings in the police courts when there is no further trial and the exclusion of the public in such circumstances is wholly and constitutionally wrong.  I think the objection may be, to some extent, met by the provision of some appeal from the decision of district justices.  It seems to me that in this measure we are giving the district justices who, though they are very worthy people, are the lowest rung in the judicial ladder, wide powers to cover an enlarged range of indictable offences.  In giving them the additional power to exclude the Press you are giving the justices a great deal of power over the liberty of the individual <Col N="1652" /> citizen.  It seems to me that at the present time, when liberty is being threatened on all sides everywhere, that this Bill does greatly extend powers of district justices, and should therefore be jealously scrutinised by the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I would further like to draw the attention of the Minister to Section 18 (3).</P>
    <P>Section 13 (6) of the Constitution provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The right of pardon and the power to commute or remit punishment imposed by any court exercising criminal jurisdiction are hereby vested in the President but such power of commutation or remission may, except in capital cases, also be conferred by law on other authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 18 (3) of the Bill provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government may delegate to any other authority any power conferred by this section and may revoke any such delegation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That seems to be a very wide delegation. The statute may enlarge those powers of pardon contained in the Constitution, but is it within the spirit or the letter of the Constitution?  Would this statute be supported if it were seriously questioned?  Has the Oireachtas the right to extend these powers not only to the Government but to any other person to whom the Government delegates them?  We have the Latin axiom <i>delegatus non potest delegare.</i></P>
    <P>I call the attention of the Minister and the Attorney-General to the far-reaching nature of this provision.  These are very wide powers to give and I feel that they affect the liberty, possibly, of every citizen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. J.T. O'Farrell Mr. J.T. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Although this Bill is composed of 21 sections and two Schedules, the great bulk of discussion centres on Section 15, and on the question of publicity.  A great deal could be said on that from both points of view, but I do not think that <Col N="1653" /> the operation of the section will make any material difference in existing practice, first because of the type of court and, secondly, because of the reasonably high standard observed by our newspapers.  It could, of course, operate in a very obnoxious way at times of high political tension, because the question of what is public morality might be interpreted in what might be rather a strained way by judges or justices at such times.  It might appear appropriate to a judge in such circumstances to prohibit publication of a trial of a number of people charged with political offences of a particular character, or there might be some notable politician favourable to the Government of the day, or the reverse, involved in cases in which publicity would not be desired.</P>
      <P>I know that these are, probably, extreme cases, but they are really the only dangerous circumstances in which this section might operate.  On the whole, if it were practicable to define the type of case in which this power might be exercised, it would be better. I agree to a great extent with Senators who argue that these powers are rather too wide to give justices and judges to apply in any particular case, and the Minister might consider whether it would not be possible to add to the cases already provided for whatever cases they have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would seem to be easier to discuss this Bill if it were divided into two Bills.  The first three sections and the First Schedule appear to me to constitute a distinct Bill dealing with the administration of criminal justice, while the other is a sort of omnibus Bill affecting Acts involved in criminal justice.  I heartily approve of the first three sections, because they tend to simplify and to speed up the administration of justice in criminal cases.  I imagine that one of the most terrible prospects of any accused is the time and money involved during the protracted period occupied in taking depositions in indictable offences.  In some cases these are spread over months, with numerous adjournments.  All those who are accused are not guilty people.  They may eventually vindicate their characters <Col N="1654" /> at a price which leaves them in bankruptcy.  During all the time they are under the shadow of a terrible cloud, with their whole material and spiritual prospects in peril.  Anything that would tend to speed up business &mdash; that would be in the interests of the accused.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have sat on criminal juries have often been puzzled at the necessity for certain evidence adduced on behalf of the State.  I suppose the police authorities are going on some ancient formula, but to my knowledge days have been taken hearing evidence from witnesses to which, as a juryman, I could attach no particular importance or significance, nor did the judge draw attention to any particular importance in it.  However, the formulæ has to be complied with, and the unfortunate accused is the victim.  If eventually he proves that he is not guilty, he has no redress in law by way of damages.  He has to pay for the mistake that was made in charging him in the first instance.  Even if he was guilty, I suggest we should not try to punish him financially, by ruining him in his fortune as well as in his person.</P>
    <P>To the extent that this Bill gives an opportunity to avoid a double trial in indictable offences, it is in the interests of justice, and certainly a merciful act towards the accused, whether he be innocent or guilty.  Unquestionably it is a big responsibility for the District Court in which district justices are, I think, in nearly all cases, solicitors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought they were.  To the extent that they are solicitors, they would not have quite the same qualifications perhaps for acting as justices as counsel would.  I may be wrong there but, at all events, they would not have had the same experience of indictable offences as judges, except to the extent that they have to take depositions.  Of course, prisoners are protected to the extent that one could protect them.  I presume that before a prisoner is asked to opt <Col N="1655" /> for summary jurisdiction, the court will ensure that he has had legal advice. In some cases prisoners are not able to provide that advice.  I take it that in such cases it would be provided, and that the court would be assured that a prisoner had legal advice before he opted for trial at a District Court.</P>
      <P>There is a further provision, that if there are two serious offences, one in which a year's sentence would not be enough, the Attorney-General could prevent the accused being tried by summary jurisdiction, seeing that the maximum sentence would not fit such trial if the accused was found guilty. Taken on the whole, these two sections are a very valuable contribution to the speeding up of justice and, as far as the other portions of the Bill are concerned, they are technical and involve a big principle.  I agree with other Senators that this Bill could best be discussed in detail on Committee Stage.</P>

The object was to simplify the law in certain cases and, I think, adequate precautions are taken to protect the interests of accused persons.

I am fully satisfied that the interests of the accused are protected.</P>

    <P>I do not know that there is any great need for me to go into any of the points which have been raised.  The Attorney-General, who is an expert on the matter has dealt with some of the questions raised, particularly that raised by Senator Stanford.  I did not like to say too definitely that this power already existed, but I am perfectly satisfied that the power is there.  As has been said by the Attorney-General, the power is vested in the courts to judge whether it is in the best interests of the community to hear a case <i>in camera</i> or not or have it published or not.  This Bill gives specific power to carry that on.  It is not new.  It is in the Act of <Col N="1656" /> 1929 of the Oireachtas and it is in the Judicial Proceedings Act of 1926.</P>

      <P>Yes.  In the Judicial Proceedings (Regulation of Reports) Act, 1926, of the General Acts of the British House of Commons there is the clause:&mdash;</P>

      <P>It would be like hanging a fellow first and then finding if he was guilty.  The power is inherent in the court, but, however, I leave that to be argued in Committee.  I hope that the Seanad will be as reasonably disposed on the Committee Stage as it is on this stage.  I do not know that there is very much I can say on the matter that would be useful.  In my opinion it is very important that these long delays should be avoided.  When I was here some time ago on the question of jurors I undertook to bring in a measure such as this to expedite the hearing of cases and relieve jurors from the pressure that is put upon them and I am fulfilling that promise to the Seanad.  I am glad that I have been able to do so and trust that you will accept my efforts in the most sympathetic way possible.</P>

    <Title>Alginate Industries (Ireland) Limited (Acquisition of Shares) Bill, 1949&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to explain the general purpose of this Bill it is necessary to outline the circumstances which have led to its introduction.  My Department has had assocations for the past 12 years with an English firm named Alginate Industries Limited.  This firm has been engaged in the extraction of Alginates from seaweeds since 1936, and all this time has been a buyer of Irish seaweeds, the gathering and transport being organised by Gaeltacht Services and the material being shipped in the air-dried state to Scotland for processing.</P>
      <P>Early in 1946, the company decided to form an associate Irish company the better to ensure their supplies of these raw materials.  Plans were made for the Irish company to engage in the purchase, sale and shipment to the English company of air-dried searods. Later in the year 1946, the English company became interested in ascophyllum (rock-weed) as a supplementary raw material for the production of a kind of alginate which would cater for certain markets which could not be satisfied out of the limited annual production from searods in Ireland and Scotland, and it was decided to set up a plant in Connemara to dry and mill the weed instead of shipping it unprocessed from this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish company was incorporated in February, 1947, with a capital of £6,000, of which 51 per cent. was subscribed by an Irish interest.  A site for the drying and milling plant was acquired at Kilkerrin, near Carna, and close to the largest ascophyllum belt in Europe.  An agreement was concluded between the Irish and English <Col N="1658" /> companies for the sale and purchase of seaweeds whether in their air-dried or milled states and provision was made for the supply of machinery and technical assistance by the English company.  The milling factory was completed in February, 1948.</P>
    <P>While the factory was in course of erection the position developed that certain chemicals required for the processing of ascophyllum weed were no longer available to the English company and that, therefore, milled ascophyllum weed would not be required for the time being.  The Irish company was, therefore, asked to substitute for the agreement to supply milled ascophyllum weed one for the supply of milled searods for the production of which the milling plant was also suitable.  At the same time, it was found that the capital of the Irish company was insufficient and would have to be increased to £10,000, in which increase it would be necessary that the Irish partners should participate so as to keep their share up to 51 per cent.  While these matters were awaiting settlement a change occurred in the ownership of the Irish interest, and in March, 1948, the Irish partners asked to be released from participation in the Irish company.</P>
    <P>My Department suggested to the English company that they might apply for a new manufacture licence under the Control of Manufactures Acts to enable them to get complete control of the Irish company subject to subscribing for the majority of the shares.  The English company, while being of opinion that such course might be feasible and to some extent advantageous in the case of the milling of the ascophyllum weed which is found in close proximity to the factory, could not agree that there would be any advantage in the case of the milling of searods.  Having regard to the cost of transpost of searods from far and near points of the coast to the factory such milling could, it asserts, be done as cheaply and more conveniently after direct transport to Scotland at its plant there.  It should be remembered that the milling of searods here had been proposed only to replace the milling of <Col N="1659" /> ascophyllum weed until its use could be resumed.</P>
    <P>We decided to take up the interests in this project and ask for 51 per cent. of the share capital by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The reasons for adopting this course may be summarised as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Unless it were adopted, it seemed certain that the rod-milling industry would be lost to the Gaeltacht.  Recent indications show that the ascophyllum scheme may be revived in two or three years' time.  Failing participation in the Irish company by the Department, the obvious and most economical course for the English company would be to close the Kilkerrin factory and revert to the direct shipment of searods to Scotland.  The factory could be reopened on the revival of the ascophyllum scheme.</P>
    <P>(b)  The searod industry is regarded as the one showing the best prospects of the marine products industries.  The uses to which the products of the searods are put are such that it appears that the demand for these will be lasting, will steadily increase and will be a valuable source of income to the men engaged in the industry on the western seaboard.  The collection of searods has been increased and approximately £12,000 has been paid to the gatherers for the past season's harvest.</P>
    <P>(c)  It is estimated that the working of the factory will mean the distribution of an additional £9,000 in respect of wages, turf and services rendered locally.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House accordingly proposes to authorise the expenditure of a sum not exceeding £5,100 in the acquisition of shares of £1 each in the Irish company.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of this Bill is self-explanatory. With regard to Section 2, the capital of the company, at present £6,000, is to be increased to £10,000 as already stated, and this section provides for the acquisition of 51 per cent. of the increased capital of £10,000, so <Col N="1660" /> that the majority holding will be in the name of the Minister for Lands. Section 3 deals with the powers of the Minister in respect of his shares.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 4, it will be necessary that the Minister should be represented on the board of the company, and this section accordingly provides for the nomination of nominees and their powers and functions. Section 5 is required because a Minister of State as a corporation sole is not a qualified person under the Control of Manufactures Act, 1934.</P>
    <P>Sections 6, 7 and 8 are self-explanatory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has explained, this Bill is designed to ensure that a particular industry in the Gaeltacht will continue.  I understand from the Minister's statement that the industry was first established in conformity with the Control of Manufactures Act and that 51 per cent. of the capital was held by Irish citizens.  As time went on and with the ups and downs of industry in general, it was found that the time had come when the company should be further developed. Do I understand that, in giving the Minister power to acquire some 5,000 shares at £1 each, the Gaeltacht Services Department are taking the industry over completely, or has the English firm still a controlling interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  That cannot be, according to law.  The Minister for Lands is taking over 51 per cent. of the shares and the English company will hold 49 per cent., which gives the Minister a controlling interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that really what the Minister is doing is taking over the shares formerly held by Irish citizens under the Control of Manufactures Act and that the industry will be continued on the same basis, except that the Minister will in future, as one of the largest shareholders, have the appointment of members of the board to control the industry.  We not merely will give every support we can to maintaining the industries which exist in the Gaeltacht but we hope and urge that, so far as possible, every step <Col N="1661" /> should be taken to develop, build up and expand as many industries as possible there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know any more than the Minister told us about Alginate Industries, Limited, but I know a certain amount about seaweeds and about this substance, alginic acid. There are certainly two or three things of interest with regard to this Bill which I think might profitably be considered by the Seanad.  One point is that, as some Senators may know, some years ago it was discovered that our common seaweeds had a most important chemical material, alginic acid, which could be made the basis of a whole series of adhesives and plastics and which is really one of the coming substances.  In one way I am very glad that there is a chance of the Minister getting his hand on this substance, because I think it is a substance we ought to exploit.  We are, as is generally realised, in near proximity to a very important ascophyllum belt which if properly harvested would give us a very large amount of this material. Following the remarks of the Minister, I understand that the foreign company took over the preparation of the alginates in 1936, the material being sent to Scotland for subsequent processing, but this is what I am a little puzzled about.  In 1948, if I heard the Minister correctly, the scheme was modified because certain chemicals needed for processing could not be obtained. That is something we ought to look into.  The extraction of alginate from seaweed is a very easy thing, and I wonder just what is behind the &ldquo;certain chemicals for processing which could not be obtained&rdquo;.  After all, the war is over.  I wonder why this foreign company suddenly decided to withdraw their interest in this particular source of the alginate, the ascophyllum.  I do not want to get too tied up in the botany of it&mdash;I can go into it on Committee&mdash;but this is a matter we might look into so as to be perfectly certain that we are not buying a pig in a poke or not buying a poke that has no pig in it.  Is there anything wrong with this material or what happened that the foreign company could not get the necessary reagents required for processing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1662" /> We then went on to the sea rods, to the laminaria and their milling, and in this respect there are one or two things we ought to consider also&mdash;the cost of maintenance of the milling plant and whether there is any danger of the foreign markets being closed.  If so, we should see that we are developing home markets for the conversion of the milled laminaria searod meal into the raw material from which the alginate is extracted.  Alginic acid is too important a substance to be let go by default.  There may be quite a good thing in this, but, on the other hand, there may be some hidden snag, and I am not certain whether the snag is in the seaweed, in the company or in the chemicals for processing.</P>
    <P>The last matter which might commend itself to our consideration is that we do not want one company to get a monopoly of the seaweed processing in this country.  We require a certain opening for private enterprise and I presume that Irish Alginates Limited will not eventually extend its activities so as to control all the weed harvested off the coast.  I almost feel that an investigation might be conducted a little more fully into the question of Irish harvested weeds, especially as, some years ago, we had the results of some very first-rate work done by Irish chemists in a southern university&mdash;Cork, to be precise&mdash;on the composition of these materials and the extracts from them.  I sincerely hope that their advice has been sought in considering this subject.  That is why I am particularly interested in one aspect of it&mdash; the type of stuff we are getting; why the foreign company suddenly withdrew; and how valid the claim is that certain chemicals are required?  Another thing which I should like to ask is the alginate content of our various marine algæ, the laminaria and ascophyllum. If we can get enough alginic acid out of it to make the process workable&mdash; that will be the first step.  The second step is home processing, and the third, a really developed market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBigger" hpid="Professor Bigger Professor Bigger">
      <NameTxt>Professor Bigger</NameTxt>
      <P>I am almost completely ignorant of a great many things and I should like enlightenment in regard to one of them.  I am almost <Col N="1663" /> completely ignorant about ascophyllum and searods, but I do not propose to ask the Minister to expound on these, but on the question of finance, about which I am almost equally ignorant. By Section 2 the Minister is authorised to expend a sum or sums not exceeding £5,100, which, for a country with the annual income we have, does not seem a very large sum.  The question on which I seek enlightenment is: why, in Section 7, sub-section (2), it is necessary for the Minister for Finance to be empowered &ldquo;to borrow from any person, any sum or sums and for the purpose of such borrowing to create and issue additional securities bearing interest&rdquo; and so on?  It seems an awfully large weapon to be used in respect of £5,100.  I am sure there is a perfectly good reason for it and I ask the question in honest ignorance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Captain Orpen Captain Orpen">
      <NameTxt>Captain Orpen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for Lands for a little further information about this alginate industry because, as Senator Fearon has said, alginic acid is an important material and one that seems to be about to have a valuable and important future.  I want to know from the Minister why, in addition to merely drying and milling laminaria, he could not do the extraction.  If, as has been stated, we are particularly favourably situated as regards the ascophyllum, why should we merely dry and pass the material through a hammer mill?  Why do we not do the extraction?  From the limited amount of information that is available to us it looks to me very much as if the people of the West of Ireland are being asked to do the laborious work while somebody else is pulling out the plums.  I should like to hear the Minister on that point.  I feel that, from what one hears vaguely in regard to these highly-flexible plastics that seem to be associated with alginic acid, we ought to get in and on this project and not allow it to be completely developed in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>To the average person, a great deal about this industry must be very vague as I must admit it was to me until some time ago.  The history <Col N="1664" /> of the industry can roughly be described as follows.  While it appears that alginic acid, which is a very useful substance in the manufacture of plastics and many other things, could always be produced on a small scale in the laboratory it was only quite recently that it was discovered how to produce it on a commercial scale.  That is, as Senator Orpen has just asked me now, a secret.  I think the secret of how to produce it on a commercial scale is confined at the present time to two people in the European theatre.  During the experimental stage they tried their hand on many raw materials and, while they tried on ascophyllum, they tried on each of the three common kinds of seaweed.  They discovered that searods was the most productive type&mdash;not alone did it produce the best quality but it was found to be the most productive source of raw material for the supply of alginic acid.  The searods grow in a depth of from about 15 to 25 or 28 feet of water.  Our west coast seems to be particularly favourable for the development of a large field in this respect because it slopes slowly to the Atlantic shelf.  A steep drop does not provide the necessary broad field for what we would regard as a liberal crop. Searods are thrown up by storms during the winter and it is during the winter that the gathering must be done.  At first there was no market, but then English Alginates discovered that it was a very fruitful source of alginic acid.  Gaeltacht Services stepped in and, besides inducing the fisher folk and the people along the coast to gather these rods which had been going to loss, they purchase the searods from them.  They pay the gatherers with money voted by the Dáil and that has appeared under a certain sub-head in the Book of Estimates for the last few years.  The searods are then sold to the company that was specially formed by a certain Irish interest, and English Alginates and that company was known as Irish Alginates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The searods are sent to a factory established for the purpose where they are dried.  It is a rather slow process so as not to destroy the quality of the searods.  They are then ground to a <Col N="1665" /> meal and shipped to a factory in England where the alginic acid is extracted. The Irish interest decided to withdraw from the company for reasons, I suppose, best known to themselves.  There was a danger of the industry perishing or going on the rocks.  This Bill is asking for the necessary authority to purchase the 5,100 shares held by the Irish interest up to this and to go into the industry ourselves.</P>
    <P>Senator Fearon asked why we do not go the whole road and extract the acid ourselves.  The answer is that we do not know how to do that.  Apparently it is a secret yet.  Mind you, experiments are being conducted.  Quite a lot of people have pricked up their ears, and while it is a secret at the moment it may not be a secret very much longer.  Quite a number of people are very much interested in it, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked about the two other common kinds of seaweed, rock weed and the other type which grows out to sea also.  Experiments are being conducted, particularly on the ascophyllum rock weed.  I hope they will come to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>Another question asked was why the English people could not supply certain chemicals for the extraction of alginic acid from ascophyllum.  The British Government refused to do so. They were prepared to supply them for its extraction from searods, but definitely they were not, during the war period when chemicals were scarce, prepared to supply them for ascophyllum. I suppose they had inside knowledge that ascophyllum was not as productive or as successful as searods, and we must bear in mind that chemicals were scarce then.  That is the only reason.  That situation has eased to a great extent.  The experiment on ascophyllum is going on apace and I hope it will prove successful. There is a vast field there in England for the extraction of alginic acid, but rock weed may from a very useful raw material for other industries apart from alginic acid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1666" /> Senator Bigger asked why sub-section 2 of Section 7 was in the Bill. That is in accordance with usual procedure. Any time any Minister has to go, in such a case as this, to the Minister for Finance for anything from 1/- to £1,000,000 that sub-section will always be in the Bill before both the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>
    <P>There is not really a whole lot to be said on this matter.  To put it in very simple language, we are taking over the Irish interest, the lapsing of which threatened the industry which had been established.  We have every reason to hope that there is a big future before it and not the sudden rise and fall kind of business that the seaweed industry suffered from in the past. The seaweed industry first came into prominence as a source of iodine.  Then, I think, Chilian nitrates was discovered to be a better source because a greater supply could be produced cheaper.  Consequently, after a sudden rise, the seaweed industry tumbled just as quickly.  Shortly afterwards, it was found that kelp was a source of potash, but now other sources of raw material have crashed that.  This time we hope that this industry will have no other competitor as a source of raw material in the production of alginic acid from seaweed.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House and I know that every Senator would be well pleased if it provides some extra income for the people along the coast.  They are not the wealthiest people, the quality of their land is bad and the weather seems to militate against them.  This side line will be a very useful one, as the price, which is about £4 a ton for searods, will form a welcome source of income.</P>
    <P>While the gathering of the crop has grown from about 41 tons per year to last year's 3,000 tons, even yet only about 25 per cent. of the total quantity of rods washed up is gathered.  We hope to expand this industry to the fullest.  In the immediate neighbourhood there are large quantities of turf and turf is the material used for drying. It takes one ton of turf per ton of searods dried.  That will provide employment for people who otherwise <Col N="1667" /> might not have the same opportunity of employment.  I believe that on this occasion we have hit on something which will not fall on evil days, as the seaweed industry fell in the past.</P>
