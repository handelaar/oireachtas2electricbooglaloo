      <P>It is proposed to take first No. 2 on the Order Paper&mdash;the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1948&mdash;and proceed then with the Finance Bill.  The House will sit tomorrow, if necessary, at 10.30 a.m. to complete these two items.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (8) to add at the end of the sub-section the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>and if a resolution is passed by either House within the next 21 days upon which that House has sat after the Order has been laid before it annulling the Order, the Order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section provides the board with power to make regulations for any purpose connected with the generation, transmission, distribution or use of electricity or for any purpose connected with the performance by the board of any of their powers, duties and functions. Where the board makes such <Col N="1194" /> regulations, they are to be presented to the Minister for confirmation and the Minister shall confirm the regulations, return the regulations to the board for the making of such amendments as he thinks proper or refuse to confirm the regulations.  The position therefore is that the board having made the regulations which they consider essential for the carrying out of the works, these regulations may be amended by the Minister, and in order to make known to the public what these regulations were and how they affected the public, the Dáil, by an amendment in sub-section (8), provided that all orders made under the section should be laid on the Table of each House as soon as may be after they are made. The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that not alone will the regulations be placed on the Table of each House but that this or the other House will have an opportunity of considering and discussing them, and, if they think that the regulations&mdash;either those originally proposed by the board or as amended by the Minister&mdash;should be annulled, of annulling them.</P>

      <P>I intended to ask what provision is made for scrutinising these orders.  I take it that these orders are made by the Electricity Supply Board and that, unless the Minister makes an objection to them, they stand, and I was anxious to know what mechanism exists for scrutinising these orders from a point of view other than that of the Electricity Supply Board.  That did not seem to be clear, but the amendment now accepted by the Parliamentary Secretary seems to me to provide the necessary machinery and it is, therefore, unnecessary for me to go into any further detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This section appears rather strange to a person who does not know what is behind it.  It provides that certain employees may inquire from the board whether it is the board's intention to pay certain supplementary allowances under Sections 14 and 15 of the Superannuation Act of 1942 and the board may say whether or not it proposes to pay such allowances, but there is nothing in the section which would seem to require the board to pay any such allowances.</P>
      <P>One wonders what is the point in granting a legislative right to an employee to ask a question as to what the board proposes to do.  Surely the man has a constitutional right to ask that question in any event?  Why should it be necessary, if there is no compulsion on the board to grant any such allowance, to insert a special section in the Bill giving him the right to ask the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, under the sections of the 1942 Act, if an employee asks the board whether or not he is to get a supplementary pension on retirement, they cannot inform him in advance of retirement.  He can ask the question, but they need not answer it. Under this, they can inform him in advance of retirement of what his pension will be and what the supplementary allowance will be.</P>

      <P>While many of the workers who were originally employed by the Dublin Corporation at the Pigeon House appreciate this section very much, I understand that there is some difficulty in regard to a small number of people.  I have particulars of one person who, although conforming as closely as possible to the conditions laid down, does not come under the terms of this section as it stands at present.  He was employed by the board.  He started work in the Pigeon <Col N="1196" /> House in April, 1941.  The Pigeon House was closed down, I understand, in 1930.  That man had been employed at various other times&mdash;1921, 1922, 1923. He was employed, too, in Ardnacrusha and subsequently again in the Electricity Supply Board.  Regardless of the provision made here and of the fact that he was an employee of the board, he has now been informed that he does not come under this superannuation scheme.  I should be very grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary would look into the matter.  It would be very unsatisfactory if even one person, who conformed with the conditions, was omitted from receiving the same benefits as his fellow-workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have the case to which the Senator has referred examined.  I think I should say on this section at this stage that I undertook in the Dáil to introduce an amendment in the Seanad if the persons concerned were prepared to opt whether they would take the existing pension or whether they would allow their gratuity, when it will be payable on retirement, to be abated to the extent of the gratuity which was paid to them for the short period during which the Pigeon House was closed.  Since the matter was discussed here the persons concerned have been interviewed by representatives of the Electricity Supply Board and representatives of the Department of Industry and Commerce. They are all prepared to retain their present position.  In other words, they are satisfied with the <i>status quo.</i>  Therefore, the offer which was made to them has not been accepted by them and consequently the service, which it was urged during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil should be regarded for pensionable purposes&mdash;that is, the service which they had for two years when the Pigeon House was closed&mdash;will not count.  As I say, I undertook to bring in an amendment at this stage.  No amendment has been brought in as a result of the situation which developed by reason of these people not wishing to have the gratuity abated.</P>

      <P>I should like to repeat much of what I said on the Second Reading of this Bill and the reasons which prompted me to put down the amendment.  If we are going to maintain democratic institutions in this country, it is essential that we should make every possible opportunity available to people to take part in democratic political organisations.  While it may be reasonable to debar persons who hold membership of a board or of a semi-State board from being members of this House or of the other House, it is certainly not in the interests of democracy that we should put obstacles in the way of such a large number of people as are employed by the Electricity Supply Board or any such semi-State organisation.  We know that in the future, regardless of what we may have said in the past about semi-State organisations, we are going to have more of them.</P>

      <P>I am not making a point of order.  The matter is one of importance.  I think Senator Hawkins could have the subject discussed by putting down a motion.  A general principle is involved and the matter is one of great interest.  As he says, we are developing more and more State <Col N="1198" /> concerns.  Therefore, this matter arises, though not so much on this Bill, and it could form the subject of a very interesting and non-Party discussion.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for the very capable manner in which he has presented the Bill to the House and for being reasonable in accepting one of the amendments submitted.  I think, however, that it would not be in the public interest if I were not allowed to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to those people for whom this Bill proposes to make provision.  While Section 3 of the 1927 Act specifies to a certain extent and prevents members of the board, employees or servants, from being members of this House, it has been read into by those people in charge of the Electricity Supply Board that none of their employees are to take part in any political activities of this country or be members of any political organisation. I know that that was probably not the intention of those who put the amendment into the Bill.  Some time ago a circular was issued to each employee saying, on the basis of this sub-section, that he or she was not under any circumstances to be a member of any political organisation in this State. That circular was later withdrawn to an extent, I believe.  It is because of that position and seeing that the Bill is being returned to the Dáil that I would again request the Parliamentary Secretary to have the matter examined in so far as it relates to this board and <Col N="1199" /> have the broader issue discussed later, as Senator Hayes suggested, on a motion.</P>

Living as I do in the centre of Dublin in a part which is considered still to be habitable and by some to be beautiful, and which has been gradually encroached upon by Government and semi-Government boards, the chief offender being the board under discussion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It seems to me that under Article 16 of the Constitution anybody, unless debarred by particular laws or regulations, is eligible for membership of the Oireachtas. Therefore, if the Bill before the House prevents somebody from standing for the Oireachtas, I am merely wondering how it can be out of order to consider an amendment restoring to him his rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Orpen</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Parliamentary Secretary replies might I ask <Col N="1200" /> what machinery is available to the ordinary man in the street to ascertain what the Electricity Supply Board proposes to do in future under Section 16? We find from past experience that the first the public hears of what they are going to do is that they have done a considerable amount of preliminary work and then, of course, one feels that it is wrong to make a protest because a protest is too late.  On the Second Stage of the Bill I put in a plea that for the sake of our grandchildren and their children we should preserve one waterfall in the country and I suggested that that waterfall should be Torc.  I understand from a White Paper issued a long time ago that Tore waterfall was one of those to be used for electrical generation.  If it has only gone as far as a preliminary survey one can get up and make a protest, but what I feel is that the public is entitled to get fair warning before some major operation such as the damming up of the Boyne, the Lee or some other large river or the example which I gave of eliminating for all time the last large waterfall is embarked upon.  It seems a weakness in our system that a semi-autonomous body can go ahead quite far with its plans and preparations before the public has any knowledge that something is happening. I would welcome the Parliamentary Secretary suggesting what steps might be taken to overcome this difficulty so that when the Electricity Supply Board engineers have decided to eliminate something the public want the public can decide whether they prefer Tore waterfall or more watts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Orpen from another angle altogether.  I am not interested in Torc waterfall, but I am interested in the cemetery at Camden Row in Dublin which is one of the most ancient cemeteries in Dublin.  Many famous men are buried there, notably Archbishop Hurley, who was martyred in Stephen's Green, and Father Austin, the noted Jesuit.  I heard some talk about a power station being erected there and also that a certain objection had been made, but when I went there I discovered, to my amazement, that the power station was almost complete. <Col N="1201" /> We do not think much of the living sometimes as the same argument can be made of the dead.  We have seen many cemeteries covered over for playgrounds. I suppose you cannot keep cemeteries in existence in the centre of the city, but this was a particular cemetery.  An objection was made to this power station, and it is almost completed.  The grave of Dermot O'Hurley was a place of pilgrimage for many years, until the penal times became severe and the pilgrims had to stop.  We have reached the enlightened age of 1949 when we have concerns like the Electricity Supply Board, which is only concerned with its own needs and the erection of a power station on such an ancient cemetery, and I want to protest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The point which Senator Hawkins raised and which was also mentioned on the Second Stage is a matter which will have to get consideration. The fact that this prohibition was put in the 1927 Act is undoubtedly due to the fact that the number of State companies was very small, probably only one or two, whereas it has grown since.  I think that this is a question that must be considered and it is a question that should be considered in a detached manner and fully, because there are possible results from employees of State companies being members of the Dáil or Seanad that might react unfavourably on these companies.  On the other hand, with the increase in the number of such companies there is an ever-widening sphere in which people by reason of their employment in these companies are deprived from membership of either the Dáil or Seanad.  I think this is the only Act that has this very stringent prohibition, but in practice, I understand, employees of State companies do not continue in their employment when they are elected to the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question raised by Senator Orpen and by Senator Colgan in a different way is provided for under the Act.  Notice must be given to any person whose property is to be entered upon; and not only is notice given, but there is a provision in the Act that full particulars, if that person <Col N="1202" /> so requires, must be given of the layout of poles or other machinery or any interference that may be considered.</P>
    <P>The point which Senator Colgan made is the same as was raised on the Committee Stage by Senator Mrs. Concannon. I understand from the Electricity Supply Board that it was necessary to erect a transformer in that part of the city, and having surveyed all possible sites they found that the only available one which was suitable was this graveyard.  It is unfortunate that that should be so, but the position being explained to the Representative Church Body and to the corporation, the approval of the Church Body was granted for the work concerned.  The remains of certain people buried there had to be disinterred and reinterred, all of which took place in the presence of the incumbent.  At the same time, the headstones or plaques on the graves concerned have been placed along the wall, so that, in so far as it is possible to retain the character of the graveyard, it has been retained.  It was only in the peculiar circumstances which required that a transformer be erected there that it was necessary to enter and put the transformer in the graveyard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary object of this Bill is to give effect to the Financial Resolutions passed by Dáil Eireann subsequent to the Budget.  Advantage is taken, as is the habit on the Finance Bill, to introduce a few miscellaneous financial matters which require legislative sanction.  Section 18, for instance, is to remedy the situation resulting from a provision made in 1924 with <Col N="1203" /> regard to gifts <i>inter vivos</i> of foreign property, made for public or charitable purposes.  There is also Section 21, which refers to an agreement, which is scheduled, as one secured with the British Government for the avoidance of double taxation in respect of corporation profits tax and British profits tax.</P>
      <P>By Section 29 I am carrying forward the Transition Development Fund.  Last year I announced that it was to be wound up on a particular date, but as there is still in the fund a certain amount of money and there is a certain commitment against it, I am postponing the winding up of the fund for a further year; and legislative sanction is sought for that.</P>
      <P>In the main, the Finance Bill gives effect to the various remissions that I announced in the Budget this year when speaking in the Dáil on the 4th May, 1949.  This year, the remissions of taxation that have been made and certain advantages that have been given are mainly to be found in the field of income-tax.  There is a reduction of the standard rate, which costs £1,000,000 in a full year and which will cost over £700,000 in this particular financial year.  There are certain other aids to particular classes of income-tax payers, which would cost about £250,000 in a full year.  Arising out of the Budget this year, between remissions and other aids to taxpayers, there is a forfeiture, as far as the revenue is concerned, of a sum of about £1,250,000 in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, as Senators will be aware from the Budget speech, it was decided to proceed further along the line of making some provision for people whose situation in life had been affected by the decreased purchasing power of money or by the increased cost of living.  These are mainly with regard to pensioners this year, but in addition to that I am making provisions for certain increases in pay for civil servants and the Garda and, later on in the year, in respect of the Army.  This is costing about £750,000 in this year. Between the aids that are given in pensions and increased pay, and the remissions of taxation in the Budget, there is <Col N="1204" /> reflected an improvement in conditions, costing the Exchequer about £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>That is not, of course, as much as last year, when taxation to the extent of £6,000,000 was remitted, mainly through the repeal of the duties on tobacco and beer.  It shows, in any event, that we are advancing along the same path as was traced out last year&mdash;remissions of taxation where those are possible and aids to the people who, in our mind, have priority in respect of those aids.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been very brief in the introduction of this Finance Bill, which makes a demand on the people for a larger sum than was ever demanded in taxation here, a sum of over £72,000,000.  It might be a coincidence that, while we are here discussing to-day the measures necessary to enable the Minister to gather from our people this huge sum, there are other Finance Ministers engaged elsewhere in discussing something that might even more affect our people than what we are discussing here to-day.  I consider that this opportunity should be availed of by the Minister to tell this House and to tell the country what proposals, what steps or what policy the Minister has to meet the position which the Ministers in other countries are prepared to take measures to counteract, if certain suggestions should be forced upon them.  We have at the present moment a very clouded financial position&mdash;suggestions, rumours and counter-rumours are going around and our people, naturally, are very interested, as not alone those who have investments abroad, but everyone else, will be affected as much as the countries who are engaged in these discussions at the present time.  Therefore, I think the Minister should avail of the opportunity presented to him, in bringing this Bill before the House to-day, to tell us what the policy of the Government is in the event of the devaluation of the £ being forced, or in the event of such steps being forced on those in this State or in any other State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to examine the Bill before us we must, if we are to give a fair judgment, ask ourselves some few <Col N="1205" /> questions.  First of all, as a result of the war certain steps had to be taken. When the war was over we found that this nation was in a creditworthy state. The Minister, in making his appeal to subscribers to the two loans, made it quite definite that we were one of the very few creditworthy States in Europe.  It is true that during the emergency we had to budget for huge sums.  We had to maintain an army to defend the freedom we had; we had to set up emergency services; we had to give increased prices to our farmers to produce the food to feed the people; and we had to give subsidies in order to ensure that the essential commodities would be kept within the reach of our people.  The war has passed and with it the need for the maintenance of the Army.  The maintenance of many of the subsidies, whether they were needed or not, has stopped, or they have been reduced.  Therefore, we have a position in which considerable savings should be brought about. Despite the savings in the Army and under other heads we have presented to us the largest sum ever to be extracted from our people by any Minister for Finance.  I would not be too worried about the size of the demand if, side by side with that, I could see that there was a reasonable effort being made to cope with the money problem that faces us.</P>
    <P>We have the great problem of unemployment with from 61,000 to 62,000 people drawing unemployment assistance at our local labour exchanges.  It has been said, by some people in authority, that many of them are workshy and that they could get work in many parts of the country if they were prepared to go there.  I do not subscribe to any such theory for I believe that the majority of the Irish people are prepared to earn an honest day's pay and to give in return an honest day's work.  Before making statements of that kind we should carefully examine each case on its merits. If people in Dublin, Cork or Galway, who are requested to report for work on the Erne or any other scheme, do not do so you will find that there is some good reason for it if all the facts are examined.  It is probably because the person is not in a position to go <Col N="1206" /> even though he is unemployed at home.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in this Bill to meet, in some way, this problem or to try and seek a solution by getting work for our people.  The Minister, when he took over office, set out, as it were, to reduce the cost of living and the only effective steps which he took &mdash;and they were ineffective, as a matter of fact&mdash;was to advise the people not to spend, and he being a responsible Minister of the Government, the people took his advice to a great extent. Consequently, we have found in the last 12 months&mdash;and the Minister for Industry and Commerce must be particularly aware of this situation&mdash; that as a result of that advice we have shopkeepers reducing staffs and manufacturers employing less and producing less and factories going on half time while others have closed down. Still the cost of the articles to the consumer has not been reduced and it cannot be reduced because the overheads of the manufacturers are still as great even though they are producing less.</P>
    <P>The question of unemployment is more pronounced in the Gaeltacht areas of Galway, Connemara and Donegal.  There we find the hand-won turf scheme and the hand-woven tweed industry dwindling and that coupled with the withdrawal of the road grants and the refusal to give grants for major and minor road schemes has contributed to a vast emigration which never before in the history of this State has been as great as it is to-day.  We find in these areas that not only the young people but whole families are leaving the country.  If something is not done immediately to stem this tide of emigration then there will be nothing left in the Gaeltacht but the old and the infirm who will be a burden on the State for a short time and when they go this problem will have been solved in one way and there will be nothing left but to deal with what is left of the Gaeltacht under the great afforestation scheme.</P>
    <P>We had expected in the last 12 months that something would have been done to stem this tide of emigration but we find that, despite the promises made, 40,000 of our best young people have gone from the country. <Col N="1207" /> That means 40,000 less pairs of boots to be manufactured, less clothing and the loss of people who should be engaged in building up this new State but are now going to build up other places.  There is no provision made in this huge sum to try and find some little remedy for this position.</P>
    <P>We have heard much about asking the farmers and industrialists to increase production.  In the past few months farmers who were asked to increase production did so but they found that despite the promises of increased prices in return they were worse off than ever.  They increased egg, poultry and butter production only to find that the prices for these commodities were reduced.  If you are going to appeal to the people to increase production you must at least ensure that that increased production is not going to leave them worse off than they were before.  Side by side with that reduction in reward they have had to face increased cost for maize and increased farm wages.  The Minister will, I am sure, remind me of schemes about to be introduced but we are not playing fair with those people who played a great part during the emergency.</P>
    <P>During the emergency farmers responded to the appeal to grow wheat. Many people held that the growing of that wheat reduced the fertility of the land; and in order to meet that the Government of the day introduced a fertiliser voucher scheme.  It is an extraordinary thing that while we seem to be prepared to spend £40,000,000 on land reclamation we are not prepared to give these farmers with whom we had entered into contracts what is in justice theirs.  We had, in reply to a question in the Dáil recently, the Minister making a statement that credit would be given for the 1945 vouchers some time at the end of July.  That means that the farmers who were issued with vouchers for 1945 will not be able to get certain fertiliser credit until the end of July.  More extraordinary still, those to whom dockets were issued in 1946 and 1947 may have to wait for two or three years.  If we are serious about encouraging our farmers to produce and if we are <Col N="1208" /> serious about spending this sum of £40,000,000 on the reclamation of bog land, on improving land which requires draining, and so on, surely we ought to start by trying to put the good land back into the condition in which it was before and so get a better return from it, and at least to honour our bond with the farmers by making immediately available to them the fertilisers on foot of the contract entered into.</P>
    <P>We have another problem, housing. Some efforts have been made in this matter and everybody seems to be sympathetic, but neither the Minister nor any member of this or the other House can be satisfied with the progress we are making.  We have, as I often reminded the House before, the extraordinary state of affairs that there are three or four Departments dealing with housing&mdash;Local Government, dealing with the housing of working class people in the cities and towns, and in the rural areas so far as labourers' cottages are concerned, and the Land Commission and the Gaeltacht Housing Branch.  There are many schemes on which all of these work.  We are informed now that the only thing holding up progress&mdash;the money and materials are available&mdash;is the fact that skilled workers are not available. When one is informed by those in authority in trade union organisations that there are more carpenters, plasterers and craftsmen of every kind on the books of these trade union organisations in this city than there were in 1929 or 1937, one cannot but feel that there is something seriously wrong.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been offered with regard to the provision made for houses for people other than those removed from slum areas.  I do not propose to offer any such criticism.  My complaint is that there is not sufficient provision for people other than those who are in the unfortunate position of having to reside in slum areas.  There is a section of people who seem to be nobody's baby and who, without heavy liability, cannot get a house at all.  These are the salaried people, the people who are sometimes referred to as the white-collar workers.  It is sometimes said that trade unionism is not playing its part&mdash;that the conditions regarding <Col N="1209" /> apprenticeship are too severe and that trades should be open to more young people with a liking for particular trades and particularly those who have already received vocational or technical training &mdash; but while that may contribute in some small way to the problem, I feel that our whole approach to the problem is wrong.  I feel what we want is a national housing board, with powers to employ people, to direct labour and to ensure to tradesmen that, when a scheme of houses on which they have been working is completed, they will not have to face three, six or eight months of idleness until the contractor gets another contract.</P>
    <P>In many areas that I know, there is a slowness in this matter, so far as local authorities are concerned.  Many of them are pulling their weight, but very little encouragement is given to them to proceed with the necessary work of housing and sewerage schemes when they are in the position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>This House is asked to pass a Bill enabling the Minister for Finance to extract from the people a sum of over £72,000,000, which money is to be expended, amongst other purposes, for the purpose of the erection of houses.  In fact, there is a particular provision in the Bill dealing with housing, and I now propose to direct my remarks to that section which relates to the Transition Fund.  I was suggesting that, to solve the problem, it is essential that a housing board be set up.  I have always thought there is something amiss in a position in which the Department of Local Government make available more than half of the amount required for housing to a local authority and in which the local authority has to borrow the remainder, the occupant of the house paying a very small proportion of the total cost <Col N="1210" /> in rent.  The value of such a board would not be so much in distributing the fund as in guaranteeing to the workers continued employment over a period of years.  We have complaints made that contractors working for the Dublin Corporation or for other local authorities cannot get tradesmen, whereas contractors working for private profit can secure these tradesmen, because they are able to pay them something above the ordinary rate and are able to give concessions in the way of overtime and so on.  I hope that when the Appropriation Bill comes along we will be able to consider that matter, although I do not agree that we will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will remember that we had some small discussion last year on the Transition Fund, which at that time was to expire on the 31st December, which date was later extended to 31st March.  The reason given by the Minister for that extension was that the fund was already practically allocated. I want to bring the Minister back now to a hardy annual of the past few years &mdash;the increase in rates of interest to local authorities.  The Minister made the very definite statement that provision would be made to compensate the local authorities in connection with housing work, as apart from other work carried out by them.  In other words, so far as housing was concerned, the rate of interest would be 2½ per cent., and, for other work, sewerage and water supplies, 2¾ per cent.  What do we find?  There has been a manipulation of figures.  The Transition Fund and the customary grant by Local Government to the local authorities has been consolidated, but the local authority is not getting any increase. The Transition Fund was first brought in for the purpose of encouraging local authorities to proceed with essential works, particularly housing, and to recoup to them&mdash;so that they might be in a position to let those houses at a reasonable rent&mdash;an additional grant over and above what was made available in respect of the two-thirds total cost of the house previously.  That has not been done.  I should also like to recommend to the Minister&mdash;because, after all, whether it is a matter for the <Col N="1211" /> Minister for Local Government or for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the man who holds the purse strings is the man who can direct the policy&mdash;that the various semi-Government organisations and Government employees follow the example of the Mallow sugar factory which is undertaking the erection of houses for its workers.  Throughout the country there are Gardaí, teachers and a number of other professional people&mdash;employees of the central authority, if you wish&mdash;and, in place of expecting the local authorities to provide housing for such people, as is the case, they should be provided through an organisation such as that which the Mallow sugar factory proposes to operate in connection with their workers.</P>
    <P>A sum of practically £73,000,000 is not the only demand which is being made this year on our people.  That sum is an increase of £8,000,000 over the Fianna Fáil demand.  It is an increase of over £8,000,000 at a time when we have not to make provision for the maintenance of a large Army; when, we are told, we have already saved £3,000,000 in with held subsidies and when, as I have said, no provision is made, by creating public works, to solve the problem of unemployment. Side by side with this huge demand on our people, there is the still greater burden of increased rates.  Every county and every ratepayer throughout the length and breadth of this State is called upon to pay increased rates this year.  In many cases there is a double surprise a waiting him, that is, that his valuation has been increased.  Not alone have his rates been increased but his valuation has been increased&mdash; thereby increasing his expenditure in more than one way.  It means that his Electricity Supply Board charges are increased.  If his house is a public-house it means that his licence fee is increased or, if he is a licence holder of any kind, his licence fee is increased. While there may be a justification for a revaluation, certainly there is no justification for a revaluation to be carried out and an increase in valuation brought about without even having the common courtesy of informing the <Col N="1212" /> occupant that such has been done.  He should be informed that his valuation has been increased so as to prepare him for the shock he will receive when he gets his new demand note, if he has not already got it.  I think that a condition of revaluation should be that the owner should be informed that it is decided that his valuation has been increased.</P>
    <P>I started off by requesting the Minister to give this House and the country some information in regard to the present financial position and in regard to what it may be in the very near future if certain events take place. There are, however, one or two other queries which I should like to have answered.  Prior to the introduction of Marshall Aid there was made available out of the British pool a certain amount of dollars for the use of this State. That was generous, if you like, but I should like to know if any allowance is being made now.  Are our total imports from America being purchased out of dollar aid or is portion of them purchased, as they were prior to the introduction of Marshall Aid, by an amount made available out of the British pool?  It would be reasonable to ask that that amount, if any amount is made available, should be increased. The position now is that we are purchasing foodstuffs and paying for them out of money borrowed under Marshall Aid.  We are exporting those foodstuffs to another nation from which we are receiving nothing except what the Minister often termed before &ldquo;just paper money&rdquo; A condition of Marshall Aid is that farm implements and foodstuffs be made available.  I wonder if, as a result of that condition, we are being placed in the position of having our credits accumulating in one country as a result of our exports to that country and that at the same time we are being compelled to import from a country from which we have to borrow the money to pay for the imports.  We all understand and hope that this nation will honour its bond and pay back every penny of Marshall Aid.  If we are serious about doing that it might be pertinent to ask now what steps we are taking towards accumulating the dollars for that purpose. <Col N="1213" /> We have been told by those in charge that one of the best and most effective means we have of earning dollars is to develop our tourist industry because we cannot ever hope or expect to export to America unless they are prepared to remove many of the embargoes they have on imports.  What is being done towards developing our tourist industry? What steps are being taken by the Government since it took office, or the Tourist Board, to encourage American tourists?  When last I spoke on this subject I read a statement in which it was pointed out that it was essential to modernise our hotels to cater for American visitors.  The only steps I see being taken in that direction are steps to sell out those places which we could have as models for other hotels to imitate.  I have not seen any great activity by the Tourist Board in the direction of encouraging tourists from either England or America to come to this country.  We have this huge sum before us, but, indeed, it is not the whole bill.  The Minister, in his very short opening statement, has already informed us that he proposes to make provision for increases to certain State servants.  There are many other matters for which provision must be made unless we are going to do out of borrowed money the important schemes at present before the Dáil for land reclamation and rehabilitation.  Provision must be made&mdash;it is a small amount&mdash; for Gaeltacht housing plans, as no provision has been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Although this is a huge sum we are glad at least that it is the last word.  I have pointed out that it is a huge sum, £8,000,000 more than was asked for by the previous Government. But we still have 61,000 unemployed, under-production in agriculture and industry and our Gaeltacht problems with no prospect of their being solved.  We have an Emigration Commission, but no report, and what they have to sit about or report upon neither I nor any other member of this House knows, as we all know the causes for emigration without a commission. There is no hope held out to the people, except that they have to pay a greater sum for less services than were provided previously.  Side by side with that we are in the position of being the only country in Europe where rationing of bread, butter and other commodities is maintained, not because of a shortage of supply, not because we want to share our supplies with other countries, but simply because we are not prepared to do either one of two things.  One would <Col N="1215" /> be to withdraw the subsidy on those commodities, have them sold and let the people have the amount they require because the Minister is not prepared to make available the money essential to give them their requirements. On the other hand, he could take his courage in his hands and say I am not prepared to give a subsidy for such commodities, but I am prepared to let every person have what is in the country in equal share, provided he is able to pay the price.</P>
      <P>We have tea at 5/- a lb. for a certain section of the community, butter at 3/6 a lb. for the same section, sugar at 7½d. a lb. and white flour at 7/- a st.  If we have supplies of those commodities, surely the thing to do in the national interest is to have equal distribution? We have now proceeded to tighten up on this arrangement and instructresses in vocational schools throughout the country have received instructions that they are to bake in their classes with white flour in future. They are not now permitted to use the brown flour although the Minister and the medical profession might tell us that it is a more healthy commodity than the white flour.  Instruction has been sent out to domestic economy in-structresses, whether they are in the heart of Connemara, Donegal or Kerry, that they are to use white flour and not the healthy brown flour in their courses for the people at large.</P>
      <P>No wonder the Minister was very brief in his introduction.  He said that he proposed to make provision for certain increases.  He mentioned the Garda force, I think, and it just struck me as he mentioned it that I might avail of the opportunity to make one recommendation.  During past weeks we have enjoyed very fine weather and I think it is about time that somebody made a recommendation to the authorities that the uniforms of these people should be changed to something more in keeping with weather like this, and the same recommendation would go for the officials of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. J.T. O'Farrell Mr. J.T. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>One notices that those who criticise the amount of the Budget, having done so, proceed immediately <Col N="1216" /> afterwards to give a whole list of subjects on which several additional millions of money could be spent. Senator Hawkins has not indicated as far as I know any way in which a saving could be effected, but he certainly has indicated ways and means by which many millions of additional money could be spent in what seems to him to be a very useful manner.  There is one fact which this Bill and its predecessors bring home very forcibly and that is that we have now reached the saturation point in taxation.  If we add the local to the national taxation we find that we are taking in or about 25 per cent. of the estimated national income or about £27 per head of the population. The eminent economist, Mr. Colin Clark, estimated that in normal times it was unsafe to exceed 25 per cent. of the national income in taxation. It is true that in Britain taxation amounts to about 41 per cent. of the national income, but there the national income per head of the population is about twice ours, which is only in the region of £100 per head per annum.  If you take 25 per cent. off £100 you leave £75 per head.  If you take 41 per cent. off £200 you leave £118 per head.  That leaves us very much poorer per head than Britain with its very high taxation, relatively. In the United States the national and local taxation amounts to 24.6 of the national wealth which, of course, on an average is altogether out of any comparison with ours, being more than several times greater.  In Sweden it amounts only to 18.9 per cent. of the national income which, I think, is very much larger than our average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coincident with this big increase in taxation here there has been a fall in production.  I think in 1948 our exports were still 27 per cent. in volume below those of 1938.  The principal reductions were of course in agricultural output. Our output in cattle was 22 per cent. less than in 1938-39; in sheep and lambs our output was 40 per cent. less and in pigs nearly 58 per cent., and all that, despite the fact that last year was decidedly better than 1947.  In those circumstances it is obvious that the only hope for the nation in view of the growing demands for still more <Col N="1217" /> taxation is an increase in production. Having regard to the alarming amount of the adverse balance it is obvious that in order to reduce that balance by buying less from foreign countries and being able to export more to them we shall have to increase our production not only in agricultural output but in our secondary industries also.  There is very little real incentive for manufacturers here to increase their output by the adoption of more efficient methods and the installation of modern equipment.  Immediately prices tend to fall or there is anything in the nature of effective competition from outside, they rush to the Minister for Industry and Commerce with a demand for an increase in the tariff.  Every form of competition is termed &ldquo;dumping&rdquo;, workers are blackmailed in being told that their jobs are at stake and they are asked to go to their trade unions to bring influence to bear on the Minister to substitute tariffs for efficient and better equipment.</P>
    <P>All of us are familiar with the type of blackmail that was employed on the present Government immediately it came into power by a firm which, as soon as it got its tariff, proceeded to raise its dividends very considerably by the time-honoured method of distributing what are known as bonus shares.  Nobody objects to giving the Irish market to the Irish manufacturer, provided he can produce goods which the Irish people can afford to buy; but everybody must object to a form of procedure which is the equivalent of industrial blackmail.  Personally, I would not mind how high the profits of a manufacturer or how high the rates of wages provided he is able to give us goods that will bear comparison with similar goods produced in other countries where wages are high and profits are high also.</P>
    <P>We all know the way in which, for some years, nobody but a very wealthy person here could possibly purchase a tomato during several months of the year&mdash;all in the interest of a small section of people who are not prepared to accept the same profits or the same prices as Dutch farmers were prepared to accept after having paid the freight charges all the way from Holland.  In <Col N="1218" /> fact, the prices were at least three or four times what the Dutch tomato was costing, and Irish citizens were deprived of the use of tomatoes in the interests of this small section of people.  Whilst this practice of putting on an increase in the tariff the moment there is anything in the nature of a fall in prices goes on, we cannot possibly hope for a reduction in the cost of living or an improvement in the general standard of life of the great majority of the people.</P>
    <P>There is one section of people referred to by Senator Hawkins who are deplorably badly hit in this connection &mdash;they are what one might call the lower middle class or clerical and salaried grades.  They subscribe a surprisingly large amount of income-tax or national taxation and they get no free social services of any kind.  It is utterly impossible for them to get a State-subsidised house built by a public authority.  They have to purchase their houses on the instalment system.  Every young couple starting life have a millstone round their necks by this huge debt, yet they are expected to keep up appearances and maintain their social position, which some other sections are not required to do.  The present high cost of commodities to these people imposes an intolerable burden, as their salaries have not been increased by anything like the amount of the increase in the cost of living.  It is to them a matter of supreme importance that the prices of everyday commodities should be brought within their financial possibilities.  Those of them who are married, in many cases have not been able to replenish their household effects for many years and now, when they proceed to do so, they find it absolutely impossible to purchase at present-day prices.  If our manufacturers are not prepared to try, by efficient and better equipment, to turn out goods at a lower price, all that can happen is that these people will not be able to buy and will have to do without them.</P>
    <P>In this connection, there are some workers&mdash;I believe they are a small percentage of the total&mdash;who think it is a very fine form of trade unionism to turn out as little work, as little output, <Col N="1219" /> as you possibly can for the largest amount of wages you can possibly extract&mdash;in other words, reduce the national pool and there will be more to go round for everybody.  That is a very pernicious policy of absolute nonsense and one which no responsible trade union should countenance for a moment.  We have the same policy in other countries, the policy of &ldquo;go slow&rdquo;, generally trying to restrict output in a world of shortages.  We are going to make and are making here very considerable demands in respect of improved social services, and with that policy the overwhelming majority of the people will agree, but we cannot get the wherewithal to supply these demands unless we proceed to increase the national wealth.</P>
    <P>The national wealth can only be increased as a result of an increase in production and in agricultural output lies our greatest hope.  For one thing, agriculturists need not fear that they will not have a market, a limitless market, for their output for as long as one can possibly see.  In a recent statement, Lord Boyd Orr, the Director-General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Even if the world population were static, the nations would be hard put to it to save the soil and grow enough food.  How much more formidable is the problem when man is increasing by 20,000,000 a year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For various reasons, the world food supply is 13 per cent. below pre-war level, whilst the population of the world has increased in that time by 200,000,000 people.  In this connection again, Lord Boyd Orr says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The total output of food by 1950-51, assuming that we have no catastrophe, may not exceed the pre-war average&mdash;and that was not enough for the smaller pre-war population.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is true that, in pre-war days, millions went hungry while food was destroyed, but the position is different to-day as millions of people who could and would buy additional food are not getting <Col N="1220" /> sufficient, since they cannot find a supply.  There would be a limitless market for many years to come for all the increased foodstuffs that we could produce.</P>
    <P>There is another factor of great importance, that is, the extent to which the arable soil of the world is reducing through erosion, mainly arising from bad husbandry, from bad farming methods.  In the United States, Dr. Bennet, giving evidence before a Congressional Committee, estimated that the equivalent of 200 40-acre farms is lost every day in the United States through soil erosion.  General Smuts has said that soil erosion is South Africa's greatest problem.  The same story comes from Mexico and other food-producting countries.  Mankind lives on nine inches of the upper layer of soil and if that is blown away, as has happened in other countries, it will take many generations before it can be restored.  It is estimated that it takes 1,000 years for nature to produce one inch of upper soil.  In this connection I think the Government is pursuing the right line and a far-sighted policy in seeking to make more land available for food production in one form or another, as well as making more fertile the land that is already being used for that purpose.  I think that is about the best way we could possibly spend money and particularly the moneys received in Marshall Aid.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins has referred to the matter of making more provision for the unemployed and stated that there are about 61,000 persons unemployed. It is surprising how people will debate or exploit this question of the unemployed regardless of the history of the past.  In the three years prior to the outbreak of the last war the world was beginning to recover, and had actually recovered, from the depression of the early 'thirties, and it was in many respects one of the most prosperous periods that this country had for some 30 years.  In 1931 we had 81,100 unemployed, and the figure rose to 88,770 in 1938, and it was 93,100 in 1939.  Last year the average was 61,900, or only two-thirds of that of the last year prior to the war.  Taking it on another basis, in 1939 15.6 of the <Col N="1221" /> total insurable population was unemployed, while in 1948 the figure was only 9.3 of the total insurable population. Consequently, we have never got rid of unemployment, notwithstanding the very lavish promises made to the electors and to the world by the leaders of Fianna Fáil before they came into power.  It is a deplorable thing that we seem to be only able to dispose of our surplus population by exporting them.  That is what we are doing and what we have been doing down through the years.</P>
    <P>On that question of workers for housing, I do not believe that there are many unemployed skilled workers on the books of the trade unions.  Actually there is a serious shortage of skilled workers and many housing schemes are held up for a considerable time because of the shortage of plasterers and again by the shortage of carpenters.  A good many skilled workers have gone to Britain and it is difficult to get them back.  Many of them are only willing to come back if they are given attractive terms which must include houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the State is embarking to an increased degree on industry and other exploits.  Planned economy seems to be absolutely necessary for almost every community.  In this country the State has not interfered if private enterprise is prepared to do the work.  Private enterprise failed to give us a national electricity supply and private enterprise failed to give us a sugar supply and again, private enterprise has lamentably failed in the matter of transport, and it is in these circumstances that the State must come in and ensure that these services are provided.  There seems to be a belief amongst certain people that in services operated by the State it is quite honest and good conduct to defraud it.  For that reason it is often more difficult for the State to make a success of these undertakings than it would be for the private firm.</P>
    <P>Taking it all in all, we have, I think, in our present national income gone as far as we can go in a matter of taxation, and the Government and employers should do all they can to <Col N="1222" /> increase the national output in every direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. D. Burke Mr. D. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hawkins spoke about the difficulties of increased production and reduction in prices resulting therefrom.  I think he made very bad use of that.  It is obvious to anybody that any increase in production is a benefit not only to the producer but to the community at large.  It is better to have more production than to have black market prices for small quantities of goods such as bacon and butter.  It would be better to have a large production with fair and reasonable profit.</P>
      <P>I think the Senator's suggestion that industrialists should provide finance for the building of houses for their workers is one that should be considered by the Government.  There are many firms in this country particularly co-operative societies who are in a very large measure free from income-tax and they should take some steps in the provision of houses for their employees.  Why should the taxpayers have to provide subsidies for the building of houses for the workers of such firms as these?  I do not think it was ever the intention of the Housing Acts that the local authorities should be asked to provide houses in such cases.  I think this is a matter to which the Minister for Finance should give his attention.</P>
      <P>I would also urge the Minister to give attention to Senator O'Farrell's plea for the white collared worker who is carrying a heavy burden.  He has to pay for every service he gets and he is the man who, in our fiscal policy, we must see is not crushed between the forces from above and the forces from below.</P>
      <P>The question of rates has been raised and I think there is too great a tendency to get away from the question of our obligations in regard to rates. We have people looking to the central authority to relieve them of these responsibilities and burdens by making everything a State charge.  It is becoming a matter of practice now for county councils to seek to have this or that charge passed over to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the duty of county councillors to see that their own affairs are efficiently <Col N="1223" /> managed and that their own roads are good value for the money spent on them rather than to think they are fulfilling their obligations by asking the State to take them over and do them for them.  That is an escapist method of conducting local affairs, and, when the new Local Government Bill comes before us, I hope it will put sufficient responsibility on the local authorities to ensure that they will do their own work in a proper way and will not look to the central authority to help them out of their difficulties.</P>
    <P>One matter which is causing concern in country districts is the increase in valuations, and particularly where urban councils and corporations have to pay jointly with county councils for certain services.  In the past urban and corporation areas were very efficiently and very properly valued, but the same does not apply to county council areas generally.  The burden of the rates has been increasing each year on the urban areas until they have now got so great that the urban areas are scarcely able to bear them, and I should like the Minister to examine that problem with a view to seeing if anything could be done to stop this unjust burden being placed on the urban areas.  There is a feeling of the utmost apprehension amongst people in urban areas in the matter of repairs or even maintenance of their property owing to the increased valuations.  The increase in rates has been so great that they feel they now bear no relation whatever to those of their neighbours or people living in the larger area of valuation, which is usually the county council area.</P>
    <P>With regard to unemployment, it has been brought to my attention that there are many people to-day who are not genuinely unemployed and many people who are working as domestic servants who are insured contributors. Admittedly, as Senator J.T. O'Farrell said, only 9 per cent. of these insurable people are unemployed, but there are possibly some 1 or 2 per cent. of these who are not genuinely employable, and I think it would be well if this matter of those who are genuinely employable and those who are not were investigated, so that we may get some true <Col N="1224" /> ideas with regard to the problem which has always been used as a means of propaganda by a Government or an Opposition.  From the national point of view, it would be well if we could have some agreed register and if we could tackle the problem in such a way that the people would feel satisfied that it was a true index of the people who wanted work rather than of people who pretended to want work.</P>

      <P>Le cothrom na Féinne a thabhairt dó féin níor mhór do dhuine ar an ócáid seo srian láidir a choinneáil air féin mar is Bille é seo a spreagfadh duine le cur síos ar a lán nithe a bhfuil tábhacht mhór ag baint leo, agus ag an am céanna go mbféidir go bhféadfaí a rá nach mbaineann siad go teicniciúil leis an mBille.  Mar sin féin, is dóigh liom an té a mba mhian leis cur síos ar gach brainse de chúrsaí rialtais, gheobhadh sé údar le sin a dhéanamh ar an mbealach a thug an tAire féin an Bille ós ár gcomhair tráthnóna.  Ba gheall an méid a dúirt sé le óráid den tríú chéim nó an choiste den Bhille, rinne sé tagairt don óráid a rinne sé nuair thug sé an Budget isteach ins an Dáil.  Níl fhios agam an ionann é sin agus údarás a thabhairt dúinn na nithe go léir a phlé sé le linn an Budget do phlé anseo tráthnóna. Ní dhéanfaidh mise é ar aon chaoi.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dúirt mé níos mó ná uair amháin gur ócáid ar leith nuair a thagann an tAire Airgeadais ós comhair na Dála nó ós comhair an tSeanaid.  Ócáid é, is dóigh liom, atá níos tábhachtaí ná na hócáideacha a dtagann na hAirí eile ós ár gcomhair.  Sé an fáth atá agam le sin a rá i dtaobh an Aire Airgeadais ná go bhfuil, thar aon Aire eile, a mhéir aige ar chuisle na tíre chomh fada agus a bhaineann le airgeadas agus chomh fada agus a bhaineann le geilleagar.  Bhféidir gur dualgas an-throm é sin air agus bhféidir go n-abróidh an tAire agus an saol atá ann: &ldquo;Ní ceart díbh bheith ag súil go ndéanfaidh mise cur síos ar rudaí atá chomh tábhachta ach tá chomh haimhréiteach agus atá na rudaí seo.&rdquo;  Dá dtagadh an tAire ós ár gcomhair agus é sin a rá linn, go bhfeictear dó nach féidir dó aon chuntas a thabhairt faoin mbail a bheas <Col N="1225" /> ar an saol ins na blianta atá le theacht agus innseacht dúinn an fáth atá aige leis, ní chuirfinnse milleán ró-mhór air.  Ach ní dóigh liom gur cheart don Aire&mdash;agus ní thógfadh sé orm agus é a rá&mdash;teacht isteach anseo agus an Bille a chaitheamh ós ár gcomhair agus a rá:&mdash;&ldquo;Tóg é nó tóg.  Níl spéis agam ins na rudaí a déarfas sibh.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Nuair léim imeachta na Dála&mdash;agus léim go cúramach iad&mdash;fágann siad go ró mhinic mé in amhras an ceart dom eirí suas sa Seanad chor ar bith, mar caithfidh mé an méid seo a rá gur pléadh an Bille seo go han-chúramach, go han-chruinn, go han-mhion agus go húdarásach ag muintir an fhreasabhraidh ins an Dáil agus is beag a d'fhéadfaí a rá nach bhfuil ráite ag na daoine sin agus ráite go han-mhaith.  Bhí mé ag súil agus chomh mion agus a pléidheadh an Bille ins an Dáil go bhfaigheadh muid freagra i bhfad níos iomláine, freagra níos cúramaí, ón Aire ná mar a fuaramar.  Ní ó thaobh na poilitíochta atá mé a rá go raibh mé ag súil le sin.  Tá spéis agam i bpoilitíocht agus ní fiú deich triuf an tEireannach, fear nó bean, nach bhfuil an spéis sin aige, ach tá spéis agam sna nithe seo ó thaobh sóisialachta agus ó thaobh geilleagair agus nílimid ag fáil treoir ná léargus ar chúrsaí geilleagair, cúrsaí airgeadais agus cúrsaí sóisialachta ón bpríomh-Aire de na hAirí mar ba choir duinn fháil.</P>
    <P>Níor mhiste dhom é seo a rá, go bhfuil ag an Aire, is dóigh liom, ceann de na brainsí, ceann de na hAireachta is fearr ar an domhan a bhfuil seirbhísígh maithe, meabhracha, cúramacha le fáil ann.  Do bfiú dul i gcomhairle leis na daoine sin agus iarraidh orra meastachán cúramach a dhéanamh amach i dtaobh cúrsaí na tíre seo agus chomh fada agus bhaineann leis na nithe seo atá go speisialta ar chúram ag an Aire.</P>
    <P>Deirim an méid sin agus ní le haghaidh cáineadh ná spídiúlacht a dhéanamh ag an Aire é ach mar go gceapaim nach bhfuil an Seanad go háirithe ag fáil cothrom na Féinne ó Aire de ghradam nó d'éirim an Aire seo.  Faoin mbille atá ós ár gcomhair, tá an tAire ag iarraidh meíd áirithe millún punt chun polasaí <Col N="1226" /> an Rialtais a chomhlíonadh.  Céard é polasaí an Rialtais?  Siad na rudaí is mó go bhfuil suim againn iontu sa tir seo le blianta ná ceist na himirce agus an easba oibre agus laghdú ag cánacha agus ar an gcostas maireachtála.  Ní misde dhom a rá nach bhfuil mé sásta beag na mór le polasaí an Rialtais i dtaobh imirce agus easba oibre.  Más é gur ceist airgid í ba chóir don Aire misneach a bheith aige agus a rá gur olc mór í olc an imirce agus an easba oibre. Do b'fiú dhó a rá gur ceist phráinneach í agus go bhfuil air an chumhacht chun airgead d'fháil chun an míádh seo a glanadh amach.  Níl aon mhaitheas a rá liom go bhfuil coimisiúin ar bun atá ag scrúdú na ceiste seo agus go bhfuiltear ag feitheamh le tuarascáil uathu.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé ceart gur cuireadh an coimisiún seo ar bun ins an gcéad ait tar éis an méidh adúradh leis na daoine roimh an toghchán agus le linn an toghcháin deiridh.  Tá brón orm a rá nach bhfuil an muinín is lú agam ná aon mheas agam as an gcoimisiún sin.  Is dona liom é sin a rá go háirithe mar go bhfuil aithne agus meas mór agam ar chuid de na baill den choimisún sin atá ag scrúdú na ceiste.  Do b'fhearr i bhfad éirí as ar fad ós rud é nach bhfuil muinín againn as an gcoimisiún.</P>
    <P>Tá cúpla focal agam le rá i dtaobh laghdú ar an gcostas maireachtála. Is dóigh liom gur féidir a rá, le áthrú beag anseo agus ansiúd, le manipulation, a thaispeáint gur raibh laghdú tagaithe ar an gcostas maireachtála pointe nó leath-pointe&mdash;ach le fírinne, níl aon laghdú tagaithe air.  Do thárla an oiread sin rudaí&mdash;tá an oiread sin cánacha nua agus costasaí nár tógadh isteach sa suimiú sa gcostas maireachtála.  D'ardaigh siad sin an costas maireachtála gan trácht in aon chor ar an méadú atá tagaithe go neamh-dhíreach air.  Tóg, mar shampla, polasaí an Rialtais i leith, abair, siúcra, agus i leith, abair, plúir.  B'fhéidir go mba chóir dhom focal a rá i dtaobh ceist an phlúir. Deirim leis an Aire Airgeadais, ó sé an tAire sin atá i gceist, go mba chóir dhó iarraidh ar an Aire Tionscail agus Tráchtála, ó sé atá i gceist, athru cinneadh a dheanamh faoi'n <Col N="1227" /> litir a cuireadh amach chun na gairmscoileanna ar fud na tíre ag ordú dhóibh an ceadúnas a fuair siad i dtaobh an ghnáth-phlúir a chur ar aís chun an Roinn Tionscail agus Tráchtála.  Sna scoileanna sin múintear do na daoine óga an chaoi leis an leas is fearr a bhaint as na gnáth-rudáí agus i gcás plúir, as an ngnáth-phlúir.  Is leis an ngnáthphlúir sin ba chóir go bhfaighdís an teagasc ins na scoileanna.  Is dóigh liom gur suarach an tslí sin chun cáin d'fháil na ceadúnasaí sin a thabhairt ar ais ionas go bhfuil ar na scoláirí an plúr daor a cheannach. Is suarach an tslí é sin chun beagán scilleacha d'fháil don Stát dá bharr.</P>
    <P>Nílim chun an tríú pointe a phlé go mion mar, chun na fírinne a rá, tá náire orm teacht isteach sa Teach seo chomh minic seo sa bhliain atá caite chun a iarraidh ag an Aire léargas a thabhairt dhom ar na pointí sin. Sna blianta atá caite do bé an gairm scéal a bhíodh ag an Aire agus ag a chomh-Airí ná go raibh an tír cráite ag Rialtas Fianna Fáil le cánacha. Séard a bhíodh á rá acu ná nár bhféidir leis an tír an oiread sin cánacha a sheasamh agus gur raibh an tír dá bánú agus dá bochtú.  Taréis an méid sin cainte, taréis an méid gealltanasaí a tugadh do na daoine go laghdófaí ar na cánacha lé deich milliún punt, séard a thárla ná gur hardaíodh na cánacha le £18 milliun&mdash;agus níle £8 milliún mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Háicín.  Níl sé cóir go bhfógrófaí, chomh minic agus a fógraíodh, do na daoine ag an Aire agus ag a chomh-Airí go ndéanfaí laghdú ar na cánacha ar theacht i gcumhacht doibh agus go mbeadh an scéal ann inniu gurb amhlaidh hardaíodh na cánacha in ionad iad a laghdú.  Nílim ag fáil locht ar cheist ardú cánacha.  Ceist eile í sin&mdash;ceist an féidir leis an tír breis cánacha a sheasamh.  Ach nílimsé sásta leis an Aire.  Ba chóir dó teacht anseo agus a admháil go raibh dearmad déanta acu agus go raibh fírinne an scéil ar eolas ag an Rialtas anois agus mar sin, go bhfuil orthu é seo agus é siúd a dhéanamh.  Ba chóir dó é sin a rá agus a admháil gur raibh an ceart ag an Rialtais a bhí ann roimhe sin. <Col N="1228" /> Más mar sin atá an scéal dáiríre ba chóir dhúinn bheith cneasta le chéile i gcúrsaí den tsórt sin.  Rinneadh tagairt i dtaobh a riachtanaí is atá sé breis táirgthe bheith sa tír. Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leis na scéimeanna a moladh.  Do bhíomar ag moladh na scéimeanna sin le blianta. Bhíomar ag dul ar fud na tíre ag iarraidh a chur ina luí ar na feirmeoirí, agus daoine nach feirmeoirí, go mbeadh breis táirgthe indéanta ach tabhairt faoi ins an tslí ceart.  Ceann de na príomh riachtanaisí, is dóigh liom, má támuid leis an ardú sin d'fháil ar tháirgeacht tabhairt faoi oideachas.  Ba cheart tabhairt faoi mar an chéad rud nó an t-am céanna a mbeadh muid ag tabhairt faoi na scéimeanna eile a thabhairt chun críche.  Maidir le cúrsaí gairm-oideachais, ní dóigh liom gur gá dhom a mhíniú nó a rá a thábhachtaí is atá sé má támuid chun chumas, éifeacht agus teichniúlacht na bhfeilméirí d'ardú mar ba mhaith linn.  Ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an Aire go speisialta áird a thabhairt ar na hiarrataisí atá ag déanta chomh minic sinn ag lucht gairm-oideachais i gcóir breis cúnaimh chun na hoibre seo a dhéanamh ar mhaithe le cúrsaí táirgeachta. Má abrann an tAire nach féidir breis scoltacha a thabhairt dúinn, nó an méid atámuid a iarraidh, ní chuirfidh muid mileán air, cé nach bhfuil muid sásta leis an méid atá againn.  Tá fhios againn go bhfuil ganntanas de shaghsanna éagsúla ann a chuireann srian le hobair den tsaghas seo, ach tá múinteoirí ag teastáil.  Tá scéim ann chun breis múinteoirí a thréineáil, go speisialta múinteoirí tuath-eolaíochta nó rural science, múinteoirí adhmadóireachta, miotalóireachta, tís agus cócaireachta.  Tá breis múinteoirí ag teastáil le go mbeadh teagasc le fáil sna cearda teallaigh nó home crafts.  Níl aon mhaith sa gcaint faoi árdú táirgeachta nó feabhas ann go n-ardómuid caigh-deán teicniúlachta na ndaoine atá i mbun táirgeachta.  Mar sin, tá sé fíor-ríachtanach aire faoí leith a thabhairt don taobh seo den scéal agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire níos díograsaí i leith na n-iarratas i dtaobh an saghas sin oideachais atá luaite agam.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> Níl fúm mórán eile a rá ach ba mhaith liom tagairt don phoinnte go bhfuil spéis faoi leith againn ar fad ann agus cúram faoi leith ag an Aire mar gheall air.  Rinneadh tagairt níos mó ná uair amhain inniu don chabhair atá an tír a fháil ó Mhéirica. Ba mhaith liom a rá&mdash;dúirt mé go minic é agus tá muid ar fad ar aon intinn&mdash;gur mór againn an méid atá déanta ag na Stát Aontaithe chun cuidiú leis an Euroip; gur mór againn é agus go bhfuil muid thar a bheith buíoch do na Stát Aontaithe mar gheall ar an gcabhair agus an cúnamh atá siad a chur ar fáil dúinne, bíodh nach bhfuil siad ghá chur ar fáil sa mbealach céanna dúinne agus atá do thíortha eile.  Níl dóthain eolais agam ar mhion phoinntí na scéime ach ní mór dom a rá nach bhfuil mé sásta, do réir an eolais atá agam, go bhfuil cúrsaí cúnamh Marshall ag dul chun chinn sa tír.  Iasacht a fuair muid ó na Stáit Aontaithe agus ciallaíonn iasacht go bhfuil oblagáidí móra i gceist.  An té a fhághann iasacht ní mór dó an iasacht íoc ar ais arís agus ní mór dúinn idir an dá linn ús a chur ar fáil do réir pé ar bith rátáí atá socraithe.  Nuair a thiocfas an lá a chaithfeas muid an iasacht a aisíoc le rialtas Mheiricá caithfimid é íoc ar ais i riocht dollars, nó airgead Mheiricá.  An bhfuil an tAire sásta go bhfuil muidne ar an mbealach ceart chun an t-airgead sin a chur ar fáil roimh an dáta atá ceaptha chun tosnú ar an ús a íoc agus an rachmas a aisíoc?  Is ar mhargadh Shasana a bheas muid ag díol agus ní ar mhargadh Meiriocá.  An bhfeiceann an tAire aon tseans dúinne, taobh amuigh den chuartaíocht, chun airgid Meiriocá d'fháil lenár n-oblagáidí a chomhlíonadh ar an dáta atá ceaptha?  An dóigh leis gur féidir linn gnóthaí nua a chur ar fáil agus go mbeidh Meiriocá sásta torthaí na ngnó sin a cheannacht?  An bhfuil tionscail againn agus an féidir linn na tionscail sin a mhéadú chun go bhféadfadh muid earraí a chur go Meiriocá?  Tá fhios ag an Aire agus tá fhios ag an Seanad go raibh bearna mhór i gcónaí idir an meid a ceannaíodh muid ó Mheiriocá agus an méid a cheannaíodh Meirioca uainn.  Tá na <Col N="1230" /> blianta 1947 agus 1948 agus 1948 as áireamh, ach ceannaíodh £29,000,000 i 1947. Ní sheasann sin, tá fhios agam, ach pé scéal é beidh muid ag ceannach suas le £3,000,000 ó na Stát Aontaithe i riocht earraí.  An mbeidh muid ag díol aon rud cosúil leis sin leis na Stát Aontaithe?  An mbeidh muid ag díol suas le £3,000,000 leo?  Bhreathnaigh mé ar na figuirí agus scrúdaíos an saghas earraí a chuireann muid go Meiriocá agus cén chaoi an féidir linne an saghas earra atá muid a dhíol le Meiriocá a mhéadú le go mbeidh an diolaíocht cothrom leis an gceannacht nó cosúil leis?  Ni hé amháin sin, ach do réir cosúlachta sa mBreatain Mhóir is dóigh liom gur mó an bhearna a bhéas ann idir ceannach agus díolaíocht idir Éire agus na Stáit Aontaithe.  Má leanann rudaí mar atá siad sa mBreatain Mhóir tá seans go mbeadh sé níos fearr dúinn earraí a cheannacht ó Mheiriocá a cheannaíonn muid sa mBreatain Mhóir faoi láthair, sé sin, go mbeadh an bhearna níos mó fós idir an méid a dhíolas muid agus an méid a cheannaíos muid.  An mbeidh cúrsaí geilleagair fábharach do Shasana idir seo agus 1952 agus an bhfuil cosúlacht ann do réir geilleagair go mbeidh dollars chomh fairsing ag Sasana go mbeidh dóchas againn go mbeidh sí ábalta nó sásta cuid dar n-airgead a thabhairt dúinn i riocht dollars?  B'fhéidir go bhfuil eolas ag an Aire nach bhfhuil agamsa; bfhéirir go bhfhuil mé ró-éadócasach. Ní thaithneoidh sé liom má théann Sasana síos; ní dóigh liomsa gur féidir naísiún amháin a shaidhbhriú de bharr náisiúm eile a bheith bochtaithe; tá suil agam go dtiúrfaidh Sasana a cosa léi sna blianta ata rómhainn ar mhaithe léi féin agus ar mhaithe linne.  Ach an gceapann an tAire go mbeidh feabhas chomh mór sin idir seo agus 1952 go mbeidh fáil againne ar an airgead a bheas riachtanach chun ár ndualgas a chomhlíonadh leis na Stait Aontaithe a bhí chomh fial sin linne?  Is dóigh liom gur cheart don Aire cuntas éigin réasúnta mion a thabhairt dúinn i leith na ceiste sin.  Ba cheart dó tagairt cinnte a dhéanamh, don tseans atá againn teacht suas ar an <Col N="1231" /> airgead Meiriocánach a theastaíos uainn.</P>
    <P>Ní thaithníonn liomsa an dearcadh atá ag an Rialtas seo.  Ba cheart don Aire cuntas a thabhairt, ní amháin dúinn-ne ach do mhuintir na tíre&mdash;atá an méid sin imní orthu i dtaobh an pholasaí, nó easba polasaí, atá ag an Rialtas i láthair na huaire.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir liom gan tagairt a dhéanamh go speisialta do scéal na móna.  Ní thógfaidh an Seanad é sin orm, agus mé chomh gairid sin d'oiread sin de lucht na móna.  Ceann de na rudaí is mó a spreagas mé, an chaint a rinneadh le gairid i dtaobh an scéil seo.  Dúradh sa Dáil gurbé an fáth anuraidh nár gearradh an oiread sin móna agus ba cóir, go ndeachaigh muintir Fianna Fáil amach agus gur chomhairlíodar do lucht na móna gan í bhaint.  Ba mhaith liom a rá anois go mba náireach an chaint í sin.  Níor cheart é rá agus níl sé fíor.  Is cuimhin liom&mdash;agus dúirt mé leis an Aire Airgeadais é, blian ó shoin, agus dúirt mé níos mó ná bliain ó shoin é&mdash;nuair a cuireadh deireadh le scéim na móna ar an mbealach gur cuireadh deireadh léi, bhí mise ar an daoine ar iarr muintir Chonamara orthu teacht siar agus comhairle a dhéanamh leo ar céard ba cheart a dhéanamh.  Chomh fada agus a bhain liom agus le Teachtaí Dála ó Chondae na Gaillimhe, chomhairlíomar do mhuintir na Gaeltachta dul ar aghaidh agus móin a bhaint.  Ach chuireadar an cheist seo orm agus ar mo chomrádaithe: &ldquo;An fíor go bhfuiltear le gual a ligint isteach?&rdquo;&ldquo;Is fíor,&rdquo; adúramar, &ldquo;do réir caint an Rialtais.&rdquo;&ldquo;Má thagann an gual isteach, an bhfaighmid luach réasúnta ar an móin, an mbeidh éileamh uirthi?&rdquo;  Níor bhfhéidir linn-ne ach a rá: &ldquo;Ní chreidimíd go bhfaighidh muintir na hÉireann an oiread guail ar an luach céanna in áit na móna.&rdquo;  Mar sin féin, bhí na daoine sin in aimhreas.  Ní fhéadfainn&mdash;agus ní fhéadfadh an Rialtas&mdash;geallúint a thabhairt dóibh go bhfaighdís margadh le haghaidh móna ar luach réasúnta.  Céard tá tar éis titim amach?  Deireann an tAire Tionscail agus Tráchtála nach féidir dó uimhir na bhfear oibre feiliúnach d'fháil le haghaidh na scéimeanna atá <Col N="1232" /> ar bun.  Ní chuireann sé sin aon ionadh orm, ach ná cuireadh sé an milleán ar mhuintir Fhianna Fhianna Fáil, ach air féin agus ar an bpolasaí dí-ceillí a bhí aige chomh fada agus bhí sé.</P>
    <P>Ar an chaoi chéanna, tá baol ann anois go gcaillfimíd fir mhaithe, de bharr deireadh a chur le forbairt na mbóithre.  Deirim leis an Aire go mba cheart dó iallach a chur ar a chomh-Airí athscrúdú a dhéanamh ar cheist na móna.  Tá a fhios againn go léir, a bhíos ag taisteal ar na bóithre faoin tuaith an droch-bhail atá orthu fá láthair.  Ná ceapadh an tAire go bhfuil an bhail ar na bóithre móra a bhí orthu, ná bail cosúil leis.  Tá droch-bhail ar a lán de bhóithre na tíre agus tá siad ag dul in olcas in aghaidh an lae.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the point raised by Senator Hawkins on the question of the devaluation of sterling and to say that at this stage it is desirable that everybody in this country should keep a cool head in this matter and should get their leadership from the financial experts in regard to the situation and what they are going to do about it.  I am stirred into this speech at this time by what I consider to be an extremely dangerous letter written by Captain Henry Harrison on this matter in the <i>Irish Times</i> to-day.  This is a difficult and very technical subject and one in which the public could very easily be misled.  I have known Captain Harrison for a very long time and he is what I would call a Cassandra, one who takes a gloomy view and is always forecasting that the end is approaching. In the course of his letter there is a good deal of misrepresentation of people who have done valuable service for this country.  He refers to the Banking Commission as being headed by a British professor.  That is a very curious statement, since the chairman of the commission was governor of the Central Bank and he is not British and he is not a professor.  He refers to these people as not being capable of <Col N="1234" /> handling the issues involved.  If that is a reflection on anybody it is a reflection on the Government of the day which appointed these people to handle this matter.  There is also a suggestion that the Banking Commission were led by some inducement into the British camp. That is a suggestion that there was some kind of bribe or something of that kind.  Captain Harrison then goes on to use some of the old stories of which we hear so frequently, such as being under the thumb of the Bank of England and the British Treasury.  It is dangerous for people to make such statements in a situation of this kind, which can easily bring about confusion and be entirely misleading.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Going back to the Banking Commission of 1938, the question of buying gold was discussed by that commission on the evidence of Captain Harrison and I think it is only fair to say that the conditions of that time when the Banking Commission made its recommendations were entirely different from what they are to-day.  If we had been endowed with the gift of prophecy and a prescience of the world war we might have accepted the recommendation. At the time the matter was discussed by the commission it would have been a very rash gamble to involve the country in buying gold.  I suggest that some of those gentlemen that criticised the Banking Commission for its recommendations should remember the circumstances of the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the final paragraph of his letter Captain Harrison calls on the Government to bring in American experts to extricate us from the appalling situation into which we have plunged ourselves. Except for the dollars which we get through the Marshall Aid, sterling is the only currency we can obtain in the matter of trade.  We hear a lot of talk at the present time of paper money being the only external asset which we are in a position to secure, but all money at the present time is paper money.  Even the dollar <Col N="1235" /> is paper money&mdash;will anybody despise it for that?  We get most of our imports from the sterling area and if we were to lose our sterling credits we would have to go short of a great many things.  Therefore, to refer to the matter in terms likely to mislead public opinion is a dangerous move.  It seems to me we should do everything we can in the course of our public policy to keep up the valuable reputation of sterling and not decry it.  We should, in this country, have a creditor mentality and not a debtor mentality. The only real way in which we can get the currency for repayment of Marshall Aid is by maintaining the value of sterling, and above all, its convertibility.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter seems to be that at the moment we are caught up in a series of difficulties from which it is very hard to escape.  We are suffering now from some of the real costs of the world war.  In modern times, neutrals cannot escape their costs of war simply by being neutral. They may escape some of the physical destruction and loss of life, but modern war is so international in scope and so world-wide that no country can possibly hope to escape some of its repercussions. At the moment, we are suffering from the backwash of the war.  The present sterling difficulties are the direct result of the loss of external assets by Great Britain during the war. All I want to say, in conclusion, is that, at a time like this, panic-mongering statements, making the situation worse than it is, do not serve any useful purpose, and therefore I echo the plea made by Senator Hawkins that a statement regarding the realities of the situation, seen in its proper perspective, by the Minister for Finance, might be one of the most useful public services he could perform at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusOFarrell" hpid="Mr. S. O'Farrell Mr. S. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are degrees of futility, we, I think, reach the utmost limit when we talk on a Finance Bill.  Nothing we say will have the slightest effect on the Minister nor on the taxation imposed, which has already been passed by the Dáil.  I suppose that is why so few of us want to <Col N="1236" /> talk and why so remarkably few want to listen to such a discussion.  The Minister, in fact, dances in here like Salome with the head of St. John the Baptist on a plate.  It happens to be the head of John Citizen and nothing we can do will put that head back again.  We can discuss what way the taxes might have been raised or how they might have been spent, but I doubt if even what we say this year will have the slightest effect next year or in ten years' time.</P>
      <P>I am rather depressed by the fact that year after year we complain in the same way about the same evils. We complain about taxation&mdash;how it is raised and how it is spent and the reasons why it is necessary to spend it at all, but we do nothing which will make any fundamental change.  If we look around us&mdash;I have no particular kite of my own to fly, nor have I any special panacea to put forward&mdash;we will find that the whole world has been complaining for a number of years of the very things that are affecting us most seriously and has been seeking remedies and has not found a satisfactory remedy yet.  Therefore, we still have our unemployment and we are likely to have our unemployment, and, so long as we have unemployment, there will have to be taxation in relief of unemployment.  I wonder sometimes whether we ought not to set up an inquiry of our own to see whether a better system could not be devised, or, if not a completely new system, a modification of the present system, so that we will not always be limping behind some other lame man.  That is what we are doing, and if we continue to follow the other lame nations, our nearest neighbour being Britain, we will have to follow her further along the road to Socialism, and the line of demarcation between Socialism and Communism grows fainter year by year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I know something about unemployment from an angle not familiar to most Senators.  Senators talk about unemployment and they are very sympathetic and anxious to do something about it, but how many of them have ever had to face up to unemployment? Do they know what it means?  Does even Senator J.T. O'Farrell know <Col N="1237" /> what it means when he talks about unemployment, and, in the next breath, talks about every worker having to increase production in order to build up the resources of the nation?  Must he not know, as I know, that working hard in a job gives no security in that job?  You may increase the output and the wealth of the nation and not benefit yourself by one halfpenny in the doing of it.  What incentive have the workers of this country to work harder unless it be a moral obligation on them?  If they work harder they are working harder for somebody else.  The most they will get or can ever expect from the job is a week's wages and the most wages they will get out of the job is whatever they are able to force their employers to pay.  I am not saying that is right or wrong, or that our employers are a harder-hearted set of people than the employers of any other nation, but I think that some greater incentive should be given to the workers, and it seems to me that it is appropriate to talk about that on a Finance Bill, because if we can make the people more independent, more productive, more self-supporting and more self-reliant, we are reducing the need for taxation and State services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not familiar with procedure and I was afraid that, if I waited for the Appropriation Bill, I would be told that I must raise each specific point before each specific Minister. I mention the general principle here now because the Minister is the man who takes the taxation into his hand and re-distributes it afterwards. I was caught out this morning by being too reluctant to speak, and then I found that because I did not speak soon enough, I could not speak at all, but I think the general principle could be discussed because so many general matters have been discussed.  I should like to see, as every worker would like to see, the productive capacity of the country increased, but the worker ought to have a greater incentive than he gets&mdash;the insecurity of a weekly wage.  The Minister is raising taxation for various purposes, some of which include <Col N="1238" /> housing of the workers and social services.  That money will be spent in many ways.  It will be spent, as Senator J.T. O'Farrell said, on social services, on doing for people what they are not economically, financially, able to do for themselves.  He mentioned the white-collar workers.  No such people exist nowadays.  Their collars went limp years ago and they are as limp as their collars.</P>
      <P>I thought this morning that I could raise a constitutional matter and found I could not do so, but I happened to notice another item in the Constitution which it is probably appropriate to mention here.  It is Article 15, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Oireachtas may provide for the establishment or recognition of functional or vocational councils representing branches of the social and economic life of the people.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So far we have made no provision for that and have never attempted to do it.  I think we ought to take a proper view and visualise the possibility of building up in this country some better social and economic system than the one which we are trying to patch at present.  I do not propose to go into details about profit-sharing and the control of industry by workers.  These are matters which might more appropriately come up for discussion on another occasion.</P>

      <P>I think they will at some future time, but I am not discussing them now.  I am merely mentioning that I do not propose to discuss them, but I am making a threat, if you like, that I will raise that ghost at some other period.  We ought not merely to be making points against each other about unemployment not having been solved and taxation not having been reduced, because, no matter what Government is in power, so long as the present system prevails, taxation will have to go up, unemployment will not be solved and production will tend to go down rather than up, so long as the people have not got a proper incentive to work.  It is all very fine for me to talk about it because I have had personal experience of what unemployment <Col N="1239" /> means.  Some of the Senators are very vocal when their own particular interest comes up for discussion and I speak on many things because I am interested in many things, but I think that Senators who do not have to work for a wage, who do not have to face the insecurity and the menaces which that insecurity brings ought to face up to whether the taxation of the State is being properly spent, as well as whether it is being properly raised, and not adopt the attitude of the girl who, when passing through a village and told: &ldquo;The cows are in your father's corn&rdquo; replied: &ldquo;To hell with my father's corn.  I am living with my uncle now.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that that is the responsibility of the Chair.  I hope it is not a threat.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach has at least to give me an opportunity of expressing my opinion.  Looking back now to the time when I was sitting on the other side of the House I feel that it was more refreshing and perhaps more invigorating to study what the Minister was then doing.  One had to do it.  The situation is somewhat different now.  I feel that the responsibility of marshalling the problems of the State in their order of importance, and of surveying the capacity of the community to bear taxation, is in the hands of somebody who has a very clear head and who is very competent.  One rather sits and waits to hear the criticisms on the way the Minister discharged his responsibilities. So far, there has not been very much criticism of what the Minister is doing. Senator Hawkins criticised the high level of taxation&mdash;what he was pleased to term &ldquo;the highest figure that has ever been levied.&rdquo;  The rates of taxation are not higher and I think that statement is a commendation of the policy of the Government.  The Minister seems to be able to get more out of less. <Col N="1240" /> Is that not a bit of a miracle?  Yet that is really what is happening in present circumstances.  The policy which the Minister is pursuing is the policy for which we have been calling for a very long time.  The net result is, apparently, that he has been able to get more money and that he has been able to give back more money to the community and, at the same time, to give such encouragement to production that production generally throughout the country is rising.</P>
      <P>Time and time again I addressed myself to that aspect of national policy, and the people who are over there will agree with me that I always urged that our productive capacity should be increased.  The Minister and his colleagues have devoted and are devoting considerable attention to a policy of getting increased production in the country.  That is not so simple. There are many contradictions in our present scheme of economics that must some time or other be straightened out if the nation's well-being and the living standards of our people are to be improved. There is something contradictory about the situation in which, according to Senator Hawkins, our figure of unemployed stands to-day in the region of 61,000.  It is something which I do not understand.  It is not good for the country that the figure should be so great.  If it were possible to put these people into productive occupations where they would be increasing the available commodities in the market&mdash;instead of being a burden on the taxpayers of the country&mdash;they would be able, themselves, to make a contribution to the revenue.  Things definitely should be better, but I must say that I wonder where these unemployed are.</P>

      <P>I am a member of the local authority in my county.  We had a meeting of the county council the other day.  Relatively speaking, my <Col N="1241" /> county is one of the most populous counties in the country from the point of view of the number of small farms and rather large families.  When we were discussing problems of road construction, drainage works and so forth at our county council meeting the other day, we were informed by our engineering staff that they were not able to-day to get the number of people to do the work to be done and they were not able to spend the money available to them because the people were not there to work.  Quite conceivably one could go to the labour exchanges in the county and find that a certain number of people are available.  You have that situation&mdash;people registering for employment and yet when people are wanted for work they are not available for work.  I suggest to Senator Hawkins and everybody else who wants to stress that aspect of our economy in this House and outside it&mdash; and I have heard Senator Hawkins speaking about it outside, but we are here now and that is what matters at the moment&mdash;that it would be much better for the nation's sake to say first to ourselves, instead of urging people to register as unemployed, that anybody who registers as unemployed and who does not want to work is not a good citizen and that these people must not be encouraged in these ways. These people are up and down the country.  They are drawing from the rest of us.  They are lowering our living standards by their behaviour.  It is not the kind of thing we should stand for and we should set our faces against it.  I have made these comments because Senator Hawkins mentioned that figure, but, in doing so, he did not tell the whole story.  I am telling it now, so far as it applies to conditions in my county.  I suggest that if you go all over the country you will find that that picture is at present the general picture, and the sooner we face that fact the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hawkins asked the Minister to make what I suppose would be regarded as an authoritative statement arising out of the situation which apparently confronts a number of Finance Ministers in other countries.  If the Finance Ministers in some of these countries could prevail on these people to give a <Col N="1242" /> better hour per day in their different occupations the problems which face them would not be facing them.  Senator O'Brien has said, in relation to the question of the devaluation of sterling, that it would be inadvisable for a country interested in maintaining the purchasing power of the £ to say anything that might be injurious to that position.  I agree.  It may be bad policy for us but, on the other hand, we would be fools not to face the facts. I believe that the British are not terribly concerned about the strength of our economy in this country.  We have not had any evidence from them during the war and up to the present of any appreciation on their part of the strength of our economy or that it would be possible, by building up our strength, to strengthen theirs.  As far as I can see, their main concern seems to be to strengthen their own economy at the expense of ours&mdash;to purchase as cheaply as possible from us and to sell to us at the highest penny.  While the devaluation of the £, if it takes place, is going to be injurious to us, at the same time it is true to say that obviously a country like Britain cannot go on living at the expense of other people outside her own shores.  If people are losing confidence in British industries or British Government securities it is very difficult to have confidence in industry if the workers are not giving their output.</P>

      <P>I am discussing it only in so far as it affects our own and that is terribly important for us.  In every department of her economic life the situation which confronts her is the situation which would confront us if we added to the 61,000 people or had enough of the spirit that has been expressed up and down the country in pointing to the numbers who are not working without a word about the people who will not work when the opportunity is there.  We are going to be injured in our economy by the <Col N="1243" /> devaluation of the £, but in so far as this Government is encouraging the productive effort of the people of the country and in so far as we are increasing our exports, we are going a long way towards balancing our purchases with our exports and so strengthening our own economy.  It would have been better if the advice given to Fianna Fáil when the Central Bank was going through had been taken, to put the £ in a more stable position, but we are tied to the present position.</P>

      <P>I think I dealt with that point of Senator Hawkins before.  In addition to that 40,000 who are going, more cattle, eggs and poultry are going; more butter is being produced and there is a definite increase in the productive capacity of the people on the land of this country.  It may be that there are in the towns and elsewhere certain people who are not doing their share; it may be that certain people are not making their contribution towards an increase in the productive effort; it may be that there is a lack with regard to some of the industries created here before and during the emergency and it may be that there <Col N="1244" /> is a necessity for a complete overhaul in that respect.  In the boot manufacturing industry to-day we have more factories than are needed to supply the needs of the people at home and people in the industry must either make up their minds to work harder, more efficiently, to produce a product we can export as the farmers export cattle and eggs or accept the fact that some of them must go out of production. The people of this country cannot maintain a number of the uneconomic industries or conditions where quotas have to be imposed or a price level maintained which will keep inefficient people in production to the disadvantage of the efficient and more especially of the consuming public. There may have to be a considerable overhaul and readjustment from the Minister's point of view in that regard. It would, of course, be very excellent if our manufacturing industries, instead of being satisfied with the shelter of our own four walls and to produce what would be consumed by our people, were to make a strenuous effort and strengthen the national economy and take their share of the export market that should be available to them. What is there inferior in Irishmen and Irishwomen that, while in some respects they can produce goods which can compete against the world, in others they cannot?  Is it an incapacity in the management, a lack of courage and enterprise on the part of the management, or is it the fault of the workers in these industries?  In many respects we have advantages that we should realise and make the most of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell addressed himself in his speech rather ably to the problem confronting the world in the matter of food production, and the view Sir John Boyd Orr has frequently expressed on the difficulties that arise as to how the rising population of the world is going to be able to buy or provide sufficient food.  I think generally that that is true, but it is also important to keep another aspect in mind.  It is possible to have a shortage of food and at the same time to have the markets glutted and the farmers broken. Unless Governments have more regard for that in the future than they had in the past we will have calamitous results <Col N="1245" /> because there is a bottleneck.  There can be a damming down of production and the net result for the world can be really disastrous.  It is all important to us here and it is a fortunate thing that the Government has an appreciation of that fact.  It is quite clear that grain production in the world is rising very quickly.  The Americans are talking of restricting the area under wheat next year and it is a good thing that we foresaw that possibility coming and saw that another type of economy was more advantageous to us than the type we exploited during the war.  While that is true, the position in regard to world agriculture is that unless the Governments of the nations of Europe and America realise that the first thing they have to do is to keep the price of agricultural produce stable at a level that will encourage efficient production and give farmers security, disaster can come upon the world because of an artificially created shortage for which farmers cannot be blamed but which comes about as a result of the shortsightedness of Governments.  What the Government have done for farm produce over the coming years is an encouragement to stable production and we know what the Minister for Agriculture is going to do in the future. What we must do is to get a proper perspective with regard to industry, the people who manage industry and the technical efficiency of the people who work.  May I say to Senator Hawkins that if he has any advice to give to the people of the country he should tell them instead of going to labour exchanges to throw off their coats and roll up their sleeves because there is plenty of work for every man who wants work and the day is not very far away when they will be better employed in Ireland than by running across to England?</P>

      <P>It is a regrettable characteristic of most of us that while we enjoy running up bills our reactions when they are presented for payment are not so full of pleasure.  This applies to the annual presentation of bills by the Minister for Finance.  This year's bill is a heavy one.  According to the <Col N="1246" /> Estimate of Receipts and Expenditure for the year ending 31st March, 1950, the expenditure is estimated at £73,150,000 for Central Fund and Supply Services.  That is about £1,000,000 more than last year.  It is a very big sum, but it is not the only one we have to meet.  There is an enormous increase in local demands, there is the rising cost of postage, of national health insurance and of transport&mdash;all big charges which have to be added and which make a very heavy burden on the community.  The Minister himself estimated the burden as about 25 per cent. of the national income.</P>
      <P>Many of the items for which this increased money is needed, as set forth in the Estimates, are in respect of measures for which many of us have long been pressing.  There is the added money for pension rates for retired teachers, for Civic Guards and civil servants.  The increased remuneration to civil servants is designed as an effort to keep pace with the rising cost of living.  All these things are inevitable and the Minister could not but grant them.  I think he was very fair and I am glad he has done so. No matter what the cost, we must do justice to the people who need it most. I speak particularly for the retired teachers.  It is true that the increased pensions there are as yet only a promise. The Minister has promised to introduce the necessary legislation soon and I hope that, before the Dáil adjourns for the summer recess, the legislation will be passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For other things in the Budget we are grateful to the Minister.  The 6d. off the income-tax provided for in Section 1 of the Finance Bill is welcome, as is also the increased allowance to widowers in respect of housekeepers. That is a realistic view of the increased cost of domestic service. Also welcome is the increased allowance for dependent relatives.  All these things cost money, but it is well spent money and the Minister deserves thanks for having considered the needs of those catered for in these respects.  At the same time, we all agree&mdash;and he himself was the first to remind the House of it&mdash;that we should try to stop now.  We should not be pressing unless something inevitable <Col N="1247" /> makes us do so.  We should consider carefully every item of national expenditure and when any new costs are presented to us we should ask ourselves what good will we get from them.</P>
    <P>I am thinking, for instance, of our joining the United Nations.  If the veto is removed we ought to ask ourselves, before we join that body&mdash;it has not done a great deal and we have done very well without it&mdash;how much our commitments will be and what good it will do us.  I feel the same way about the Council of Europe, this very inaccurately named body, which has a shadowy function.  We do not see how it comes in amongst the numerous organisations which are trying to run the ruins of Western Europe at the moment.  What good will it do us to join that body, and how much will it cost?  Another matter on which I would like to touch is the new Irish news agency.  What is that going to cost us, and will it really be worth the money?  I think most Government news agencies suffer in their birth from the circumstances of their birth.  The news they give would seem to have a propaganda touch and for that reason they are usually discredited.  There may be some good reasons for establishing it but so far we have not heard them. Before approving of this scheme we would like to have much more information on it and some details as to its cost and what good it is going to do us.</P>
    <P>The Minister has one of the heaviest burdens any Finance Minister has had since the State was founded.  For the first time in the affairs of the State there is a heavy external loan which has to be met in repayments and interest.  How that money is to be got I do not know and the suggestions made by our advisers are not very illuminating.  They seem to have only one suggestion to offer and that is tourism.  I think we made a very bad start in that matter by selling our hotels and unloading them all on the market at the same time, enabling people to pick them up for almost nothing.  We had a case of the Hydro Hotel in Lisdoonvarna which was sold for £10,000 just as though it was a bankruptcy sale.  That unloading of <Col N="1248" /> these hotels has also interfered with the sales of private hotels by people who decided to dispose of them for domestic or other reasons.  It was a pity to dispose of the hotel in Lisdoonvarna as has been done.  Lisdoonvarna is one of the greatest assets this country has and if that spa was developed according to its rights and on the best lines it would be one of the best in Europe.  There is no reason why it should not be developed along the lines of the spas at Wiesbaden and the other German spas.  To do the thing properly the immediate vicinity of the spas must be properly developed just as the Germans developed theirs. These are things which we should devote ourselves to in future developments.</P>
    <P>The development of our ports is another matter which requires attention if we are to reap the harvest from tourists.  We have already heard very uncomplimentary remarks made about Cobh which is the sole entrance gate to the country from America.  That, however, could best be dealt with by someone else.  We have also the case of Galway port which is in a very unenviable position.  It is like Mahomet's coffin, hovering between Heaven and earth.</P>
    <P>Before the war the Galway Harbour Development Bill was passed, providing for the development of the port in two stages.  Only one stage of the development had been carried through when the war broke out and the rest has been left in abeyance.  The deep dock&mdash;that is the Dun Aengus dock&mdash;is deep enough for cargo vessels using it but it is not wide enough for them to turn.  The commercial dock is wide enough but it needs to be deepened very considerably.  There should also be a communication link between these two docks.  There is also the matter of the dock gates which are likely to collapse, rendering the dock useless.  It would be money well spent to have these works carried out and I do not see why some of the Marshall Aid funds cannot be used in that work.  We should be able to get some of that money to finish off this job properly. These works would be advantageous when it came to attracting tourists.  I <Col N="1249" /> believe 500,000 Americans are supposed to be coming to Europe this year. Many of them have close Irish connections and they would come to Ireland if real efforts were made to cater for them.  Here they have wonderful stretches of tourist country, including such lakes as Lough Conn, Lough Corrib, Lough Mask, along the western seaboard and 2,000 years of history for those interested in such things.  The commercial prosperity of Galway is dependent on finishing the work begun about ten years ago on the port.  That, too, would provide an answer to another headache of the Minister, the unemployment problem. A great many young Connemara men who are now going away could be brought into Galway and the Galway merchants, who are progressive and anxious to develop their business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I find myself in the position of many of the Senators who were not too sure whether the remarks they wished to make would be relevant or whether they would more properly arise on the Appropriation Bill.  I want, however, to talk on a matter which I think is relevant&mdash;income-tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think everybody will agree when I say that there is only one view held by everybody in regard to income-tax&mdash;that it is something they should not have to pay.  The most righteous of men and women who will pay their other taxes willingly and without question object to and will try to circumvent, if possible, the payment of income-tax.  The Minister, of course, will say that it is a very fine source of revenue, but I can recollect that, at a time when I was a younger man, when the average wage of a tradesman was 35/- a week, the minimum figure in respect of the payment of income-tax <Col N="1250" /> was £130 or £150.  The position now is that practically every worker comes under the hammer of the income-tax collector, and not alone is the tax unpopular but the officials who collect it are most unpopular.</P>
      <P>That brings me to another point mentioned by Senator J.T. O'Farrell, the question of increased production. Everyone will agree&mdash;I, as a trade union official, certainly agree&mdash;that, whatever the cause, there is not that incentive to work nowadays which existed 20 or 30 years ago.  That position seems to be world-wide&mdash;it is not peculiar to the people of this country&mdash; and whether it is a reaction of the recent war or not, I am not sure, but it has been put to me that men have been reluctant to work overtime, to earn more wages, on the ground that much of the extra wages so earned goes into the coffers of the income-tax collectors. Whether that is true or not, I do not know, but that is what has been put to me and it is questionable whether it is judicious to leave the minimum figure for the payment of income-tax as it is, if we want to get increased production.  Representations were made to the Minister by the trade union congresses with a view to getting the figure raised but, seemingly, the Minister was not in a position to raise it, because he did not do so.</P>
      <P>Another matter referred to was the matter of housing.  This is a national scandal&mdash;I am talking of the City of Dublin&mdash;and it is questionable whether we are approaching the problem from the right direction.  What is happening in Dublin is that people are being taken out of insanitary habitations and put into another dwelling, and these insanitary habitations are immediately occupied by somebody else.  I can look back 30 or 40 years and I can remember that there was then a housing problem in Dublin.  To solve that housing problem 35 years ago, we wanted 20,000 houses, and we still want more than that number.</P>

I suggest that it was a mistake that the Minister did not give some heed to the representations made to him by the trade union people on behalf of the working class generally.  If you want production you must give the worker some incentive; and there is no incentive to a worker to work hard if he finds that the money he earns through working harder goes to the income-tax collector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will agree that the main purpose of a Second Stage debate on the Finance Bill is to enable the House to discuss general financial policy, and you, Sir, will agree that the debate cannot be kept too strictly relevant.  It would be of very similar nature to what one might call a general Budget debate in the Dáil. I have never had any serious fears of ever being a Minister, but I always feel that, if I ever were to become a Minister, the last job I would like would be that of the Minister for Finance.  He bears possibly more responsibility than any other Minister, with the possible exception of the Leader of the Government of the day, and he has a thankless task.  He cannot possibly please anyone except, perhaps, those who are economists or who give the matter a considerable amount of unselfish and theoretic consideration. <Col N="1252" /> At the same time, he cannot ever really satisfy himself.  I imagine, from what I know of the present Minister, that he has probably felt considerably irritated at his inability to do a number of things which he, as Patrick McGilligan, T.D., would wish to do. He has to take a broad view of the situation.  He has to resist or to give in to demands from other Departments and, generally, he has to try and work out a financial policy which will provide the necessary funds but which, at the same time, will not do any harm to the general financial structure of the State or to questions of production, business, etc.  Although he might have a perfectly framed Budget from the point of view of the least possible objection and from the point of view of passing it through both Houses that Budget might have a very serious and unfortunate effect on our general economy.  I find considerable diffidence in speaking now.  Like Senators Hawkins and O'Brien I should love to hear the Minister or somebody else make an authoritative statement about the situation but I honestly believe neither he nor anybody else in Europe is in a position at the moment to make it.  It depends on circumstances which no one nation by itself can control. I think we have an extremely good Minister but if we had a super Minister for Finance and the best in the whole world he could not by himself in Ireland solve the problems which relate to currency exchange and the convertibility of currency&mdash;not only sterling but other currencies which are related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection I was going to point out&mdash;possibly I shall shock Senator Mrs. Concannon&mdash;that a number of Members of Parliament whom I met recently on the Continent are looking hopefully to the Council of Europe, through the Committee of Ministers, and to the fact that for the first time it will be possible for representative members of European Parliaments to discuss these problems in the open.  Many people feel&mdash;not, I think, that the Strasburg Assembly could, because it has no legislative powers, solve these problems&mdash;but that the frank discussion of them in a European Parliament may lead to an <Col N="1253" /> understanding of the difficulties and how much the countries of Western Europe are depending on each other. This is not fully realised at the moment, particularly in this country. The man in the street in smaller countries, particularly in the Scandinavian countries and in Belgium and Holland is very much alive to the serious danger of the spread of Communism.  They need no convincing that it is essential that there should be close working together among the western European nations.  We were neutral in the world war but we certainly are not neutral in relation to Communism.  Theoretically we may dread it and are opposed to it. For religious and possibly other reasons we reject everything that it stands for but I do not think that as individuals we realise the danger or the extent of this menace in the same way as the same kind of people would in the same way as if they were living in continental European countries.</P>
    <P>May I say that I very much welcome the speech of Senator O'Brien. I agree with most of it except perhaps his statement at the end.  I do not think there is much to be gained at the moment by putting forward abstract theories, however sincere or well thought out.  The importance of currency is not the particular value of any country's piece of paper but the extent to which it can be used to promote trade, national and international. The countries of Western Europe must increase their trade. Either that or they are going to go under.  That is more or less accepted. I believe that the problem of currency is essentially international.  From our point of view we admit frankly that not only is it our interest that sterling should be strong but it is our interest that the countries of Europe that are working together should reach a clear and satisfactory understanding with the United States.  Talking about some imaginary thing we might have done ten or 15 years ago and which we think would have had some marvellous effect and would possibly have prevented our suffering economically from the war does not help us very much.  Some people believe that sincerely but I think that it leads to an undue pessimism and has a deleterious effect.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in Senator <Col N="1254" /> Colgan's remarks with regard to income-tax.  It shows that the general view is much the same from the bottom to the top.  I remember as a young man going to an inspector to persuade the inspector that my father had deliberately paid too much income-tax. He told me that I was asking him to do the most difficult thing any inspector could possibly be asked to do.  I told him that he did not know my father. Eventually I was able to prove the matter.  What happened was that my father asked me about a particular payment.  I pointed out that it was not income according to income-tax law and was not regular.  I was away for some time after that and my father, who had qualms of conscience, returned it as income.  It took about a year and a half before the inspector was satisfied, but he was satisfied and it was put right.  There are quite a number of people who are pretty conscientious with regard to their payments. The point I want to make is that income-tax is now based in the main on the laws of 1920.  It does not create a general feeling of satisfaction and fair play as applied at the present moment.  Senator Colgan has dealt with one aspect of the matter with regard to allowances.  I, personally, think that income-tax should start with low incomes.  However, it should not be 3/3 on the first taxable £100, which is far too much on a low income, and 6/6 on the next £100.  It should be lower at the start if it is to be applied at all.  The operation of a scheme of that kind suddenly imposed on the top of our Income Tax Acts would probably lead to considerable difficulty.  I am not, and I do not pretend to be, an expert in this matter and I cannot say how the Revenue Commissioners would view the suggestion.  I am, however, very disappointed that I have not been able to persuade this Minister for Finance&mdash;as, indeed, I was not able to persuade his predecessor&mdash;that the time has come when a committee should be set up to examine the methods of applying income-tax particularly in regard to business.  More and more, the most important businesses in this country will be carried on by public companies.  The directors of these companies, whether they are shareholders' <Col N="1255" /> representatives, or workers' representatives, no matter what way you may elect them, must, of necessity, be trustees.  If the business is to be of any value to the country it should be kept up to date so that for generations it will go on providing employment and giving service to the country. It does not very much matter to the people who run that business how much the tax on the profits may be, provided they are quite sure that it is only on profits that the tax is paid.</P>
    <P>There is at the present moment sometimes a wide, and sometimes a not so wide, discrepancy between the profits as assessed for income-tax and the profits that any responsible auditor would allow them to be sent out to the shareholders and it is that discrepancy that causes difficulty.  It could be&mdash;in fact it does happen&mdash;that you are paying income-tax from a business when in fact you have not in that year made a profit which an auditor would regard as a profit at all.  I think it would be very much healthier from the point of view of the State and of business if it were possible to bring the margin of difference between the two down to the absolute minimum so that when the Minister for Finance decides on income-tax or profits tax he will know that only actual profits will be taxed and will not injure the business concerned. I think that would mean a considerably higher rate of tax than 6/6 for business profits.  I am sure that 6/6, plus the corporation profits tax, which works out at 1/6, that is 8/-, does not represent the actual amount paid by the average business to the State. I do not know if figures have been issued.  I do not think the Minister should spend money on getting them out, but it would be useful at some time to publish the total amount of income-tax collected from persons with an income of £300 a year or under and for amounts up to £1,000 and over&mdash; surtax returns of course give you an idea with regard to individual incomes over £1,500&mdash;and the amount payable by businesses as distinct from individuals.  Figures used to be available but I do not think I have seen them lately and it would be useful to the public generally if they were <Col N="1256" /> available.  It used to be said that if you reduced income-tax by sixpence you were toadying to the rich.  I do not think that was true in the lifetime of any of us but people's wages were once so low that a majority of them came below the standard.  Now, as proved by the speech of Senator Colgan, that has ended and a reduction is a reduction for all.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins produced an amazing line of argument and I am drawing attention to it not so much because he mentioned it as because it seems to me to represent a point of view which is held in a very vague way by far too many people.  He complained that there has been increased production and therefore a reduction of prices.  It seems to be the idea that having lived through a period of scarcity and war conditions with high prices due largely to scarcity, the farmers, manufacturers and others will be dissatisfied, and will not work or try to increase production unless they are guaranteed the same price.  That is fundamentally wrong and it is up to us in all Parties to make it clear that the object of being an agriculturist or an industrialist is to give service as well as to make profit.  If you can make the profit which is necessary to keep your business or farm going it is a thousand times better to make that profit by producing three times the amount and giving your fellow countryman, or people of other countries if you are exporting, goods at lower prices.  That means you can have self-respect; it means that you can be proud of your industry and proud of increased production.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it should be made perfectly clear by all Parties that we want increased production so that prices can come down without reduction in the total necessary profit. Many of the rates of profits were reduced because of high prices during the war, particularly in the distributive trades.  In the manufacturing trades, because of small turnover, rates of profits went up and they can come down if there is increased production. The line of Senator Hawkins was that we should keep up our prices and increase production at the same time.</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied that the Government are wise in maintaining the present price control system. The system of marginal price control where you have a fixed percentage of profit on the low and on the high priced article is unsatisfactory where there are sufficient quantities available. It only benefits the person who can buy the high priced article to the detriment of the person who can only buy the lower priced article. Where there is competition there is a tendency to have smaller profits on the lower priced article in order to meet the person with a small income.  In the main it is the person with a low income who walks from one shop to another in order to get the cheapest article.  I know that there are exceptions&mdash;misers and ladies with very big incomes who spend 2d. on a bus to save a penny, but that does not happen generally.  It is a mistake to continue price control if it has a detrimental effect on trade generally, which I think in many cases it has.  I personally&mdash;and I will probably be blamed by some of my colleagues for saying so&mdash;am of the opinion that price controls should be abolished except in industries where the State by means of tariff or in some other way restricts the market.  I agree that where commodities are still short you must not allow people to profiteer simply as a result of the shortage, but where you can get back to free competition I think it would be very much wiser to take your courage in your hands and drop the restrictions that exist.  A great many have gone and I think the effect has been good. I do not want to take time now though I would be prepared to argue the case at considerable length if necessary. The effect would be to reduce prices, particularly of the lower priced articles and I speak with some little experience and a clear recollection of what happened after the 1914-1918 war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some sympathy with Senator S. O'Farrell's statement about the difficulty of providing an incentive to work. No doubt with fixed wages as a result of negotiations between employers' and workers' unions a man may feel that <Col N="1258" /> no matter whether he works or not he will get his £4, £5 or £6 a week.  We must get together and see whether that can be improved and have a relationship between a man's earnings and the amount of work he does.  No doubt as far as the majority of businesses are concerned those who get their income from the profits have plenty of incentive to work because if they do not they know there will be no profit at all.  The problem of relating production to income should be carefully considered both from the worker's and employer's points of view, and I am rather glad to see Senator Séamus O'Farrell raising it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I do not at all agree with Senator Mrs. Concannon&mdash;with whom I find myself very frequently in agreement&mdash;when she says we should examine the position in relation to the United Nations Organisation or the Council of Europe, to see how much good it will do us or what it will cost. I say we should examine it to see if we can afford to stay out of it, what we can do to co-operate with others, will it do something to benefit the position not merely of our little nation but also other nations, and more particularly the smaller nations who have suffered from the war and are trying to get on their feet.  The two bodies which she mentioned&mdash;I am more interested at the moment in the second&mdash;are international bodies.  We would never take any part in them if we viewed them simply and solely from the narrow view-point&mdash;I have taken down the Senator's words&mdash;&ldquo;How much good will it do us and what will it cost?&rdquo;  They are international efforts and must be viewed as such.  That includes, of course, the good we will get out of it.  I hope Senator Mrs. Concannon will agree with me that it should be viewed from the wider international angle.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe is going to cost a little money but it will not be very much.  There has not been a Supplementary Estimate, so we do not know the estimated figure.  We are entitled to send four delegates and four substitutes&mdash;that will be eight.  Possibly the Minister, who is a member of the Committee of Ministers, can also attend.  That is not quite clear and I <Col N="1259" /> cannot find it clearly in the statute. We will also have to pay for periodic meetings&mdash;I suppose four or five times a year&mdash;of the Committee of Ministers. I would like to point out to the Seanad that, in the Committee of Ministers, we will be taking equal part as one of ten.  It may turn out to be a very unique opportunity for a small country like ours, not only to know what is happening and have first-hand information but also to play our part in that Committee of Ministers.  This is one of the first cases where we joined as a Founder State and went in at the beginning, taking our full part.  Therefore, while I welcome criticism, I would like to see a good deal more known about the Council of Europe and what the Strasburg Consultative Assembly is hoping to do, and I would like to see our delegates taking part in it. The cost comes within this Bill, as it has to be provided, although we have not had an Estimate.  I agree with Senator Mrs. Concannon that when we plan things of this kind we should have regard to the cost, but I would not like to narrow it down solely to what good it will do us.  I am convinced that the problem of prosperity, particularly amongst the European countries, cannot be solved by one country alone but is becoming more and more an international problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBurke" hpid="Mr. R.M. Burke Mr. R.M. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Several Senators referred to increased production and I agree that this was a good time to do so.  We should, however, emphasise that what this country needs&mdash;and the world also&mdash;is increased production of the type of goods which the majority <Col N="1260" /> of the people need, in other words, necessities and simple luxuries, which are within the reach of people with small incomes.  One of the evils in this country is that there is too much production of very expensive luxuries which are only within the reach of the wealthy few, and far too little production of many of the necessities of life which the majority of our people need. Under the latter heading would come food, to which Senator O'Farrell referred. As he said, all over the world the majority of the people need more food now, and will for many years to come, in much greater quantities.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons why there is too much production of very expensive luxuries and not enough of necessities is the effective demand.  There are certain people with very big incomes who demand expensive luxuries and can afford to pay for them, so the business firms go on producing them, instead of producing the things which most of the people urgently need and cannot get.  That is where we can, by means of the Finance Bill, affect the position, by reducing the incomes of the very wealthy and increasing the incomes of the majority of the people. In that way, we can bring about a greater effective demand for the goods that are desirable, and reduce the demand for very expensive luxuries. As I did last year, I would again this year appeal to the Minister, and to all those who consider this subject, to endeavour to reduce rates and taxes further on people with small incomes and, in order to make up the deficiency, increase taxation on very wealthy people, of whom there is still a considerable number in this country, people who spend large amounts on enormously expensive luxury motorcars and many other luxuries I need not mention now.  I may be asked how that can be done.  One way, I suggest, would be to increase surtax on people with incomes of over £1,500 a year. Another would be to increase death duties on persons coming in for large estates of, say, from £10,000 or £20,000 upwards.  There are various other methods that could also be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with estate duties, it is interesting to notice what has been <Col N="1261" /> done in Britain.  I know that some conditions are different there, but I believe that we would do well to consider that they have a much higher rate of death duty on large estates than in this country.  According to some figures which I received recently, on estates of £20,000 the rate here is 9.6 per cent. while in Britain it is 12 per cent.; on estates of from £35,000 to £40,000, it is 14.4 per cent. here and 18 per cent. in Britain; and on estates of from £50,000 to £55,000, it is 19.5 per cent. here and 24 per cent. in Britain. People coming in for large amounts of money varying from £20,000 to £50,000 have far more money than they need, and an additional tax of this nature would not be any hardship on them. It could be easily collected by the Minister for Finance, and used to reduce taxation on people with small incomes.</P>
    <P>With regard to income-tax, referred to by Senator Douglas and Senator Colgan I believe that what they said in regard to wage-earners is correct as far as large urban areas and cities are concerned, but the situation is completely different in the rural areas and small towns.  I believe that the vast majority of the people in rural areas have incomes of less than £4 a week, and do not pay income-tax, and they regard the income-tax payer as the better off man.  When income-tax was reduced by 6d., these people did not get any relief at all, particularly the married man with £3 10s. 0d. a week or less.  It might be asked: &ldquo;In what way can we help such people?&rdquo;  I suggest that we might help them by reducing the rates paid by persons in that category.  The man with a wife and family who is getting £3 10s. 0d. a week in the rural areas and small towns pays at the present time in many cases more than £5 a year in rates and these rates have been steadily increasing year by year.  I believe that we should help such people by reducing their rates and collecting the money by a levy of higher taxes on wealthy people.  I believe that income-tax, although there are certain anomalies, is, on the whole, a very fair tax. Rates, on the other hand, do not vary with income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for mentioning the matter is that money raised by increased surtax or death duties could be used to reduce the rates paid by the person with a small income.  With regard to income-tax, I think it is a good form of tax, but I do suggest that more should be levied on the persons with large incomes and less on the people with small incomes.  I believe many people willingly pay their income-tax, because they think it is just, and they feel that the money they pay, which goes to help widows and orphans and old age pensioners, is as well spent by the Government as it would be if it were given to a charitable institution.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Douglas that we should be willing to help in improving world conditions even if we do not gain any benefit ourselves, just as we were willing to send help to Europe in the form of food when it was needed.</P>
      <P>Another matter to which I would like to refer is a statement made by the Minister for Finance recently which, I am informed, gave the impression that the Minister may, in a short time, perhaps in weeks or months, reduce the stamp duty on the purchase of lands and buildings.  As a result of that impression, many people have (I am informed) decided to postpone certain purchases and sales of lands and houses which they had intended carrying out.  I believe it is not desirable that such proceedings should be held up indefinitely, and therefore the Minister should, at the earliest opportunity, make a statement on the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ireland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that the Minister for Finance should tack on to this Bill the proviso that this is a Finance Bill for a portion of what ought to be an economic unit.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was rebuked the other day, for referring to Partition at Geneva, by a British Minister.  I do not think he was entitled to do so on that occasion because the meeting really had a lot to do with the economic prosperity of Ireland.  I think, as this House is <Col N="1263" /> aware, the chief dollar-earning industries of this country happen to be situated in the partitioned portion of the North-East.  It seems to me there can be no real discussion on this Bill without taking into account our dollar necessities.  If we were an economic unit at the moment, we would not possibly have to be carried on the dollar pool and we might possibly be able to buy requisite materials for our industries if we were an economic unit. It may, therefore, be appropriate if the Minister underlines the fact that where our dollar interests are concerned, the partition of our country is a matter of prime importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be very helpful if we had statistics setting out the national income and the way in which it is divided amongst the various sections of the community.  With these figures at our disposal, we would be in a better position to assess whether justice is being done or not.  I think some years ago a paper of that sort was brought out by the Minister's Department and I suggest to him that it would be desirable, even now, to present Deputies and Senators with a similar statement, especially in view of impending legislation.  I would like to say also that, while disclaiming any pretensions to a knowledge of high finance, it would not be unwise if the Minister was to consider setting up a commission to study the present financial position of the country.  I do not agree with the ostrich-like fashion of sticking our heads in the sand and refusing to see what is happening around us or face the facts.  It would be better to seek men of sound financial knowledge and get them to give serious consideration to the financial position existing at the present time.  The terms of reference of that commission would be a matter for the Minister after consultation with the Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about agricultural production and about the necessity for increasing our industrial output. If we look around us at the world to-day, we will find that the safest basis for any country is its agricultural industry, and, while it is desirable to absorb people who are not employable <Col N="1264" /> in agricultural production in subsidiary industry, it would be fatal if we focussed our attention on, and gave all our determination to increasing production for the sake of exports, because, once you become an exporting country, you enter into a competition and you neglect the essential industry in the country for the sake of competing against people further ahead in the race.  Highly industrialised countries to-day which have deserted agriculture and have entered into that competition in respect of industrial exports would very much like it if they could return to the position we are in, and for that reason I commend the policy of the Minister and the Cabinet in concentrating on our basic industry and putting into it every available pound to increase production and to absorb more men on the land.  I believe that is a sane and sensible policy.</P>
    <P>I am not at all impressed by what I call the political argument about emigration and unemployment.  I come from a congested county in the west and I can say without fear of contradiction that there is no unemployment in that county, and, as evidence of that fact, within the last couple of weeks, I spoke to a Bord na Móna supervisor&mdash; and this is a fact of which the Minister should take serious notice&mdash;who wanted men.</P>

      <P>It has relation to the Bill.  That supervisor went to the labour exchange and was given a list of 15 men.  The board did not even ask these men to walk, cycle or run to work.  They provided transport for them, but, out of the 15 men, only two went to work.  The others said that they had not time to go because they had plenty to do at home.  If Senator Hawkins wants to put forward arguments&mdash;I do not say this with any personal antagonism towards the Senator&mdash;he should rely on more serious arguments than those he has <Col N="1265" /> put up.  In my county, every man who wants work to-day can get it, but of course there are people who do not want to work.</P>
      <P>With regard to emigration, I might say in passing that there is no need for a man to emigrate if he is prepared to take the type of work available, but there are people who are not prepared to take it and these people go to another country to do the type of work they prefer.  I think that is a normal proceeding.  I am pleased with this Bill not so much because of what it contains, but because it is an indication of the policy the Minister intends to pursue, and, while he confessed in the other House that he is not satisfied, it gives us the feeling that he will continue on the course he has now embarked upon until he is able to introduce a Finance Bill which will satisfy all sections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Orpen</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his Budget.  It looks as if the Minister was some sort of conjurer because he clearly has given a certain number of remissions in taxation while, like all good conjurers, he has been able to take more out of the hat than was put into it.  That is the mark of a sound Minister for Finance. The Minister, in his last two Budget speeches, gave a short, simple economic review and I think that periodic reviews of the general economic situation by the Minister are very valuable.  He, better than any other Minister, sees the picture as a whole.  Ministers are naturally apt to see their own Department only, but the Minister for Finance has to see all Departments, and I should like to see him, now that we are to have a reinforced Department of Statistics, getting out such figures as were referred to by the previous speaker, the figures of the national income, in time for us to make use of them and not merely to have them for purposes of record and historical interest.  I want to see trends of production set out at more frequent intervals.  I want to see plans for capital investment and possibly information in relation to savings. I think we want more information about the general economic status of the country.  Extreme accuracy is not <Col N="1266" /> so essential as having what one might call &ldquo;hot&rdquo; figures.</P>
      <P>I want to refer now to one very small feature of the Budget, a feature of great interest to many people who have the fortune or the misfortune to live in remote rural districts.  It is extraordinary how legislation of all sorts has had a tendency to consider that all rural Ireland is exactly the same and that there are no such places as remote rural districts.  I live in one, and I know what it is like, and I am therefore very glad to see that the Minister is making concessions to these remote districts which have sometimes been forgotten and which have to provide for themselves everything they require in the way of amusement and entertainment.  Anything that helps these people in remote districts and facilitates them is, I think, a good thing.  Let me finish by saying that I think it is most important that, possibly half-yearly, we should have an increased use made of the Minister for Finance's economic review.  We want to know where we have gone and, if possible, where we are going.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Finan's suggestion that the Government should look into the financial question to see how it will be affected by the present international situation. My knowledge of the subject does not permit me to make suggestions but I feel that the matter should be looked into.  I think it is rather peculiar that, while we are content to borrow dollars from America, we have, at the same time, to spend a great deal of these dollars on goods which we could produce at home.  I understand that it is a very good thing to be able to borrow dollars for things which we are obliged to import from other countries.  It costs £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 a year to purchase wheat from America but there is no reason in the world why a great bulk of that commodity could not be produced at home.  It seems unwise to produce less wheat and undoubtedly we shall have less wheat this year than last year.  Last year, although the acreage was down, the yield was high and that accounted for the increase. This year the acreage will be down very <Col N="1267" /> much more and there is no prospect of an increase in yield.  Therefore I do not think we shall have more wheat this year than last year.  I consider that policy to be unwise, seeing that the wheat has to be paid for in dollars. Further, the purchasing of maize in large quantities from America does not appear to be wise.  It seems to be a very doubtful practice to borrow large sums of American money to purchase maize to be fed to pigs which, in turn, are exported to Britain and paid for in sterling.  It would seem that we are subsidising the British market with money borrowed by ourselves, because we are borrowing good money and trading it for sterling.  I cannot understand why that practice should be followed on such a large scale.  If, as I have said, it was necessary it would be all right, but, in the case of wheat and other commodities, there does not seem to be justification for such large purchases from the United States.  No doubt the money which will be expended in drainage will make a good return and the same applies to the development of harbours and so forth. Money spent on such projects will be well expended.  So far, money has not been provided, as it should have been provided, for the improvement of harbours. The previous Government gave money freely for the development of harbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill provides for a very large sum of money.  I think it justifies the finances of the previous Government. The present Government undoubtedly have an advantage in that they can buy cheaper than the previous Government could buy.  There is now a general improvement in conditions due to recovery from the effects of the war situation and there was a good harvest last year, and so forth.  Despite these favourable circumstances their bill is as high as the highest Fianna Fáil bill and, as I say, that justifies the Fianna Fáil Government.  No doubt, social services take a very large proportion of that sum but they did so too under the previous Government and they got no money for that.  The Fianna Fáil Government were being continually cried down because of large expenditure but now their work has been fully <Col N="1268" /> justified by the size of the present Government's bill.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why rationing in regard to flour, tea, sugar, and other commodities is maintained.  There seems to be no reason for it as there seems to be an unlimited stock of flour.</P>

      <P>The wheat is there, wherever it came from.  It could have been produced at home but when it is there why not distribute it?  However, it is very hard to justify the two prices. At certain times and in certain circumstances it might be possible to do so but it is not possible to justify two prices for flour, and tea and sugar.  A previous speaker said that there should be either rationing for all at one price or that there should be a subsidy without rationing or else that the goods should be put on the market at a reasonable market price.  The Government has shown a want of frankness in that situation.  They have tried to avoid either of these courses&mdash;to withdraw the subsidy, or give the subsidy on the foodstuffs without rationing which would have been the far better course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of increased production has been raised by several Senators. I agree with Senator Burke when he said that we should increase production of the essentials of life more than of anything else.  There has been too much increased production of luxury articles&mdash;motor-cars and other luxury articles, imported at terrific cost. There is a fear, in regard to increased production in agriculture, amongst agriculturists that increased production may inevitably lead to a very serious decline in prices.  We all understand that present prices cannot last but, if there could be an assurance that there would be a reasonable price, it would be all right and there would be an incentive to production.  Take, for instance, the question of butter.  In 1939 the price the British Government was willing to give to Irish farmers for Irish butter was only 5d. a gallon. There is every reason to believe that if butter becomes plentiful again the same thing will happen next year or the year after.  There is every reason <Col N="1269" /> to believe the foreign market will offer the same price as formerly.  Then, there is the further difficulty of wages which were increased during the war and the fear that the cost of agricultural implements, manufactured goods and so forth will remain comparatively high.  That is the great fear before agriculture.  It probably is a world problem because it existed all over the world before the war and unless there is some means to adjust prices on a fair basis there will be periodic slumps and shortages in agricultural production.</P>
    <P>I think the development of drainage will prove of great advantage to the country but I would like to point out that even more important than the development of derelict and swampy portions of the land would be the actual development and working of good land.  You see the richest part of the country unworked and left simply to grazing.  In Limerick and Tipperary we see vast tracts of land used for ranching and that is as great a waste of our natural resources as allowing swamps to remain. The land should be developed to produce as much as possible and maintain as many families as possible and we regret that land division seems to have slowed down.  If families are to be maintained on the land it must be divided.  Agricultural prices should be kept at a steady, reasonable level, as otherwise we cannot hope to maintain people on the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to make a few remarks on the Bill.  On reading the debates in the Dáil and hearing the debates here I feel the Minister must be very tired now of all the details that have been gone over. I regard the running of the State as being similar to the running of a huge industrial or business enterprise.  In a business it is usual at the end of the year to give some credit to the managers and the people who have run the business successfully and put hard work into it.  Listening to the debates one seldom hears anybody giving credit to the Minister for the hard work he has put in for the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Finance Minister is the keystone of the whole structure <Col N="1270" /> of Government and I would like to start my few remarks by paying a tribute to our Minister for Finance because I think we have a Minister for Finance who could compare with, if not excel, any Minister in the world. Last year in his Budget which was taken on at very short notice he mentioned that the reliefs given in it were more or less tokens indicating a trend.  I think he has justified his prophecies on that occasion in this Budget by continuing that trend.  The trend is one in which there is apparent a desire to give relief to the taxpayer and to call a halt to Government expenditure which seemed to be growing and growing to such a degree that the ordinary taxpayer really saw no end to it.  In this Budget we have had income-tax concessions.  It has been said that more money has been collected this year than ever before, but that is a different story.  What in fact the ordinary taxpayer wants to know is whether he is going to pay more this year than he did last year and the fact is that both the individual taxpayer and the business taxpayer is paying less this year than last year. The fact that more money comes as a result of a lower rate of taxation is a feather in the cap of the Government. It is the very thing that we in business have all been proclaiming for years. We said &ldquo;lower taxation and you will get more money&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The idea seems to be that the more you take from a man the more he will give you.  We have exploded that. We said: &ldquo;Give us more incentive to work and leave more in the business and the State will have more.&rdquo;  That is what happened, so what is the good of standing up and saying that more has been collected this year than ever? I commend that and if the rate of taxation were lowered and more money would be left in business and for the individual taxpayer there would be more money for the State.  The fault to-day is that too much money has been taken out and nothing left in the money making machines.  I feel that this Government and the Minister for Finance in particular has called a halt to this relentless upward movement of taxation and realised that the taxpayer has not an inexhaustible supply <Col N="1271" /> of money.  In the past people engaged in any type of business felt that things were becoming hopeless and that taxation was more and more penal.  We all know, and I believe, that the best people to spend money are the people who make it.  The taxpayer is the person who makes money.  He has earned his money, usually pretty hard, and he is entitled to spend it and invest it. The man who makes the money is far more entitled and capable of both spending and investing his money.  I feel also that the State should only take what is necessary to run the country efficiently and has no right to indulge in extravagant or wasteful expenditure.  In this country and in a great many countries to-day the State seems to take the attitude that it is the only person capable of spending money.  The fact is that in most cases the State is just spending money.  We had an example in recent years of State enterprise in this country and I think it would not be an unfair thing to say that not one of the projects in which large sums of the taxpayers' money were invested has proved to be a businessman's proposition.  In other words, they have not paid their way or justified the expenditure laid out on them.  It has been said that if the State did not undertake these enterprises things would not have been done at all.  I think that in a great many cases it would be just as well if they had not been undertaken at all, if they were not undertaken by private enterprise and run properly.  We had this excursion into tourism, creating hotels and so on run by people who did not understand what it was all about.  We had the transatlantic air lines which no businessman would undertake because the first thing anybody in business wants to know is what the probable economic results are.</P>
    <P>It was a well-known fact that the American Air Lines were not paying at the time they were taken on by a small State like ours and when we required the money for far more essential things.  Over-taxation of individuals and enterprise obviously deprives both the individual and the business of any incentive to work because when one makes a bit of money it is <Col N="1272" /> immediately taken by the State and there is no method of saving or providing for the future.  It has been claimed by the State that it should set up a series of social services of all kinds which, of course, are meant to take the place of what in the old days we knew as the individual's provision for the future for himself and his family.  The State has a duty to provide for the weak and the maimed and the mentally deficient, people who cannot help themselves and our social services should be directed to them. We all have a duty to pay our taxes to provide social and medical services of all kinds for this sort of people, but when it comes to the point of every man, woman and child in the nation being provided for, it merely creates a feckless race of people, prepared to sit down and wait for things to be done for them.</P>
    <P>The greatest incentive in life&mdash;even in the spiritual life&mdash;is that if you do not fight you are not going to get the rewards.  There is a feeling growing up here, taken of course from other countries, that the State should be the provider for everybody, whether they work or not.  That has the inevitable result we see in England to-day, that the people who provide the means for this are becoming fewer and the people on the receiving side are becoming more numerous.  For that reason, I welcome the fact that in this inter-Party Government we have a Labour Party, a very sensible Labour Party, though it is sometimes thrown out at them as a jibe: &ldquo;Here in this State we are getting reduced taxation: what does labour think of that?&rdquo;  The fact is that labour is getting a reasonable supply of social services, but that is being done at the same time as we are reducing taxation.  How is it done? It is done by cutting out unnecessary and extravagant expenditure by the Government which could be better undertaken by ordinary individuals in the community.  I think that is the ideal state and not only ideal but just commonsense.</P>
    <P>Most of the taxation that is taken from trade and industry at the present rate is in most cases taken really from capital.  The rate is really too high. There should be some differentiation <Col N="1273" /> in taxation between profits distributed and profits which are ploughed back into business.  Business, both manufacturing and distributing, is suffering from under-capitalisation.  It is not always possible to put in new money. In most cases there is only one way&mdash; by putting it in out of profits earned. I do not think anyone would disagree with the view that there is too much money taken away in taxation of so-called profits&mdash;I say so-called, because they are not real profits&mdash;with the result that there is really not enough money being allowed to industry for the replacement of machinery and for modernisation.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter referred to the necessity for exports by our manufacturers. I met some of those American E.C.A. people who were over here recently and we were talking about exports.  They all agreed&mdash;and it is quite clear to anyone who looks at our industries here to-day&mdash;that we are completely out of date in the things we are producing.  Even this question of protection has not been properly examined: tariffs and quotas are being put on without proper examination. The whole approach to our industrial programme is from the manufacturer's point of view.  This is an unpopular thing to say, but it is only too true.  We have the wrong approach completely in our industrial life in regard to manufacture. I am in the distributing trade. I have been president of the Distributive Trades Association for several years in the past and I am very closely in touch with them; but never once in the past 20 years have I or anyone associated with me, as far as I can remember, been asked by a manufacturer, before he went into production, to give him advice as to what he should produce.  He has bought machinery and gone gaily into production of a particular item and then brought it to be distributed and sold.  Very often, to his surprise, he has found it is very hard to sell.  He then proceeds to complain, to blame the people, to say that there is a prejudice against Irish goods and that people will not buy his things, because they love the foreign article or because there is dumping.</P>
    <P>In the modern State&mdash;as is done in <Col N="1274" /> America&mdash;if you want to manufacture goods the very first thing to do is to make a reconnaissance of the market, to find out what the people want.  The best people to tell you that are the people who have to sell goods to the consumer.  I think I am right in saying that, on the whole, our manufacturers often make the goods and then try to force them on the market.  There is a terrific market here for goods of all kinds, both textile and otherwise, and if manufacturers would first of all make a survey of what is required by the public and then go off and make the goods, they would find it much easier to sell them.  I would go so far as to say that they will never have any success in the export market unless they first of all decide what markets they are going to invade, then go to those markets and find out what is wanted and then come back and try to make it.  That is the only way.  If that small piece of advice of mine is taken, I feel that you will have a new era in both home sales of Irish-manufactured goods and in the export market.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a small suggestion to the Minister.  I think he has done a very good job of work in reducing the standard rate of income-tax by 6d.  If you want to measure the degree of that act, you need only mention it to people in England to-day that our taxation has been reduced by 6d. and they look at you in amazement and say that you must have a wonderful Government.  There is no doubt about that and it cannot be denied.  That is a great incentive to the individual taxpayer and to the businessman to work on and to hope for bigger and better reliefs next year; and I foresee the Exchequer getting even bigger sums if we proceed in that direction.  I would recommend to the Minister to consider some arrangement whereby taxation would not be levied on undrawn profits, even if it is at the expense of distributed profits.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like once more to welcome the continuation of the trend which was begun last year and I hope that, when we meet next year, we will find this trend further accentuated.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with Senator McGuire in complimenting <Col N="1275" /> the Minister on reducing income-tax to 6/6; if he has officially reduced it he has at the same time put on other burdens.  I do not agree with the congratulations for the Minister on the reduction because when all the hidden taxation is taken into consideration we will find we have an income-tax rate, not of 6/6, but of 7/-in the £.  The local authorities have had to meet additional rates because of the withholding of grants and these things should also be considered in discussing the income-tax rate.  If the taxation which the Minister is collecting for the sugar, butter and flour, over and above the controlled price, plus the withholding of the grants from the local authorities, is taken into account, then we will find the income-tax rate much higher than 6/6.</P>
      <P>I think most local authorities are asking for increased grants from the Transition Development Fund for the erection of houses.  These grants have not been increased for some years while the prices for building materials and the costs of erection have gone up considerably, leaving the local authorities to meet an additional burden which is becoming unbearable.  The Minister and the Government should consider increasing the Transition Development Fund grants.  Thousands of houses are to be erected and until this matter has been faced, I do not think the local authorities can continue to bear the burden imposed on them in meeting the deficiency between the grants and the actual costs.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister will find very much money by the tax on dancing and the costs of collection will not be worth the return.</P>

      <P>I do not believe the people in the country look with favour on this tax and you will find increased difficulty in collecting it.  I do not believe there is such an easing off in the production either in the factories or on the land as has been suggested during this discussion and candidly I was surprised to hear Labour representatives say that if a manufacturer wants protection, he goes to the workers and tells them that unless they get protection from the Government, he will have to dismiss them.  I believe that to be the worst form of blackmail and I have yet to learn of anyone in this country, who was associated with the Irish-Ireland movement, ever having any objection to a reasonable protection being given.  I think the workers of Ireland are reluctant to allow themselves to be used in that way.  I do not know a lot about the city but I do know that the workers in rural Ireland, whether in the factories or on the land, give a fair return for the money they get.  On the whole, I think as far as producers are concerned, whether they are employer or employee, they give a fair return for what they earn.</P>

      <P>I rise to refute Senator McGuire's analogy between the functions of Government and the functions of direction of a business firm.  I must oppose his views on this matter and in the course of doing so, I may have to speak some platitudes. I hope neither this House nor the Minister would ever accept such an ideal as that expounded by Senator McGuire.  The function of most business firms is to make as much money as possible for a limited group of people by buying cheap and selling dear.  The function of the Government is to achieve the greatest feasible good for the whole body of the people entrusted to their care.  It is only because I believe that the Minister acts on that <Col N="1277" /> principle for the common good that I have confidence in him.  In the 13th chapter of the Epistles to the Romans, the Apostle Saint Paul said that the tax gatherers are the ministers of God. No further comment is needed on that. I believe that the only, and the best, incentive to work is an opportunity to share in the full profits of one's work.</P>

      <P>A variety of matters has been raised during this discussion and I do not propose taking up the time of the Senators in going into all the matters in detail.  As usual, I will open with the official <i>caoiner</i> of the Party, Senator Hawkins.  I have often wondered how he can deviate so much from everything in the way of accuracy; but his performance this afternoon was the worst or, possibly, from some points of view, the best I have ever listened to.  I could content myself with taking a number of his statements and just denying them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator said that this is a huge sum.  I have already commented in the Dáil on this matter but it certainly comes well from the Senator who upheld a Government that imposed additional taxation year after year.  He talks about a huge sum of £8,000,000. That is an assault on the truth.  How does the Senator reconcile that viewpoint of his with the view put forward by an official speaker of his Party in the other House?  Last year the tax on beer and tobacco was removed and the estimated loss to the Exchequer, and the remission to the people, under these heads was £6,000,000.  This year there is a loss, through the remission in respect of income-tax, of £1,000,000 on the standard rate in a full year, and the other aids or remissions given will certainly cost another £250,000 in a full year.  Those taxes have been removed, and, if the Senator is of the view that I put forward new taxes bringing in £15,000,000, I should like to know what they are.  He could give me the headings quite easily, but he must get some extra impositions to the extent of £15,000,000 if he is correct in saying that I have increased taxation <Col N="1278" /> by £8,000,000, when I say that I have, through three major remissions, withdrawn £7,000,000 and a bit from the revenue.</P>
    <P>The statement that staggered me most, however, was his next&mdash;that subsidies had been reduced by £8,000,000. That is not merely an assault on truth &mdash;it is an assassination of truth.  Subsidies have been reduced by £8,000,000! I do not know how the Senator can say that sort of thing without being ashamed of himself.  No subsidies have been withdrawn to any such extent. Last year there were subsidies in connection with oatmeal, margarine and certain provisions with regard to farmers' butter, but there was not £300,000 in the whole thing.  Yet that was magnified up to this figure he mentioned.</P>
    <P>He also says that no provision is made at the moment for extra work in the country.  That is the handiest and most talented performance with the truth that I have ever listened to.  The Senator must know that the &ldquo;under the line&rdquo; expenditure this year, on the tot given in this White Paper, amounts to £12,630,000.  The figures last year were £9,113,000.  If the Senator had given attention to the explanatory matter provided on 4th May when I was introducing the Financial Resolutions, he would know that £12,630,000 does not represent the full tot, because there are to be added to that, under the heading of the Local Loans Fund, an amount of £1? millions out of the Transition Development Fund and something more than £500,000 through the ploughing back of certain payments coming in.  Instead of a sum of £2,800,000 being available for the Local Loans Fund and, through it, for housing, there is a sum of £5,000,000, as well as £1,000,000 on the Vote for Local Government.  In addition, the Electricity Supply Act moneys, which are stated here to be £4,750,000, are really about £1,000,000 more, because they also get certain moneys back which they are ploughing back into development.</P>
    <P>I made the calculation in the Dáil&mdash; I can give the detailed figures here, if required&mdash;that the sum set down as £12,630,000 is, in reality, about <Col N="1279" /> £16,000,000 and that leaves out of account altogether any money under the land reclamation project.  An Estimate for that will be taken one of these days and I think it will be for the sum of £1,000,000.  It was thought at one time as being likely to be about £4,000,000 and it can be increased to £4,000,000, if the work is to be done, but there is at least £17,000,000 available immediately and that is to be compared with a figure of £9,000,000 last year, and it is also to be compared with a sum of £5,000,000 which was the best Fianna Fáil could do in their last year and with £2,000,000 in the year before their last.  In face of that, is it credible that anybody can assert in this House that no provision is made for extra work for the provision of employment?</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Senator must agree that not merely are these sums there but that two further things have been done, one of which is that the wages and salaries payable to workers have been increased.  I have made this statement, and I find it accepted, that the extra emoluments now secured by workers have equated the increase in the cost of living since 1939.  That was not the case in February, 1948, so that in the matter of the incentive of having at least a wage which, measured by the cost of living index figure, bears some relation to the wages paid in 1939, we have achieved that position, and we have achieved it without any increase in the cost of living.  No doubt, there was considerable danger attendant on what was done last year.  Deputy de Valera had announced as his policy in the autumn of 1947 the reimposition of a Standstill Order in wages.  That policy was not pursued.  The policy was pursued of allowing wages to find their level under a particular agreement made and by submissions to the Labour Court.  That, with the provision of these extra moneys which were made available, undoubtedly might have caused a certain amount of inflation or&mdash;to put it another way&mdash;might have stopped a deflationary process from taking place.  But the cost of living has not risen.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins is probably better aware than most people in the House <Col N="1280" /> that the cost of living was fictitiously arranged by the previous Government. There was a Government decision which was announced in the Trade Journal of 1947 that, under the direction of the Government, certain things which used to be weighted in the calculation of the cost of living figure had been removed from that calculation. These were the things the previous Government had taxed, so that they taxed and then did not let the effect of the taxation be shown in the cost of living figure.  But taking the old cost of living figure which has been replaced by this new one, which has not yet got great currency, the old figure was brought down by at least ten points in the first year of the present Government.</P>
    <P>I suggest that to have done three things at the same time&mdash;to have enabled wages and emoluments to rise and to have given increases in wages and allowances in relation to servants of the State and anybody under the control of the State, to have made money available for development purposes and to have maintained the cost of living even at the old figure, much less reduce it considerably beyond the old figure, was no small achievement and it ought all to have helped in the keeping of people in employment, and in employment in this country.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins is worried about emigration, and has spoken in the usual derisory way of the Emigration Commission&mdash;there is no necessity for it because everybody knows the answer to the question: Why are people leaving this country?  On that, it has to be remembered, that, in July, 1947, Deputy de Valera, replying in the Dáil to the debate on the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach, expressed his view about emigration in this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The most important question was that of emigration, but, when they had done the best they could, the drift from the land to the towns or abroad would continue.  There was no other way for it.  There had been that steady drain since the Famine and perhaps it was a tendency they could not stop.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Senator <Col N="1281" /> Hawkins thinks that that is the answer to the problem of emigration.</P>
    <P>The Government, however, were moved on to a further consideration of the matter in December of 1947 and a memorandum was submitted to the Cabinet on 15th December, 1947, by the Department of Social Welfare.  It was under the not very attractive heading: &ldquo;Restrictions on Emigration to Employment.&rdquo;  The document was a warning to the Government that the British Government would remove certain conditions they had imposed on people going to Great Britain from this country in relation to the question of visas.  It said that no visas will be necessary for entry to Great Britain but that an identity document such as a travel permit card or travel identity card will be required.  It said that it is understood that some 170,000 of these documents have been issued to men since September, 1939, and that as long as those 170,000 permits were in the hands of those 170,000 men there was not much chance of preventing some of these from getting out.</P>
    <P>Emigration from Ireland to Employment. The document continues: &ldquo;The present arrangements for regulating emigration will, in these circumstances, cease to be effective.&rdquo;  In a later paragraph it says that the Minister had gone on to consider whether the situation could be met by refusing emigration facilities to persons in certain defined occupations, e.g., those with experience of agriculture or turf production.  They put that forward as a suggestion but the suggestion was turned down.  In paragraph 4 we read that the Minister says he would have difficulty in suggesting a return to this arrangement particularly as numbers of such workers already had permission to go&mdash;that even if he did attempt to go back to the old restriction, that is, make it as nearly illegal and impossible as could be to prevent them from leaving this country, regulations would be futile as long as 170,000 persons had travel cards.  The document goes on to point out that, having considered the situation, &ldquo;the Minister for Social Welfare is of opinion that in the situation which will follow the cessation of the British visa requirement the alternative to the introduction of legislation <Col N="1282" /> which would forbid emigration except under a system of permits with penalties in case of unauthorised emigration and with provision for deposit of a substantial sum in cases, for example, of visits to Great Britain refundable on return, is the elimination of emigration regulation or restrictions.&rdquo; The Minister submitted the matter to the Government for direction. The only question was whether they would remove the restrictions on emigration.  Having come to that, which was not a very satisfactory conclusion&mdash;it can hardly be said that it was the answer to the problem of people emigrating&mdash;we read in paragraph 8:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Apart from the immediate problem dealt with so far in this memorandum the Minister is of opinion that the effect of emigration on the present and future population trends here, more particularly in view of the influence here of the population changes anticipated in the relatively near future in Great Britain, is a matter which would repay careful examination.  He accordingly suggests that the Government might consider the appointment of a commission with wide terms of reference which would examine the population position and probable developments as influenced by various factors of which emigration is one.  If this be agreed in principle the constitution and terms of reference of such a commission would be the subject of a further submission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senators will remember the date of this document&mdash;15th December, 1947. The note I have at the top is that it was withdrawn until further notice. The elections, of course, were on at the time.  It would not have done for the Government to say that that was their method of facing this serious problem of unemployment which, as Mr. de Valera said, was a trend which had been steady since the Famine and perhaps one that could not stop.  Then there was the question of the establishment of a commission with wide terms of reference which, I am sure Senator Hawkins would agree, would mean wide delay before the submission of the report.  However, the matter <Col N="1283" /> was withdrawn until further notice. The people responsible for that are not in a strong position when they criticise the establishment of a commission to investigate certain things.</P>
    <P>Senators also protested against any allegation being made that some work people in this country are to be described as work shy.  I am afraid that that is the situation and that it has been revealed to two Governments that some fraction of the population is work shy.  I have occasionally spoken about the profits certain industrialists made.  That statement was immediately transformed into a statement that all industrialists had been profiteers.  I am quite certain that when I say simply that some of the workers in this country had been revealed to be work shy in the <i>Irish Press</i> tomorrow it will be said that I said all the workers are work shy.  I have not said that but I do say that some are. My colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce has indicated quite publicly and he has information from Bord na Móna that there are 15 county areas in which Bord na Móna have work for people and in only three of these county areas have they enough men.  I gave in Dáil Eireann, and it is important enough to repeat here, the story with regard to the attempted recruitment of labourers for employment on the Erne Scheme in Bally-shannon. People were interviewed at four Garda Stations.  I take that to mean employment areas where the Garda Station is taken as a centre. The people to whom attention was specially directed were the single men, under 45 years of age, without dependents. The emolument offered was 88/-.  It was stated that board and lodging could be had around Bally-shannon at 33/- per week.  If that were available it meant that after providing for board and lodging a man had 55/- left.  Certain reference was made to single men who had people to look after but, in the main, single men without dependents and under 45 years of age were interviewed.</P>
    <P>At one Garda station 54 men were interviewed and offered work&mdash;one accepted.  At another Garda station 90 <Col N="1284" /> men were interviewed and offered work &mdash;nobody accepted.  In a third station 80 men were interviewed and offered work&mdash;six accepted.  In a fourth station 95 men were interviewed and offered work&mdash;one accepted.  Eight out of a total of 319!  It is said that a few people pleaded circumstances such as aged and infirmed relatives who needed attention&mdash;a few I do not say that that is typical.  I do not put that forward as a picture of the whole country but it is remarkable that in four areas marked out by four Garda stations in one part of the country only eight of 319 people could be got to work.</P>

      <P>That is one county, as far as my knowledge of geography goes.  I am looking at the names of various places but I think they are one county.  May I say in addition to that that transport was offered to these men by bus to the site and it was not a question of being sent to an offer of any short time employment because a long term of employment was offered? That cannot be any great news to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, certainly not to any of those who were in touch with any of their Ministers prior to the change of Government.  I have previously referred here to a conference on turf production which was held on the 9th April, 1947, which the then Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, attended to open the proceedings.  It was a time when a great drive was on to get increased turf production, a time when there was a good deal of panic and scare with regard to fuel in this country and a special effort was made.  All the county engineers and county surveyors in the Twenty-Six Counties were summoned down and the matter was put on a high level by having the then Taoiseach open the proceedings.  After he made an address to them in the morning pointing out the importance of turf development and putting to them that the future of the country with regard to fuel supplies was at stake and using every argument that could be used to impress upon them the necessity for this work and the urgency of the situation, the then <Col N="1285" /> Taoiseach handed over the conference to the then Minister for Local Government and the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary opened by asking every person to offer his views frankly on the problem which was to get the same number of men to produce a greater quantity of turf in a shorter time.  He said to them: &ldquo;Do everything you can&mdash;piecework where possible&mdash;also altering the method of producing turf by private producers&mdash; contract system.  Overtime.&rdquo;  He said to them to do anything to get these men to work, and having made his very emotional and persuasive appeal he then threw the ball to the various representatives of the county councils who were around.  One man opened by saying that there was a point which he did not like to mention in the morning in connection with the turf programme, that is, the unwillingness of some men to come out and work.  &ldquo;We had one district last year, Mr. Minister, in which we could not get the men to work.  Most of those men are on the dole all the winter.  Last year when we asked them to come out and cut turf they refused.  I reported this to the labour exchange and all I got was an acknowledgment.  There was no action taken&mdash;an extraordinary thing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The text gets a bit stacato here: &ldquo;disinclination&mdash;people do not want to work any longer&mdash;too many social services&rdquo;.  The Minister asked why he had not mentioned that in the morning.  The engineer said that he was afraid of hitting at Government policy.  The Minister said: &ldquo;If people refuse to work it is up to us to see that these people are not kept in idleness.&rdquo; The engineer retorted: &ldquo;I gave particulars of these cases in writing to the labour exchange on five or six different occasions.&rdquo;  The Minister said: &ldquo;I will see that this does not occur this year,&rdquo; and asked if he had copies of the correspondence.  The engineer said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  Another said that he had the same thing.  He got a grant, he said, and there were plenty of men unemployed but they would not come out to work. &ldquo;First they could not walk the two and a half miles.  When a lorry was provided they could not work unless they were paid every Saturday.&rdquo; Another man took up then, saying: <Col N="1286" />&ldquo;Mine is not quite the same experience. There is a general tendency to avoid coming out to work at all.  If that is to be cured I do not think it can be done by dealing with individual cases but by a thorough investigation of the whole administrative side of paying doles.  There seems to be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The text is blotted here but the only word that will fit in the context is &ldquo;conspiracy&rdquo;.  &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;between dolemen, guards, labour exchange whereby men can continue drawing dole and do not turn up for a recognised job.  I can prove it&mdash;men working for farmers and others&mdash;possibly guards&mdash;at reduced rates.  There is grave abuse...&rdquo; This goes on until finally the Minister said: &ldquo;Can I say it is a fairly general experience?&rdquo;  All: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  I could give the detailed statement of these men.  That is the situation.  One man came to the point when he said that the only way you can get men to work on the bog is to stop every other Government work, work under the Office of Public Works, on the improvement of estates, anything in the nature of Government work.  &ldquo;Put the old stimulus of hunger upon these people.&rdquo;  That was the recommendation made to the then Minister for Local Government and backed by statements and correspondence showing that work was offered and had not been taken.  Let me say that I only give those examples to show that there definitely is abuse with regard to unemployment assistance. It seems fairly widespread and two Governments have had much the same experience with regard to people refusing offers of good employment.  It looks, as far as that document is concerned, that that is a situation which has developed over the past 15 years, that people did not regard unemployment assistance as what people got when they were looking for work and unable to find it but as an aid to the wages they got from some other type of work.  That is more widespread than to have people sitting back and refusing work and living on what the unemployment assistance amounted to.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins referred to increased productivity and I am glad that Senator O'Dwyer who also spoke on the matter is behind him.  Senator <Col N="1287" /> Hawkins said that the producer who is producing more is no better off than he was before.  That is not the experience of the people in this House who come from rural areas.  The producer is better off but if the producer thinks that he is going to get under conditions of increased production scarcity prices which he was able to demand when goods were scarce he should think again.  Senator O'Dwyer came to a conclusion quite different from Senator Hawkins.  He said that prices of products should be kept at a steady level and that is a sensible demand but let there be no mistake. Nobody offers, nobody could think of offering to the producers of this country the prices they were able to command during the war at a time when the stuff they were producing was very scarce.  But the producer is better off in taking lower prices for increased production.  Is not that what is required? It gives the community cheaper goods and should give, in fact gives, the producer a better return. The producers of this country are getting a better return and I doubt if that can be gainsaid.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins complained about the housing question.  Some complaints could be easily swept aside by saying that he tolerated them for 14 years. He said that there were too many Departments, that there should be a national housing board and so on.  It may be that there is to much division of authority with regard to this, but I do not think that much good would come as a result of a national housing board.  In the main, one Department attends to housing and it was regarded by the late Minister for Local Government as such an important matter that he asked to have a Parliamentary Secretary allocated to him so that either the Parliamentary Secretary or himself could give what amounted to full time to the question of housing. As far as money is concerned, all that alarms me is the amount of money that has been made available for housing. Five million pounds have been expended this year alone together with the £1,000,000 which is to be found in the Vote for the Department of Local Government together with whatever <Col N="1288" /> funds may be got by such bodies as Dublin Corporation and Cork Corporation and put into housing.</P>
    <P>There is an abundance of money and I understand that the wages paid to skilled tradesmen in housing bear very favourable comparison with what they can get abroad.  I do not know what a Government can do except provide funds, see that some man gives what amounts to full time attention to the co-ordination of the effort and seeing that things run smoothly and see that wages are at an attractive level.  If housing does not proceed apace, certainly Government activity is not to be blamed for it.</P>
    <P>The Senator astonished me even at this late point when I thought I had gone beyond astonishment when he said that Electricity Supply Board charges had been raised.  Perhaps this statement came out in the swing of his oratory but he said that Electricity Supply Board charges had been raised. The Senator concluded by saying that people were being asked to pay more for less services.  In fact, the reverse is the case: they are paying less for more widespread services and services of more use.  They are not being asked to pay for certain services which I was rather fortunate to have the opportunity of cutting out of existence last year, things like the transatlantic air service.  Finally, the Senator wanted to know whether I could promise that there would be no Supplementary Estimate and alluded to Gaeltacht housing.  The Estimate for that has been introduced already and was provided for and specially mentioned in the speech I made on the 4th May and was taken into account when the level of taxation was being arranged this year.</P>
    <P>With regard to other comments that have been made, I agreed with Senator J.T. O'Farrell when he said that taxation is at the highest point for safety.  I think there is a welcome change in the Opposition attitude.  At least, I get an echo from Senator Mrs. Concannon that she, at least, from that side of the House, welcomes the air of economy.  There seems to be a far different feeling in the air, and a disinclination to smite the taxpayer as they wanted to do last year.  In fact, <Col N="1289" /> their complaint this year is of our not having reduced taxation sufficiently. That is astonishing, as last year the whole pursuit was after me with regard to every small item of economy. The aim which I have held out as attractive in Dáil Eireann and hold out still is that we ought to leave the ordinary person with more money in his pocket to spend as he likes and not take it from him to be spent by the State to give him services he may not desire or may not want, or may consider too expensive.</P>
    <P>Senator J.T. O'Farrell questioned this whole matter of the clamour for tariffs and said that the ordinary excuse was dumping.  It is not the only excuse.  In the minds of certain people, every import ought to be classified as a dumped import.  The other term that has lost its old significance is &ldquo;competition&rdquo;. There is no competition nowadays except &ldquo;cut-throat competition&rdquo;, so that when people are approached by manufacturers who say they are subject to cut-throat competition and to dumping, it is pressure of a type that amounts to blackmail.  It is very specially to be characterised as blackmail when it goes to the extent it got to about last Christmas-time, when two very well-to-do manufacturers, people making very well out of two companies, locked out their workers in Christmas week and used them as pressure on the Government with regard to the tariff.  Then, as Senator O'Farrell stated, after they had achieved that, they proceeded to distribute a whole lot of their shares by way of a bonus issue.</P>
    <P>I think I have answered Senator Burke when he spoke of keeping an unemployment register giving a reflection of the real unemployed in the country.  We are aiming at that, but there will have to be a certain amount of harshness shown regarding people who got into bad habits in the last 14 or 15 years.  Senator Burke referred to revaluation.  I would ask the Seanad to take it that I have nothing to do with that.  It is done by a particular Department which has its own rules and regulations.  The initiative ordinary is taken by the local authority and when premises are revalued <Col N="1290" /> there is always resort to the courts. If a person thinks he is too highly valued, he can go to the courts and get the independent judiciary to consider whether the increased valuation is proper or not.  When the courts are considering the matter, one of the standards&mdash;I do not say the only standard, but certainly an important one&mdash;is the valuation of premises in the neighbourhood of the building under criticism.  I think the code is as fair as anybody could get, but if anyone likes to offer criticism, we can have it considered.</P>
    <P>Senator Seamus O'Farrell spoke of the incentive to work.  I have associated myself with that viewpoint for a long time.  There is not much in asking people to work harder if they do not get any personal benefit from the extra effort.  There is a warning there in connection with the amenities and social services the Government is asked to provide.  The view expressed by Senator Concannon has been expressed recently in Dáil Eireann by Deputy de Valera, that you may easily get to the point when you kill incentive, when you leave a man with certain facilities and amenities and services which he can get if he is idle and the difference between that and what he may get by hard, laborious, intensive work may not be sufficient to encourage him to do the hard work.  I have discussed this with representatives of trade unions.  I was surprised that one scheme suggested to the Congress of Irish Unions brought their retort that it required full employment and directed labour.  The particular example I gave showed that a particular scheme had been inaugurated at a time when there was nothing like full employment and certainly no direction of labour.  I was hoping those representatives would reconsider that matter and see if they could put pressure on some of the firms enjoying very heavy tariff protection to give the workers who share in production a chance, and let it be worked through trial and error, to see if anything could be got out of it.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer Senators to the Official Report of Dáil Eireann for 24th June, 1949.  It contains a speech made on the Vote for the Office of the <Col N="1291" /> Minister for Social Welfare by Deputy de Valera, recently Taoiseach.  Senators will be debating social services one of these days and I would like them to inform themselves of what has been said by Deputy de Valera.  It is given in column 1462 and onwards, and I am summarising part of it.  He said that, in our whole approach to this subject, there will arise the question of what is reasonably possible and what is wise. He goes on to point out that the producing section of this community compared with other communities is relatively small.  He takes it for granted that all the means for the provision of social services have to come out of production in some form or another.  He speaks of the possibility that you may so strain a small section engaged in production, by loading too heavy burdens on them, that you will fail to get production and in the end cause a breakdown in the whole state of society, by attempting to go too fast or to give too much.</P>
    <P>Having said that on the matter of what is possible, he also said that there is the question of wisdom.  On that point, he says that we would all admit it would be very unwise not to leave the ordinary incentives to the individual to do the best he can for himself. He continues: &ldquo;I think everybody will admit that there is a danger that, if the community as a whole makes it almost as valuable to the individual to be idle as to work, the natural incentive to work would disappear.&rdquo;  He returns to that later, in column 1464, and points out that &ldquo;we have always to be careful to see that there is a reasonable margin between the reward he gets for work and the sum that is given to the individual by the State to maintain him because he is not at work.&rdquo;  Later, he comes very nearly to the point of saying that the best solution would be to recognise people as members of a State who were prepared to do their work in the State, to do their duty as citizens, to play their part in production, and to guarantee to them, by the State a certain minimum, irrespective of the individual it was.  That gets very near to the point I have urged here, that the best way of having social services in any community is to let <Col N="1292" /> people provide them for themselves by giving them sufficient wages, instead of letting them depend on the State. However, all this is a very big breakaway from the talk about social services for many years.  I think that quotation answers what Senator Colgan said here.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas requested information on taxation.  I have not that material at hand at the moment.  He queried the rate of interest in taxation and how it bears upon people and the effective rate of tax on certain incomes. He will find a good deal about that in the Annual Reports of the Revenue Commissioners.  The one I have here is the 24th Report, for 1947, on page 112 of which the relative taxes on certain incomes are given.  Senator Douglas has spoken of the person on £600 a year.  Taking what can be regarded in this country as the average, the married man with a family of three and where the income is all earned, the effective rate of tax is 3½d. in the £ on him.  On £600, he would pay about £9.  It is interesting to note that in Great Britain a man in his position would pay £28 10s. 0d.  I have not the other figures the Senator requested at the moment, but if they are required I can get them at a later date.</P>
    <P>Other comments have been made with regard to increasing taxation on certain people and those described as the wealthy class.  The trouble is that, in this country, from the tax-gatherers' point of view, there are not many of that class, there is no great class in this country from which we can draw to provide for smaller people.  I feel embarrassed by Senator Burke's argument that, because a rural worker gets £4 a week, he does not pay tax and gets no benefit from the reduction in income-tax.  I cannot meet that point, except to say that when taxation is lowered he will get whatever remission there may be.  It is not possible to have for each group a special remission that touches the group each year.  Probably the rural worker smokes and takes a glass of beer and, if so, he got what is, from the revenue point of view, a very heavy remission in respect of these taxes last year.</P>
    <P>Looking at the general picture and <Col N="1293" /> coming to my own view, I would like to remind Senators of the situation that faced us in 1947.  I have already quoted from Deputy de Valera's statement that emigration has been there as a trend since the famine and that perhaps nothing can be done about it. Speaking on the 2nd July, quoted in the Press on the 3rd July, 1947, he said that agriculture was a problem and that a consistent decline in the numbers engaged in our basic industry raised a question as to whether there was any solution to it or whether it was a natural decline.  He faced the Dáil and said: &ldquo;If anyone can give us a solution to the difficulties of agriculture, we will consider it.&rdquo;  That is what passed for policy in July, 1947.  I do not think people can say of the present Government that they paraded themselves in Dáil Eireann and said: &ldquo;If you can give us a policy, we will consider it.&rdquo;  We have tried to do something on our own, and we have been fairly successful so far.</P>
    <P>I have a quotation from the <i>Irish Times</i> of October, 1947.  I choose the <i>Irish Times</i> deliberately as they had a most spectacular headline indicating the then Taoiseach's aspect: &ldquo;Taoiseach tells Dáil that Wages are to be Pegged.&rdquo;  That was the policy of October, 1947.  Underneath that headline is the report that the Government wanted to control wages so that they could have a general fixation of prices such as was in operation from November, 1943, to October, 1947. That is the period in which, in the main, distortion was caused to the lives of the community by having a particular stand-still in regard to wages and very far from a stand-still in regard to prices.</P>
    <P>In September, 1947, one of the Parliamentary Secretaries of the last Government returned to this country from a tour in certain parts of Europe and decided to tell the people of Lanesboro in County Longford of the wisdom he had derived from his sojourn on the Continent.  I raised the question a few times in Dáil Eireann and, as far as I could make out, his speech was to be regarded as an official statement of policy.  He said quite a lot that was somewhat enigmatic, but <Col N="1294" /> he made one very precise statement. He spoke of heavy subsidies involving heavy taxation as being a vicious principle because it was merely a pretence in the long run.  That was a speech made in September, 1947.  I put it in contrast in Dáil Eireann to the policy that was adopted in October, 1947, when the then Government came in with their only policy, as revealed to the House in the Supplementary Budget, an adoption of this &ldquo;vicious principle&rdquo;&mdash;increased taxation, mainly on beer, spirits and tobacco; and subsidies.  I am asked in the House&mdash;it is put as a double-barrelled sort of argument&mdash;to increase the subsidies, or at least to allow bread and other commodities to go off the ration but to keep them at subsidised prices.  I suggest that we have followed a policy which is better than either of the two policies paraded here.</P>
    <P>We have kept a ration which is generous&mdash;certainly, which is sufficient. I do not think there is any complaint on that point, regarding any of the things rationed at the moment.  We have kept those, at a very heavy cost to the rest of the community by subsidies, but we have released certain extras and said to people: &ldquo;If you have more money to spend and like to pay a higher price, we will use the fruits of what we get from you to keep taxation in line.&rdquo;  I cannot see how that policy can meet with disagreement. I could imagine comment being made if the ration were not generous or if the rationed food were not of good quality, but I assert that both these conditions are met, that the quantity is generous and that the material being subsidised is of good quality.</P>
    <P>I would like to get this matter of taxation and aids into some sort of proper perspective.  I want to claim again that before the 1948 Budget the Government of which I am a member reduced the taxation on beer and tobacco at a loss of £6,000,000 to the revenue.  I do not think I am wrong in saying that this year the reduction in income-tax has cost the Revenue £1,000,000.  Certain other concessions are being made in connection with <Col N="1295" /> income-tax this year which will cost in a full year £500,000.  I find myself then in the position that £7,250,000 of taxation have been put back into the hands of the people to spend as they chose.  While that was being done additional amounts were given to old age pensioners and that cost the Revenue £2,400,000.  In addition civil servants got increased emoluments under an agreement which was left to me which cost the taxpayer £700,000 in a year.  Last year the increased tea ration had cost £1,500,000 to the taxpayers. This year various aids and increases to the Guards and increases to the Army, yet to come, amounted to a total of £750,000 in a year.  Under various other heads there was provision made for almost £1,000,000.  This is a total of £4,350,000 or to use a round figure £4,500,000.  If the Government had in cash these extra aids and increases we would have a further £4,500,000 to play with and we could have reduced taxation by £11,500,000. Instead of reducing taxation by that amount we applied this £7,250,000 and gave these increases.</P>
    <P>At the same time we gave our blessing to a movement going on in the industrial world to increase wages.  We threatened no standstill but we did advise the people to be careful how they spent and not to have too much volume of money in circulation.  While that was going on we have provided in various schemes at least £16,000,0000, leaving out the land reclamation project, for works of a capital nature this year and I do not think it can be denied that production increased in the last 18 months.  On the whole I suggest there is increased productivity, better wages are being paid and better care is being taken, by the provision of increased rates, of those who are infirm and unable to look after themselves. The increased productivity has not reached the volume that we had hoped for.</P>
    <P>There is one last matter to which I would like to make a reference, and that is the question of devaluation. There has been a demand for me to make an authoritative statement on sterling devaluation.  I have been faced <Col N="1296" /> with a number of problems in the last 14 months but this one appals me.  I cannot take on myself the responsibility at this point of making a statement that could be called authoratative. Nobody knows whether devaluation is going to take place and no one can say what percentage the devaluation will be if there is devaluation.  I do not think I attach too much importance to what I might call the ancient enemy of this country when I say that the United Kingdom is in a far more difficult position in this matter than this country. The reserves of the United Kingdom and the position of the United Kingdom in the world have an importance that far surpasses anything that even the most enthused nationalist of this country could claim for it.  Nobody, not even the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the other side, has made an authoritative statement on this subject. Some questions have been asked of the Chancellor as to whether he was assenting to devaluation and were answered by statements of a decidedly negative nature with a certain amount of brusqueness about them.</P>
    <P>There is taking place in Paris at the moment a meeting at which this question is being discussed.  It is only when results emerge from that meeting that the facts will become so clear that policy in this matter of devaluation can be decided.  As I said in the Dáil it is appreciated that there is pressure for the revaluation or devaluation of the £1 and it is dangerous to mislead public opinion by statements of an irresponsible nature such as Senator O'Brien referred to here to-day.  Reading the various newspapers circulating in England I think one can safely conclude that in England a good deal of harm has been done to their situation by some of the newspaper comments that have been made.  In any event, while sterling may be under suspicion at the moment its true position must be recognised.  In the race so far as currency is concerned the dollar has so far outstripped it but outside dollars sterling is the best currency in the world to-day.  Neither the Belgian nor the Swiss currency has anything like the same value or is as widespread a medium as sterling is. <Col N="1297" /> Sterling, whatever may be said about it, is an important currency and many countries have to regard it as hard currency.</P>
    <P>As to whether devaluation will take place, to what extent it will go and, more particularly, what is to be done in this country in face of a revaluation or devaluation, is an entirely different matter and so full of hypotheses that I do not think anybody can, with reason, ask me to go through all the various circumstances that might arise.  I should like to associate myself, in the main, with what Senator O'Brien said.  I might put a note of interrogation here and there, mainly on matters of history, but I do not think that anybody could ask me to make a better statement than that which has come from the Senator.  There may be a debate on this hereafter&mdash;not a very useful type of debate&mdash;in which the question will be raised as to whether, following Senator O'Brien's line, if we had been wiser in 1926 or 1936 or 1939, other and better arrangements might not have been made.  I am sure that those who accept the present situation and regard it as almost inevitable will say that that position arose through circumstances of history and our economic relations with Britain.  In any event, whatever the reason, this country has now to accept the position that the greater part of its assets held foreign are sterling assets.  If there was any time at which evasive action could have been taken in connection with sterling, supposing that devaluation had been thought of as a possibility years ago, the only time anything could have been done about it was when there was supposed to be full convertibility as between sterling and dollars.  That was only for a few months in 1947, and, although it was supposed to be full and free convertibility, it only applied to what were called current operations.  That opportunity did not occur in my time or in the time of this Government.  We have to meet whatever change comes as best we can when it does come.</P>
    <P>May I say that it would be rash to conclude that if there should be a revaluation downwards, our assets <Col N="1298" /> abroad would lose a great part of their purchasing power or all their purchasing power.  In relation to the sterling area, there will be little change, if we followed by devaluation here, and, in relation to those areas where sterling at the moment is a desirable currency, there most likely would be no change, because it is to be assumed that the currencies in Western Europe generally will have to suffer their own series of revaluation. So far as what is called the sterling area itself, or the area where sterling is a desirable currency, there need not necessarily be any great change. The question of prices remains outstanding, and there would be considerable difficulty with regard to the price situation.</P>
    <P>The other way in which devaluation would effect the British situation and affect us would be that anything we might have to buy from the dollar areas would be increased in price. Dollar goods would be increased in price seriously or only to a small degree, according to whatever the percentage of devaluation might be.  Again I say that I do not believe anybody can with reason ask me to go into this matter authoritatively or in detail or consider and decide on the many hypothetical situations that may arise. There is this to be mentioned on the other side, that, if dollar imports become dear and particularly if items of foodstuffs which England imports from dollar areas become dear, that might present a better opportunity for producers who could supply substitute goods from this area, where of course there would not be anything like the same currency difficulty.  I have dealt with this matter very hesitatingly because it is not a matter on which anybody but a real expert could pronounce, and I do not put myself forward as a real expert.  I should like to attach myself again to the comments of Senator O'Brien and ask people to read these, with whatever exceptions, minor exceptions, I have made.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke raised a point with regard to the 5 per cent. tax on houses and I am very glad to get the opportunity of clearing up what appears to be a mistake in that connection. <Col N="1299" /> Speaking in Dáil Eireann on 23rd June, I did say, with regard to one of these stamp duties on property, that, at a fairly early date, apart from being driven away from this tax by pressure, I hoped we would get rid of it on our own.  That referred to the 25 per cent. tax and it was only in that connection that I held out any hope of an early remission of the tax, and, even though I did say that then, I do not see how anybody could have believed that I was thinking of removing that tax in a period of weeks or months.  If it is to be taken away, it will be next year&mdash; even the 25 per cent. tax.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other, I ask those Senators, if they are pursued by anybody with the statement that I made a promise, to read column 1308 of the Dáil Debates of 23rd June.  My reference to it is not too happily phrased, but my point of view is made perfectly clear.  I said it was a tax which I would aim at getting rid of, but I went on to say that I hoped that anything I said would not prompt any expectation of getting this remission at an early date.  I said there were quite a number of other things which, to my mind, would have priority and I mentioned the income-tax code, such things <Col N="1300" /> as increased allowances which had to be brought to some better stage of consistency with the present value of money and other matters.  I said that the 5 per cent. tax was one which I hoped would disappear, but that there was no question of its disappearing in weeks or months or years.  I believe that tax will be with us for three or four years yet.  I want to say that because during that debate one Deputy &mdash;a Dublin solicitor Deputy&mdash;had put it to me that a condition of uncertainty with regard to this tax was very bad because people who believed the tax was coming off might refrain from making purchases of house property which they might otherwise indulge in. It was to still that condition that I spoke in this way, but I apparently have only added to the uncertainty. The 25 per cent. tax might come off in a year or two; the 5 per cent. tax, I hope, will come off sometime but I am not even promising that it will come off in a year or two.</P>
