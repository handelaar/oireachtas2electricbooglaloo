      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Waterford Gas Order, 1949, proposed to be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and laid in draft before Seanad Eireann on the 29th day of March, 1949, under sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, be approved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>The City of Waterford Gas Company has made an application to the Minister for Industry and Commerce under Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, and the Gas Regulation (Special Orders) Rules, 1940, for a Special Order to effect certain modifications of the City of Waterford Gas Act, 1898, for the purpose of making better provision for the proper and efficient conduct of the company's undertaking.  The principal objects of the Order are to provide for borrowing powers by mortgage or debenture to the extent of £64,795 12s. 6d., which is the aggregate amount of the paid-up share capital of the company, and to authorise the creation, issue and redemption of debenture stock, the interest being limited to 4 per cent., save with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The immediate purpose for which the new capital is required is to construct trunk mains, instal gas for new housing schemes and to recoup the excess of capital expended over capital issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> The total amount is £46,339.  I should say that that is an estimated figure.</P>
    <P>It is proposed also to create a redemption fund from the profits of the company for the purpose of redeeming the loan, mortgage, debenture or debenture stock raised or created by the company.  Power is also sought to improve the internal management of the company empowering the directors to declare an interim half-yearly dividend without the sanction or direction of a general meeting; to determine the remuneration of the secretary and auditors; and to enable the company to make a minimum charge not to exceed 25/- a quarter where gas is used as a stand-by only on any premises used for trade or business purposes.  It is necessary to apply Sections 23, 24, 25 and 26 of the City of Waterford Gas Act, 1898, with the necessary modifications to the powers of borrowing sought in the draft.</P>
    <P>The draft repeals Section 15 of the City of Waterford Gas Act, 1858, which provides that the quorum of a meeting of directors was three if there were more than three directors, and two when the number of directors did not exceed three; it provides also by article 5 that the quorum for a meeting of directors shall be two.  It is proposed to amend Section 17 of the 1858 Act by changing the date of the ordinary meetings of the company from &ldquo;the month of August&rdquo; to any date &ldquo;not later than the month of November&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Gas Regulation Act, 1920, altered the old and cumbersome procedure whereby statutory gas undertakings were obliged to secure their powers by way of Private Act or Provisional Order confirmed by a Special Act of Parliament, and provided instead that powers or additional powers could be secured by a special Order approved by a resolution of both Houses.</P>
    <P>The procedure, as laid down in the Gas Regulation (Special Orders) Rules, 1940, requires that the draft Order be prepared by the Gas Undertaking, and that full publicity of the intention to apply for the Order, and of the contents of the draft, be given by notices in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and local newspapers. Notification must also be given to the State and to private interests involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="815" /> One month is given for the lodging of objections; the subsequent stages being dealt with in accordance with the Gas Regulation Act, 1920.</P>
    <P>If there are objections, the Minister may order an inquiry, and when the inquiry is completed, if he considers that any modifications or alterations are desirable, he may decline to submit the draft.  In this case, no objections were lodged and consequently there was no inquiry.  Senators may remember that an Order in similar terms was made recently in connection with the Cork Gas Company.</P>
    <P>I move that the Seanad approve of the Order.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very short and very simple Bill entirely for the purpose of dealing with one particular matter. Children under certain circumstances can be committed to a reformatory and in certain circumstances can be committed to an industrial school.  It did happen in the case of children committed to a reformatory and subsequently in connection with children committed to an industrial school that there were cases of girls where there had been sexual contamination of one kind or another or a danger of that and in some cases the authorities of the schools refused to receive them and in other cases declined to retain them in the schools when the general circumstances became known.  In these circumstances a special school was set up which is mentioned in this Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is that, particularly in respect of children who are committed to an industrial school, it will be possible for these children to be sent to the special school referred to in this Bill.  The ages at which children can be sent to a reformatory run from 12 to 17.  There is a certain provision for supervision after the age of 17. Under the original Act of 1908, they are under the supervision of the managers of the school to which they <Col N="816" /> have been committed until they are 19 years of age.  Supervision consists of this, that they are released at 17 into some kind of employment; they are under supervision in that employment and, if circumstances arise that, in the opinion of the management, they still require to be directly looked after they can be brought back to the reformatory for a period not greater than three months.  Then they are put out under supervision again and, under the 1908 Act, they could be kept under that type of supervision and that liability to be brought back to the reformatory until the age of 19.  An amendment to the 1908 Act is respect of that age was made in the 1941 Act and now it is possible to retain supervision and, therefore, to retain power of returning them to the reformatory for a period of three months up to the age of 21.</P>
      <P>The maximum age for retention in an industrial school is 16.  This Bill provides that that age will be raised to 17 and, again under the 1908 Act, it was possible to maintain supervision over an industrial school child until the age of 18.  That was raised to 21 under the 1941 Act.  So, the main provision of this Bill is that, completely retaining untouched and unextended, the main basis on which children can be sent either to a reformatory or industrial school&mdash;the basis being, for reformatory schools, Section 57 of the 1908 Act and, for industrial schools, Section 58 of the School Attendance Act&mdash;a special school is provided here and, with the approval of the managers of that school, certain children that have certain contamination may be sent to this particular school rather than to one of the old reformatories or industrial schools where they might be refused or rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision is maintained that there will be the same control by a local authority.  A child is not committed to an industrial school at the present time unless the local authority has been given an opportunity of appearing at a court or wherever the decision is taken that the child will go to an industrial school and under sub-section 18 of Section 133 of the Act of 1908, there is complete safeguarding of religious rights.  The whole of that fabric is maintained and the only <Col N="817" /> change that is taking place is that 16 years of age, which is the maximum age for keeping a child in an industrial school at the present time, is, in respect of conditions of this kind, raised to 17.  In case it is argued, as, no doubt it can easily be, that 17 is not an age at which children of that particular kind can be regarded as completely free from danger, the supervisory and controlling powers of that Act of 1908 and 1941 remain there until such time as the child is 21 years of age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has stated, the Bill is rather a simple Bill but deals with a very urgent and delicate problem.  It is one, of course, which must be approached with tact and dealt with in a particular manner. We accept the desirability of the segregation of the various types of young people who are sent to various institutions. Apart from provision for the committal of young persons in the ordinary way, I should like to see the making of provision whereby parents who consider that it would be in the interests of their children to be committed to such care as is provided in institutions of this kind would be allowed to send them there voluntarily rather than have them committed by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although it is not within the terms of this Bill, I should like to impress upon the Minister the desirability at some time in the near future of changing the whole system.  I consider it is not good and has not borne good results in the past up to the present to have young people who for one reason or another are committed to industrial schools or reformatories brought before the court and to have them associated with police officers.  That leaves in their young minds&mdash;and in after-life &mdash;something of a disregard for law and order and for the courts in general.  It impairs the respect which one would like to see instilled into young people for our police force and for all the circumstances surrounding their committal to such an institution.  We have reached the stage where we should be able to devise some better system regarding this connection between force and the committal of young people to institutions.  If we did that we would <Col N="818" /> be taking the first step towards creating in their after-lives a greater respect for law and society in general and we would have better citizens.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more contact between the outside world and people committed to those institutions.  I feel quite confident that they are under the best care in the institutions in which they live, that the best medical services are provided for them and educational facilities of every kind, but I feel that during their term in them they feel that they are completely cut away from the outside world, and when the time comes for them to take their place in it they feel that they have not been a part of it.</P>
    <P>I should like to have a representative visiting committee.  There are people in every town and district who have a leaning in that direction and who would take a keen interest in the young people.  When the time would come for them to go out into life these people would also take an interest in them.  They would instil into their young minds that they are part and parcel of out people, that they are sent to the institution for no great crime but only to do what other boys and girls are doing in other schools, preparing themselves for life afterwards and becoming good citizens.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question.  As far as I am aware, only one school, St. Anne's, is mentioned to cater for these young people.  Is there provision for boys and girls?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that the leaving age from industrial schools may be raised to 17 years from 16. What is the position with regard to education?  Is there any provision for those who stay for the extra year to have better than a primary education? Some boys at the age of 13 are quite capable of passing the Primary Certificate Examination.  What is going to happen for the three or four years they remain in an industrial school until they are 17?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that Senators, whatever side of the House <Col N="819" /> they sit, will be of one mind in thanking the Minister for having sought and found a solution for a very difficult and delicate problem.  He has found that solution with the co-operation of a devoted religious congregation who are highly specialised in the training and treatment of girls such as these poor girls with whom this Bill concerns itself, these tragic victims whose plight has worried not only this Minister for Education but his predecessors, and for whom careful, wise and very sympathetic consideration is required to provide a remedy.  I know that this is a simple Bill, dealing only with one particular class and designed to find a remedy for only a particular problem however pressing, but there is always a tendency in the case of an amending Bill to talk a little about the Acts of which it is an amendment. Already Senator Hawkins has made a very useful contribution to that side of the question.  This House has a good record with regard to Children's Bills.  Important amendments were introduced in the 1941 Bill by Senator Hayes which got the support of the other side and which has been very useful.  We look on these children as the wards of the nation and we would like to do what we can for them.  When the Minister has more time he might be able to visit&mdash;though I am sure he has done it already&mdash;certain nuns who have great experience in dealing with the problem involving children in industrial schools and who have some very practical propositions which I am sure he would be glad to receive and consider.  I do not propose to deal with them, but if the Minister is kind enough to let me see him, I would like to make certain suggestions for his consideration.</P>
      <P>St. Anne's Reformatory School, which is mentioned in the Bill, provides only for Catholic children, but the problem also arises in respect of children of other faiths and I would like to know if any provision is made for them.</P>
      <P>That is all I have to say except to thank the Minister and wish Godspeed to him and to the devoted Sisters who are taking on this truly Christ-like task.</P>

      <P>Following Senator Mrs. Concannon, I should like to have from the Minister some statement on the religious safeguards he mentioned. The case, as Senator Concannon remarked, might arise of a Protestant child who wished on religious grounds not to go to a school run by those of another faith.  The Minister has said that there are religious safeguards, but if he will save me the trouble of looking up the Act, I should like to have a statement on that point.  Is there an alternative school of any kind if that problem should arise of people who on religious grounds should prefer to go to a school of their own faith, and, if so, what is that alternative?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this measure as being very useful social legislation, but I feel inclined to ask one or two questions on the matter.  The Minister speaks about reformatories and industrial schools and this new school for the purpose mentioned in the Bill of admitting young girls under certain conditions.  Does the Minister contemplate the corollary which should follow?  We have frequently seen in the papers cases which came before the courts and where there is a question of sex and would the Minister not consider making the punishment fit the crime by bringing before the court the beasts who committed those crimes against those children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may go backwords, I say in reply to Senator Anthony that I come here only as Minister for Education and the question which he raises arises before the case comes to the Minister for Education and is a matter for the Department of Justice.  Three Ministries, apparently, have something to do with Children's Bills, the Departments of Justice, Health and Education.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Stanford's question, I would refer him to Section 133 of the Children's Act of 1908.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>He will not find the complete answer to his question there and he may perhaps look for the <Col N="821" /> insertion in our legislation of a section like Section 66 of the 1908 Act, but in actual practice there never has been and never is any difficulty regarding religion in any cases that have arisen in our courts.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is the slightest indication of a lack of the same protection for other religious denominations as there is in the British Act of 1908 for Catholics, I undertake that all the necessary legislative provisions will be made to give by law that protection which in fact exists.  I believe that the implication of Section 133 of the 1908 Act is as fully operated as if it were law and I do not think it would have been left in that state if it were not so.</P>
      <P>Senator Mrs. Concannon asks if there is any other school other than a Catholic school.  When it is realised that there are only six girls in this institution at the present time and that in order to make adequate financial provision for the school it has to be maintained at a national figure which I doubt could be reached, I would not care to have to go to the particular decimal point of provision we would have to go to if we had to provide an additional school for children of other denominations.</P>
      <P>While this question is a small one it is most important, and as far as we can see we feel fully satisfied that the provision made here will not have to be added to.  Senator Colgan raised the question of education.  As Senator Mrs. Concannon has pointed out, these girls are in the hands of a most experienced Order whose contacts with problems of this particular kind on the one hand, and with the general education of girls, on the other hand, stretches back for more than 100 years and possibly for a few hundred years.  Senators may rest assured that the finest possible approach is being made towards keeping these girls occupied and towards giving them the fullest possible training so that, by the full exercise of their faculties and of their talents, they may so develop as to be above all danger and temptations when they leave the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> Senator Hawkins mentioned the question of contact with the outside world.  Senator Mrs. Concannon suggested that it would be well worth while visiting some of these schools and meeting some of the magnificent women in charge of them.  I often wish I could take a couple of the Reverend Mothers whom I know and have them as occasional inspectors, because their very practical and vigorous approach would be very useful if they could travel outside their own respective spheres.  There is a great desire among those in charge of industrial schools to leave nothing undone&mdash;to increase that contact with the world on the one hand and, on the other hand, to make the children feel, even in what might from the outset be regarded as the very restricted and confined atmosphere of the schools, that they are a part of the general world.</P>
    <P>The Superior of one boys' school discussed very seriously with me the question of vacations for the boys.  Up to last year, I think, 21 days' vacation was allowed, during which period the children returned to their homes or to the homes of friends for holidays.  The Superior discussed with me the desirability of extending the holidays in such a way as to make the children feel that they belonged to an ordinary residential school when they could go home at Christmas, Easter and in the summer, where at all possible.  The home conditions in many cases are not such that it would, perhaps, be advisable to do that, but the minds and the thoughts of those in charge of the schools are travelling very much in that direction.  A superioress of one of the schools was responsible last year for making me think it was desirable to extend the period of leave from 21 days to 31 days.  That was done last year with, I understand, very beneficial effects.</P>
    <P>The minds and thoughts of those in charge of the schools are very open. They realise their responsibilities in regard to the mental outlook of the children under their care and anything that either they or we can do to assist in that connection will be done.  It is very desirable that the ordinary citizens who live in the locality of these schools would, through the many <Col N="823" /> societies that exist and in various other ways, keep in touch with communities and children of this particular kind, but particularly, I think, with the communities. Many of these communities are not very well off.  They are, perhaps, carrying on without any great financial assistance either from the State or from the local bodies.  They live lives of great anxiety and care and they need the stimulating interest of the people outside.  These people could help the community either as individuals or as small societies and, without any great inconvenience to themselves, they could show communities of this kind that they are taking a real interest in their work.  I have in mind, in particular, the boys' side of things. There is a marked difference noticeable when you go into an institution run by men for boys and when you go into an institution run by nuns for girls.  You wish you could see more of the woman's hand in the institutions run by the male religious communities for boys. To some extent, it has been effected beneficially by the introduction of women nurses in some places to look after the boys.  All the developments I see there are developments in a satisfactory direction.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins suggested that the whole system must be changed.  I do not think it is beneficial to revolutionise everything.  I think it would be very hard to provide a better system than what can be developed organically from the very sound roots which we have in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the systems of committal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In that respect, as far as Dublin is concerned, there is the Children's Court.  There is no display of armed force or even of helmets of a menacing kind in relation to the carrying on of the cases there.  Then, throughout the country, there is the system of district justices.  I do not think the Guards in the country are regarded as a force with a capital F, in the way Senator Hawkins rather suggests.  To get a different system would mean that you would have to take the young children away from <Col N="824" /> their own parish areas to a central court, or something like that.  I think it would be better to reform the outlook on what the Guards and the district justices are, rather than to set up committal machinery for dealing with the very small number of cases of children that there are.</P>
      <P>It has also been mentioned, particularly in cases of this kind, that it would be desirable that a child should be admitted to this institution without going before a court.  This matter was very fully considered but it did not appear that there was any way in which you could so break in on the fabric of the foundational law in relation to industrial schools and reformatories that you could get children into these institutions without first going before some kind of an official court that would issue the necessary Order.  If, in the working out of things, we are able to find that a system of voluntary approach can be evolved in regard to entry into these particular schools, then we shall see if, in the case of a voluntary desire to enter, it can be done without a court.  One of the difficulties is that part of the cost of this scheme is borne by the local authority and part by the State.  There must be some kind of machinery of agitation on a particular case before you can feel it is properly decided that the State and the local authority should shoulder themselves with the cost of maintaining a child.</P>

      <P>A large number of the children committed to industrial <Col N="825" /> schools are committed because they are orphans or because their parents cannot maintain them.  Why should these children have to go before a court of justice in order to be committed? They have not done anything against the community.  It is indicating poverty as a crime, while we pretend it is not.  Certainly, it is a different matter if the children break the law. I know that at one time they had to go through the farce of begging outside the court.  Sometimes the policeman handed them a bag of apples.  They were then brought into the court&mdash;and that was their crime.  That has been changed but, again, why should children, simply because they are orphans or because they are poor, be brought before a court as if they were criminals?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator is rather misrepresenting the nature of the court.

I have known them in various towns&mdash;particularly in my own City of Galway, where they are doing very useful and tremendously good work.  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the suggestion put forward by Senator Colgan.  I hold that it is not impossible to get away from the atmosphere of the courthouse, from the atmosphere of the law having those young people in its claws and of putting them, even if it should be for their betterment into one of these schools. We should devise some more humane system&mdash;something that will imprint on the minds of those children in their later life that they are more a part and parcel of the people than they have been up to the present.</P>

      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the suggestion of Senator Hawkins.  To my mind, however, it is not one of the things that the State can do from the top.  I have a very strong suspicion that the Department and the Minister would be very sympathetically inclined towards suggestions in that direction which might come from those responsible in the schools.  They possibly better than anyone else know the facts.  The whole object of modern reform is to try to help the child who is not getting a fair chance in life and to make him into a decent citizen.  That is what we want to do and it is all a question of what is the best way to do it.  Personally, I would be better pleased if the police, so far as possible, were out of it.  At the same time, I recognise that you cannot open this to everyone, that there must be proper evidence and proper consideration before a child is sent to one of these schools by a justice. I was wondering if it might be possible for the justice to hear cases of this kind in his own room without any <Col N="827" /> publicity, but I do not think that is something which requires legislation.</P>

      <P>I know that in certain cases that is the way in which it is done and possibly something on those lines might be devised.  I personally would not move it as an amendment, but I should like to see the word &ldquo;reformatory&rdquo; taken out of the name of the school, not because the word is not an excellent word but because it has got a sort of stigma attached to it. I should like old boys or girls of these schools to be able to speak of their old school with a certain amount of pride and not to regard it as something they had to suppress.  I should like to see this word which unfortunately gets a meaning which is not intended, removed but again I do not think that can be forced by the State.  It is useful that these points should be made in debate, but it is mainly those who are doing extremely fine work in charge of these schools who will know the best way in which changes might be made.  As a rule, these changes come gradually as the result of experience and that is probably the best way.</P>

      <P>There are six matters dealt with here and these are dealt with in Sections 5 to 10 of the scheme.  Senators <Col N="828" /> will remember that, after the setting up of the State, the Christian Brothers' Schools, which had not been under the national school system, came in.  From 1925 or 1926, in a progressive movement into the national school system, the Christian Brothers came in and the transfer was regarded as having taken place from 1st January, 1927, and the teachers in these schools were then regarded as national teachers.  At that time, there was a contributory pension fund.  They were not contributors to that fund and, when in 1934, the national teachers' pension fund was taken over by the State and the fund scheme became a non-contributory scheme, the question arose of what was to be done in respect of a pension provision for those who had been teaching in these schools as monitors, junior assistant mistresses and so on who had not contributed to the pension fund. It was decided when the fund was introduced in 1934 that those who had given service in certain capacities, non-contributory, before that year would be allowed to count two-thirds of their period of service as pensionable service and they then came in under the scheme as if they had been members of the fund before.  In the case of the lay teachers who came in under the Christian Brothers' Schools, they were allowed to count their service back to 1st January, 1927.</P>
      <P>A number of cases were raised both here and in the Dáil during the discussion on the previous superannuation scheme and it was pointed out that hardship was caused in a small number of cases by reason of the fact that there were men who had given fairly considerable service before 1927 who were receiving no recognition for that service and who, as a result, were retiring on very small pensions indeed. Section 5 of this scheme makes provision that service given before 1st January, 1927, and back to the time the teacher was 18 years of age will now, and retrospectively for a certain number of years, be regarded as pensionable service for the purposes of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the recognition of the strike period as pensionable service. The teachers were on strike for <Col N="829" /> about six months from 31st October, 1946, and, in order to wipe out any recollection of that event in our educational history, the Government were anxious that there should be no hanging-over feeling that the increment date was postponed year after year as result of absence during that period and because there was a gap from the point of view of pension.  It was not necessary to come to the Oireachtas to maintain the normal date for increment and to ignore the absence of six months or so from the incremental point of view.  Some time ago, it was settled that the normal incremental date would be retained and this provision will enable us, in fixing pensions, to ignore any absence at that time and to count the whole of the teacher's service for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is a tidying-up section.  It has been the practice that teachers retire on reaching the age of 65 years, and this provision simply arranges that service after that age will not count towards pension.  There are a small number of instances in which, by reason of fortuitous circumstances of one kind or another, a teacher is continued in office.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the abatement of pension.  It has been the practice that, when a teacher who has retired on pension takes up a position as a teacher, his pension will not operate to secure that he will get more money in his temporary post-pension position than he had in the position from which he was pensioned.  This extends it to the taking up of employment otherwise than as a teacher.  It only relates to employment where the moneys are provided directly from the Oireachtas or out of the Central Fund.  The question has been raised as to whether this would affect a person employed under a vocational committee, by the Electricity Supply Board, a university or some nationalised undertaking.  The question might arise according to the terms of the nationalised undertaking, but it would not arise in connection with the Electricity Supply Board, university employment or employment under a vocational committee.</P>
    <P>With regard to paragraph 9, new <Col N="830" /> scales of pay came into operation from 31st October, 1946, and when these new scales were introduced, it was realised that teachers who went out on pension immediately after, as their pensions were based upon the average income for three years immediately preceding the date of termination of their office, would suffer rather much by reason of the fact that they were going out on pensions based on the old scales, although they had actually been begun to be paid on the new scales.  It was decided that every teacher would be allowed to continue beyond the normal pensionable date for such a period as would enable him to have one year of the new salary scale as a contribution to a larger pension.  This paragraph provides that, with retrospective effect to all those who went out since the new scales were introduced, they will receive a pension based on the notional calculation of what their income would have been for three years before the date of retirement, had they been on the new scales for that period, so that all those who retired from 31st October, 1946, will after this clause comes into effect, receive pensions as if the new scales of pay had been in continuous operation for three years before they went out.</P>
    <P>Section 10 relates to marriage gratuities. At present, when a lady teacher retires for marriage, she gets a retiring gratuity based upon income for three years before the date of her retirement. If she had an income of £240 for the year immediately before her retirement, or at the time of her retirement, £220 the year before and £200 the year before that, she would retire with a gratuity based on an average income of £220.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I am correct in saying that this is the first occasion on which the Minister has appeared before us as Minister for Education.  We knew him before, of course, as a member of the Seanad, but if this is his first appearance as Minister, I would like to bid him welcome. I should like to do that particularly because he has appeared with these proposals which, as he said and as I can confirm, will make for better relations between his Department and the 12,000 or 14,000 people with whom he has to deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some observations that I should like to make on the proposals in this Order. The first deals with Section 5 (iii) (a) where, as the Minister explained, two-thirds of the service given by certain teachers engaged in Christian Brothers' schools will be allowed for pension purposes.  In my opinion there is no real justification for cutting the service by one-third. In this, of course, the Minister is following the precedent set by the previous Government in 1934 when they brought into the pension scheme convent teachers and junior assistant mistresses.  That Government, in turn, were following the precedent created in 1920 by the British Government when, for the first time, teachers engaged in convent schools were recognised by the State for the purpose of payment.  It was argued very strongly then, by the teachers' representatives, that those women, some of whom had given long service in convent schools as assistant teachers, should have that service recognised for the purpose of placing them on the scale but, after first refusing to recognise any of the service, the Government yielded to pressure and agreed to allow service to the extent of two-thirds. <Col N="832" /> That is just and arbitrary figure. There is no virtue in it any more than there would be in three-fourths, seven-eighths or any other figure.  It was just one of these things that the British Government liked to do by way of compromise.</P>
    <P>That precedent was followed when convent school teachers and junior assistant mistresses were being put on the pension scheme in 1934.  They were allowed only two-thirds of their previous service.  The result is that some of these teachers, especially junior assistant mistresses and convent school teachers who had to retire shortly afterwards, retired on extremely low pensions and the problem was created of the miserably low pensions, of which we have heard so much.</P>
    <P>The only suggestion I have ever heard in justification&mdash;it was mentioned again by the Minister in his statement&mdash;was that these people did not contribute to the old pension fund. I do not think there is any substance in that argument.  They contributed by their service.  They worked for lower salaries than the other teachers had at that time, low and all as they were, and they gave service to the community. There is no good reason that I could ever understand why the whole of their service should not be recognised for pension purposes.  I know that in respect of those employed in the National Health Insurance Society, service given in the separate societies before unification, is now recognised in full for pension purposes.  There is another reason, and a strong reason, why this should be done, namely, that the teachers have the worst pension terms of any public servants.  In practically all other services, the pension is equal to two-thirds of the average salary over a number of years.  If it is not two-thirds, it is one-half plus a lump sum.  That is the position in the Civil Service and in the local authorities and in most other public services, or semi-public services.  In the case of teachers it is half the average salary over three years and no lump sum.  In Northern Ireland, the teacher is entitled to a lump sum, and in the Civil Service here and most other services that is the position.  That is a further reason why we should get away from <Col N="833" /> the two-thirds in the case of teachers engaged in convent schools, Christian Brothers' schools and junior assistant mistresses.</P>
    <P>With regard to paragraph 6, dealing with service during the strike period, it was regrettable that there should have been a strike, and I think nobody regretted it more than those who were compelled to take part in it but, at the time, it seemed to them their only method, after trying every other method, of bringing their position before the public and getting the public to recognise it.  I have no hesitation in saying that if the suggestion which was urged on the Minister at that time and which has now been adopted by the present Minister, of setting up a representative committee before which the teachers could argue their case and make their claim, had been adopted, I feel quite certain that there would not have been a strike.  However, that is past and gone.  It is highly commendable, I think, on the part of the present Minister and the Government to allow this service, especially the incremental service, which is even more important than pension service, for the purpose of creating better relations and wiping out any bitterness or trace of bitterness that might have remained.  It is only fair to say that, while the teachers have asked that this should be done, they did not claim it as a matter of right.  They had no right to get this service allowed.  They went on strike.  They knew what they were doing.  They knew the sacrifices and they were prepared to make them.</P>
    <P>There is only one thing in connection with that strike that I should like, very briefly, to mention.  It was the action of the former Minister and Government, after the strike, in rewarding by means of special bonus those members of the teachers' organisation or nonmembers of the organisation who remained on and refused to go on strike. That is something that is unique in disputes of this kind, and I wonder what a trade unionist, say, Senator Seán Campbell or Senator Colgan, would say if, after a strike those who failed to obey the call of their organisation or union were rewarded by the employers with a special bonus.  That also is past <Col N="834" /> history but it will be remembered for a long time as the outstanding thing which was very bitterly resented by the teachers.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and thank him also for this other section whereby the older teachers who were just about to go on pension at the time the new scales were introduced will now get in their pension the benefit of the new scales as if they had served for the full three years on the new scales.  That is something that the teachers' organisation had always asked for and which, up to this, they did not get.  They certainly did not get it under the British when the 1920 scales were introduced and some teachers had to go on pension a month, two months or six months after the new scales were introduced and it brought them no benefit in their pension.  The former Minister, after the 1946 scales were introduced, as the present Minister has told us, did allow one year and provided that every teacher, no matter if he were due to go on pension, would be allowed to serve one year on the new scales.  That, to some extent, helped towards getting a better pension.  Now, the new salary scales will count to the full for pension purposes for those teachers who had to retire shortly after the scales were introduced.</P>
    <P>There is only one matter which I regret.  Of course, it was not possible, I suppose, to bring it in on this Order. I refer to the case of ex-teacher-pensioners that has been so frequently and so strongly represented to the Government.  I can only hope that there will be no further delay in remedying that very deserving case and giving these ex-teachers some help, especially in view of the very poor terms of their pensions.</P>
    <P>Again I would like to thank the Minister for bringing in these proposals, especially the provision in regard to the strike period, which, as I say, the teachers could not claim and did not claim as a matter of right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House removes many of the disadvantages under which teachers were labouring for some time.  I would like to join with Senator O'Connell in making a plea to the Minister on behalf <Col N="835" /> of two types of teachers, that is, those for whom he now proposes to make a provision of two-thirds of their service and old retired teachers.  I regret to find, on an examination of the Estimates for the coming year, that no provision is made there to implement the many promises that were made throughout the election campaigns, first, to increase teachers' salaries and remuneration in general and, secondly, to make provision for those old retired teachers.  The teachers have a powerful organisation to plead their case and to fight their battles, but I fear that as far as old retired teachers are concerned their case has been left somewhat in abeyance for some time past and they have felt the strain of the increased cost of living more than any other section.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Connell was anxious that we would pass over the history of recent months and I think he set out fairly well to do so himself.  In every reference he made to any improvement in the conditions of the teachers in general he started with what the British did in a particular Act and came on to what the previous Government did in their legislation and during their term of office.  There was quite a lengthy piece of history between the passing of the British Government and the coming into office of the Fianna Fáil Government and the Senator should have made some reference to the Government that was first in office for what they did on behalf of the teachers.  I do not think it was fair to pass from what the British Government did to what the Fianna Fáil Government did or did not do.</P>
      <P>Section 6 makes provision for putting the teachers in the position they occupied prior to the strike.  It does only what this House and Parliament has already done in the case of Corporation employees and other State servants who went on strike.  I do not think that there is very much we can say in regard to this particular motion except that we are glad that a number of disadvantages are removed.  We plead again with the Minister on behalf of those old retired teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This amended superannuation <Col N="836" /> scheme is a distinct improvement for a number of classes of teachers.  I am inclined to agree with Senator O'Connell and Senator Hawkins that it is a pity that something could not be done for teachers who retired a long time ago on very miserable salaries and who are therefore in a lamentable position as regards pensions, but it might be in order to remind Senator Hawkins that while we all sympathised with these teachers and while the powerful organisation of national teachers was trying to do something for them, Senator Hawkins was a force in another very powerful organisation which for over 16 years failed to improve the lot of these old teachers.  However, that is only by the way.  The Minister has adopted a newer and more enlightened scheme whereby when people miss an improved scale of salary they are not allowed to miss the improvement in their pension. Everybody will, I think, agree that that is a good scheme.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a word regarding lay teachers in primary divisions of Christian Brothers' schools.  Speaking with experience as a secondary teacher in Christian Brothers' schools, I can say that they were a very badly paid and hard working body of laymen.  I agree with Senator O'Connell and Senator Hawkins that it is desirable to give them what they are getting now and if they could get more it would also be desirable.  The problem is not a continuing one.  It only applies to people who were employed in the primary divisions of Christian Brothers' schools when they were taken over in 1927.  I had something to do with the transfer, which took a number of years. It is a distinct improvement to allow them two-thirds of their service, but seeing that they are a disappearing band of people and that no precedent would be set up, if that could be improved it would be all to the good. They were a very deserving class of people who did good work under difficult conditions of every kind and it would be very good if it could be improved.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister is to be congratulated on this amending scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask <Col N="837" /> the Minister for some information about the position of women teachers.  I hope that Section 7 can be interpreted as applying to women teachers as well as to men teachers.  By a very unfortunate interpretation of previous Acts, a good many women were compelled to retire at 60 years of age even before they had served a sufficient number of years to qualify for full pension, and I think there should be some amendment in that respect.  If Section 7 means anything it means that a teacher remains in active service until the age of 65 and that pensionable service counts until the age of 65 and not after. I would be very glad if that applied to women as well as to men.  There is no reason in the world why women should retire at 60 and not at 65 and it would be most unjust if they had to.  Women teachers have many disadvantages and I have voiced their grievances on more than one occasion without getting any further.  If we have an assurance that the term &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; applies to women teachers as well as to men teachers, it will be very good news for a lot of people.</P>
      <P>I join with those who have asked the Minister to consider&mdash;I am sure he has considered it&mdash;and bring all the pressure he can to bear on the Minister for Finance to do something for the old pensioned teachers.  It is a crime and a disgrace that these people should have utterly inadequate pensions. Their salaries were utterly inadequate and their pensions are based on them. They have done magnificent work and I do not know how they exist or keep going at all on pensions based on those salaries.  No matter where the money comes from, the nation would be very pleased, although we are not very fond of Supplementary Estimates, if the Minister for Finance could bring in a Supplementary Estimate for that.  It would be very welcome to most people concerned with this vital aspect of our education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer can be given positively to Senator Mrs. Concannon that Section 7 applies to women as well as to men, that is, as regards such benefits as are in it, but I do not want her to misunderstand the situation.  That does not, however, <Col N="838" /> remove the provision from the superannuation scheme of 1934 which in Section 31 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No pension, gratuity (other than a short service gratuity) or other sum shall be payable under this scheme to or in respect of any teacher who has, otherwise than under and in accordance with permission given by the Minister to such teacher, continued to serve as a teacher after such teacher has attained, in the case of a male, the age of 65 or, in the case of a female, the age of 60.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The provision remains that female teachers can be pensioned and retired when they reach the age of 60, but that is not actually operated at the present time.  They are not retired at 60, but the power to do so and pension them at 60 remains while there is no such power in respect of male teachers up to the age of 65.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The question raised by Senator Hawkins of the salaries of national teachers is being dealt with by a committee specially set up for that purpose under one of our Circuit Court judges and it is being fully examined.  The Government is committed to improving the pensions of the older teachers who do not come under this Bill.  The Estimates were published, showing the amount of money that is going to be spent on services and the Budget will show you the Government's general approach to any additional matter with which it proposes to deal during the coming year.  Any additions to our plans and the hope we have for the future will depend upon the state of the Exchequer as it is shown to-morrow or the day after.  We must size up the realities of the matters that really require to be dealt with, and Senators, I think, can confidently expect that while direct machinery has been set up to examine the situation regarding salaries, the pension situation will be <Col N="839" /> dealt with adequately and effectively as soon as we possibly can.</P>
    <P>The only other question is why noncontributory teachers up to 1934 can count only two-thirds of their services for pension purposes.  Teachers who were brought in under the 1934 pension scheme and who had not been in pensionable positions before and who had not any hope or understanding that they were in pensionable positions were given a concession in respect of their past services.  They were allowed under the 1934 scheme to count two-thirds of their previous service for pension purposes and that is a very considerable concession to people who expected nothing.</P>

There are so many things which have to be dealt with in a realistic spirit.

      <P>Senators may remember that when the debate on this <Col N="840" /> motion was adjourned I made a case that while very considerable capital was required in agriculture, in my opinion control in the injection of this capital was necessary and experience has shown that over-free lending such as this country experienced after the first World War was ultimately harmful to the industry.  In the interim since the adjournment of this debate, we have had before us a scheme which does to some extent inject controlled capital into the industry.  I refer to the Minister's scheme for land reclamation and rehabilitation which limits the provision of fresh capital to certain definite objectives and, presumably, in the first instance anyway, will not have the undesirable inflationary tendencies that the coming in of capital into an industry in a disorganised and uncontrolled manner might otherwise have. I think a time may come, however, when schemes such as the farm improvements scheme and the land reclamation scheme may not cover all the requirements of the farmers. There may be gaps that will have to be filled to fit circumstances of certain farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in my opening remarks we have to think not of the farmer but of the farm.  The farm may require capital but the farmer cannot get it for various reasons such as, in the judgment of others, non-creditworthiness. If we always regard the problem as that of farmers requiring capital we shall always be up against the difficulty of the non-creditworthy man.  On the other hand, when you regard the problem as one associated with agriculture and associated with the condition the land has got into it will be seen that if the provision of capital or credit for the land is the objective the problem takes on another aspect.  To illustrate what I mean let us take for example a statement made by the present Minister for Finance when he was Deputy McGilligan, and since he has become Minister for Finance.  He has said something to the effect that he saw no insuperable difficulty in providing capital for agriculture but he did see very considerable difficulty in devising means to secure repayment of interest and of the moneys advanced.  I wonder whether he had considered that, possibly, <Col N="841" /> when you take agriculture as a whole it would be too far to go to say: advance money and get your repayment by a levy on exports.  From the point of view of agriculture, the main difficulty is increased production.  The land and the farmer are restricted by insufficient capital.  But suppose the farmer had that capital.  Suppose what he was asked to do was to produce more.  I think the agriculturalists as a whole would be quite prepared to say that they were ready to fall in with the idea that repayment could be ensured by a levy on exports.  I do not want it looked on as one man producing one thing, say capital, and a levy on the export of pigs decided on.  Quite obviously there must be some sort of a levy on all exports, designed more or less in proportion to the amount of money that has been advanced to the various branches of agriculture and apportioned as best it can to meet the circumstances.  What I suggest is that we have got to take cognisance of the fact that our low production is to a great extent consequent on years of under-capitalisation of our farms.  We have seen that this Government has realised that and has made a tremendous step towards meeting that difficulty in the last few months.  But I, personally, think that it should be possible, if, any time we find that this land reclamation scheme does not cover all the needs and requirements of our farms and the State fees, that it cannot make any further contribution, after the manner of the one proposed by the Minister, that the farmers as a whole would be quite prepared to fall in with a scheme, such as I suggest, that advances made to agriculture might be covered by a levy on agricultural exports.</P>

      <P>One wonders, when resuming a discussion that has been adjourned for so long, where to begin. One is tempted to deal with the remarks of the last speaker.  Senator Orpen has made what one might describe as a useful suggestion but Senator Counihan might not agree with it. Senator Orpen has praised and advocated the land reclamation scheme. I do not think this is the time or the place to discuss that scheme, considering that we do not know its terms. From what one can gather, the Minister has not yet indicated the terms or the proposals he has in mind in relation to this scheme.  I can quite understand that Senator Orpen has contributed largely to the formulation of this scheme and that he would, no doubt, be a very able advocate of it in this House.  I think however, that he might strain Senator Counihan's allegiance very much if he stressed that a levy should be paid on exports in order to repay loans farmers have secured from various Government institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I first saw this motion on the Order Paper I expected that some scheme would be proposed or suggestion made in relation to the type of person Senator R.M. Burke, and those other people who have spoken, holds is not now in a position to get credit from the banks or from the various other lending institutions in this country such as the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  Senator R.M. Burke took up much time in this House suggesting that the wealthy should be taxed so that those less fortunate might be provided with the necessary capital to go into more production but he has not told us how to meet the demands of those people who have been described as non-creditworthy persons.  We have been told by speakers on both sides of the House that there are sufficient facilities available for any farmer who is creditworthy but what about the non-creditworthy farmer?  The non-creditworthy farmer is not and will not be in a position, despite whatever schemes are put into operation by this or any other Government, to get credit, simply because in the view of the lending societies and institutions he is not a creditworthy person.  If we examine <Col N="843" /> the matter we will find that the &ldquo;non-creditworthy person&rdquo;, particularly in the case of farmers, falls under one of two headings.  There are those who, through no fault of their own, are non-creditworthy. As we know, a system prevails in rural Ireland under which, when the father passes away, he leaves the property to the eldest son on condition that the eldest son will provide fortunes for his sisters and look after his brothers.  It often happens that, in order to provide his sisters with dowries or fortunes, the eldest brother has to borrow from the bank.  Having borrowed from the bank for that purpose, he is then not in a position to seek further credit to develop his farm and so make farming pay.  He borrowed in order to fulfil an obligation and he was facilitated because the bank considered that the land which he owned was capable of yielding him the money and the interest he would have to repay.  He now finds himself in the position that he has not the capital to develop his land and that he cannot borrow because he is already in debt.  What scheme does Senator R.M. Burke suggest in order to make provision for such a person?  He should have informed the House in that respect, considering the fact that he put down this motion.  In particular, he should have informed the Minister who, I am sure, would receive most sympathetically suggestions in regard to the lending of money at a reasonable rate of interest&mdash;and Senator R.M. Burke would be an able advocate in regard to the lending of money at as low a rate of interest as possible.</P>
    <P>The second type of non-creditworthy person is the man who, through illness or loss of stock through disease, or through any of the many other setbacks that occur on a farm from year to year, finds himself in such a position that, although he could probably make the best use of money because of his circumstances, neither the banks nor the Agricultural Credit Corporation will lend him money.  It is no use saying to such a person: &ldquo;There are the banks, and, if you do not get it from the banks, you can get it from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.&rdquo;<Col N="844" /> In addition to these two types, there is the farmer with the large family. Whatever we may say about Christianity and so on, there is this to be remembered, that, in the case of a person who requires a loan from the Credit Corporation, from a bank or from any other institution, if it is put forward that he has a large family, his chances of getting the loan, even though other circumstances are favourable, are much lessened.  There is also the traditional obstacle of the difficulties of getting possession of a farm, if the loanee defaults in payment.  I urge Senator Burke to put before us some method by which cases of this kind can be met.</P>
    <P>In the past&mdash;and I think it only right to pay tribute to this section of our people&mdash;the greatest friend the farmer had was the local shopkeeper. It was the local shopkeeper who fought side by side with the farmer to get possession of the land.  It was the local shopkeeper who helped the farmers in their fight in the Land League days and who helped the farmers through the difficulties of the economic war and it is on these people, the merchants and shopkeepers of our towns, that the type of people I refer to have to depend to a large extent for the credit necessary to maintain themselves on the land at all.  In recent years, there was introduced a scheme by which loans were made available through the county councils to cottage owners for the purchase of seeds and I suggest that that scheme might be extended.  The members of the county committees of agriculture know the persons making the applications and know their circumstances, and if by some arrangement with the Central Fund, committees of agriculture were enabled to make short-term loans available to such farmers as I speak of, it would be of great assistance.</P>
    <P>Many of these people who found themselves uncreditworthy have got out of their difficulties, due in no small measure to the tillage policy pursued in recent years.  I have one particular family in County Galway in mind.  That family found themselves in very difficult circumstances&mdash; a huge debt in the bank, no stock on <Col N="845" /> the land and portion of it let in conacre. They were young and energetic and willing to do their best to get back to the position which their people before them had held, but they were tied down for want of capital.  They undertook the growing of beet and wheat, and little by little succeeded in getting out of the mire, until in recent years they were able to take back their land from the person to whom portion of it had been sublet and are now able to stock the land completely and have their debts paid.  That is due to the cash crop, the crop they could grow and for which they could get the cash which was so essential to enable them to make good, and it is only by a continuance of that policy that we can help the type of people whom Senator Burke seeks to help by his motion.</P>
    <P>When, however, we examine the position and see what has been done, we find that, particularly in the past 12 months, persons of the type we wish to help by this motion are being hindered and many of them have been deprived of whatever little moneys they made in recent years.  Last year, the Minister for Agriculture issued advice to the farmers over his own name to grow more potatoes and oats and urged&mdash;he not being an advocate of wheat growing&mdash;that they should abandon the growing of wheat.  This advice, coming from a responsible Minister and issued by the Department, was accepted by many of our farmers and many of those who accepted it were people who had taken conacre and who were striving to get out of difficulties, people of the type this motion seeks to help.  These people were encouraged by the Minister to grow these crops, and, having grown them, they found, when the harvesting season came along, the Minister telling them that he could find no market for them and that the only thing they could do was to walk these crops off the land.  These people would be delighted to be in a position to walk crops off their lands if they could buy the live stock.</P>
    <P>In many cases the difficulty is that in order to be in a position to purchase live stock they must first of all sell a <Col N="846" /> cash crop.  Until we have a long-term agricultural policy, until that policy is taken out of politics, and we are not going to have, as we had last year, statements issued by the Minister for Agriculture advising farmers to do one thing this year and reversing that advice the next year, we will have this problem with us.  We had the Minister issuing advertisements this year advising farmers to grow wheat, and then advising them to avoid growing oats and barley until they were in a position to walk their stock off the land.</P>
    <P>They are the people who need credit, because they are not creditworthy.  If we are going to aim at the increased production that the Government and everybody else would like to see, we must not allow occupants of holdings, owing to circumstances over which they have no control, to be left in the position that they cannot get the fullest production out of their land.  If we can avoid it, we must not allow that position to continue, but must make provision to help persons of that type to secure the credit they require.  In speaking to his motion Senator Burke did not give any insight into what scheme he suggests should be put into operation to meet such cases.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the safest scheme for such farmers would be a long-term policy, so that they would know where they were going, what they were going to get for their work and not be faced with changes from day to day in agricultural policy.  That has happened inside 12 months, where advices that were directly contradictory were given. Of course the farmers were not a bit upset by such advice; what they were really surprised at was that different advice was not given every two months. If we are going to help these people I think there should be an extension of schemes, whereby agricultural committees would be in a position to give farmers short-term loans, and also to let them know what Government policy would be for a number of years ahead. That would be a most essential step in getting the required production and in giving farmers generally confidence in their industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcCrea" hpid="Mr. McCrea Mr. McCrea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCrea</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of this motion must be obvious to all Senators. <Col N="847" /> It has been on the Order Paper for months, but was passed and by-passed so often that it is difficult to know what to say about it now.  During the debate our whole agricultural economy was examined.  We travelled over the Continent and at one time heard all about the Norwegian forests.  Even Senator Hawkins, in his criticism of the motion, did not advance any suggestion as to how the problem about which we are concerned should be dealt with. Senator Counihan put down an amendment and went a long way with the motion until he clashed with the Minister. My idea in seconding the motion was to deal with the position of farmers who live on uneconomic holdings, on bog-sides or on hillsides.  When travelling through the country, and looking at the well-kept cottages in these places, it would seem as if everything was beautiful, but off the main roads, and up lanes and boreens, numbers of people will be found living on uneconomic holdings.</P>
      <P>They are in dwellings, some of which have been there since the flood, badly ventilated, sometimes insanitary, while the out-offices consist of stone walls roofed with a few sheets of iron.  These are the conditions under which many people have to live and to try to rear families.  I do not believe that under such conditions the occupiers would be in a position to pay the principal or even the interest on loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hawkins complained that no suggestions were made about improving such conditions.  People of the class that I refer to are most impoverished. They are not farmers nor workers; they are nobody's children. My suggestion is that the Minister should extend the Labourers' Acts, or otherwise amend them by bringing in whatever legislation would be necessary, so that county councils would be given authority to build houses on such holdings.  These people are not farmers or labourers and when they are sick and have to call in the doctor they have to pay.  If they have to go to hospital the hospital has to be paid.  Many of them for generations have debts that are a regular millstone to them.  My suggestion is that for such people the <Col N="848" /> provisions of the Medical Charities Act should be extended to enable them to improve their general condition.  As most Senators are in sympathy with the motion I ask the House to pass it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBurke" hpid="Mr. R.M. Burke Mr. R.M. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that so many Senators seemed to approve of this motion.  On the various occasions on which it was discussed Senators on all sides, and in every political Party, to a very large extent, approved of the proposal, some, perhaps, with slight modifications.  Quite naturally there were certain questions and certain objections raised to which I should like briefly to refer.  I shall refer to them in order, so that Senator Hawkins may have to wait for a few minutes before I deal with his points.  Some Senators stated that there were an adequate number of organisations and schemes already in existence to enable farmers to obtain all the loans they require, such as the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the county council loan schemes, and so on.  While these organisations have done a considerable amount of good work, they are not adequate.  There is still a very large number of farmers who need loans and who have not been able to obtain them.  Numerous farmers have come to me over a number of years pointing out that they had applied to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and were unable to obtain a loan.  The argument has been put forward, in reply to that statement, that the Agricultural Credit Corporation probably did not lend money to these people because they feared they might not be able to repay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose, therefore, to make several suggestions as to how that difficulty might be overcome.  First of all, with regard to the improvement of land.  In that connection I am glad to note that the Minister and the Government have already adopted one of the suggestions that were put forward in this motion several months ago, that is, to advance money over a long period for the improvement of land.  That part of the motion has already been adopted by the Government.  They have now agreed to spend, over a period, up to £40,000,000 on land improvement. They have also agreed to allow that <Col N="849" /> money to be collected with the Land Commission annuity&mdash;another thing that I suggested when speaking on the motion.  It is, I think, an excellent idea, because the farmer, instead of having to go to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, can pay a little more annuity in the half-yearly instalments. It really amounts to a loan over a period of approximately 68 years, which is very reasonable.  As far as land improvement is concerned, therefore, under the proposed new scheme, one of the points in this motion has been met.</P>
    <P>This motion also suggested loans for several other purposes.  The next purpose was the improvement of farm buildings.  In that respect we are still awaiting a suitable scheme.  I suggest that we might have a scheme similar to the land scheme, because farm buildings last a considerable number of years.  Sixty-eight years may be considered too long, but most substantial concrete buildings would last that period, and I consider that 35 years is too short a period to give a farmer a reasonable opportunity of paying for substantial buildings.  With regard to buildings, therefore, a loan could be advanced and repaid with the annuity by a system similar to the system that in the near future will be adopted for land improvement.  That would get over one of the difficulties that Senator Hawkins mentioned, that of a farmer who was sick for a short time.  He would have a long term to pay off the debt and we would hope that he or his son would be able to pay it over that long period.  The sickness would probably last only a few months or, at most, a few years.  A different problem arises in regard to farm machinery, which would wear out after a shorter time.  I shall refer briefly to that later on.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that the Agricultural Credit Corporation would be able to meet the needs of farmers apart from the new land improvement scheme.  I think that is not the case, and I will give a few figures to illustrate the point.  The amount that the Agricultural Credit Corporation issued over the last 21 years is only just over £3,000,000.  Dr. Henry Kennedy estimated, <Col N="850" /> on pre-war figures, that agriculture needed over £200,000,000, which would mean over £300,000,000 now. Some Senators said that they thought his figure astronomical.  Even if his figure were halved however, it would be approximately £150,000,000.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation, therefore, with their loans of £3,000,000, while they have helped a certain number of farmers, have touched only the fringe of the problem, and a great deal more is needed.</P>
    <P>Another argument that was advanced by certain Senators&mdash;Senator Quirke was one of them&mdash;against this scheme, was that it would encourage too much mechanisation, that too many farmers would want to buy tractors, especially farmers' sons.  I believe that it would be desirable in the national interest if more tractors could be available in this country, but I would not go so far as those people who suggest complete mechanisation and the abolition of horses.  I would not agree to that.  I need not go into the reasons, because several Senators have already pointed out the advantages of having a reasonable number of horses in the country and I agree with them.  I do think however, that there is room for more tractors, and there is one reason which was not mentioned in this debate.  It is that a horse consumes, on an average, the produce of about five acres of land, in grass, hay, oats and so on.  For every three horses, for which a tractor might be substituted, there would be 15 acres more land available for producing food for human consumption.</P>
    <P>In the West of Ireland, where Senator Hawkins comes from, and where I come from, there is great land hunger. Senator Hawkins referred to that. There are many people clamouring for more land.  Even if all the large estates which are not properly used were divided, they would still be clamouring for land.  Where is that land to be obtained?  One way in which more land could be made available for keeping cows, and producing food for human consumption, is by keeping a certain number less horses and substituting tractors.  In that way there could be a great increase in the production <Col N="851" /> of food.  Sir John Boyd Orr has emphasised that there will be a world shortage of food for a number of years.  There is, therefore, a good case for the keeping of more tractors, although I would not be in favour of mechanisation to too great an extent.</P>
    <P>Next I would come to the difficulty raised by the Minister, Senator Hawkins and some others, and which I admit is a difficulty, that is, what the Minister described as &ldquo;separating the sheep from the goats&rdquo; or finding out the creditworthy farmers from those who are not creditworthy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to correct the Senator.  I did not make any reference to goats because I hold that there are no goats in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  It was the Minister who referred to sheep and goats, but Senator Hawkins mentioned that there were some farmers who were regarded as not creditworthy and I quite agree.  He mentioned several types.  With regard to the Minister's point, first, in connection with sheep and goats, I do not think that there can be any system, and I doubt if anybody will ever produce a system, whereby the sheep and the goats in this world can be completely separated. We will probably have to wait until the Day of Judgment for that.  In the meantime, however, that does not mean that we should hold up land improvement.  As Senator Orpen pointed out, this matter concerns the whole nation, and if certain farmers can be described by certain people as the goat type of farmer, it does not justify the community in neglecting them.  Their land should be improved for the good of the nation, as well as for the good of the people working on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hawkins mentioned the extension of the county council loans system for seed, and I quite agree that that would meet a part of the problem, but such loans would not be sufficient for all purposes.  I believe that, wherever it would be practicable to have long-term loans, the difficulty could best be got over by putting the loan with the land annuities as a charge <Col N="852" /> on the land to be paid over a very long period.  That would not cause as much hardship as if the loan had to be paid back over a short space of time.  One difficulty remains, that of the sickness of a farmer or some other catastrophe, such as buildings being destroyed by fire, or the death of animals.  The only remedy I can suggest for that is an insurance system for farm stock and buildings, and this would be to the benefit of the farmer in the long run. When a farmer pays a small amount as insurance against fire, if his buildings are destroyed, he is in a position to rebuild. I know farmers, some of whose buildings were burned, and the people in the locality collected money to help them, and the same happened in the case of farmers who were sick.  The only way out at present is private charity, to help farmers in the case of a sudden catastrophe, such as buildings being burned, or sickness, but there should be insurance against such risks.</P>
    <P>As well as lending only £3,000,000 in 21 years, the average amount of the loans issued by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, as you will see if you read the annual report, is only £108.  Dr. Henry Kennedy, who is an authority on this subject, stated that on farms of 30 or 40 acres as much as £300 or £400 capital might be needed.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation, therefore, while it is doing a certain amount of good, has not met all the farmers' needs for loans.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that we should not encourage farmers to borrow what they cannot pay back.  I quite agree, but many farmers who could not pay back a loan in four or five years, could do so in seven or eight years.  If the time limit for the repayment of the loan were extended it would enable farmers to pay back loans which under the present terms they cannot.  It would also be easier for them to repay if the output per acre and per man hour were increased.  At the present time it is often the man who most needs a loan who is unable to obtain it.</P>
    <P>Another matter mentioned in the motion is the rate of interest, and some Senators argued that, in the case of a small loan of, say, £50, the rate <Col N="853" /> of interest did not make much difference. I quite agree that on a loan of £50 the rate of interest may not be very important, but it is very important in the case of a loan of £200, £300 or £400.  A difference of 1 per cent. or 1½ per cent. would be very big when spread over a number of years.  Psychologically it would also encourage farmers to take loans where they were needed, as they are now deterred by the high rate of interest.</P>
    <P>It was also pointed out by some speakers that loans would be of little use to farmers with very small uneconomic holdings of land, that such persons had no need for big elaborate buildings, nor for a large amount of live stock, because they had no place for them.  I believe that the best form of loan for farmers with small holdings would be a loan to enable them to erect poultry houses and piggeries and keep more poultry and pigs.  A considerable number of poultry and pigs can be kept on a small farm.  On a very small farm a man could not make a livelihood out of cattle and sheep, but he might out of pigs and poultry.  At the same time, I agree that small farms create a big problem.  In connection with the use of modern machinery there should be co-operation, and the system advocated by Senator Orpen of &ldquo;Economic Farm Units&rdquo; should receive further investigation and consideration.  In that way farmers could co-operate to utilise modern machinery for the good of all concerned.</P>
    <P>Some people raised another objection, saying that in the past when banks lent money to farmers, many farmers were unable, to repay.  One reason for that was that some old loans were for the purpose of buying land.  I think that Senator Orpen mentioned that those loans did not increase agricultural output, but merely transferred land from one person to another.  Loans such as are suggested in this motion, however, would increase the agricultural output, and would therefore be productive.</P>
    <P>I do not say that I have been able to answer every question raised, or that I could put up a complete remedy, but I doubt whether anybody could do that, realising that we live in an imperfect <Col N="854" /> world, and that we cannot have perfection.  What I advocate is a scheme which is practicable under present conditions.  My principal reason for advocating the scheme contained in this motion is that it is one way by which we could increase agricultural output per acre per man hour.  It would not only raise the income of the farmers, but it would raise the income of the whole community, and the nation.  I do not suggest for one moment that it is the only thing required. Many other things are needed in order that the national income should be increased, but I believe that this scheme would help considerably in that direction.  In fact, it has been said with regard to this proposal, that there is no other known method of achieving so much for so many by such simple means, and I still believe that is true.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have already adopted one of the suggestions in the motion, regarding land improvement, and I am very hopeful that, as a result of this debate, which has taken place over a long period, other portions of the motion will be implemented in due course.  I do not think, therefore, that it would serve any useful purpose to put this motion to a division.  It has been fully discussed, and members on each side of the House have availed of the opportunity to make constructive suggestions. I think that it would be sufficient now to leave it to the Minister and the Government to act on the suggestions put forward.  I am hopeful that suitable legislation will be introduced in due course on the lines of this motion.  Already, in fact, a start has been made.</P>

      <P>That this House is of the opinion that the Government should at the commencement of each session indicate to the Oireachtas the legislative programme contemplated for the session.</P>
      <P>In moving this motion, I should like to say that I regard it as an entirely non-Party motion and almost more of a social than a political motion.  It embodies a desire I have had in my mind for some years and only now do I see an opportunity of bringing it to the notice of the House and inviting the attention and assistance of my colleagues. The first difficulty I found was in the matter of the wording.  There are two things behind this motion.  The motion is worded: &ldquo;That this House is of the opinion that the Government should at the commencement of each session...&rdquo; Strictly, I would sooner have put &ldquo;at the opening of the Parliamentary year&rdquo;, but that would have meant that I would have had to define &ldquo;Parliamentary year&rdquo;.  If the House will allow me to regard &ldquo;session&rdquo; as meaning &ldquo;Parliamentary year&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Parliamentary year&rdquo; as meaning: the 12 months following the annual reassembling of the Oireachtas in the autumn&mdash;it will make the position a little easier for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the word &ldquo;opening,&rdquo; the idea at the back of my mind is that we should have a formal State opening of this House at the start of every Parliamentary year.  I have attended five opening meetings, autumnal meetings, of the Oireachtas and I have always felt a little disappointed <Col N="856" /> that they were somewhat informal.  I believe that this is a very important institution, the most important secular House in the country and one of the Parliaments of Europe.  We might have a more ceremonial start in the autumn.  One reason for that is that our zeal for democracy may tend to take a certain amount of the colour and brightness out of life, and what I really would like to see is the President coming with an escort, being met by a guard of honour and received by this Chamber and giving us a message like the three leaves of our shamrock: charity to all men, faith in the present, and hope for the future. I could not with any propriety phrase that as a motion before this Chamber &mdash;who am I, as a private member of this House, to make suggestions as to what the President should do?&mdash;nor could I present it to the Government without knowing what this Chamber felt about it, but I should be very grateful to have it discussed.  In the past, it would have been somewhat difficult to do during the emergency period, but now I feel, in view of the very considerable legislative changes of the past year, that we have an opportunity to seek a more ceremonial opening of our session.</P>
    <P>As to how that has been worked into the motion, I thought the message of the President might very well be made the occasion for another thing which I felt would be desirable, that is, that, either in the Message or in the adoption of the Message by the Government representative in the Chamber, we might have some indication of the Government programme for the ensuing Parliamentary year.  We know that if we look too far ahead, we fall over what is at our feet, and, on the other hand, if we look at the ground all the time, we do not see where we are going.  If we were enabled to lift up our eyes and to see the hills and obstacles which we have to face and the road we are going to traverse, it would be a very great help indeed.  I do not seek to tie the hands of the Government, to commit them to a particular programme, a particular line of policy, or anything of that sort, but I believe they could give us a perspective. That, I think, is of particular <Col N="857" /> importance at present in view of the very wide issues we are facing&mdash; national issues, like social welfare on a very large scale, and international issues.  If we knew that we were going to discuss these things at a certain time of the year, we would be better prepared.  From my own limited experience, the Seanad would profit enormously by a blueprint for the Parliamentary year, so far as such a thing is possible.  It would prevent our work being bunched together, with long intervals, and would give us a chance of spacing out the work and of discussing important and relevant matters at a time when there was not such great pressure of work.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the two arguments I put forward in support of this motion. I am not a believer in long speeches.  I have avoided the phrase &ldquo;Parliamentary year&rdquo; because I do not see how it can be defined properly without getting into all sorts of difficulties about chopping legislation into time units, but I suggest that the House allow me to read &ldquo;session&rdquo; as meaning &ldquo;Parliamentary year&rdquo; in this particular case.  With these two arguments, I very respectfully submit this motion for the consideration of the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion raises certain points of interest in respect of which some of us have found difficulty over rather a long period.  The Senator desires two separate things, apparently: (1) that we should open Parliament with more ceremony, and (2) that we should be given beforehand an idea of the legislative programme. That we should have more ceremony is quite within the power of the Government. It is quite possible, and I agree entirely with Senator Fearon that it is desirable that we should have more ceremony, but I think we should be very careful in the development of ceremony of that kind.  We cannot adopt ceremony from other places and we must allow something in the way of a native ceremonial to grow up.  That, of course, offers very considerable difficulties, because all secular ceremony in this country was associated <Col N="858" /> with an occupying Power with which a great many of us naturally did not agree.  But we should not allow the fact that we did not agree with it to blind us to the advantage of ceremony in secular matters.</P>
      <P>I think the Senator has made a case for a ceremonial opening of Parliament; that when a new Parliament comes into being it should be opened with greater ceremony and, less, so to speak, casualness, than has hitherto been observed.  There are various reasons for the present situation. One of them obviously is the beginning of the Parliament in 1922 and the other is the desire to avoid the kind of ceremony which was associated with the British occupation.  I suggest that we should have more ceremony with regard to the opening of Parliament, that is, the opening of the Oireachtas, and, perhaps, as the Senator has said, an address to the members of both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second thing the Senator asks for, however, while it may possibly be desirable, is something of much greater difficulty.  He asks that the Government should, at the commencement of each session, indicate to the Oireachtas the legislative programme contemplated for the session.  The word &ldquo;session&rdquo; in Great Britain has a technical meaning and Parliament is opened and concluded at the end of a session and business which is not concluded in each session is killed.  For a number of reasons, including, I think, if I may say so, simple ignorance on our own part as to what a session might be, we did not adopt that particular scheme for having Parliamentary sessions and I think it is desirable that we should not adopt it.  The system which did grow up of allowing us to consider the whole life of a Parliament as one session is a system which has proved useful from the point of view of legislation.  For example, Governments have adopted commonly the plan, when adjourning for a long time until autumn, of announcing a number of First Readings, not with the certainty that the Bills will be circulated but in the hope that the Bills will be circulated by the autumn.  If they are so circulated, they can be taken early in <Col N="859" /> the autumn session, using the word &ldquo;session&rdquo; in a loose fashion.  That, I think, has proved an advantage for the working of Parliament and I agree with Senator Fearon that it would not be desirable to define the word &ldquo;session&rdquo; more tightly than it has been heretofore.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Government announcing its business, I do not know whether the Senator means that something in the nature of a King's speech or something in the nature of the message of the President of the United States to Congress should be adopted and that in the Dáil there should be a general discussion on it.  That is not quite the thing for us, but, if I might be allowed to express an opinion, I have never seen much advantage in what one might call a general discussion lasting over a week.  General discussions do not seem to me to be of very great advantage.  It would not be very easy to declare one's legislative programme and to be sure that one could adhere to what one had said at the beginning of the session.</P>
    <P>I speak now exactly like Senator Fearon, merely as a member of the Seanad who is interested in this matter, and not as referring to any particular Government.  Members of the House who have been here for some time have heard me declare often enough that Ministers and heads of Governments are very much alike, no matter what their Parliamentary programme was before they got in and no matter what the name of their political Party is. There are certain enduring and unchanging qualities in Ministers, but, while that is true, there are some very real difficulties in the position of Governments. For example, a declaration of business made last October could scarcely have included a Transport Bill, but it is quite obvious now, I think, speaking entirely without any special knowledge, that we are going to have a Transport Bill and that it is going to be an important Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it would not have been easy to frame a message from the President to the Oireachtas in October to say that, owing to the parlous condition of Córas Iompair Eireann, it is probable that the Government will have to introduce a Transport Bill.  That would not have been quite so simple.  One would have to indicate something more concrete than that kind of general proposition.  However, another of the advantages that Senator Fearon thinks would accrue from declaring your Parliamentary programme would be that it would help to space out the work.  I am afraid it would not.  It would be an aspiration towards spacing out the work but, even if you knew beforehand or declared beforehand all the things the Government intended to do, that would not get over the difficulty in which this House has found itself every year in the month of July or August since 1922. The real difficulty with regard to congestion of business is, I think, that the financial year is from April to April instead of January to January and I think we would be precluded by the terms of this motion from discussing whether that is a desirable change or not.  I have heard it discussed.  But, the result of the financial year being April to April is that the Budget, which occupies so much time in the other House necessarily, is thrown into the month of May and comes at a particular moment when the Estimates also fall for discussion in the other House and if there are any important pieces of legislation, as there were, for example, this time last year and this time two years and as there will be this year, then the Dáil gets all clotted up with business, with the result that in July or August this House is confronted with measures which have been considered at some length in the Dáil and which, in the nature of things, this House, grumbling, complaining and protesting, has to pass in the month of August.  The remedy would be, of course, that the Dáil and this House should do more business in October-November-December and that the work <Col N="861" /> should be transferred from June-July-August to October-November-December but, in the nature of things, and with the financial year as it is at present, I see no great possibility of doing that.</P>
      <P>There is only one suggestion which I have to make, which I made a great many years ago when I was Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil and when I had no experience at all as a Senator, and that is, that more use should be made of this House for the introduction of certain types of Bill.  In the nature of things, you could not introduce in this House Money Bills or Bills which, even if they were not Money Bills, would be concerned to a very great degree with public moneys, but there are certain types of legislation which might very well be brought in here and which would help to relieve congestion in the Dáil and which would get a very good kind of consideration here.  We had one example this very day.  I think it would have been just as satisfactory, perhaps a little more satisfactory, if the Children Bill had been brought in here rather than in the other House. I see on the Order Paper of the Dáil at the present moment an Infanticide Bill from the Minister for Justice. These are matters which raise no political issues, no matters of high policy, but in connection with which the usefulness of a Second House might be very well displayed and which, if introduced here and if they got a particular kind of discussion in this House, would go through more rapidly in the other House and, instead of stuff being banked up in the other House and then suddenly overflowing here, you would have this House working at particular periods and it would make the work easier as between the two Houses.  I have always considered, for example, that a Bill dealing with the Seanad itself should be introduced here rather than in the other House.  That is really the only thing that I can suggest in present circumstances which would be of assistance in getting the business done and preventing the extreme congestion that seems always to occur in July or August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that Heads of Government have had the heroic resolve in more than one case that they would not do <Col N="862" /> legislation.  I have heard that expressed with great vehemence and with, I am sure, great sincerity, but it does not always work out that the Head of the Government can avoid legislation.  So far, the Taoiseach here present has not had very important, contentious legislation but there are some Bills in the offing which will certainly take time and while, as I say to Senator Fearon about his motion, that we could have more ceremony and, I think, ought to have more ceremony, the actual declaration by the Government of the legislative programme would not be of great importance in actually getting the business done.  If Bills could be got through the other House before Christmas rather than coinciding with both the Budget and the Estimates then, of course, the whole situation would be radically changed.  The desirability of doing that has always been recognised by Heads of Government but, for a great variety of reasons, it has not ever been found possible to do it.</P>
    <P>The Senator explained that he did not use the word &ldquo;session&rdquo; in any technical sense but that it could mean Parliamentary year, but even the words &ldquo;Parliamentary year&rdquo; are difficult to define because the question is, when are you going to begin it&mdash;is it in the autumn or after Christmas?  It is very difficult to say.  Our actual system, which means that the session runs over the whole period of a Parliament, has proved in fact to be a good one.</P>
    <P>The only concrete suggestion I can make to the Taoiseach and the House is that more use should be made of this House for the introduction of certain types of Bill, particularly Bills which are not of any political moment, and it would be rather in the way of a political education for the country if they realised how many Bills there are, and there is a very considerable number of such Bills, which have no political significance at all and which could be very satisfactorily discussed here and which then could go to the other House and, instead of coming here in July or August, could be finished by the other House about that time.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Fearon is to be congratulated for giving us an opportunity <Col N="863" /> to discuss this matter but it is not something which can be easily disposed of by way of motion in the Seanad. The difficulties in the matter are inherent in the facts and they are very hard to escape from, no matter what goodwill one may bring to bear upon them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisIreland" hpid="Mr. Ireland Mr. Ireland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ireland</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Senator Fearon's motion, I am afraid I could not say very much about the possibility of outlining in advance what would happen in a given Parliamentary year because I have not Parliamentary experience but I was very interested in the other aspect of the Senator's remarks, the connection between ceremony and a republic.  I was very interested because, in a pamphlet which was published in 1941, which I hope will be republished very shortly, I analysed the absence of ceremony about the opening of our Parliamentary year and I drew a connection between that and our republican outlook on government.  I pointed out that there is a fundamental difference between the way an Irishman would regard a State coach and the way an Englishman regards a State coach.  I think an Englishman is more impressed with the symbolism of the State coach itself and the Irishman is apt to look through the State coach to the reality of government which it represents and that, I said, was a republican way of looking at things.  I think my analysis has been borne out by the course of Irish history in the meantime.</P>
      <P>I do agree with some previous speakers that we might have more colour in the opening of the Parliamentary year and I think we would have very good analogies for that.  In France they make quite a ceremonial out of it.  As Senator Hayes has said, there was an unfortunate feeling in the Irish mind that any form of ceremony was associated with a foreign power in this country.  I think it is time we began to build up our own ceremony. We have a very colourful collection of cavalry and I do not see why we should not use it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested from many points of view when I saw this motion on the Order Paper.  I often felt that it would be a good thing if we had an indication from the Government at the beginning of a Parliamentary year, particularly after a general election, as to what legislation they proposed to introduce or what programme they proposed to give effect to.  I quite realise that there are great difficulties and recent events have shown to all our people how almost impossible it would be to expect that such a programme could be outlined at the opening of Parliament.  It may be possible when you have one or two Parties going before the people and putting before them a very clear and definite policy.</P>
      <P>The people naturally expect and the members of Parliament expect that effect will be given to the programme of the Party that is elected as a Government but where you have a position arising from a general election that there are a number of Parties comprising the Government and where the programmes put before the people by those Parties are at variance, it would be very difficult even for the President or, if we had a Monarchy, for the King, to give an idea to the people as to which part of the various programmes would be given effect to in that Parliamentary year.  Therefore, I think we must only place our confidence in the system of each Party putting before the people a clear, definite policy and programme and giving effect to that policy when elected as a Government to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the suggestion of having a ceremonial opening, I think that has been already dealt with by Senator Hayes.  Our past has compelled us to regard not too favourably all ceremonial occasions of that kind. We are here building up a new State and I think it would be very premature <Col N="865" /> to come to a decision as to the form of such ceremonial opening of our Parliament.  Senator Ireland pointed out that it would be very nice, and a great demonstration, that the President should arrive in Leinster House escorted by our Irish cavalry.  He has overlooked the fact that we have disposed of or put into abeyance our cavalry and have now adopted an imported form of escort, motor bicycles, which, to my mind would not produce a proper ceremonial effect on the occasion of the opening of Parliament. Therefore, as far as the opening of Parliament is concerned, I think we can afford to leave that matter in abeyance with the many other matters but that consideration might be given to the suggestion put forward by Senator Hayes of having many Bills introduced in this House rather than in the other House.  It would be well if at the opening of Parliament we could be given an idea of what programme would be given effect to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a good thing that motions of this kind should on occasion be brought forward and we should consider procedure and see whether it might not be possible to make improvements.  Senator Fearon is decidedly optimistic, I would almost say innocent, if he thinks that a motion even of this kind could be brought forward without somebody introducing Party politics but we would not really enjoy a debate here if Senator Hawkins, Senator Hayes and some others had not a little to say on the matter.  I was enormously interested to learn that for a period of 16 years a particular Party knew in advance what it was going to do and never changed its mind.  That is a marvellous record if one could only believe it.  I think it is inevitable that you will have differences of opinion.  I would like to see a ceremonial opening of Parliament but I do not think that ceremony and pageantry are necessarily the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously Senator Ireland and I have a slightly different idea about what way the President should arrive.  I am not very much worried provided he gets here safely, but I think it would be a good thing if once a year we could <Col N="866" /> have a ceremonial opening when both Houses meet and when either the Taoiseach of the day or the President in a speech prepared and acting on behalf of the Government and on advice were to indicate in general terms the outlook regarding policy and legislation for the year.  I do not think, however, that it would have any value in the sense that Senator Fearon hopes it would.  I do not think it would affect the date on which any Minister would be ready or the length of time it would take the Parliamentary Draftsman to get Bills ready.  I am perfectly certain, even if we had that scheme, that the Seanad would find a lot of Bills coming in at the end of July and that nothing would change that.  I am looking at the question not so much from the point of view of the members of both Houses but from the point of view of the public, and I think it would be a good thing if the Government, without giving details of the legislation, were to indicate in more or less general terms what it proposed during the coming 12 months to do, or what legislation would deal with certain problems.  It would almost certainly mean more public discussion of those problems.  Undoubtedly, political correspondents or whatever they call themselves would lose just a little, as they would be speculating on something for which there was at least some ground for speculation.  Instead of our hearing first from some gentleman in the Press that it was rumoured or believed or thought or known with certainty that the Government intended to introduce a Bill dealing with some particular subject, measures would be indicated in a general survey.  I think the value of that survey would be entirely from the point of view of creating more public interest and in focusing the minds of the people on the Parliament and with the same idea I would favour a ceremonial commencement once a year.</P>
    <P>I am in general agreement with what Senator Hayes has said regarding the practical difficulties, but that may be because he and I were together to some extent when those difficulties were faced in the very beginning.  Our views are liable to be coloured by that experience, <Col N="867" /> but it might easily be that new minds would see things from a different point of view and work out something new.</P>
    <P>I am not impressed by the word &ldquo;session&rdquo;.  We could easily have adopted the word &ldquo;session&rdquo; and not adopted the British practice, &ldquo;the murder of the innocents&rdquo;, or whatever it is called on the other side.  On the whole I think a position which has grown up partly by accident by which we treat the whole life of the Parliament as though it were a &ldquo;session&rdquo; in the British form has worked pretty well, and I do not think anyone wants to change it.  Things which grow up are, as a general rule, better than things which we artificially try to create.</P>
    <P>I should like the Government to consider whether it might not be possible this year to introduce some innovation in the commencement of Parliament in the Autumn.  I would not like to say exactly what form it should take, but if there was to be a statement such as I have indicated or one more on the lines which Senator Fearon desires, one thing which I would strongly urge that should not take place is a debate on it.  I think that a debate on the Address, such as they have in the British House which may be of value there because of its long tradition, would be sheer folly here in either House.  They have it in both Houses over there, I think.  You would be debating something you know very little about.  It is only an outline and most debates on the Address are concerned with what is not in it rather than with what is in it.  It would be sheer waste of time to have a debate, but some sort of general statement by the Government of the day, particularly if it were found to be useful in practice, would have considerable public value.</P>
    <P>I should like to add to what Senator Hayes and Senator Hawkins have said &mdash;I have said this so often that I hardly like to repeat it&mdash;a suggestion to the Taoiseach that quite a lot of Parliamentary time could be saved if Ministers introduced non-controversial Bills into the Seanad, particularly those on which it would be likely to get helpful criticism on non-Party lines.  As we <Col N="868" /> know, there are quite a number of them and we, I think, do not do them full duty.  These small Bills are introduced when the Minister is in a hurry, having had delay in the Dáil because they were not very important, and if the same amount of time were given here as is given in the Dáil to these Bills of no great political interest they would get a better examination and improvements could be suggested. It would not cause any embarrassment at all and with a few very rare exceptions they would go through to the Dáil promptly.  When Estimates and work of that nature are taking up the time of the Dáil, better consideration could be given to those Bills here, and last but not least it would add to the useful function of this House which is something which ought not be overlooked. We could do a good deal more work if we were given that opportunity.</P>

      <P>I am very much in favour of the suggestion that this House should be used for the introduction of legislation more often than it has been the custom.  It gives me extra pleasure to support that proposal because in the past I have frequently been accused of wandering outside the rigid boundaries of the subject matter under discussion, and although all Parties and all speakers up to now have approved of that suggestion, it is not mentioned even by implication in the motion.  Sometimes it may be an advantage to wander, but whether it would be advantageous for us to wander in our robes through the city before the opening of Parliament I am not sure.  I have witnessed, as I suppose many here have witnessed, the old Mayoral processions where Dublin Corporation met in solemn assembly in borrowed robes to drive through the city and I do not think they managed their affairs much better then than they do now when there is no ceremony or Lord Mayor's coach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can remember, as some of you can, I am sure, standing in the streets watching the grand dames and their escorts arriving for the Castle balls, and certainly it gave me no respect for the Castle or for its rule at the time. <Col N="869" /> I am not sure whether there would be any more respect, or, rather, any less disrespect shown now to the Oireachtas if we went out in our robes.  Ceremonial robes are all right for university professors or judges on the Bench, but I doubt if it is any more pleasant to be ordered to be executed by a judge in his robes with a black cap over his wig than it is in America where you can be put in the electric chair by a fellow just as plainly dressed as yourself.  The thing you do matters rather than the costume you wear when you are doing it.  Senator Ireland has been attracted to the idea by the possibility of marching, driving or trotting behind the Blue Hussars but he forgot that they have gone sky-high.  I wonder what was the origin of ceremony in the British Parliament&mdash;will we start with a Gunpowder Plot of our own?</P>

      <P>I believe that we might make more use of this House.  I am not so keen on a ceremonial opening and I do not think it would be feasible to submit to the Oireachtas an outline of the contemplated legislation. It might be submitted in outline, but there is no guarantee that it would be carried out.  When we meet we get an Order Paper giving the orders of the day.  That is a small, simple affair, and yet never once in my experience has the Order Paper been followed. It has always to be altered, chopped, changed and adapted.</P>
      <P>Somebody made reference to the fact that it might be very difficult for Governments to outline their programme. There would be no difficulty whatever for Governments to outline their programme. Every Party outlines its programme in a general election and the one that gets into power has already given its outline.  If it is said that it is not possible for a Party to carry out its promises I will agree, because in the 27 years' history of our Parliament no Party has ever carried out the promises it made before it was elected.</P>

      <P>I think there is a very good idea behind Senator Fearon's motion, although I suppose it would not be practicable to carry out his suggestions <Col N="870" /> in full.  There is a feeling that the legislation which has been enacted in the country since the inception of the State has been, to the man in the street, rather haphazard, and especially in later years the amount of legislation which has gone through the Oireachtas seems to be on an increasing scale.  A great deal of uncertainty has undoubtedly been created in business circles, in my own sphere, because one never knows what is going to come out of the Oireachtas before the year would end.  Anybody engaged in any forms of business, whether agriculture or industry, would like to have some idea from year to year of the major issues which are going to be before the country and how it is going to affect economic life.  Therefore, I feel that there is a very good idea behind the suggestion that some general picture should be given to the country of what is proposed in each year.</P>
      <P>We all know that to-day all Parties are calling for more and more legislation. I am glad to see that the present Government has let it be known that they wish to go a bit easy with the introduction of legislation.  Senators will probably recollect that when General Mulcahy was speaking in this House to-day he referred to the necessity for a slow-down in regard to drastic and new changes in existing systems.  Everybody seems to want a change in the whole system and completely new methods of doing everything. I feel that it would be well if we were to slow down on the introduction of legislation and think more before we initiate these new Bills and Orders.</P>
      <P>It seems to me an important point that up to the present, with this terrific spate of legislation, Ministers did not get enough time to administer their Departments.  Their work has grown enormously and the work in the Departments has swollen to a great degree.  It stands to reason that if a Minister has to spend a lot of his time on new legislation he will have little or no time to look after his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Seamus O'Farrell is quite right in his remarks about ceremony. The Irish are not very much impressed <Col N="871" /> by people wearing coloured scarves and funny hats, in gilded coaches.  Somehow, I think that nowadays we are rather cynical when we see that type of thing.  On the other hand, we can go too far the other way.  In the early days of this State some of our magistrates did not wear any kind of robes at all, and I must say that I think that was carrying it too far.  Ceremony of some kind is essential.  The suggestion that the President should come here&mdash; especially now that the Repeal of the External Relations Act is about to be effected fully on Easter Monday&mdash;is important.  The President is an essential part of our legislative system but he does not appear in it at all.  He is in the Park and removed from it.  The psychological effect of the President coming here at the opening of the Parliament after a general election, or once a year would, I think be good. It would stress how important he is in our legislative system.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the President's escort.  From some of the remarks which have been passed it would seem that there is a regret that the horses were changed for motorcycles. I for one am very pleased that that has happened.  If we are going to have ceremony it be a ceremony that grows up naturally from our own institutions.  After all, we have only had fully active self-government for the last 25 years, and the horse was rapidly becoming obsolete even in those days.  I always felt that the cavalry escort was something that was really dug up out of a musical comedy and that it was no credit to Ireland. It has been said that there is something un-Irish about a motor-cycle and something very Irish about a horse.  I do not know whether the first horse appeared in Ireland, but I know that some of the first motor vehicles appeared in Ireland.  We had some of the pioneers of that important industry in Ireland.  It will be remembered that the pneumatic tyre was invented by an Irishman, and I remember myself, as a child, seeing the late Sir William Gough driving a motor car.  I think it can be said that other Irishmen also were associated with the motor industry. <Col N="872" /> The present motor-cycle escort is simple, dignified and practical.  I feel, therefore, that Senator Professor Fearon has done a very good service in bringing this motion before the House and I shall be very interested to hear the views of other Senators on it.</P>

      <P>As the seconder of the motion I do not propose to say more than a word or two.  I should like to assure Senator Séamus O'Farrell that it is no part of our intention that the members of the Oireachtas should wear robes at the opening of the Parliamentary session.  Of all the people in this House who would be the least likely to advocate such a course I think the university professors would be the least likely.  We have suffered for many years from having to wear most uncomfortable robes which are, nowadays, exceptionally expensive.  I would say to anybody who introduces an amendment to this motion to the effect that we should wear robes that I would vote strongly against it.  It is not part of the original motion.</P>
      <P>I do not think I need apologise at this stage for the introduction of the motion.  I think the discussion which it has provoked has shown that it is a necessary motion.  A number of people in the Seanad feel that something of the kind is required.  I feel that the very excellence of the discussion on the motion has brought out one of the functions of the Seanad which is not, perhaps, sufficiently realised, namely, that we can have discussions and that we have had discussions which are not directed towards any immediate legislative result.  Even in the course of the last year we have had very interesting discussions in this House on the subject of the speed of motor vehicles, the payment of jurors and so forth.  We have had discussions which, speaking as an outsider, I do not think would have been possible in the same tone and with the same objectivity in &ldquo;another place&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the desirability of using the Seanad for the introduction of legislation.  I would suggest to the Taoiseach that he might consider the possibility of some special type of legislation <Col N="873" /> as being particularly suitable for introduction in this House.  I speak subject to correction, but I think that there is in this country no body corresponding to the Law Reform Committee which exists in Great Britain.  It does seem to me that the common law is being gradually reformed and being brought up to date in Great Britain and that we are falling behind in that respect.  Students of law in the universities find that in order to qualify for the examinations here they have to get old English textbooks of 20 or 30 years ago.  English law has moved forward&mdash; the law of defamation and the law of negligence and branches of the common law have been brought in line with modern conditions.  Non-contentious and non-political legislation would be suitable for introduction in the Seanad. There are a number of people in this House qualified to speak on that subject. If the question of the introduction of legislation into the Seanad is being considered, I suggest that that particular type of legislation would be eminently suitable.</P>

      <P>In supporting the motion moved by Senator Professor Fearon that we should have more ceremony as distinct from pageantry in our openings of Parliament, I should like to raise one practical question.  A certain amount of elasticity has been shown in determining the terms of the motion and perhaps I will be permitted to stretch it a little further.  It is desirable that some indication should be given to Senators, well in advance, of the days when the House will be sitting.  It is a very practical difficulty for fairly busy men.  We have to guess whether on certain Wednesdays, Thursdays or Fridays the House will meet or not.  It would be an enormous advantage if we could have a provisional calendar.  There may be objection to that proposal, but I cannot at the moment see them.</P>

      <P>With what I conceive to be the purpose behind Senator Professor Fearon's motion, I am in sympathetic agreement.  I must say, however, that I am very disappointed at the course of the debate.  For the last 27 year I have had contact of one kind or another with every Government that has operated in this country since the establishment of this State. Throughout that entire time I think every Seanad that has sat has at some time or another had some kind of a motion in which it denounced the Government for neglecting the Seanad, for bringing it back at curious times, at vacation periods, and for other matters of that kind.  The tone of the debate to-night was, I must say, disappointing because I did expect that there would be some more provocative matter for me to reply to.  Even when Senator Hawkins made a contribution to the debate for the sole purpose of having a hit at the inter-Party Government&mdash;he made no other contribution to the debate as far as I could see&mdash;he did not succeed in rousing in me any considerable amount of ire.  I am sorry to have to disappoint Senator Hawkins but I think he will have to reconcile himself to the fact that the inter-Party Government is working extremely well and very harmoniously.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, at the outset, that I am very strongly of the view expressed by Senators Hayes and McGuire to the effect that the less legislation there is in existing circumstances the better.  Last year when I started as Head of the present Government that was the headline I set myself.  I <Col N="875" /> felt that more good could be done for the people of the country, in existing circumstances, by administration rather than by legislation.  A lot of good has been done in the last 27 years for my profession by the provision of laws that have been enacted very hurriedly, I am glad to say, by different Parliaments&mdash;thus providing fees for members of my profession and substantial law cases from time to time.  I have, for the moment, temporarily deserted my profession.  I do not propose to help my colleagues in gathering up my practice by giving more legislation to them to prey upon.</P>
      <P>Seriously, I think that the country, in existing circumstances, can be governed better by administration than by legislation.  Consequently, I hope that when this Government bows itself out&mdash;whenever that may be&mdash;it will be able to boast that it did something good for the country and that it had introduced very few Acts of Parliament. With that object in view, it would be difficult to carry out one object of this motion&mdash;to indicate at the beginning of each session or Parliamentary year, whatever you like to call it, the Government's intentions in relation to legislation&mdash;because it was the Government's intention to introduce as little legislation as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Douglas rather put his finger on the real difficulty.  If the proposal could be given effect to&mdash;if, at the beginning of each year, the Government, either through the Taoiseach or by way of a speech by the President, did give an outline or an indication of the Government's programme for the ensuing year&mdash;there would inevitably be a debate upon those proposals. There would be a certain measure of convenience in a mere bald statement of what the Government intended to do, even though it were the merest outline, but without a debate there would be little interest and, with a debate, in existing circumstances and in the circumstances that are likely to exist for many years to come, there would be nothing, in my view, but the sheerest waste of time.  Senator Douglas did not want a debate.  Without a debate it would be of no interest <Col N="876" /> and with a debate there would be bound to be considerable acrimony and very considerable waste of time.  I suppose one's point of view changes when one is in opposition and when one is in Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as my outlook on this matter is concerned, I may say that it has always been the same.  I would think it would be wise and prudent and desirable from many points of view that some indication should be given to both Houses not merely at the beginning of each Parliamentary year but at the beginning of each period resumption after adjournment of what the Parliamentary programme would be; but I am not on the whole in favour of something which would be the counterpart of the gracious Speech from the Throne.  I may say that, historically speaking, I killed that practice early in the history of this State by giving advice to the then Government that it was not constitutionally necessary.  If it was not constitutionally necessary at that time, I am disposed to the view that it is not constitutionally possible at present under the existing Constitution.  I have made it a rule in the Dáil not to give any expression of my opinion on constitutional matters when I speak as a Deputy and I do not propose to depart from that self-imposed rule now when speaking to the Seanad, but I certainly would like to get competent advice on the question whether or not, having regard to the provisions of the Constitution, it would be constitutionally possible for the President, to do what Senator Fearon suggests, that is, to come and open Parliament and to make a speech indicating the Parliamentary programme for the ensuing year.  I draw attention to the possible doubt as to the consitutionally of such a procedure, but if the Seanad were desirous of ascertaining the correct view, I would take the opinion of the Attorney-General upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the other suggestions made, that this House should be, more than it has been, used for dealing <Col N="877" /> with measures of a non-controversial or non-Party character, if it is possible to get any such Bill, I should be very much disposed to consider sympathetically, and to ask my colleagues to consider sympathetically, that suggestion. I think there are such Bills&mdash;Senator Hayes referred to one to-day.  There are a number of them at the moment in preparation.  There are a number of Bills which I think could get better consideration here in the calmer atmosphere of this House than they would ever get in the atmosphere of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien referred to a law reform committee.  I have consistently refrained for a long number of years from advocating the formation of a law reform committee&mdash;I gave my reasons in the Dáil from time to time&mdash;because I was afraid&mdash;I was terrified, perhaps I might say&mdash;that such a committee would be set up because inevitably on to that committee would creep or be placed all the cranks that could be collected in this somewhat cranky country and I was very much afraid of what would emerge from a law reform committee of the type which my somewhat fervid imagination conjured up. That does not mean that I do not favour law reform.  I have been asking for it for a number of years and I hope before I cease to be a member of the present Government to have certain Bills before this Parliament reforming the existing law and bringing it up to date in the way of which Senator O'Brien has spoken.  Some years ago, I introduced one myself into the Dáil and the then Government undertook to sponsor it as a Government measure. It was placed in the limbo of the Department of Justice from which I hope to unearth it one of these days.</P>
    <P>I think that measures dealing with law reform are peculiarly the types of Bills that could be dealt with here, measures dealing with social matters such as the Bill referred to by Senator Hayes, the Infanticide Bill.  That has been introduced in the Dáil, but it might very easily and properly have been introduced here because it does raise a question of very great social importance.  I do not want to anticipate the discussion upon it, but it is the very type of Bill which could be dealt with here and, without giving any <Col N="878" /> guarantee or being in any position to bind or speak for my colleagues who have not had an opportunity of dealing with this motion, I can give the Seanad my own personal view that it is desirable that Bills of that kind should be introduced in the Seanad in the first instance.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of ceremony, cermonial or pageantry, that is largely a matter of a point of view and taste.  I personally believe there is value in ceremonial.  I attach some importance, with all respect to Senator O'Farrell, even to robes.  I made a considerable amount of money in my time out of wearing robes and I found it was a good commercial proposition.  The fact that members of my profession did wear robes set them apart as something that had grown up naturally, as a profession which had a separate existence, the <i>cachet</i> or outward symbol of which was the wig and gown they wore in the courts; but the wearing of wig and gown would have been merely comic if these robes had not behind them the long tradition they have.  If somebody or another had sat down and decided that Senators should wear a particular type of dress with coocked hats or tall hats and flowing robes, I am afraid the risibilities of the Dublin populace would probably have been called into action very rapidly.  But if these robes had, like the robes of the Dublin Corporation members, a tradition behind them, if the people were acustomed to them and associated them in their own minds with a particular office and a particular dignity in that office, they would have a value, and I agree with those Senators who said that you cannot artificially create ceremony.  That is the worst thing you could do.  It has to grow up naturally and be suited to the traditions and outlook of the people.</P>
    <P>Behind this motion is very probably, even though Senator Fearon does not know it, some lingering connection with the ceremony and the practice of the British Parliament.  It is natural that that should be there.  The British Parliament is opened with the ceremony of the King driving to Parliament, <Col N="879" /> with the Black Rod, the Commons asking for their privileges and all the rest of that pageantry, but that grew up out of the history and out of the building up of the Parliamentary institutions in England.  Unless our ceremony grows up naturally from the building up of our own institutions, it will be just a purely artificial tag on to our institutions, which will not last. I would be entirely in favour&mdash;giving expression merely to a personal point of view&mdash;of a rather ceremonial opening of the new Parliament.  I am not at all so convinced of the desirability of a ceremonial opening every year.  I would favour anything at all, whether it be ceremony or pageantry, which increases the dignity and enhances the prestige of Parliamentary institutions in this country.  I think that should be the predominant motive in reference to all that.  If whatever we do increases that prestige and increases the respect our people have for their own institutions and if it tends, above all, to raise the standard which members of both Houses of the Oireachtas set for themselves in Parliamentary debate and in Parliamentary conduct, it is something which ought to be fostered and even created.  That should be the test, in my view.</P>
    <P>I think it would be desirable for the President to open the new Parliament. I draw attention to the doubt that I have, without expressing any opinion on it, as to whether the President could constitutionally do what is suggested in the way of something which could be the counterpart of the speech from the Throne in England, but, subject to that, there would be no objection that I could see to his opening Parliament. It certainly would add to the prestige of Parliament and would secure further respect from the people for it.  We have, as Senators know, the institution of the Church services at the opening of a new Parliament.  I rather fancy that if that was turned into something that became an annual event, its repetition would spoil its novelty and the ceremony would probably cease to have any great effect and might fall merely into the category of an annual event of no particular importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, of course. The Senator wants to turn me back into being a lawyer.  I hope he does not expect me to give him a constitutional opinion.  The provisions in reference to his addressing Parliament have an entirely different connotation or meaning from what I think is in the Senator's mind.  The President may address Parliament after certain formalities have been observed; he may give a message to the people; but that is not saying what Government business is going to be, so I commend to the Senator a persual of the relevant Articles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say how grateful I am to my colleagues for their very friendly discussion of my motion, and to the Taoiseach for the exposition of his views on the subject.  I anticipated many of the objections raised, but I did not refer to them because I did not want to put ideas into people's heads.  Most of the other difficulties, I think, come from a couple of misconceptions which, before asking for permission to withdraw the motion, I should like to clear up.  The first is the Royal speech and debate.  I never mentioned the Royal speech&mdash;what I had in mind was the President's address to the American Legislature, and I certainly had no in tention of suggesting that the speech by the President or by anybody who condescended to open our session should be the subject of debate.  The only thing I did feel was that, if he came here and gave a message, he would have to say something, the alternative being that he would receive an address from us.  Which would be likely to inflict more trouble on him, I do not know.  Certainly, some sort of programme would have to follow, but a debate, and especially a general debate, would be a general nuisance, and I ask Senators please not to associate me with the suggestion that the formal opening of the Seanad should be the subject of debate at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" /> The other point is that I resisted the temptation to follow the invisible robe that Senator O'Farrell seemed to trail before me.  I never mentioned robes. Like any Dubliner, I have many recollections of the old Lord Mayor's processions, with their atmosphere of dust and month balls and all the exhibition of obsolete paraphernalia, but that is not what I had in mind.  Nobody suggested that this House should acquire robes for the occasion and parade the city. Senator O'Farrell must be thinking of the zoo or the waxworks or the circus coming to town.  I never mentioned robes and I oppose them as strongly as Senator O'Brien.  Furthermore, as to the introduction of ceremonial, my own impression was that it would be in the right tradition if the President condescended to come here in his ordinary car and was received here by a guard of honour.  No fireworks or salutes or bands.  Quite a simple and dignified ceremony.  I hope it will yet be possible to achieve such an aim.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="882" /> As to the other point.  I, perhaps, did not emphasise clearly enough what I meant by a blue print for the Seanad. I hoped that would lead us, as it did, to a discussion of the possibility of Private Bills and even Government Bills being introduced here.  The blueprint would give us an idea of the pieces of State legislation that we might help to make.  That has been, more or less, replied to by several speakers.  I do think the Seanad has resources that have not yet been tapped to the full.  I am very grateful for being able to hear this discussion and I ask permission to withdraw my motion.  It emphasised points that I think needed to be emphasised and has shaken things up a little bit.</P>
    <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.18 p.m., until 3 o'clock on Wednesday, 30th March, 1949.</P>
