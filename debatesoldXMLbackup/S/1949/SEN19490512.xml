    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that the case put forward last night by the Minister and the Attorney-General has not impressed me in the least. Neither have I deviated from the attitude <Col N="1066" /> I took up yesterday towards the provisions of this section.  I do not wish at this stage to go over the case I made last night except to say that I feel that if a case can be made, as was made last night, for the continuation in service of district justices who have reached age of 65, it would be much better if we set down a definite age limit of 70 or 72.  We have provision here enabling a district justice to be continued in service until he is 66, 67, 68 or 69.  Are we to take it then, as was suggested last night, that when a man reaches 65 it depends on him whether he is capable of filling his high office until he is 72 or 73?</P>
      <P>This committee, even if they are satisfied that a person is capable of carrying on past the age of 69, cannot lay that down.  A case was made for the extension of the age limit to 70 because judges of the High Court are not caused to retire until the age of 70 or 72.  I would prefer if provision were made for the continuation in service of the people to whom this Bill applies until they reach the age of 70 with the safeguard of having a committee to consider the question of their retirement when they reach the age of 65.  While I am not prepared to go so far as giving a definite expression of view, it is quite possible that if the same rule were applied to people of the age of 65 or 55 as will be applied to district justices of the age of 65, many of them would come into the category of people who should be retired.  If that is the case, I think that with this Bill before us we could do a tremendous amount of good by setting up a committee which would have the function of examining, any time that the question might arise through ill-health or other causes, whether circumstances would warrant the retirement of a justice and which would have the power to retire him.  It could also have the power to add the years to his service if necessary so as to give him the pension he would have if he served his full term.  It would be much better in the interests of justice and of the people as a whole if a man who was not capable of carrying on were retired, even if it cost the State a considerable sum to do that, and if a person capable of doing the work were put in his place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case which has been put before <Col N="1067" /> us by the Minister does not satisfy me that a proper approach has been made to this question.  In the case of district justices, as in every other line, there are people who, when they are retired, are quite capable and fit to fill the post. But as the years go by and sometimes as a result of cases brought on not altogether by their own assistance, they may not be people who, in the best interest of justice and of respect for the law, should occupy such a high post.</P>
    <P>It would be well if some system of appointing these persons were set up, if the appointments were made through the Appointments Commission or some other system of that kind.  Some consideration should be given to the man's approach.  In reading the papers from time to time, we are often dissatisfied at reading statements and approaches of district justices to the people appearing before their courts.  In the interest of justice and of respect for the law, a man appointed to such a high position should, by the dignity of that office, rather create respect than, as often is the case, by the treatment meted out sometimes to the lawyers, sometimes to the witnesses, cause something which does not uphold the respect that should be given to our courts.</P>
    <P>I was inclined to put down an amendment to this section on the lines I have outlined&mdash;that the terms of years be increased to seven, that the committee be as it has existed and that the committee have power to retire a person even at 40 or 45 if, in their opinion, the best interests of law and of justice would be served by doing so, regardless of cost to the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 21 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1946 (No. 21 of 1946), we have that power to retire a district justice.  The section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever the Minister requests the Chief Justice to appoint a judge to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) investigate the condition of health, either physical or mental, of a justice, or</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1068" /> So the Senator is asking us to put in a power that already exists.  There is no necessity to extend this Bill in the way suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>My suggestion is that in his investigation the Minister should have the help of this committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will not hold that the judge will have the same wisdom as the three people appointed under this Bill, even if the judges were appointed in the last 16 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I will accept that correction.  This is to extend the time, if the man is physically fit and capable of carrying on his duties.  I think that is reasonable, especially since a number of justices come in very late in life to the service of the State and have not the opportunity of qualifying for a full pension.  It could be argued that that should be met in another way.  Be that as it may, this is considered a reasonable way to meet the difficulty.</P>
      <P>As to whether the committee is a good one or not, these are three people occupying very responsible positions and I am perfectly satisfied that they will discharge the obligation placed upon them.  I went to the trouble of consulting them and I am very glad to say I got their consent to act.  I did not like to ask them, but at the suggestion of the Opposition in the Dáil I agreed to the proposal.</P>
      <P>The last extension is at the age of 69, that is, for a further year, thereby bringing them to the age of 70.  On examination, I think it will be found that the proposal is reasonable enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be placed on record as saying this.  It is a very difficult problem, I quite agree, but taking the broad view we in this country should come to the conclusion that 65, a purely arbitrary figure, is an age that should be the retiring age for all professional classes enjoying positions under the State.  It is being fairly <Col N="1069" /> rigidly imposed at present in the case of local authorities.  I dislike very much that the impression should go abroad that simply because a person is in the position of administering justice he should be treated in a different category.  For instance, a medical officer of health in a local area has to make equally as great and grave decisions as a district justice and still there is a purely arbitrary retiring age of 65.  I agree that no two people at the age of 65 have exactly the same mental capacity.  This is an extremely difficult problem and in the best interests of the State it would be desirable to fix 65 as the arbitrary retiring age.  In certain circumstances I am quite willing to agree that there might be an extension, but we are fixing here an arbitrary retiring age of 70.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, 65.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 70.  The man may be continued until then.  My own experience of most district justices is that the great majority of them will be in as full possession of their capabilities at 70 as they would at 65.</P>
      <P>I far prefer Senator Hawkins' approach to this.  This committee has no power to give a man a year over the age of 70.  That should be accepted as a general principle here for all classes. I am aware that it imposes hardships, but taking the long view, if a retiring age must be fixed it is better that we should accept 65 and deal with very special cases as they might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the Minister should consider regarding this as a temporary measure.  Perhaps we are doing something it may be necessary to do to-day, in relation to certain people, but it is establishing the worst kind of headline one can imagine.  Mr. A is a district justice and does not want to retire at 65.  He makes his application for a year's extension.  This committee recommends that his health is all right and his mental capacity and sprightly step entitle him to an extension of 12 months.  He gets it&mdash;but he may be the most incompetent justice on the Bench.  The question of competence does not arise here; it is only a question of the health of the individual. <Col N="1070" /> I do not think he can be thrown out on the grounds of unfitness.  Very likely he is as fit at 66 as when he was appointed at 45 or 50.  The situation will be an awkward one.  This man applies for a year and gets it, but someone else applies and for some reason he will not get the extension. Here you are creating a situation in which one justice can continue up to 70, while the other must go at 65.</P>
      <P>It would be far better to say that the retiring age for a district justice is 66, 68 or 70, and that there will be no departure from it and can be no extension, or, alternatively, let the Government re-examine the whole situation with regard to the retiring age, because it is very likely that men generally are more competent at 65 to-day than they were 25 years ago. People generally live longer than they did 40 years ago.  It may be that there is a case for making the retiring age 66, 67 or 68, but it should apply to everybody&mdash;to the county medical officer of health to whom Senator Hearne referred and the dispensary doctor.  Let us not forget that for a number of years the Minister for Local Government has been fighting with the medical profession on the point of compelling doctors to retire at 65, in respect of whose appointment there is no retiring age.  But here are men who took the appointment subject to a retiring age.  Even if they were 50 they knew they had to go out at 65.  They took the appointment and now some are getting three, four and five years' extension by a backdoor method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is fair to the community or to the professions as a whole, and I suggest that the Minister ought to regard this as a temporary measure to deal with what appears to be a difficulty confronting him now. Let me make this suggestion: the difficulty is not one or should not be regarded as one of expense.  There is no use in making the case that, if you throw out ten or 12 justices, you have to pay them pensions and also pay their successors.  Where is that to stop?  Will that not apply to every bank, every transport company and every local authority in the country? Will they not all say: &ldquo;Why should we <Col N="1071" /> put these men out on pension and then pay their successors?&rdquo;  The whole system is wrong and I do not think the Bill can be defended on the plea of expense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach of the Minister to this problem apparently is that district justices, in the main, come into the service at a rather late age and, therefore, at the retiring age of 65, it is unlikely that they will be entitled to a full pension, based on years of service.  I have a great deal of sympathy with the justices concerned, but I find it very hard not to reply to that by saying that they applied for these positions with full knowledge of the circumstances and conditions and if the Minister has occasion to appoint one or two justices in the course of the next year or two he will find that the number of applicants is very great.  There will be just as many applicants for the positions if the age is fixed at 65 as there will be if it is fixed at 70.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. D. Burke Mr. D. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desirable to increase the age because I believe that district justices will be able to perform their duties more effectively in view of their greater experience at the later age.  There is, in addition, the whole economic question of carrying people on pensions who become a burden on the rest of the community. It is a rather peculiar doctrine that, when a man reaches the age of 65, he is incapable of paying any useful part in the life of the community and that he must be carried by the State.  The section in the Bill provides for almost every contigency in the matter must comability of a justice to carry out his duties efficiently.  There is a committee, and that committee must consult with the Minister with a view to ascertaining if he has any special knowledge why a particular man may not be continued in office for a longer period.  It is good principle to make people give useful service for a longer period than they have given heretofore and for that reason I give my wholehearted support to the Bill.  I wish that in other Acts in which the retiring age has been fixed at 65 provision were made to allow people to give service <Col N="1072" /> for a longer period rather than to expect the community to carry them on pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBigger" hpid="Professor Bigger Professor Bigger">
      <NameTxt>Professor Bigger</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the contention that the scheme suggested in the Bill in relation to retiring justices should not be adopted. I do not propose to argue at the moment whether the retiring age should be 65 or 70.  In the case of lawyers, they mature late, and I think that long experience of the law is an important point.  If the Minister cares to suggest that the retiring age should be 70, I should be prepared to accept it, but I do not like the provision of a sliding scale, of annual review and these responsible persons having to produce evidence, presumably, that they are reasonably competent in mind and body to carry out their duties.  I think it is undignified for them, and, furthermore, I think it puts a most unfair burden on the Chief Justice and the Minister for Justice.  They have to review these cases and possibly each individual who wishes to continue to the age of 70 will be considered five times, and certainly some justices are going to retire without an extension, while some will get an extension.  There will be accusations of favouritism, jobbery and so on.  A retiring age, I believe, should be fixed, and whether the age be 50, 60, 70 or 80, some people will be competent at a particular age and some incompetent long before it.  I am all in favour of a fixed age, although I am not at the moment arguing whether it should be 65 or 70.  A fixed age, however, would save the Chief Justice and the Minister and his successors from a great deal of embarrassment and unpleasant work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I offer one further suggestion in addition to what has been said by Senator Bigger?  There is the point that this scheme exposes the community to very serious risk in the <Col N="1073" /> administration of justice, because each of these justices will be a temporary judge for five years, and he will do nothing that will jeopardise his chances of a renewal of his tenure of office when it comes before the committee. I think it has been held that, in the case of temporary justices, the best way to have your certificate renewed is to do what the State wants when a criminal, or a person alleged to be a criminal, comes before you.  If you do not create trouble for the State, the Minister gets his conviction and the Attorney-General is not incommoded in enforcing the law.  The justice is almost sure to be regarded as a very competent man; his health will be all right; and he will get his extension. If he does not do that, he will be regarded as being in failing health, as becoming cranky and hard to deal with and he will be turfed out at the end of a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That argument has not quite the validity it appears to have, when you remember that the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court are on the committee, as well as the Attorney-General, and that these two members of the judiciary have no particular interest and ought not to have any particular interest in prosecutions put forward by the Government or the Attorney-General.  If it were the Minister for Justice who was the authority, there might be some validity in Senator Duffy's argument, but, with the committee as suggested here, the idea that a district justice might curry favour with the powers that be is not valid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear Senator Duffy giving expression to what I hope is the Labour point of view, something a little different from that expressed by the representative <Col N="1074" /> of Labour who spoke last night.  I must say that I was surprised to have expounded from the Labour Benches the point of view expressed last night.  We should have from the Minister an assurance that this is a temporary measure to overcome whatever difficulties are in the way at the moment.  It is only in this respect that some of us at any rate would support this section being put into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak with certain personal knowledge of the Minister when I say that the Minister is a very reasonable man.  As far as the interest of the administration of justice is concerned, it is paramount in his view. He would do nothing that would in the slightest endanger the proper administration of justice.  I would appeal to the Minister on these grounds, that whatever case may be made for the extension of district justices, its repercussions on all other aspects of our public life will be very great.  It will make things very difficult.  Senator Burke said he would like to continue people as long as they were competent. That is understandable, but what would happen in the case of dispensary doctors? Are we to be asked to set up a committee of the Irish Medical Association to decide whether the dispensary doctor in a certain dispensary district is competent to carry on after 65?  In the case of teachers, are we to set up a committee of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, and some outside people who might be regarded as independent, to decide whether a teacher should carry on after 65?  It opens the gates very, very wide. I would be quite satisfied with an undertaking by the Minister that the position would be kept under review and that this Bill would not be regarded as a precedent in the case of other professional classes who are affected at present by the retiring age limit of 65.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, if I were establishing a new precedent I would be very slow to do so, but this door is wide open in the case of county registrars, and the Minister for Justice has to decide every year whether, when the county registrar reaches the age of 65, he will go on to 66 and so on until he reaches 70.  My predecessor exercised that power and since the change of Government I have exercised it once.  I exercise it also in the case of a district justice who can hear cases through the medium of Irish.  Therefore, I am not establishing any new precedent as far as justices are concerned.  The intention of this Bill was to appoint two district justices to get rid of the appointment of temporary justices.  In the course of the examination of the Bill in the Department the case was made that where there were experienced justices there should be an extension in the same way as county registrars.  I admit that this is opening a door and that it may extend to the others.  I got permission to introduce the Bill and to bring it through both Houses, but in the background there is the reexamination of the areas and districts in which justices are operating and the extension of their jurisdiction and several others matters of very grave importance.  When these matters come to be examined, I will keep in mind what has been said both in the other House and here and I will certainly bring it to the notice of the Government. I do not want to establish any precedent that would keep people in office longer than they should be kept. I suppose that will apply to all of us at some stage or another.  If I might express a personal opinion, it is extraordinary that we fix arbitrarily the retiring age of 65 for other people when we do not do it for ourselves.</P>

      <P>I think they will for a considerable period.  As vacancies arise, if we do not require justices, we need not fill them.  If, for instance, there is a reorganisation of the areas <Col N="1077" /> it could happen that we might have maybe two too many.  Some people say five; I do not know, but the all important matter is that we cannot dismiss them.  Even this committee set up here would find it extremely difficult to get rid of a justice.  At the moment there is considerable congestion in the City of Dublin.  There are offences which were committed, say, six months ago being tried now.  It is not fair to the accused.  We want to get rid of the arrears, which are out of all proportion.</P>

If the Minister for Justice, with complete knowledge of the circumstances of which I am not aware, decided that, say, 50 justices were necessary and came to this House and said that 50 were necessary and it would obviate the necessity of appointing any temporary justices, I would support him in the belief that it would be more desirable than that we should continue this business of appointing temporary district justices.

      <P>Nevertheless, I do submit that we are appointing a number of justices and the Minister in considering them should have some interview board, as there is in the Local Appointments Commission.  The Local Appointments Commissioners have set a very high standard in this <Col N="1078" /> country.  I think that, no matter what Government may be in power, it is time to consider some system in regard to the appointment of judges and justices as, for instance, the Local Appointments Commission.  Very often in England and elsewhere, such appointments have been political appointments.  I believe that that system is bad.  The time is now ripe, after 27 years' experience of native Government in this country, for some system of appointment.</P>

      <P>The Senator is not only talking of amending the law but of amending the Constitution also. The constitutional position is that the President appoints these judges.  I do not know but that we would want to have a battle royal to amend the Constitution on that particular point.  On the question of the 42, we think that these additional justices will be able, over the year, to do the work the temporary district justices were doing and thereby avoid the necessity of having other appointments made.  In that case the 42 should be sufficient.  If we are able to reorganise the areas&mdash;and we shall have to get considerable consent and agreement from the district justices on that&mdash;we might then have a situation arising in which we could do with a lesser number.  The matter is being examined by a committee. When we get to a certain point I may have to establish a wider committee to have the whole matter examined and to report on it to the Minister and to the Government, so as to get the best result we can from the proposals.</P>

      <P>I can see the Minister's difficulty in regard to the matter.  Since the areas are more or less already mapped out and justices appointed I can quite see a position arising whereby, in some areas such as in the City of Dublin, there would be much more pressure of work on the district justices there than in the rural districts. That is not to say that they are all saints and scholars in the rural districts and that they all keep the law there.  That is not so.  It is probably because they are better able to get away with it.  I feel that there is bound to be greater pressure of work on the District Court in Dublin.  Would it be possible to transfer some of the work, if the pressure was very great on a district justice, to a certain area, say to the West, so that a district justice there would be called on to help with the arrears of work in another district?  I feel that it is only in that way there would be equality of service in the case of district justices.  Further, I feel that it would be possible in that way to ensure that the number outlined in the section would be sufficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1924 there has been legislation enabling the Minister for Industry and Commerce to provide guarantees for loans to assist in industrial development both for new industries and for established concerns wishing to expand their activities where the granting of guarantees was calculated to promote employment and development. The legislation also provided for the actual grant of loans for similar purposes.</P>
      <P>As a preliminary to the guaranteeing or granting of any loan under the Trade Loans Acts it is necessary to consult an advisory committee, representing industrial, commercial and financial interests and the sanction of the Minister for Finance is also required before facilities can be granted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>The first legislative provision was made in the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, 1924, which provided that guarantees or loans might be granted to companies and public authorities for the purpose of meeting expenditure on buildings, plant and machinery and other fixed assets.  The operation of this Act was limited to one year but, by a series of amending Acts from 1925 to 1932, inclusive, the Minister's powers were continued.  In 1933 the scope of the trade loans scheme was extended by the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act of that year which enabled loans to be guaranteed or granted to meet cases where the expenditure to be incurred related to working capital in addition to the acquisition of fixed assets.  At the same time individuals, as distinct from companies, became eligible for trade loan facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The duration of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, 1933, was limited to five years and, on its expiry, the Minister's powers in regard to trade loans were continued for another five years by the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, 1939.  This Act also fixed a limit of £1,000,000 as the total of guarantees and loans which might be granted.  On the expiry of the Act of 1939 the powers of the Minister were extended for a further period of five years by the <Col N="1081" /> Trade Loans (Guarantee) Amendment Act, 1944.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill now before the House is to continue the powers to guarantee or grant loans for a further period of five years.</P>
    <P>It is very desirable that some machinery should continue to exist to enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce to afford financial assistance for industrial development which might not in the ordinary way appeal to the banks or to the Industrial Credit Company Limited.</P>
    <P>The advantage of the trade loans (guarantee) system as compared with ordinary commercial banking facilities is that it provides a fixed long-term period of repayment for which industrialists can budget in their costings. Banks normally require loans to be repaid over a shorter period, usually less than five years, whilst the Industrial Credit Company affords financial assistance to industry mostly in cases of large amounts where public issues can be arranged.</P>
    <P>Under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts, 1924 to 1944, guarantees were actually given in 101 cases, involving a total capital sum of £1,616,711.  In 70 cases the loans totalling £721,471 were fully repaid by the borrowers.</P>
    <P>In 25 cases, involving guarantees totalling £585,240, it was necessary to appoint receivers and some of these companies ceased to operate.  Repayments to the Exchequer in cases where receivers were appointed amount to £149,170.  There have been numerous inquiries recently as to the provision of financial assistance for industrial development in some cases by people contemplating the establishment of new industries and in other cases where industries are already established and the promoters need increased financial facilities.  As guarantees under the Act of 1939 were availed of to the extent of £446,000 only, it is not considered necessary to have any extension of the limitation of the amount&mdash;£1,000,000.  The provision enabling loans to be made has never been utilised and it is rather unlikely that it ever will be.  It is desirable nevertheless that the power should be retained.  The purpose of <Col N="1082" /> the Bill, as I have indicated, is to continue in operation for a further five years legislative provision under which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is enabled to provide loans for industrial development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the introduction of this Bill, particularly at this stage, as it is an indication, if that indication is necessary, of the Government's decision to help the development of our industries in the future as Governments have done in the past. When the Government made the decision some few weeks ago to introduce this measure to make available for Irish industry whatever assistance might be required, it was a time which we might refer to as normal.  In the last few days one would be justified, I should say, in saying that we have entered an abnormal period.  If it has been the previous policy of the Government to encourage the development of Irish industries, then that encouragement should be given more energetically and enthusiastically from this day forward.  The result of recent developments between ourselves and our neighbour is that we have come to the position where we must do whatever we can to make this country self-supporting in any events that may take place in either the near or the distant future. We have made offers for our representatives to take part in the councils of the nations of the world and, as was said yesterday and many times before, we are precluded from doing so.  Lest the events that cast their shadows over Europe take place, we must develop energetically the resources of this country and build up our industries so that we will be in a better position to overcome such circumstances should they arise than we were in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has given us a brief outline of the history of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Fund and, by and large, I think we must acknowledge that it has done a considerable amount of good in building up and in helping to extend and develop our Irish industries.  There has been a very favourable return of the moneys lent.  Eighty-five or 90 per cent. of the total amount of money borrowed has been paid back with interest and <Col N="1083" /> the losses sustained by the State are so small that they must be compensated more than a hundredfold by the development of flourishing industries as a result of that assistance.</P>
    <P>While we welcome the Bill, particularly at this stage, and wish to encourage industrialists to go ahead, at the same time we are not giving them the facilities of doing so.  I understand that a number of suggestions have already been made to the Department of Industry and Commerce in relation to the setting up and extension of industries as well as inquiries into the possibilities of starting industries.  The interested parties have been informed on more than one occasion that the Department is not in a position to advise them at the present time as to what they should or should not do, as the Government is considering the setting up of an advisory council.  That council was announced in February, if I am not mistaken, or at least in March, and we were informed that it would be a very important body, that it would achieve great results and that it was essential that it should function immediately.  Since then very little has been heard and those people who are interested in starting small enterprises or enterprises of an extensive nature are being put from post to pillar by the Department.  They are told that they cannot get the advice or the encouragement necessary until this council, which is only a suggestion so far, considers the matter and gives its direction.</P>
    <P>It is very little use for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to hold meetings of manufacturers and other such people and to advise them to go ahead with the building of industries. It is very little use for him, having first criticised them for engaging in too extensive an advertising campaign, to advise them now to go all out on a large-scale advertising campaign, in order to sell Irish goods even to the Irish people while at the same time there is this hold-up.  If this council is to be set up, if it is to be given certain functions, if its functions are to be so important that the Government will not give directions to persons interested <Col N="1084" /> in the establishment of industry until they first have advice as a result of the inquiries made by that body, then it should be set up without delay.  I say that, not because I have any faith, any belief, in this particular council, but if it is Government policy at the moment to set it up and if industrialists will not get the necessary information from the Department of Industry and Commerce until it gets the imprimatur of this council, then the sooner it is set up the better.</P>
    <P>A campaign has been conducted in this State against Irish industry, and the reaction to that campaign has now set in.  It is to overcome that reaction that the Minister for Industry and Commerce calls Irish manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers together and advises them, appeals to them, to undertake a large-scale national advertising campaign.  The reason for it is to put before our people the importance of buying Irish goods, while, on the other hand, quite a number of our people have engaged, some consciously and some unconsciously, in a blackmail campaign&mdash;if you like to call it that&mdash; against Irish manufacturers.  If many of the statements made by responsible people, by Ministers of the present Government even since they became Ministers, were not given out to the Irish public, it would not have been necessary for the Minister to have called manufacturers together and given them the advice that he has now given.</P>
    <P>We welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It is a demonstration of a continued anxiety on the part of the Government to help Irish industries which exist and to develop new industries; but I would like to say to the Parliamentary Secretary that, if that policy is to be made fully effective, a change of outlook will have to take place and more appreciation must be shown by those people who in the past by their statements have not acted in the best interests of the development of Irish industry.  We should appreciate those who are prepared to put their money into Irish industry rather than the persons who do not do so but are always prepared to put it <Col N="1085" /> into foreign investments.  We hear very little criticism of the latter.  I know people who lost considerable sums because they were patriotic enough to put their money into Irish industry rather than into foreign investments. Of course, there will be cases of persons anxious to make more profit than one would like to see, but I often think that arises from anxiety about the uncertainty of the future of Irish industry. There are many people who would put their money in, whether it is hardearned or easily got, but they see a certain section of our people so hostile that they fear a change of policy may occur with a change of Government and the encouragment or protection given may be withdrawn.  In that event their investments would suffer and it would mean a considerable change in their lives.  Therefore, it is only natural that they should be anxious to make as much as they can while they can.  If the feeling is created that no matter what change of Government takes place and that no matter what has been said in the past by those who are going to occupy the Government benches, the national policy is the policy of developing Irish industry and, where necessary, giving them protection.</P>
    <P>There is no use in saying we are prepared to give protection as long as the industry produces an article as cheaply as it can be imported.  There is a big drive on at the moment in England in searching for world markets and it is a pity that in the last two years many opportunities have been lost by our people.  The enthusiasm for building up our industries has been dampened.  We have lost, I fear, some of the good things that could have been done but for the fears created by statements made, more than by action, and that could have gone a long way to creating industries not alone to supply our own needs but to give us an export market, so essential if we are to get out of our present difficulties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope that whatever has taken place in the past will be forgotten and there will be removed from the people who are interested the fear that has been created up to very recently.</P>

      <P>Some references have been made to losses on loans like this, but if you compare the loses in the Twenty-Six Counties with what has been done in the six counties of Northern Ireland you find they are very small.  I know one industry recently started in the North of Ireland and I had a confidential statement from the Minister of Commerce up there.  They gave, not a loan but a grant of three-fifths of the capital to establish that industry.  I do not think anyone could get a grant, not to talk of getting loans, here.  It is only right that every industry should be investigated when application is made, but that investigation should not be prolonged and passed from Pilate to Herod.  There should be some dispatch.  I agree with Senator Hawkins that promoters of new industries who put their capital in should get every encouragement, no matter what Government is in power.</P>

      <P>I approve of this Bill, but I would like some information which is not available in it. Perhaps if I were familiar with the Acts on which it is based and of which this is a continuance, I would not have to ask.  What type of industries were started with these loans and what type of industries failed?  On what conditions are these loans given? Would they be available to small groups of people in rural areas who might endeavour to start an industry themselves in their locality?  Does the provision made in this Bill supplement the work of the Industrial Credit Corporation? Does it fill a gap that obviously is there, both as to the availability of the money and as to the speed with which it would be given, if it is ever given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hawkins talked about the respect we should show for the people who want to invest their money in this country.  I have a certain amount of respect for any man with money and especially for a man who invests it in his own country, but there are more than investors of money concerned with the welfare of Irish industry.  I may be going a little way outside the scope of this Bill if I say that the people who put their skill and labour <Col N="1087" /> into these industries are more vitally concerned in the welfare of the industry than the man who has put in part of his surplus capital or who has got capital by way of this or a similar Bill from the Government and is risking the State's money and not his own.</P>
    <P>There is not enough attention paid to the fact that the workers themselves have an interest in Irish industry, provided that they are run for the employees, the public and the investors. We must not pay all the attention to the investors and none to the others. If I were a man with £50,000 or £100,000 capital, I could invest it anywhere in the world and live quite contentedly in Ireland, in normal times anyhow&mdash;it may be that the risks are greater now.  Having nothing but the clothes I stand up in and the skill I possess, I must invest that in Ireland or take it with me as an emigrant.  My capital must travel with my personality, as a worker.  Therefore, I have a far greater interest in seeing that the industrial resources of the country are developed than any capitalist could possibly have, and, because I know efforts have been made and are being made to start small rural industries by groups of local people who cannot get capital and who have not enough capital of their own, I am wondering whether loans would be available under the Bill to such people.</P>
    <P>I will give an instance, which has often been referred to in the Press, of a small industry started in Bansha. There was a factory in Bansha which had lain derelict for a number of years. It was an old creamery and it was about to be sold and pulled down by somebody who wanted to use the material, and especially the slates, for the building of a cinema elsewhere. Led by the local priest, the local people came together and bought the factory and site.  Having done so, they had very little capital with which to start an industry, but they did raise a few thousand pounds amongst them.  Even then they had not the experience or a sufficiency of capital and they had to bring in a man with experience and capital who, incidentally, came from their own locality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> Other small industries could start if there was an incentive, if it was possible for local people to buy up existing premises many of which are going to waste through the country and falling into ruin.  If facilities could be given to parish councils or other groups of people to borrow money or to get grants or loans, it would be good policy on the part of the Government to facilitate these people.  The Bansha factory is now employing between 40 and 50 people.  It is making jam, and jam is being made in other factories, but the Bansha factory has a five-day week and is paying better wages than are paid in jam factories in Dublin.  It has kept the people in the locality from leaving the country and has brought back some who had gone to London.</P>
    <P>That was a good investment for the State and for the people of Bansha. I am wondering whether, if I wanted to start an industry merely to make profit for myself and if I applied for money to build a cinema or to lay out a greyhound racing track, would I get it for that purpose and would I be regarded afterwards as a benefactor of the country, or would they give it to me, to Senator Hawkins, Senator Campbell and a few others, if we proposed to start a small factory and put our own labour into it.</P>

I welcome the Bill, of course, and to the degree that the loans given under the Trade Loans Acts up to now have helped in the creation and maintenance of our industries, all sane people must be glad of its existence, and I share the pleasure given expression to by others that the Government has decided that this fund should continue to be available for people who, in given circumstances, will apply for it.  I am sure that Senator O'Farrell was not quite serious when he urged that the money should be made available for the building of cinemas.</P>

      <P>The Bill is distinctly <Col N="1089" /> entitled a Trade Loans Bill, having relation to the productivity of the State and I am not aware that the cinema contributes to either.  It should not be forgotten that, coincident with the moneys available under the Act, the industrialists of this country speculated their own money and took far greater risks than were taken by people who availed of the moneys available under the Act.  That is too easily forgotten.  There has been a rather vile campaign against the industrialists in this country for daring to be successful.  In all other countries, the successful industrialist is held up to public adulation because of the contribution he has made to employment and to the revenues of the State.  Here we are now facing a difficult situation. Senator Hawkins indicated that, because of current events, it may be that this country will once again be thrown more completely on its own resources than it is at present.  All people who have a real interest in the good of the State should refrain from carping criticism of those who have done good in the past and who are doing it at present and helping to strengthen the industrial machine on which the country will depend to a great extent if we have to face the dangers which seem to be looming over us.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of going over all the ground with regard to industrial tariffs and protection and the new Industrial Development Authority, as I do not think these matters come properly within the Bill, but in welcoming the Bill, I think I am entitled to say that the public should be reminded of the very vital part the private industrialist played when he speculated his own money and took risks.  If, in some cases, the rewards were fairly generous, let it be remembered that many of those who put up their own money had to suffer losses for which they got no sympathy of any kind.</P>

      <P>There is a good deal of misapprehension in the discussion of this Bill.  The last Senator who spoke talked about funds being available. There are no funds available under this Bill, so far as I know, and never were. This is a Trade Loans (Guarantee) Bill and it is an important part of our <Col N="1090" /> national machinery for making it possible for people to obtain additional capital, particularly for private industry. It is limited in its scope.  It does not meet quite a number of cases and is entirely confined, as Senator Summerfield pointed out, to trade and industry. The guaranteeing of loans under the Bill is not done easily and without full investigation.  It is not, so far as I know, a method of starting new industries, but it is and has been a very important feature of the development of older industries or the extension of industries.  To the best of my belief, loans are found by the industry concerned and, where for various reasons they have not got sufficient resources to obtain a loan without a guarantee, the State, after investigation, provides the guarantee.  That is something which should be continued.  It is not by any means designed to take the place of the Industrial Credit Company.  It does not deal with large new issues, but it fills an important gap and, as such, should be supported.</P>

Any person or persons anxious to start a new industry or concerned in an existing industry and requiring information, who seeks that information or who seeks advice from the Department will receive it, and is receiving it, if the information is available and if it is possible for the Department to give the advice.  No industrial development which has been brought to the notice of the Department has been held up pending the establishment of the Industrial Development Authority, and the fact that the Government decided to establish that authority has not in any way lessened the existing facilities, nor has it in any way delayed the giving of assistance or advice when required.</P>

    <P>The fact that it was decided to establish it was due to the Government's desire to make available expert advice to people wishing either to expand existing industries or to start new industries, advice which is not readily <Col N="1091" /> available in any Department where the officials are civil servants who have not opportunities of acquiring technical knowledge or experience of commercial undertakings and the ordinary working of industries.  It was merely because the Government came to the conclusion that it was desirable to have expert advice available that that authority was set up.  The advice will be given to the Minister who will still retain the functions he has at present. He will have responsibility in the matter and will be informed as to the best steps to be taken and the facilities which should or should not be provided for a particular industry.</P>
    <P>A good deal of play has been made with the idea that some Ministers have contributed by statements to a feeling of uneasiness.  I want to remind the House that the phrases which Ministers have used have only applied to some industrialists and they made that quite clear.  I think it is no harm to remind Senator Hawkins that if he looks up a speech by a former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs not so very long ago, he will find that he referred to the fact that some traders were dishonest enough to keep two sets of accounts.  I do not remember any criticism by anyone of that speech.  It is significant that, if Minister of the present Government say the same thing in a different way and apply it to a small group, it should receive such attention and publicity, although the same statement made, possibly, more directly and stated as a definite fact, received no comment or criticism when it was made by a Minister of another Government.</P>
    <P>I should say that this Bill provides assistance both in cases where new industries are concerned and in cases where existing industries require further assistance.  It must be in respect of an industry.  It could not be applied in the case that Senator O'Farrell mentioned of a cinema.  The minimum amount guaranteed is £500 and it is generally used in cases where the promoters are unable to provide from their own resources the full amount of the capital required.  An advisory committee must be satisfied.  The advisory committee is an independent <Col N="1092" /> committee, generally an <i>ad hoc</i> committee for each particular case, composed of people who have experience in industry and finance and who are qualified to advise the Minister on the particular application.  It is eminently suitable for small industries because the Industrial Credit Company deals generally with cases where there are larger sums involved.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator O'Farrell who asked what type of industry is covered.  It ranges over all types.  It varies according to the particular case and according to the amount required but it has been utilised by various types of industries in the past and rural industries such as the Senator mentioned are covered, provided they can show that the proposed development is sound.  While it is easy to talk about the successful industries, the Minister has a responsibility to those who guarantee the money as well as to those to whom he is providing the guarantee.  This Bill, as the House is aware, continues these powers for another five years.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary be able to give information as to when the proposed advisory council will be set up and will function because, apart from what the Parliamentary Secretary has already said, I have heard complaints from persons who were interested in industry, on the lines I have indicated to the House, that the Department is not prepared to give any go-ahead order until such time as the proposed industries are examined by this body?  If it is going to be set up, the sooner it is set up the better.  That is not to say that I am in thorough agreement with such a body being set up at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that Seanad Éireann hereby approves of the Sugar (Prohibition of Import) Order, 1949.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators are probably familiar with the terms of this Order. Under the Sugar (Control of Import) Act, 1936, the Government is empowered to prohibit by Order the importation of sugar except under licence.  Import licences may be granted to the Sugar Company.  The first Prohibition Order was made in 1936 and since that time the importation of sugar has been regulated by an annual Prohibition Order.  The current Order is the fourteenth Order of the series and it prohibits the importation of sugar during the period from the 1st May, 1949 to the 30th April, 1950.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Sugar (Control of Import) Act, 1936, provides that every Prohibition Order shall cease to have effect at the expiration of six months from the date thereof unless the Order has been approved by resolution of the Oireachtas passed before the expiration of the said six months.  The current Order was made on the 22nd April, 1949, and consequently, it would expire on the 21st October, 1949, unless confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In normal times when sugar is freely available it is necessary to restrict imports in the interests of the home factories. The annual demand for sugar is at the rate of about 100,000 tons, but the local factories have been able to supply only 80 per cent. of this figure. It is necessary, therefore, usually, to <Col N="1094" /> allow 20,000 tons to be imported and the arrangement under which sugar may be imported only by the Sugar Company enables a uniform price to be maintained for both home-produced and imported sugar.  During the emergency imported supplies of sugar were scarce and it was not possible to import anything like the quantities we required.  However, the position has improved in recent years.  We imported 20,268 tons in 1947 and we imported 40,170 tons in 1948.  The present Order will continue the powers under which it is possible to confine the imports to the Sugar Company.  The Sugar (Control of Import) Act, 1936, also provides under Section 7 (4) that a fee at the rate appointed by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, shall be paid in respect of every licence which is issued authorising the importation of sugar. The object of this provision is to ensure that the Sugar Company, which is the sole licensee, will not make any profits on the importation and sale of sugar.  I, therefore, ask the House to confirm the Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>We approve of the Order.  Would it be possible for the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us the amount of sugar which is extracted from home-grown beet and the amount of sugar which was imported in 1939? The Parliamentary Secretary has said that something in the region of 100,000 tons of sugar are necessary to meet the requirements of our people and that normally some 20,000 tons are imported per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1947, 20,268 tons were imported.  In 1939, 44,977 tons were imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1948, we imported 40,170 tons.  Therefore, I must take it that if we have not already reached the requirement for giving a full supply of sugar to our people we must be very near it.  I should like to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary the urgency and importance of increasing the sugar ration all round for our people.  As the Parliamentary Secretary and members of the House are aware, an allowance was made to sweet manufacturers and other manufacturers, <Col N="1095" /> to hotel keepers and others, whilst on the other hand, the public in general are deprived of their full requirements&mdash;unless they are in a position to pay the increased price of 7½d. per lb.  As a matter of fact one of the promises made by the many Parties during the general election was that if they were elected there would be a more equitable distribution of all the commodities available.  If we are to have that position, then when we have sufficient sugar to make available a greater allowance of it to every person in the State we should do so.</P>

      <P>Does this import, under licence, of 20,000 tons of sugar normally&mdash;or 40,000 tons as it was last year&mdash;include sugar confectionery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we can supply normally only 80,000 tons per annum for our own needs from beet, may I say that I would rather see more sugar imported, in addition to our total home supply, and less manufactured confectionery? I consider that it would be better economy to import the sugar and to make the confectionery here rather than to import the confectionery.  After all, when you import the confectionery you import the sugar.  I would urge the importation of less confectionery not merely because more employment would thereby result in this country but because the confectionery which we would make here would be available at a cheaper price.  Whatever price we may pay for imported raw sugar when it comes in as raw sugar, it will certainly be considerably cheaper than imported sweets and confectionery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> In the past few years this country was flooded with imported sweets and confectionery at terrifically high prices, and they were not up to our own standard. I have no interest in confecfectionery. I have got beyond the stage where sweets attract me but I think it would be much better if we limited the amount of imported manufactured confectionery even if it should mean increasing our imports of raw sugar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators are aware, there has been a very great shortage of sugar not only in this country but elsewhere.  Whilst the supplies have recently improved, it has not been possible up to the present to get sufficient sugar to meet all our requirements. We have endeavoured to do so and I hope we shall succeed in the future in getting sufficient sugar both at home and from abroad to meet all our own requirements.  The question to which Senator O'Farrell refers is not regulated under the Sugar (Control of Import) Act.  The sale of confectionery is a separate matter.  It is true that during 1947 substantial quantities of sweets and jams were imported.  That happened at a time when traders had been without adequate supplies of sweets and jams during the emergency. It was reasonable that they would restock for a potential market.  I think that anyone who has had experience of restocking at that time, particularly of the sweets and jams they imported, will hesitate to embark on such a project again.</P>
