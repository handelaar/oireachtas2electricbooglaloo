      <P>It is proposed to take business as on the Order Paper, except motion No. 5, with regard to the teachers' superannuation scheme, as the Minister for Education is not available.  Senator R.M. Burke does not desire to take up motion No. 6, owing to a recent bereavement in his family.  If we have time to-day, therefore, we will go on to motion No. 7.</P>
      <P>The first Order on the Dáil Order Paper to-day is the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill.  The Minister for Finance is anxious to get that Bill to-day in the Dáil, and if he does&mdash;it will presumably be a Money Bill&mdash;we might be asked to meet to-morrow to consider it.  I think the House should know that at the earliest moment.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to continue, with the approval of the Oireachtas, certain protective duties which were imposed by Orders made under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932.  Section 1 (2) of that Act provides that unless an Order made under the Act is confirmed by the Oireachtas within eight months <Col N="694" /> after the making of the Order, such Order shall cease to have statutory effect at the expiration of the period. Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 233) Order of 1948, which is referred to at reference 1 in the Schedule to the Bill before the House, imposes a duty on malt extract and preparations of malt extract and fish liver oil, and was made on the 6th July, 1948. The eight months' period will end on the 5th March, and if the duty is not to lapse the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas must be obtained before that date.</P>
      <P>Senators may like to have some particulars of the purposes of the duty and of the industries which are covered by the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act.  The production of malt extract was undertaken by one firm in 1944 and by another in 1946.  Malt extract is used, not only in the bakery and confectionery trade, but also as a pharmaceutical preparation.  Either of the two firms engaged in the production are capable of meeting the total home market, which is estimated at 300 tons per annum.</P>
      <P>Prior to the imposition of the duty, the home manufactured supply was meeting approximately half the market, the other half being met by imported supplies.  Direct employment in the industry is afforded to approximately 40 persons and it is hoped, with a greater supply of barley in the coming season that increased employment may be available.  The prices of the home products are approximately the same as those of the imported, but it is difficult for these firms which are only recently established to compete with firms who have a long tradition in this trade, and who have the benefit of world-wide markets and the added benefit of world-wide advertising&mdash; which, as Senators may know, is of considerable benefit to anything in the nature of a pharmaceutical preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other duties are imposed on glass jars and were first imposed as far back as 1924 for the protection of the Irish Glass Bottle Company.  As the company's range increased, the duties were gradually extended to cover the entire home production of bottles; and in 1939 the duty on beer bottles was 75 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>, 50 per cent. <Col N="695" /> preferential, with a minimum duty of 8/- per gross, 5/4 preferential; and in the case of other glass bottles and jars, 90 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>, 60 per cent. preferential.  In 1947, the Irish Glass Bottle Company installed new plant and production increased by approximately 20 per cent.  Further additional plant was provided early last year and production has increased by a further 16 per cent.  This eliminated some of the shortages which existed here and enabled the company to meet the entire home demand for the types of jars and bottles which come within the scope of the duty.  In order to assist the company to use to the fullest extent the new plant, and to expand the range of bottles manufactured, it is desirable to continue this protection.</P>
    <P>The other duty imposed under Emergency Order No. 235 of 1948 continues the duties on battery plates and accumulators. The manufacture of lead acid battery plates was begun in 1936 and the firm provides the various types of battery plates which are used here and gives employment to a fairly large number of people.  It is difficult again for the home manufacturer to meet competition from outside, particularly in view of the fact that the outside manufacturers have the advantage of the motor-car industry elsewhere, which, of course, has a much bigger market than it has here.</P>
    <P>The remaining duty which is covered by this Bill is the customs duty on footballs of 37½ per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> and 25 per cent. preferential.  That duty was increased to 40 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> and it is still 25 per cent. preferential. The problem here is that our manufacturers have to compete with footballs made in India, where labour costs and the costs of raw materials are very much lower than they are here.  It is impossible for our manufacturers to compete with footballs of Indian origin.  The standard quality of Indian footballs were available last year at 10/- each.  The cost of similar footballs manufactured here is over 13/-, so that it is difficult, in view of the lower labour costs and cheaper raw materials in India, for the Irish manufacturer to compete on anything like an equitable basis.  Accordingly, I ask <Col N="696" /> the Seanad to confirm the duties which are imposed under the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little knowledge of the particular articles which are covered by the Orders which this Bill confirms, but as far as I know, little if any exception has been taken to them.  I cannot remember any case where a duty was put on and where there were very strong grounds for opposition that somebody did not come after me with, at any rate, plausible reasons.  My first reason for rising was to support this Bill and secondly because this House has almost for gotten the existence of measures of this kind.  We used to have them every two or three months up to 1939-40.  Since then we have had very few indeed.  I do not know how many, but the number was very small because circumstances had completely changed and in many cases where goods were protected either by quota or by tariff, the previous Government&mdash;and I think rightly&mdash;removed or suspended the protection several years ago without any objection on the part of manufacturers. There was no use in their being dogs in the manger because when they could not get raw materials to produce goods at home, if anything was to be obtained abroad no one wanted to prevent the people from obtaining it.  In the emergency period there was a changed situation <Col N="699" /> during which protection was unnecessary. There may have been one or two tariffs but at the moment I cannot think of any.  Now the position is changing again although it has not changed completely, and it will be necessary for the Government to watch the situation very carefully.  While in certain trades there is still an element of scarcity, in others there are grave dangers of excessive imports seriously upsetting the home market and home employment.  It is all by no means simple.</P>
      <P>I understand that Senator Buckley thinks that there should be more Orders in this list, but I do not think he mentioned any particular one.  If he had, it is possible that I might or might not have agreed with him.  I can see no virtue in having a tariff for the sake of having a tariff, but there is an absolute necessity for wise protection so as to maintain employment here.  No rigid rule, as far as I can discover, can apply to every case. None of us wants to have protection to bolster up something which is grossly inefficient, nor do we want to destroy industries which are quickly becoming highly efficient by requiring too rigid a standard.  That is equally bad. There is need for commonsense and wisdom, and I hope that the question of protecting Irish industries will not become a Party issue, but that it will be judged on its merits and in a sympathetic way and that the Government will get the best possible advice from all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no rigid rule, as I say, but I would prefer, where it is practicable, that, in the present state of the world, protection should be by means of quota rather than tariff.  If it is protection for an industry which is able to supply 95 per cent. or 100 per cent. of the home demand, then I think a tariff is the simplest and best method, because, in fact, you are not going to import anything other than a few articles and you are not adding to the price by the tariff.  If, however, you want to deal with an industry where the home supply is 50 or 60 per cent., and where, of necessity, there <Col N="700" /> must be a substantial import, then the quota system is very much wiser.  It is sometimes said, with very little justification, though it could happen, that if you apply a quota the people who import the article at possibly a cheaper price will add to the price and get extra profit.  My own experience is that that only applies where the quota is very small; where the quota is substantial with, therefore, an element of competition, it is unlikely that it would occur.</P>
    <P>From my experience&mdash;and I have fair experience&mdash;I do not think that Irish prices in many industries at the present time are substantially higher&mdash; if they are higher at all&mdash;than import prices.  There are glaring exceptions to this, but there are other cases where Irish prices are actually cheaper.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I do not think it will be necessary to protect because of higher price here.  But that price, if it is to be a reasonable one, can only be maintained by an Irish manufacturer if the industry is able to get substantially the whole of the home market.  Nothing will raise prices more than a reduction of output.  A substantial reduction of output by a manufacturer will mean that he is running at a loss, which he cannot do for any length of time without raising his price.  Therefore, in regard to protective measures, whether by quota or by tariff&mdash;and, personally, I prefer the quota system&mdash;we must try to ensure that there will be a maximum of production in the industry concerned.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill.  I think these measures are proper measures, and I hope that we will have a number of others similar to them in a short time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering a simple Bill of this kind we should remember that not all of the industries we have at the present time can be regarded as 100 per cent. efficient, judging by world standards.  A point which I think should be stressed is that it is one thing for an industry to be 100 per cent. efficient but that it is more important, in the case of an industry which is not 100 per cent. efficient, if it fills a niche in our national economy. That situation was well demonstrated <Col N="701" /> during the war years.  Many of our industries very considerably assisted in the maintenance of a standard of life which would otherwise not have been possible during those years without them.</P>
      <P>Naturally, in the case of a simple little Bill like this, we are not going to debate in full the subject of protection. I support what Senator Douglas has said.  It is well that we have an occasion each year on which we can discuss in some small measure these particular statutes and that we can examine the industries which are actually being protected. So far, like Senator Douglas, I have not heard of anyone whose interests might be affected by these duties making a complaint and I therefore support the measure.</P>
      <P>I want to stress, however, now that there is so much talk about Irish industries and the prices of Irish goods and so forth, that it is all too easily forgotten how very vital a part some of these industries played in the recent years of emergency.  If we are to have an economy which will make us less dependent on outside sources of supply than has been the case heretofore, we shall have to continue certain industries which might not be regarded as being at the moment 100 per cent. efficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking advantage of this opportunity to reconsider the articles that have been subject to duty, I should like to raise a point about malt extract and malt extract plus liver oil.  From my experience of analysis, I know that this country can produce malt which is equal to any we have come across.  We have first-rate malt and we have good chemists and we can produce a first-rate product.  I am not so happy, however, about malt extract and fish liver oil.  Malt is a material which is used in confectionery and in many other ways, and it is used for medicinal purposes too.  But malt extract with fish liver oil is used as a medicine alone.  It is of no use in confectionery and so forth.  Its particular purpose is to give the necessary vitamins to the people who take it. We can get the malt and prepare the malt extract, but we have not got the <Col N="702" /> halibut oil, the cod or the fish liver oil. That has to be imported and blended.</P>
      <P>It is quite possible to get a malt cod liver oil here which, although very good as regards the malt, may not be quite so good as regards the fish liver oil. The foreign manufacturers are very careful about that point and in the products which they market they specify the vitamins and so forth in the particular product.  I think we should, where there is a duty on the mixture &mdash;on the malt and the fish liver oil&mdash; make it necessary for the local manufacturer to specify the strength of his product.  It should be remembered that he is producing a product and in competition with the products of American and British laboratories.  A watch should be kept to ensure that an inferior cod liver oil mixture does not appear here masquerading under a nice coloured label and so forth.  We want a guarantee as regards this fish liver oil.  The malt may be all right.</P>
      <P>I would, therefore, much sooner see &ldquo;fish liver oil&rdquo; left out altogether and leave in &ldquo;malt extract&rdquo; alone, because I think that would be much safer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have intervened were it not for the remarks of Senator Professor Fearon. If the Parliamentary Secretary and the members of the Seanad follow his advice and confine the tariff only to malt extract they may put the makers of malt extract in this country completely out of business.  The malt extract is used for medicinal purposes with halibut oil or with cod liver oil but it is used for other purposes, too, and if it is made more difficult to produce in this country or if the protection from the foreign article which the industry gets is removed it may mean that this market will be flooded in that respect.  I should like to know if Senator Professor Fearon has any reason to suppose that the article produced in this country is inferior to the foreign article and, if it is not, why it should be removed from this tariff protection which is given.  I have no reason to assume that the cod liver oil and malt extract produced here is inferior to that produced in America and <Col N="703" /> Britain although that would seem to be the inference to be taken from the Senator's speech.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned footballs.  He may think that my day for footballing is over but he mentioned, I think, that the Irish-made footballs cannot be produced because those coming from India are 13/-each cheaper.</P>

      <P>How many people are employed in this country in the making of footballs and what are the wages paid?  Footballs can be made from leather which is tanned in this country.  They can be cut out, in various patterns or sections, with a shaped knife.  Then it is only a matter of stitching the various sections together either by hand or by machine. That work is probably done by girl labour and, for all I know, in some back lane by underpaid labour.  I wonder whether an industry which probably employs only a few girls or, at most, only a few men ought to be protected. If you reduce protection to that level you make a complete farce of it.  If anybody in a back lane is entitled to protection for some little commodity which he makes I think protection&mdash; with the principle of which I am in favour and which, I think, is important&mdash;will become farcical.  Take, for example, somebody making razor strops or something like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst being fully in support of this Bill and agreeing with the necessity for protection in Irish industry there are one or two points to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  I think we would welcome a more scientific approach to this whole subject.  At the present time, we are very much concerned with the cost of living.  Tariffs have in the past been used ostensibly, and probably quite honestly, to protect a certain industry. But in doing so, by the wording of the particular Bill under which the commodity or product is tariffed, we get a whole lot of commodities brought into the net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result is merely an increase in <Col N="704" /> the taxation gathered from these duties and a consequent raising of the cost of living.  There should be much greater latitude in the system of issuing licences.  In the past, it has not been possible to get a licence for the import of goods to which I refer, namely, those which it was never intended should be protected and which are not made here.  There is the greatest difficulty in getting a duty-free licence issued.  One of the conditions attaching to the issue of such a licence has been that you must get a written letter from the manufacturer stating that he cannot make the goods which you wish to buy, before a licence is issued, and anybody who is in business will know that to get a letter on these lines from a manufacturer has been extremely difficult.  I suggest that the whole system of issuing licences should be gone into, so that, while fully protecting the Irish manufacturer, the cost of living will be kept down.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a campaign in progress at present for the imposition of more tariffs, on the plea that there is dumping.  That may be so in certain cases, but, as a distributor, I should like to point out that not only in this country, but in America and England &mdash;and, according to last Sunday's papers, in Western Germany&mdash;there is a definite&mdash;I will not call it a slump, because that is a horrible word to send around &mdash; deflationary movement. That is to say that there now are available more goods than there is money to buy them.  That being so, if manufacturers at present are feeling a slight breeze and are not fully booked up with orders, it does not necessarily mean that there is dumping.  I know that, in the distributive trades, we have had to pull in in the matter of ordering from all manufacturers, both home and abroad, and to impose a tariff because of a plea of dumping will merely put up the price of goods still further.  Surely if the manufacturer wants to sell his goods, the way to do it is not to put up the price of the retailers' goods still further.  I want to point out to those who claim that there is dumping that that in fact is not the case.  There is definitely a world recession at the moment and we <Col N="705" /> have all to bear with it here.  I have pleasure in supporting the Bill.</P>

      <P>I was about to suggest that it is not therefore necessary for us to debate the general question of tariffs.  I was about to refer only to this imposition of duty on malt extracts and preparations of malt extracts and fish oil, to the extent that it affects the price of medicines.  I had a very extraordinary experience some years ago with regard to the difference in the cost of medicine here and in Great Britain.  A middle-aged lady living near me was suffering from serious heart trouble.  Certain tablets, which cost a tremendously high amount, were prescribed for her, and she asked me, when I was going to London on one occasion, if I would see whether these tablets could be got there and what the price was.  I made the necessary inquiries and found that the Dublin price was exactly three and a half times the price at which they could be obtained in London.  I had numerous other similar experiences after that, because I made special inquiries and I found that the prices ranged very often from two to four times the London price.  Much of that seemingly was due to the fact that certain medicines had anything from 50 to 80 per cent. tariff imposed on them. They were brought in here in bulk and simply repacked by a few little girls for very low wages and then retailed to the public at two and three times the price at which they could be obtained elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A tariff on medicine is one of the meanest of all forms of tariffs, if it has the result of driving up the price.  It is simply putting a premium on illness and it puts on rich and poor alike an intolerable embargo in the fight for health.  I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary's Department should make inquiries to see to what extent <Col N="706" /> there is an unjustifiable difference between the price of medicine here and elsewhere and to what extent even that intolerable state of affairs has resulted in increasing employment here.  We hear a lot of talk about this particular matter of extract of malt and so on, and we are told that it gives employment to 40 people or so.  No doubt, some of these are juniors, working for very low wages&mdash;some may be little girls&mdash;and the total effect on the economy of the country must in any case be negligible.  The principal problem is the extent to which that sort of tariff is allowed to operate against the effective war on disease and illness, and I hope sincerely that any development in the future will tend towards making available to the people at prices they can pay the medicines necessary to keep them in proper health and well-being.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is scarcely any topic on which there is so much misinformed criticism and talk as the whole question of protection.  It is because of that fact and because of the difficulties which this Government, and, for that matter, any Government, has in getting accurate information and deciding on the right measure, as well as the right form of protection, that the decision to set up an industrial development authority was taken. I need not at this stage embark on a discussion of that subject, but it is well to remember, when people talk of protection, that the degree of protection for one industry may be totally inadequate for another and <i>vice versa.</i> The protection, or the form in which assistance is given, may be sufficient to keep one industry going while far less protection, a much smaller tariff or a quota of narrower dimensions, might equally sustain another industry, so that, when discussions on protection take place, it is well to realise that the extent of protection varies from industry to industry and that one cannot generalise freely without falling into serious errors.  For that reason, I think that some of Senator Ó Buachalla's remarks were extremely wide of the mark.  The protection on one of the industries covered was first given as far back as <Col N="707" /> 1924, so that there is no recent development in this country of providing protection.  Protection was given and has been given in varying degrees, possibly in different forms, but given and given over a wide range of industries, by three Governments.  The future of protected industries in this country will depend, and many of them will succeed, on the understanding that they will get protection both from this Government and, I have no doubt, from any Government that may succeed it.</P>
      <P>Senators have mentioned individual points on these particular duties and I would like to deal with them.  Senator Fearon mentioned the question of the duty on fish liver oil and the effect it may have on the price of medicines, as did Senator J.T. O'Farrell.  It is true that there is a draw-back to some slight extent, in having protection on fish liver oil, particularly as it is used in pharmaceutical preparations, but unless the firm manufacturing the malt extract and fish liver oil got protection on both commodities they would not be able to continue in production. As I announced at the outset, the price of the home-manufactured product is approximately the same as the imported one and the Minister for Health had to be satisfied before this duty was imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true, as Senator O'Farrell says, that any protection which would put up on our people the cost of necessary medicines or the cost of any of these tonics would be not only undesirable but entirely unjustified.  That differentiates the protection that is given in the case of footballs, because footballs, while they are in wide use, are not entirely necessary and it is reasonable to give a measure of protection in order to keep an industry of that kind going.  The number of people employed in it is quite small, but for the small increase in the cost of footballs here as compared with footballs which are available from India, it is reasonable that we should assist the industry, particularly as the firms <Col N="708" /> engaged in it are not entirely or exclusively devoted to the production of footballs.</P>
    <P>The only other matter raised was the question of a recession, which Senator McGuire mentioned.  As Senators are aware, when different duties have to be confirmed they will come before both Houses, and if any particular duty has been affected by conditions elsewhere it will be possible for Senators to discuss it when it comes up.  I think it is well to make these observations on protection and on the loose talk that sometimes is associated with it.  In one recent case, where protection was given in order to assist an industry and to enable it to continue in production and consequently to keep people employed, it was found that while the protection enabled the industry to continue, it put up the cost of the raw materials which that factory was making on other users. The danger of consequent unemployment as a result of increased costs of raw materials is one which few people who criticise either the delay or the failure to give protection in a particular case ever take into consideration. It is on a matter of that kind that accurate information and the experience of people who have available to them the effect of protection can be of benefit to the Government.  It is because of that, as well as the other matters that I have mentioned, that it is essential that any Government or any Minister should have available to him every aspect of protection, not alone the effect on the particular industry protected but also the effect which that protection may have either on the cost of the finished product or, more especially in cases where a protective industry is supplying raw materials, on the cost of the raw materials for other industries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general purpose of this measure is to make more money available for Gaeltacht housing and to bring the level of the grants available under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts into line with the revised grants for which provision has been made under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948.  It is also designed to facilitate the erection and improvement of dwelling-houses in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Under the present Bill, provision is being made to increase the total amount of grants and loans from £750,000 to £900,000.  This is a net increase of £150,000.  This sum, together with a balance of £90,000 remaining from the £750,000 to which I have referred, will give us a total provision of £240,000 for new grants and loans for housing in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to the time of the passing of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, the grants available under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts for persons erecting houses for their own occupation were greater than those obtainable under the <Col N="710" /> general Housing Acts.  By Section 3 of this Bill, I propose to restore the differential in favour of applicants from the Gaeltacht.  Under sub-section 1 (a) of Section 3, I propose to increase the grants in respect of dwelling-houses, the erection of which commenced on or after the 1st day of November, 1947, to the sums specified in the First Schedule to this Bill.  The maximum grants which could be made heretofore were related to the aggregate rateable value of all the property of the applicant. They were: (a) £90 where the aggregate rateable value did not exceed £5, (b) £85 where the aggregate rateable value exceeded £5 but did not exceed £10, and (c) £80 where the aggregate rateable value exceeded £10.  For the future, I propose that the making of grants on a valuation basis shall be discontinued in respect of applications sanctioned under Section 3 of this Bill, and that the grants in respect of dwelling-houses the erection of which commenced on or after 1st November, 1947, will be as laid down in the First Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The maximum improving grant under the present Acts is £40.  Sub-section (1) (b) of Section 3 provides for the increase of this improving grant to a maximum of £80, in the case of an improvement or extension commenced on or after 1st November, 1947.</P>
    <P>The new housing grants of sub-section (1) (a) of Section 3 represent an increase in each case of £25 over and above the maximum grants available for similar houses under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1946.  The increased improving grant provided for in sub-section 1 (b) of Section 3 is the same as that available under that Act.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 3 makes provision for grants in respect of dwelling-houses the erection of which commenced on or after the 1st November, 1945, but which were not occupied on or before 1st November, 1947.  The amounts of these grants will be as specified in the Second Schedule to the Bill.  These grants, which are to be made available irrespective of rateable values, represent an increase in each case of £17 10s. 0d. over and above the maximum grants available in similar <Col N="711" /> cases under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948.</P>
    <P>I also propose in this Bill to increase the amount in the case of an improving grant where the application therefor was made before the 1st day of November, 1947, and where the improvement or extension, in respect of which the application was made, was commenced but not completed before the 1st November, 1947.  In sub-section (3) (a) and (b) of Section 3, I am making a provision to have the improving grant in such cases increased to £60.  This is in line with what has been done under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948.</P>
    <P>Under sub-section (4) of Section 3, I am providing that the amount of any grant which may be sanctioned under Section 3 of this Bill will not be subject to the limitations imposed by the relevant sections of the 1929 and 1934 Acts, whereby the amount of the individual grant was governed by the aggregate rateable value of all the property of the applicant.  The deletion of reference to rateable value will facilitate administration.</P>
    <P>As the Acts stand at present, a person to whom a grant has been made may also be provided with a loan when it is apparent that the assistance given by way of grant is not sufficient to enable the work of house erection or improvement to be undertaken.  In the case of the erection of a new dwelling-house the maximum loan which may be sanctioned at present is £80.  I propose in Section 4 to increase the amount of this loan to a new maximum of £100. In this connection, I am providing in the Second Schedule of this Bill for the repeal of sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the 1934 Act which limited the aggregate amount of building grant and loan in any individual case to £160, as such a provision could no longer apply in the altered circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the cessation, after the enactment of this Bill, of the sanctioning of grants for the erection of poultry-houses and piggeries.  In order to provide for any cases where the sanction has already been issued and where the work has not so far been completed the relevant sections in the 1929 Act are not being repealed.  The <Col N="712" /> Minister for Agriculture has agreed that the provision in the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts for grants for poultry-houses and piggeries is no longer necessary in view of the farm buildings scheme being administered by his Department, under which larger grants are available than those provided for under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts.  These grants are on a generous scale ranging from £24 to £12 for piggeries, and £20 to £10 for poultry-houses.  The maximum grant which can be made for a poultry-house or a piggery under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act is £5.</P>
    <P>By the proposed cessation of grants for poultry-houses and piggeries I am removing what was an obstacle to the speedy erection of dwelling-houses. The sanctioning of grants for house erection under the present Acts is conditional on the provision of suitable accommodation for poultry and pigs, and in this way there was an element of compulsion which slowed down the building of dwelling-houses.  This compulsion I propose to remove, thus freeing myself and future applicants from any entanglements which might impede the housing drive in the Gaeltacht. Accordingly, I am also making provision in Section 6 for the repeal of the sections of the 1929 Act in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. Last June, in the debate on the Finance Bill, I pleaded with the Minister for Finance to make money available for Gaeltacht housing.  This Bill follows the usual procedure of making increased grants available to those residing in the Gaeltacht over and above that which is provided under the Local Government (Housing) Acts. Last year the Minister for Local Government introduced a generous measure governing the whole country.  When the provisions made in this Bill are compared with the provisions made by the Minister for Local Government last year one finds that the increased benefits for the Gaeltacht are not all that we would wish them to be.  I regret that the Minister did not give us more information.  The statement he has given deals more or less with the various sections.  The Minister has failed to give the House a broader outfit <Col N="713" /> line or picture of what is proposed, of the work to be done or the steps to be taken in dealing with the matter.  The only information that the Minister has given us is that in 1929 the first Housing Act was introduced in which there was provision for the expenditure of a sum of £250,000.  Since then a Bill was introduced in 1931 and under various Acts that were passed from 1931 to 1939 further sums were provided which brought the total amount made available to £750,000.  This Bill provides only £150,000.  It is proposed that that sum should be expended on the erection of new houses in the Gaeltacht districts.</P>
      <P>With that sum of £150,000 there is also available a sum of £90,000, being a balance unexpended owing to the scarcity of materials and the difficulties in general of building since 1939. The Bill provides for grants up to £250 and a loan of £100, making a total of £350.  There is a sum of £240,000 available. If we were to expend all that money in a year or two years we would have erected from 600 to 700 houses in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>We have expended £750,000.  I would like to have from the Minister further information: How many houses have been erected in the various districts of the Gaeltacht since the first Gaeltacht Housing Bill was introduced; how many of the people concerned availed of loans to supplement the grant; how many availed of the combined purchasing scheme in procuring building materials; how many of those applicants erected piggeries or poultry houses?  Has a survery or an estimate been made of the total number of houses that would be required in the normal way throughout the Gaeltacht? This Bill is limited in so far as it is confined to particular sections of the country and it is limited further by the fact that the applicant must be in the position of having a house already.  It is not proposed under this Bill to give grants to people throughout the Gaeltacht to erect a house in any place they wish; it will only be given for the replacement of a dwelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would like to have from the Minister some information as to what it is proposed to do with the other people in <Col N="714" /> these districts and how many it is proposed to transfer to other parts of the country in the migration scheme.  What is the position of young workers in the various Gaeltacht industries who would wish to get married and settle down while continuing in their employment? They will be debarred from the benefit of these grants.  That is quite a number of questions but it is all information which I, and, I am sure, the other members in this House, would like to have.</P>
    <P>The purpose of introducing this measure at the outset was to give special consideration and help to Irish speakers and sufficient is made available to enable them to erect poultry houses and piggeries.  Is it a condition that the applicant must be an Irish speaker or does it apply to every person residing in the districts scheduled in the 1929 Act regardless of whether they are Irish speakers or not or whether Irish is the spoken language of the home?  I take it from a statement made on the Committee Stage of this Bill in the other House that the latter is the case.  The Minister gave an indication then that he did not propose to enforce any regulations regarding the Irish language being the spoken language of the home.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the terms of this Bill in relation to the provisions of the Local Government Housing Act of 1948.  The 1948 Act made provision for the payment of a grant of £135 to a person building a three-roomed house without water supply through a public utility society.  The present Bill makes provision for £15 extra.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose the house was not being built through a public utility society, in the original case what would the grant be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>£150, a difference of £25.  It is not so many months since that Act was passed and the same conditions apply.  Since 1932 where a person was building through a utility society the grant was increased by £10.  I know from my own experience that people in the Gaeltacht of Galway who propose to build a house by the aid of the grant would build <Col N="715" /> through a utility society.  I am quite confident that if the Minister looks up the figures he will find that the majority of houses erected in Connemara, despite the fact that the grant was increased under the Gaeltacht Housing Act as compared to the local government grant, were built by means of a local government grant.  This Bill provides £15 more than the former grant and it makes available £100 as a loan, but a person building through a utility society in any part of the country has the benefit of £10 extra and can also get a loan from the local authority, the county council or the borough council of the area in which the house is being built, of up to 80 per cent. of the value of the building. A man building in the Gaeltacht under this scheme is compelled to be satisfied with the grant plus £100.  Those of us who know the difficulties of building in districts like Connemara know full well that it is more costly and difficult, as sand and materials have to be carted very long distances, than in districts where materials, transport, tradesmen and skilled labour are available.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to remove the valuation basis and I regret that decision because under previous Acts the grant was determined on the applicant's valuation, thus acting as a brake and seeing that the person with the lowest valuation and in need of the greatest help got the greatest help.  I fear that because of our opening this door the greater number of applicants will be the type of person who could almost afford to build a house without any aid from the Government or local authority and not the people for whom we should cater most.  I would prefer if the Minister had given greater grants and greater facilities for loans to people with the lowest valuations and eliminated the people who could afford to build.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has also taken steps to remove from the conditions of erecting a house in the Gaeltacht that of providing a poultry house and piggery. I regret that the Minister has taken that decision.  Whether a house is built in the Gaeltacht or any other part of the country I believe that the <Col N="716" /> time of building it, when the materials are there and the workmen are on the job, is the time, if possible, to get out-offices and piggeries.  It can be done more efficiently and cheaply.  Apart from that it is an inducement to people to build them.  I disagree with the Minister when he said that there was compulsion to build them in the other Acts.  There was no compulsion whatsoever. Section 7 of the 1929 Act deals with circumstances where the Minister may refuse a grant:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  there is in existence or will be provided with the aid of a grant under this Act or otherwise accommodation for domestic poultry ancillary to and suitable and sufficient in the opinion of the Minister for such dwelling-house, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the Minister is of opinion that, having regard to all the circumstances, the occupier of such dwelling-house could not be expected to keep domestic poultry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I assume that was inserted in the Act of 1929 in order to provide for the very rare case where an applicant may not, for one reason or another, be in a position to keep poultry or pigs and the Minister, under the circumstances, could pay the grant.  Therefore, there was no compulsion.  The Minister, both here and in the Dáil, informed us that it would be much better to remove this condition from the erection of houses in the Gaeltacht areas and to allow the applicant to make application to the Department of Agriculture for the grants that will be made available from that Department.  Is that not asking people to do things in a roundabout manner?  They have, first, to fill up an application form.  I am sure 99 per cent. of the people who will apply under this Act for a housing grant will have to travel whatever distance may separate them from the local solicitor to fill up the form.  The application is granted.  The house is begun and finished and the grant or loan is paid. They have then to make another journey, probably to the same solicitor, to ask him to make another application&mdash; this time to the Department of Agriculture for a grant or loan to erect a poultry-house or a piggery.  All the material that would have helped to <Col N="717" /> erect the out-office has by this time been removed from the dwelling-house.</P>

They would be removed because the contractor, having completed the erection of the dwelling-house, would have departed, and until the dwelling&mdash;house is completed the piggery or the poultry-house may not be erected under the grants that may be available from the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <P>Quite a number of them have been liquidated recently. The Minister for Agriculture appealed for an increase in our pig population and in our poultry stocks.  Here is one way of encouraging that matter&mdash;particularly when provision was made for it in the past.  The Minister may say that the grants from the Department of Agriculture for the erection of poultry-houses and piggeries are more <Col N="718" /> generous.  That is no excuse.  If the Minister thinks these grants are more generous for those people to help them to do what he would like them to do, why not increase the grants this year for the erection of piggeries and poultry-houses?  Let the one application suffice.  Let the one inspection be sufficient.  Let the one contractor do the job.</P>
      <P>The proposals the Minister put before this House are not sensible.  They are not going to achieve their purpose. They may achieve one thing, namely, delay, and they may save some few pounds.  If that is the purpose then it is all very well, but if it is the purpose of the Minister, as I am sure it is, to help the people in the Gaeltacht areas to better their conditions, to have better houses, then I think, taken in conjunction with that, that he should revert to the old practice of making available at the same time the facilities for piggeries and poultry-houses.  It is now over 12 years since the other Housing Bill was put before this House and quite a number of people have completed their houses under it.  My regret is that this Bill was not introduced earlier.  Quite a number of people in the Gaeltacht areas have applied to the Department of Local Government in this connection. Grants, under the Local Government Housing Grants, have been sanctioned and the work has begun.  The sum of £15, of which they are deprived, is small, but to those people £15 is £15. I would urge the Minister, even at this late hour, to consider the matter of increasing the grant.</P>

      <P>Memorandum A of the Local Government Housing Acts, 1939-1948, sets out free grants from State funds.  In rural Ireland, as the Minister and members of this House are well aware, the general procedure is that houses are erected for members by public utility societies.  There is an increase of £10 to be availed of because there is a public utility society <Col N="719" /> in the area.  The applicants avail of that society, particularly because in the majority of cases it issues credit notes to enable them to start the work and to complete it.  In the case of a three-roomed house a grant of £135 is available from the Local Government Housing Grant.  The Minister's proposal is to increase that sum by £15, and so on, up to the five-roomed house.  In each case the valuation of £15 is the same.</P>
      <P>Another very serious aspect of building in the Gaeltacht is the difficulty of securing materials.  In the past, a combined purchase or contract system enabled those who wanted to erect houses under these Acts to get the materials.  I do not see any provision in that respect.  I am sure the Minister will be able to tell the House that that system will continue because otherwise this Act will not be effective. The persons whom it is proposed to benefit would not be in a position to purchase the materials except in that way.</P>
      <P>There are some other points which I should like to raise now but which, I think, would be more appropriate on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>To sum up, I should like the Minister, before the Committee Stage if possible, to give me the answers to the questions I have asked.  How many houses have already been erected?  How many houses, in the Department's opinion, are still required in the Gaeltacht areas and will he be prepared to drop his proposal to depart from the valuation basis?  Will the Minister, if he is satisfied that the provision is not already sufficient, increase the grants and have it incorporated in the Bill as in the 1939 Act and all the other Bills passed in connection with this matter of making provision for these people in regard to erecting their piggeries and poultry-houses?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Two points have been stressed by Senator Hawkins to which I desire to direct attention.  In one instance, I am in agreement with the Senator, but, in the other, I differ very considerably from him.  Where he dealt with the question of the grant being related to rateable value, I am in <Col N="720" /> agreement with him.  I cannot understand why a person living in the Gaeltacht, with property of a poor law valuation of £100, £50 or £30, should get a larger grant when building a house than the person a couple of hundred yards on the other side of the border between the Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht area, with the same valuation. It seems to me that the special provision which has been made for a number of years in respect of the Gaeltacht was made on the assumption that you were dealing with very poor people, people with limited incomes, people with small holdings, people who normally would never be able to accumulate sufficient money to build their own houses or provide buildings for their domestic animals.  When, however, you come to deal with a person who has a considerable holding of land with a valuation of £25, £30, £40 or £50, you are dealing with a person who is at least as well able to provide his own house as the people with similar valuations in the non-Gaeltacht areas.  I think, therefore, that the whole case which has been made for special privileges, special grants for the Gaeltacht areas, is destroyed by this departure from the test of rateable valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I am wondering whether there is any case at all for a special department to deal with the Gaeltacht areas, and this is where I differ from Senator Hawkins with regard to the second point.  He is distressed because applications will be made for grants for the erection of piggeries and other out-offices to the Department of Agriculture.  What is wrong with that?  What is wrong with the Department of Agriculture that it could not administer the entire services for agriculture in Ireland and for the people who live by agriculture?  I cannot see any case for the maintenance of a special department for the Gaeltacht, particularly now when the test of rateable valuation goes, to distinguish it from the rest of the country.  I think that what has happened is that we have grown up to accept the conception of the congested district and the Congested Districts Board, and that, because there was a special assignment of the Gaelic fringe <Col N="721" /> on the western seaboard to a special body for special consideration by the British Government, we have decided to continue it for the past 25 or 26 years.  The same practice has been continued of having a particular Department dealing with the conditions of land holders in the Gaeltacht areas to distinguish them from land holders in neighbouring districts and, in fact, in some cases in the same county.</P>
    <P>I think West Cork is one of the Gaeltacht areas, but I believe North Cork is not, and I can never know which is West Cork and which is North Cork at certain points.  I am not now reflecting on Cork people, but merely on the manner of sub-dividing the county for electoral purposes.  The town of Macroom has changed hands, as between one constituency and another, five or six times since this State was established, and I do not know whether the town of Macroom becomes a Gaeltacht or a non-Gaeltacht area with all the changes in the electoral boundaries, but it could easily happen.  It is just as sensible as many other things that do happen.  I am unable to appreciate the reason why there should be a special Department, special machinery with special staff, very largely duplicating what is being done in the Department of Agriculture, for this area of West Cork, so that it will be distinguished from North Cork, South Cork and East Cork, all of which areas adjoin it, when dealing with the problem of the land holder.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly that the country should be treated as a unit.  If provision is made for grants for houses and for grants for piggeries and other out-offices they should be based on some principle which is common to the country as a whole.  If, as Senator Hawkins said, and I accept his view, the smaller the valuation, normally the poorer the occupier, and therefore the greater the need for larger grants&mdash; I agree with that&mdash;why should it be applied in Mayo and not in Leitrim, and it should be applied merely in West Cork and not in South Cork?  The whole system of dealing with the Gaeltacht areas should be reviewed from that angle.  I do not suppose that this <Col N="722" /> is the appropriate time to deal with it, but I differ from the view Senator Hawkins takes with regard to grants being made available for piggeries and other outhouses from the Department of Agriculture, and I agree with the view expressed by the Minister and inscribed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure what kind of contractors Senator Hawkins had in mind when he spoke of contractors who cleared up all their outfit and deserted the countryside once a house was built, because the fellows I know who build houses&mdash;labourers' cottages for the county councils, Land Commission houses and other houses of that kind in the west of Ireland&mdash;are usually small farmers from the neighbourhood, fellows who are fairly handy.  Such a contractor is not always a member of a recognised builder's union or the appropriate trade union for his craft, because he has several crafts.  He is builder, bricklayer, stone mason, plasterer and carpenter; he does all the jobs.  That is the type of fellow who usually takes a contract for a great number of these houses.  He is in the neighbourhood and he does not clear away.  We must also remember that these houses are not 50 feet high and do not involve the use of the kind of scaffolding or machinery which a builder in Dublin would use if he were building a cathedral, for instance.  I do not think there is much reason for grumbling on that score.</P>
    <P>The other point the Senator dealt with, in passing, was the advantages to be derived from the utility society.  I think these advantages are mythical. I happen to know instances in the country, particularly in the early days after the enactment of the 1932 Housing Act, where the local builders' provider formed a utility society, paid £1 and got it registered, and all the fellows who wanted houses or wanted houses reconstructed were his members.  He drew the cash and dealt with the Department and the fellow who was going into the house did not know much about what was happening.  If I am not making a great mistake, the then Minister for Local Government expressed disapproval on one or two occasions at that system.  I know it existed and that a utility society in a <Col N="723" /> great number of cases&mdash;I do not say all &mdash;was very largely a camouflage put up by the local builders' provider, who very often was contractor, builders' provider and utility society, he was everything in the show and captured all the cash.  I do not know whether he gave good value or not, but that is not the point.  The real point is that there was not a utility society in the sense in which we understand it.  I would urge that the Minister, in giving these grants, should ensure that, so far as his resources permit, the grants will go actually to the pockets of the people for whom they are intended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention is just to obtain a little clarification.  We all know that this Bill is to deal with the Gaeltacht proper.  Senator Duffy has nibbled at this point.  In Clare, while it is not regarded as the Gaeltacht proper, there is more than half the county scheduled as Breac Ghaeltacht or Fíor Ghaeltacht.  The same applies in West Kerry and West Cork.  I do not know if the area so described will come under this Bill and get the same facilities that the Gaeltacht proper is entitled to under it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear that Senator Hawkins, in his opening, apparently welcomed the Bill, but I confess that anything he had to say afterwards made me feel that to him the Bill was unwelcome.  It should be the first duty of the House to welcome the Minister to it, as I think it is his <Col N="724" /> first visit.  We all feel glad that he has come with an olive branch, even though that has not stirred the enthusiasm on our left that one might expect.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a very small, self-contained measure, and the Minister has had the privilege of introducing it, because his predecessors did not do so. Why did they not do so?  It struck me, when Senator Hawkins was making his demand for information, that most of his queries were queries which should have been put to the Minister's predecessor in office.  He complains about what the Minister is taking through this Bill from the people in the Gaeltacht. The truth about it is that the people in the Gaeltacht are at a disadvantage in the matter of housing to-day as against the rest of the country.  The Minister is trying to do something to level it up and he has done the job of levelling up rather well.  In justice, when we have a Minister of State concerned about the people in the Gaeltacht, we ought to welcome this wholeheartedly and applaud the Minister for what he is doing.  I do not think one of the arguments which Senator Hawkins attempted to make would hold water.</P>
      <P>I do not know everything about the Gaeltacht, but I know a little about it. I was a member of the commission in 1925 and, if I mistake not, the subsequent Housing Act of 1929 was introduced as a result of some recommendations made by that commission, of which I had the privilege of being a member.  I do not know what has been done for housing in the interregnum between the 1929 Act and the introduction and passage of these other Acts.  Senator Hawkins ought to know more about that than I; in fact, he ought to know more about it than the Minister.  He should be able to tell this House what was done under the 1934 Act and how many houses were built and what was spent.</P>

      <P>Senator Duffy agreed with one view that was expressed by Senator Hawkins, and he cited what might happen in North Cork and East Cork, but as far as the area affected by this Bill is concerned the areas will not be spoken of as North Cork or West Cork or Connemara or Donegal, but as Gaeltacht areas.  I understand the Gaeltacht areas are fairly specifically described, on recommendations based on the Gaeltacht Commission Report, which did not take into account Parliamentary areas as they existed then or as they were visualised in the imagination of Fianna Fáil in later years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much was done under the 1929 Act, a certain amount was done under succeeding Acts, and now the Minister is carrying on the work.  He has available to him the additional grant he is providing himself and the unspent portion, what remained over from previous grants, making a total of £240,000.  That is a fair sum of money.  Senator Hawkins calculates he is going to build 600 or 700 houses.  Apparently, he is going to make them all 5-roomed houses, according to my mathematics.  Anyhow, it does not matter whether it is 600 or 1,000, while the problem of the proper housing of people in the Gaeltacht remains, it is a problem that cries out for solution.  The Minister is doing a great deal by <Col N="726" /> increasing the amount available by loan.  Senator Hawkins makes a comparison between what is happening in the rest of the country and what can be procured from county councils.  I think he will find that the moneys available for applicants to county councils for loans to build houses are comparatively small.  Certainly, it is very small in my county, where I am a member of the county council.  The truth is, this Bill had to be introduced because those who introduced other Housing Acts appeared to have forgotten the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>If the Senator's Party were interested in the Gaeltacht it is obvious, when there is talk about people leaving the country, that houses would have been provided for them. As far as these people were concerned they were lost sight of, while the better-off classes were looked after owing to the operations of utility societies. The present Minister brought these proposals before the Oireachtas so that the condition of the people in the Gaeltacht would be brought up to the level that exists in other parts.  The Senator was only trying to make a case against these proposals.  Is it not time that some sense in that respect was displayed?  He suggested that the grants should be larger.  Coming as I do from rural Ireland, I should like to see grants of all kinds larger, but the whole trouble is to find the money. When we are asked to pay we do not like it.  It is easy to make demands. While studying the case made by the Senator I heard him ask the reason <Col N="727" /> why the cost of erecting houses in the Gaeltacht was greater.  If there is any place where the output per man would be greatest one would imagine that it would be in the Gaeltacht.  When I was coming into Leinster House last week I stood in amazement at what some working men in Dublin were trying to do.  I called a couple of other people to have a look.  I saw one man &ldquo;picking&rdquo; with a shovel, lifting clay about one foot off the ground and throwing it down, and then another man with a shovel picked up that clay and put it into a barrow.  That is the truth. Senators coming into the House could see it.</P>

I do not believe it could happen there.  While it is true that the cost of materials is high, I believe that the labour content is the major factor in raising the cost of housing.  I suggest to Senator Hawkins that if suitable labour is available in any place it should be in the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>I am trying to meet the case that Senator Hawkins made as to this Bill being unfair to the Gaeltacht. There are skilled men in the Gaeltacht who can turn their hands to anything. They can dig, make foundations, put in windows, put on slates and build <Col N="728" /> chimneys.  That is the type of worker that we want to cultivate, and rather than decrying it, Senator Hawkins should be proud of it.  I am prepared to go further than that, although it may not please some people, and say that what we hope to have are workers with an all round capacity.  I would be proud of the work of men in the Gaeltacht, just as I would be very annoyed if anyone told me that I was not using the skill that God gave me, in the right way.  If I was not free to do what I considered to be the right thing in the place I was in, I would move to some place else, even to the wilds of the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Senator Hawkins, referring to the repeal of Section 5, stated that this Bill takes away the power to make grants for poultry-houses and piggeries. Surely that is the concern of the man who is going to build?  If he is going to get more money under the scheme operated by the Minister for Agriculture, he would be unwilling to build under a scheme where the grant was smaller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should the grant be smaller?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Senator has experience of these schemes.  When we start to rebuild farmyards, cowsheds, poultry-houses and piggeries we will want to have the plans well considered so that they will be applicable to conditions as we find them.  In my view the Department of Agriculture should deal with that aspect.  I think the officials of that Department are the most competent to determine the type of buildings to be erected.  They are the people to give advice there and not the Department of Local Government.  I do not think that inspectors from the Department of Local Government should be asked to give advice on poultry-houses and piggeries.  The poultry instructresses advise farmers in such matters. They have experience and know far more about such matters than highly qualified architects in the Department of Local Government or the Board of Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if Senator Hawkins was serious in his other reference.  The <Col N="729" /> Senator talked about the disadvantage a farmer would be under, when the house was erected, concerning the removal of equipment.  I do not know if he was referring to shovels, picks and trowels, seeing that no lifts are necessary for houses of this type.  In the main the erection of these new houses is only starting.  The scheme under the Department of Agriculture will be brought in at an early date and will, probably, be in operation before houses that come under the control of the Department of Lands are erected. There is no point in the Senator's argument there, and I am sure that he now sees the futility of it.  I feel that under this Bill the Minister is making a contribution towards better living conditions in the Gaeltacht.  The problem remains of trying to keep people in the Gaeltacht.  People have been leaving it from one generation to another.  That is understandable.  Lines of communication have been maintained between people who have left 30 to 50 years ago. They leave during harvest and come back for the winter and spring.  Any hope we have of keeping people there is by improving living conditions.  The provision of better homes will be a major contribution.</P>
    <P>In regard to the point that has been made as to the question of valuations being dispensed with as a test, that is a test about which I always feel rebellious. A man with a £5 valuation will get a certain grant.  For instance, if he had £5 valuation he got £90 grant and if he had a valuation of £5 5s. he got only £85, and so on.  The valuation that was put on his place many years ago is the determining factor.  That valuation bears no relation to present value.  It is not a fair or equitable test. If a new valuation was put on there might be some case for it but, on the whole, conditions of living for the great majority of the people are so much alike that these differentiations reflect no credit on the State or on anyone. If you want to dispense justice and deal out a little charity you will not judge by a difference of 5/- in valuation. If the State is going to help and will make a contribution to better conditions in rural districts, the sooner we reach the stage where it will be done because it ought to be done and <Col N="730" /> because if it is not done by the State it would not be done at all, the better. In my judgment that should be the test. When our Minister for Agriculture introduces his scheme I hope he will not measure out the amount of relief by way of grant for poultry houses or piggeries by the valuations.</P>

Shílfeá, an tAire atá i bhfeidhil na Gaeltachta, go mb'fhiú dó innsint dúinn céard é méid na deacrachta ins an nGaeltacht. Caithfidh go bhfuil tuairim réasúnta aige ar cé mhéid teach atá déanta sna blianta atá caite faoi na hAchta éagsamhla; caithfidh go bhfuil fhios aige cé mhéid teach atá cóirithe nó deisithe no feabhsaithe faoi na hAchta céanna.  Caithfidh go bhfuil tuairim aige faoi céard atá ar intinn ag an Rialtas i dtaobh na Gaeltachta, ciacu an mbeidh daoine sa nGaeltacht nó nach mbeidh do réir an pholasaí atá leagaithe amach acu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá faoi bhun £250,000 le caitheamh faoin mBille seo, cuid de ag teacht isteach ó na h-Achta atá ag dul as feidhm anseo. Cé mhéid teach a déanfar ag an airgid sin?  Níl fhios agam.  B'fhéidir, nach ndéanfaí níos mó ná 700 nó 750.  Do réir mar atá an scéal ag imeacht san nGaeltacht níorbh fhiú teach eile a dhéanamh ann.  Caithfidh go bhfuil fhios ag an Aire 'na Dháil-Cheantar fhéin go bhfuil an glas curtha ar níos mó ná aon doras amháin agus muintir an tí sin bailithe leo as an tír ar fad.  Agus an rud is measa faoin sórt sin imirce&mdash; nuair d'imíodar san am atá caite bhí <Col N="731" /> paidir ar a mbéal go bhfillfhidís, ach an mhuintir atá ag imeacht inniu is mallacht atá ar a mbéal acu.</P>
    <P>Shílfeá go n-innseodh an tAire dúinn agus an saol atá ann, má tá crosbhóthar ann.  Ní hionann an saol inniu agus an saol sa mbliain atá caite.  Tá mé cinnte den méid seo, dá mbeadh Aire de lucht Fhianna Fáil ann, go gceapfadh sé go mba é a dhualgas go dtiúradh sé léargas éigin do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus do mhuintir na tíre i dtaobh stad na Gaeltachta agus faoi céard atá i gceann an Rialtais le feabhas a chur air nó le deireadh a chur leis.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir go gceapann an tAire nach bhfuil móran baint ag an méid atá mé a rá leis an mBille.  B'fheidir go gceapann sé nach fiú agus nach ceart tagairt a dhéanamh do Roinn na Gaeltachta agus Bille den tsórt seo ós ár gcomhair.  Chuala mé an Seanadóir Baxter agus é ag canadh poirt i dtaobh na Gaeltachta.  B'fhearr dó cloí leis an bport atá de ghlanmheabhair aige, port na talmhaíochta atá tógtha amach againn ins an bhlian atá caite.  Nuair chuals mé an Seanadóir Baxter á rá go mba mhaith leis go bhfeicfeadh sé cuid de sheirbhísí na Gaeltachta faoin Aire Talmhaíochta, shíl me gur chuala mé an rud is éadóchasaí a d'fhéadfainn a chloistéail i dtaobh na Gaeltachta nó i dtaobh scéal ar bith&mdash;go mbéimid ag súil le haon rud fónta o'n Aire Talmhaíochta i dtaobh na Gaeltachta&mdash;an fear gurb é a thuairim gurb é leas na tíre dá n-imíodh fiche duine óg as gach duine is fiche i gcéin; fear a cheap gur cheart an beartas a rinneadh ar mhaithe le dream áirithe san Iarthar agus san Tuaisceart, chun iad a chur ar a leas, chun deis saothruithe agus deis mhaireachtála a thabhairt dóibh, a bhriseadh; fear a rinne an oiread is a rinne an tAire Talmhaíochta chun drochmheas a tharraingt ar na daoine sin, é á mholadh dhúinn sa Seanad sa lá atá inniu ann cuid de sheirbhísí tábhachtacha na Gaeltachta fhágáil faoi Aire na Talmhaíochta.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart don Aire, agus an Bille seo á thabhairt isteach aige, léargas a thabhairt dhúinn ar scéal na Gaeltachta. Cé mhéid tithe atá riachtanach; <Col N="732" /> céard is dóigh leis a tharlós faoin mBille seo maidir leis an líon daoine sa nGaeltacht agus le deis mhaireachtála a thabhairt don líon daoine sa nGaeltacht?  Is léir nach bhfuil tuigsint ró-chruinn aige faoin méid tithe atá tógaithe sa nGaeltacht nó cé mhéid scéim atá ann atá ag freastal ar an nGaeltacht maidir le tithe.  Tá Achtanna na Gaeltachta ann agus bhí tithe á dtógáil faoi na Rialtais Aitiúla, faoin mbardas agus faoi na comhairlí condae, faoi Choimisiún na Talún agus, mar a mhínigh an Seanadóir Hawkins, tógtar tithe faoi <i>Public Utility Societies.</i>  Cé mhéid teach atá déanta faoi na scéimeanna seo go léir?  Cé mhéid teach a rinneadh agus a deisíodh faoi Acht 1929 agus cé mhéid teach a rinneadh agus a deisíodh faoi Acht 1934?  An Seanadóir Baxter agus an chaint a bhí ar bun aige!  &ldquo;Much was done under the 1929 Act and something was done under the other Acts.&rdquo; B'fhiú dó tuairisc a chur ar céard a rinneadh faoi na hAchtanna sin.  Is cuma liomsa cé na hAchtanna a rinneadh an obair fúthu, ach an mbeadh, aoinne ag súil le cleas mar sin chun cur in iúl dúinn gur faoi Acht 1929 a rinneadh an obair go léir sa nGaeltacht agus nar dearnadh tada faoi na hAchtanna in a dhiaidh sin?  An mbeadh aoinne ag súil le na leithead sin de chaint ó dhuine a ligeas air gur duine ciallmhar agus gur duine stuama é?</P>
    <P>Is maith liom an Bille seo a bheith ann agus sé an fáth gur maith liom go speisialta é a bheith ann mar go bhfeictear dhom gur comhartha é go bhfuil ciall éigin tagaithe i lucht an Rialtais i dtaobh na Gaeltachta.  Rinneadh faillí chomh mór agus comh fada sin sa mBille seo go raibh an tuairim cinnte buan tagaithe chugam fhéin agus chuig muintir na Gaeltachta gur cheap muintear an Rialtais más torthaí <i>exotic</i> trátaí gur cine <i>exotic</i> muintear na Gaeltachta agus dá luaithe a díbríodh as an tír iad sé abfhearr.  Ach tuigeann siad anois go bhfuil croí agus anam sna daoine sin agus go bhfuil ceartas ag na daoine sin agus is maith ann é.  Chuir an Seanadóir Baxter, agus é ag ionsaí an Seanadóir Hawkins, ina a leith go ndearna Rialtas Fhianna Fáil faillí i muintir na Gaeltachta.  <Col N="733" /> Tá mise ag rá anois leis an Seanadóir Baxter agus leis an Aire atá i bhfeighil na Gaeltachta go dtiocfaidh siad lá ar bith, bíodh sé luath nó mall, ós comhair muintir na Gaeltachta leis an scéal fhágáil fúthu agus níl amhras orm faoin mbreith a thiúraidh siad faoi cé sheas dhóibh agus cé nár sheas.  Ceapann an Seanadóir Baxter go bhfuil cuid againn ar a nós fhéin agus gur dóigh linn nach bhfuil sa nGaeltacht ach ainm; ceapann sé go bhfuil cuid againn ar a nós fhéin nach bhfaca é ón lá a bhí Coimisiún na Gaeltachta ar bun; ceapann sé nach bhfacamar daoine dá gcur i mbun oibre agus ag saothrú airgid mhaith, nach bhfacamar tithe ag dul suas dóibh agus an feabhas a bhí dá chur ar a saol sna blianta atá caite.  Níl fhios ag an Seanadóir Baxter ach oiread leis an Aire atá i bfheighil na Gaeltachta an scrios marfach a rinneadh ar na mílte duine sa nGaeltacht san Iarthar, sa Deisceart agus sa Tuaisceart ó tháinig an Rialtas seo isteach.  Rinneadh faillí, adeir siad, i muintir na Gaeltachta ach is beag údar cainte atá ag na daoine sin.  Caithfidh nach bhfuil mórán tuisginte nó mórán meabhair acu nó ní chuir feadh siad caint astu mar a chuir an Seanadóir Baxter tráthnóna.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Seanadóir Hawkins an cheist cé hiad na daoine a gheobhas buntáiste faoin mBille seo.  Do réir mar a thuigeann muidne, ní bhfuighidh aon duine teach ach an duine go bhfuil teach aige, pé ar bith sórt tí é, cheana féin.  Tá sé mar sin sa mBille seo agus fanfaidh sé mar sin sa mBille seo, ach ní dóigh liom, dá dtugadh an tAire cúram ceart don scéal, go bhfágfaí an scéal mar sin.  Tá iarracht á dhéanamh sa nGaeltacht tionscail nua do chur ar bun.  Tá sé riachtanach go mbeadh daoine ina gceardaithe, go mbeadh daoine i dTír Chonaill ag plé go lánaimseartha le fíodóireacht, le cleiteáil agus le fuáil agus sé an rud céanna é i gConamara; ta daoine ag plé le fíodóireacht agus le táilliúireacht.  Tá monarchain ann dóibh; monarchain bheaga iad, ach monarchain, muna mbeadh tada eile ann, a thugann andóchas agus an-mhisneach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá monarchain mar sin sa Spidéal agus i mBaile na h-Abhann.  Ta muid ag iarraidh ar na <Col N="734" /> daoine le fada an lá dul ag plé le hiasgaireacht agus cloí le hiasgaireacht mar cheird mar caithfidh daoine bheith sa nGaeltacht.  Caithfidh daoine cloí le siúinéaracht nó iompar a bheith acu nó <i>lorries.</i>  Ba cheart go mbeadh ceardaithe ann agus seans acú cloí lena gceird ar leith.  Má chuimhnimíd ar an rún a bhi againn go mbeadh muintir na Gaeltachta ag dul i líonmhaire, go mbeadh deis shaothruithe acu agus deis acu dul i líonmhaire, ba cheart seans a thabhairt do dhaoine nach feilméirí iad deontas a fháil agus buntáistí an Bhille seo a fháil chomh maith le daoine eile.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfaí a rá liom go bhfuil scéimeanna eile ann.  D'fhéadfaí a rá liom go ndéanfar tithe do dhaoine eile seachas na feilméirí faoi scéimeanna eile.  Tá a fhios agam é.  Ach sin é an rún nach bhfuil mé sásta leis, ach oiread agus bheinn sásta go n-athraítear an scéim i dtaobh tithe na gcearc agus crónna na muc ó Roinn eile faoi Roinn an Aire Talmhaíochta.  Is cuma liom cé thógann na tithe cónaí nó tithe na gcearc agus crónna na muc.  Is é mo thuairim gur fearr i bhfad go mbeadh an scéal faoi aon Roinn amháin.  Is fada ó fuaireamar é sin amach.  Is fada ó fuaireamar amach, má's rud é g o ndéanfaí tairbhe nó maitheas do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, go mba cheart go mbeadh an scéim faoi Aire speisialta faoi aon Roinn amháin.</P>
    <P>Is féidir leis an Roinn Talmhaíochta, gan amhras, tithe a thógáil.  Is féidir leis an Roinn Rialtais Aitiúil tithe a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá a fhios sin agam, ach níl mé sásta gurb é sin an rud is fearr do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, gurb shin é leas na Gaeltachta. B'fhearr liomsa go mbeadh an Ghaeltacht leagtha amach mar cheist faoi leith agus go mbeadh aon Aire speisialta amháin i mbun na hoibre sin. Sin é an fáth go mba mhaith liom go mbeadh an obair sin ar fad&mdash;tithe do na daoine agus tithe le haghaidh ainmhithe&mdash;faoi aon Roinn amháin, 'sé sin, Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Dá bhrí sin, tá mé ar aon aigne leis an Seanadóir Hawkins nuair adeir sé go mba chóir an chuid sin den Bhille a leasú.  Níl mórán dóchais, is dócha, faoi sin anois, ach dá mbeadh an tAire sár-thuisceanach, thuigfeadh sé an scéal agus dhéanfadh sé amhlaidh.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> Rinneadh tagairt do na buntáistí atá ag muintir na Gaeltachta thar mhuintir na n-acraí.  Is maith liom go bhfuil deontais £25 sa mbreis ag dul dóibh thar mar atá ag dul do dhaoine eile, ach mar sin féin tá cuid mhaith den cheart sa méid a dúirt an Seanadóir Hawkins faoi sin.  Ní hionann an saol atá inniu ann agus an saol mar bhíodh sé.  Ní bheidh muintir na Gaeltachta i ndon tithe a thógáil sa tslí chéanna agus a rinne siad fadó.  Tá fhios ag an Aire féin, b'fhéidir níos fearr ná ag mórán daoine eile, an imirce atá ar siúl ón nGaeltacht le blianta.  Ní foláir nó go dtuigeann sé nach mbeidh cabhair le fáil sa Ghaeltacht sa tslí a mbíodh go nuige seo.  Beidh ar na daoine atá ann díol as i bhfad níos daoire ná mar bhíodh, má tá an obair seo, tógáil tithe ceare agus crónna muc, le dul chun cinn.  Tá na habhair gann agus daor, agus beidh sé deacair ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta taisteal fada go dtí an baile le haghaidh a gcuid abhar a dhéanamh pé uair a bheid ag teastáil uathu agus sa mhéid a bheid ag teastáil uathu.</P>
    <P>Níl fhios agam arbh é an Seanadóir Baxter a bhí ag magadh nuair a dúirt an Seanadóir Hawkins go bhfuil ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta costaisí arda a dhíol as tógáil a dtithe.  Cheapfadh aoinne go mbeadh níos mó eolas faoin scéal sin ag duine a bhí mar bhall de Choimisiún na Gaeltachta.  Déarfadh innealltóir leo nach ceart dóibh dul go dtí an áit seo chun gainimh a bhailiú le haghaidh a dtithe&mdash;más maith leo teach réasúnta maith ba chóir dóibh dul níos faide ó bhaile, áit a bhfuil gainimh níos fearr le fáil.  Is cuma, bíodh nach bhfuil ach ceann amháin i gceist, bíonn trioblóid agus cruacht agus costas orthu.</P>
    <P>Tóg, mar shampla, muintir na n-oileán; oileáin Árainn agus na hoileáin eile.  An gcuimhnimíd ar an stró a bhíos orthu dul agus b'fhéidir seachtain a chaitheamh i gcathair na Gaillimhe, ag iarraidh na huirlisí agus na rudaí eile a bhíonn uathu d'fháil? Seachtain iomlán a chaitheamh sa mbaile mór agus an costas agus an trioblóid atá ag gabháil leis sin!  Cheapfadh duine go raibh bronntanas mór dá thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ó bheith ag éisteacht leis an Aire ag <Col N="736" /> caint mar gheall ar an £25.  Tá sé go maith, ach caithfidh mé a rá nach bhfuil mé sásta, agus an saol mar atá sé gur leor é sin mar dhifríocht idir scéim do mhuintir na n-acraí agus scéim do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá rud eile le cur san áireamh ag an Aire nuair a bheadh sé ag maíomh as an difríocht de £25&mdash;más £25 é&mdash; agus is é sin go bhfuil daoine sa Gaeltacht faoi láthair, níos mó ná ag aon am eile sna 16 bliana seo caite, gan obair.  Sna blianta atá imithe, bhí obair le fáil acu.  Bhí siad cinnte go mbeidh suim áirithe airgid sa bhlian ag teacht chucu faoi na scéimeanna éagsúla, go háirithe scéim na móna. Níl an obair sin le fáil acu anois.  Tá súil agam go bhfuil cuid den airgead sin, as an méid a fuair siad sna blianta atá caite, curtha i dtaisce ag cuid acu. Ach nuair a chuimhníos duine ar an saol a chaitheann siad, ní foláir nó nár éirigh leo aon rud a chur i leataoibh, ach oiread le daoine eile.</P>
    <P>Tá rud amháin sa mBille agus cheapfadh duine gur rud an-thábh-achtach é.  Tá deontas faoi leith, deontas ard, deontas níos aoirde ná an gnáth-dheontas, le fáil ag daoine atá ag tógáil tithe faoin tuaith in áit a bhfuil camraí agus píopaí uisce reatha. Cé mhéid áiteanna sa Ghaeltacht a bhfuil an scéal mar sin?  Tá uisce reatha sa Spidéal agus i Ros Muc.  Tá cúpla áiteanna mar sin in Iarthar na Gaillimhe ach cé mhéid áiteanna a bhfuil scéim chamraíochta ann?  Is maith an t-Alt sin, ach ná ceapadh aoinne gur buntáiste mór don Ghaeltacht é.</P>
    <P>Cuireann sé sin i gcuimhne dhom rud ba mhaith liom a chur faoi bhráid an Aire.  Tá deontais airgid le fáil ag daoine, faoi scéimeanna éagsúla, chun tancaí uisce a thógaint&mdash;tancaí déanta de choncréid.  Is trua nach bhfuil níos mó díobh sin á ndéanamh.  Is é mo thuairim go mb'fhiú do dhuine atá i mbun scéimeanna le haghaidh tithe a thógháil sa Ghaeltacht ceist uisce a chur ar fáil sna tithe sin a scrúdú.  Dob fhiú duine éigin, innealltóir, a chur i mbun na ceiste sin chun a fháil amach cén áit ba chóir an tanc a chur ar fáil&mdash; duine a thuigfeadh cén sórt píopaí a bheadh ag teastáil agus cén úsáid a bainfear as an uisce sin i gcúrsaí an tí, agus i gcúrsaí feilméireachta, agus cén <Col N="737" /> úsáid a bainfi as an uisce sin maidir le losáin uisce agus a leithéidí sin, duine éigin a thuigfeadh scéal na Gaeltachta agus an riachtanas atá leis na rudaí sin agus a cheapfadh scéim réasúnta oibre maraon leis an gcostas a bheadh orthu agus a dhéanfadh iarracht éigin chun a leithéidí sin de scéimeanna a chur i bhfeidhm in éindigh le tógáil tithe.  Má tá daoine ar an tuairim go bhfuil uisce reatha riachtanach, má tá daoine ar an tuairim, agus tá siad ar an tuairim, go bhfuil seirbhísí camraíochta riachtanach don Ghaeltacht chomh maith le haon áit eile, dob fhiú don mhuintir atá i bhfeighil seirbhísí tithe na Gaeltachta machnamh éigin a dhéanamh ar an gceist sin agus treoir éigin a thabhairt do na daoine ina thaobh.  Luaigh mé é sin cheana&mdash;ní maidir le tithe ach i geás scoltacha, gur mór an trua nach bhfuil iarracht éigin á dhéanamh againn le hinseacht do na daoine cén chaoi a mbaineann na rudaí seo lena sláinte, cén chaoi a mbaineann siad le maitheas na f ilméireachta.  Bíodh sin mar atá, tá súil agam ar aon chuma go mbainfidh na daoine, pé ar bith méid acu a bhfuil an misneach agus an dóchas acu dul i mbun tithe, feidhm as an mBille agus as na buntáistí atá le fáil faoi.  Ba mhaith liom go meabhrófaí dóibh fhaid is bheadh tithe dá dtógáil, go bhféadfaidís feabhas mór a chur ar na tithe agus ar a saol ach feidhm a bhaint as na deontais atá le fáil i gcóir tancanna uisce.</P>
    <P>Labhair mé i dtaobh scéal na dtithe éanlaithe agus scéal na muc.  Ní raibh fúm mórán a rá faoi sin, má bhí fúm tada a rá faoi, mura mbeadh an tagairt a rinne an Seanadóir Hawkins sa méid a bhí le rá aige&mdash;rud a bhí ciallmhar.  Tá mé go láidir ar an tuairim go bhféadfadh muintir na Gaeltachta a lán a dhéanamh dóibh féin ach go gcoinneoidís idir cearca agus muca i bhfad nios mó ná mar rinneadar go dtí seo.  Chomh fada agus is féidir le haon duine amháin é sin a chur in iúl dóibh, agus chomh fada agus is féidir le haon duine amháin iad a theagasc i dtaobh buntáiste crónna na gcearc agus na muc, tá sé déanta agamsa.  Tá súil agam d'ainneoin nach mbeidh an chabhair le fáil acu faoin mBille seo, go bhféachfaidh siad chuige go mbainfidh siad an <Col N="738" /> chabhair amach pé ar bith caoi is féidir leo é d'fháil.</P>
    <P>Is deacair a bheith an-mholtach mar gheall ar rud ar bith atá beartaithe ag an Aire i dtaobh na Gaeltachta, go mór mór nuair a chuimhníonn duine ar chomh cruaidh agus atá an saol ag muintir na Gaeltachta agus go háirithe ar an éadóchas atá ina gcroithe sin ón tuaisceart go dtí an deisceart.  Déarfainn an méid seo le muintir na Gaeltachta: &ldquo;Ní hé lá deiridh an tsaoil é.&rdquo;  Biodh an misneach acu agus tiocfadh an lá go bhfuighidh siad seans mar bhí beartaithe dóibh agus mar bhí á fháil dóibh sna blianta atá caite.  An oiread agus atá maitheas sa mBille, molaim é, agus an oiread agus atá maitheas sa mBille, molaim do mhuintir na Gaeltachta an oiread feidhme agus is féidir leo a bhaint as.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusOFarrell" hpid="Mr. S. O'Farrell Mr. S. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is essential and that ensures its acceptance by the House.  The fact that it is a Money Bill prevents us making any important amendments to it. Yet I suppose we have the right to criticise it, and it has been criticised, but there is nothing in any of the criticism I have listened to which points to any fundamental defect in the Bill.  The Bill does for the Gaeltacht what was not being done for the Gaeltacht by the Act of 1948 and what the earlier Gaeltacht Housing Acts did not do efficiently in modern conditions. The criticism has been made&mdash;I am not trying to take the Minister's job by answering these criticisms for him&mdash;that the grants for piggeries and hen-houses are withdrawn under this Bill; are not included in this Bill and are not brought up to the same level as the grants available from the Department of Agriculture.  The fact that they are available from the Department of Agriculture, and that they are greater than the grants formerly available under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts, is sufficient reason for cancelling them in this Bill, and Section 5 repeals the two sections which dealt with piggeries and hen-houses.  That is not to say that it is no longer possible for people in the Gaeltacht to build hen-houses and piggeries.  They can get the grants and <Col N="739" /> can get them at the full amount available to the people of any other part of Ireland.</P>
      <P>That is the one defect that I see in the Bill as a piece of legislation&mdash;that it is special legislation for one part of the country.  I think that, on a general matter like housing&mdash;I agree in this with some of those who have spoken&mdash; there should be a general policy and it should be generally applied.</P>
      <P>If this Bill were intended, as it is not intended, to encourage the language, or to preserve the Irish culture and tradition, well and good, you might have a special Bill, but there is no bribe or inducement offered in this Bill to the people to speak Irish.  They can build houses whether they will speak Irish or English in them and they can repair them, whether they speak Irish or English in them.  I am against the principle of trying to bribe people to speak the language, just as I am against the principle of trying to coerce them into doing it.  I should like to encourage them to do it.  I do not think bribes should be held out, and Senator Hawkins did find fault with the Bill because it did not contain a bribe to the people to speak Irish and did not give them special consideration on the understanding that they would speak nothing but Irish in these houses, when built or reconstructed.</P>
      <P>Although this Bill is belated, although it follows the Act passed last year for the rest of the country, it does give to the people of the Gaeltacht better facilities than are given to the rest of Ireland.  The amount of the grant or loan here seems to me to be more attractive than those available in the urban areas under the Bill of last year.  The Bill of last year makes available a maximum grant of £275 for a house, but it restricts the area to 1,250 square feet; but in this case there is no restriction.  There can be five rooms and each room can be as big as you wish to make it and the house will qualify for the grant.  Under this Bill, also, a loan is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This gives me an opportunity of talking about grants given for houses, and I find that the housing grants given <Col N="740" /> under the Act of last year are practically useless to the people for whom they were intended, and I hope that the grants given under this Bill will not turn out to have the same illusory benefits.  Any Senators who read the newspapers will discover that, instead of the grant of £275 made available by the Oireachtas to help people to purchase houses being used to their advantage, in some cases, I believe, it has merely been added to the previous price of the house.  A house which cost £1,500 or £1,600 before that Act was passed, cost that, plus the amount of the grant after.  Some builders did it openly, while others disguised it a little.  I brought to the attention of the Minister for Local Government an advertisement of houses for sale in which the price was specified.  I showed him the purchase price of the same house on the same site built by the same builder 12 months before, that price being £275 less.  He could not say that the cost of materials and labour had gone up to that extent within 12 months.  The Minister made inquiries and he supplied me with the reply he got.  That reply was that the new house, though on the same site and of the same type, would be approximately 50 square feet bigger. When the builder found he could not get away with it, he said: &ldquo;I will build a little further out,&rdquo; and he brought the front wall out a foot and charged £275 for it.  Other builders advertise that the price of a house, even though it be the economic price&mdash;perhaps it is &mdash;is £1,600, plus £275.  Therefore the actual price of the house is £1,875 and not £1,600, as would seem at first.</P>
    <P>The reason they put it that way is that the grant was designed to enable people who had not got money to purchase houses by putting down a deposit, and what the builders and building societies are doing here in Dublin is robbing these people entirely of the benefit of the Government grant.  The Government grant is subtracted from the price of the house, and the price to the purchaser is £1,600 with the grant already deducted.  You cannot regard the grant as part of your deposit, and if you have not got £200 or £300 to put down, the Government grant does not help you.  It was <Col N="741" /> intended that the Government grant would help those people who had not got ready cash, but it does not help them in any way.  Even if it does not put up the price of houses, it does not make it easier to purchase them.  A building society will give an estimate of what they will advance on a house, and all the time left out of account is the Government grant, and in the end you find that the people who are supposed to be benefiting from the Government grant will have to put their hands into their pockets or into somebody else's pockets and find £200 or £300 deposit, or go without a house. The position now is that the grant of £275, plus the £200 or £250 which a man must find, means that the deposit on a house is £500, instead of the £100 or £200 it was before.  So those fine business men who have such admirers and such heroic justifiers in this House will always find a way of getting around an Act.</P>
    <P>One remark made by Senator Baxter was about the laziness of Dublin workers.  If he knows anything at all about Dublin, he knows that most of the people working in Dublin on building schemes come from rural areas. From his description of them, we must assume that those people he saw came from Cavan.  Senator Baxter has spoken of seeing a man taking a spoonful of clay on the point of a shovel and raising it a foot high and then letting it gently down again and the next man then starting on it. Senator Baxter was like the man in the parable in the Scriptures, who gathered his friends around him.  He gathered them around him and stood looking at the men doing a little, while they did nothing whatever.  Whatever the man was paid for shovelling clay, he was paid much less than Senator Baxter or his friends are paid as company directors and Senators.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with Senator Baxter in welcoming the Minister to the House on his first appearance.  I am particularly glad, being a woman, that his first offering is a Housing Bill, and especially a Gaeltacht Housing Bill.  I welcome the Bill as everyone has done, even those who criticise its details.  Everybody in this House and in the other House has welcomed the Bill.  I welcome it, not only for what it contains but for its implications.  It proves that, whatever Government we have and no matter what change of Government comes, there still will persist the recognition that the Irish people have a responsibility towards the people in the Gaeltacht.  Recognition of that responsibility is implicit in this Bill, in the increased grant for housing there in comparison with houses by the Land Commission or under local government, and for that reason I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like to make a long speech, as this is a matter that requires technical knowledge which I do not possess; but I take the opportunity, which I hope the Minister will welcome, to make a suggestion to him. It is very important that we build a good type of house, well laid out and labour saving.  That does not mean something like what you see in American magazines, with labour-saving devices.  It means that a lot more common-sense could be applied to the building of houses, to the sort of fireplaces, and so on.  The Minister knows <Col N="743" /> the conditions very well and I hope he will look on the suggestion as a reasonable one.  I hope that, before setting about the building, the architects might have consultations with some women who have great experience of life in the country.</P>
    <P>In his own Department, there is one woman who has spent her life, since the Congested Districts Board days, helping people to go from their hovels to new houses.  Her advice would be very useful on the lay-out of the house, fireplaces and cooking facilities.  There are two or three women with extraordinary experience, enlightened women, and I hope it will not be out of order to mention them.  Miss Mellett was born in the Gaeltacht and has great practical experience.  Mrs. O'Donovan is another, and I am sure the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Education, would allow them into a conference with his architects, so that when they are building these houses they will be designed to help the women in their hard work.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Ó Buachalla said about tanks.  It is very important to have proper water facilities.  That need not cost very much, and the increased grant given for houses with sewerage and piped water would help towards the solution of a question that is very urgent in many parts of the country.  We want our people, if they do live in the Gaeltacht, to live proper lives and have a proper standard.  Unfortunately, the worst part of what is happening in the Gaeltacht now is the number of women who are leaving.  We have often heard of the want of man-power, but far more tragic is the want of woman power.  If we can stem that drift by providing proper houses, it will be work well done.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of spending a lot of money, but one of spending a lot of thought.  That is what we want, and I hope that the Minister, who is a countryman himself and knows the conditions of the people, and knows what will suit them, will do as I have ventured to suggest.  I hope he will call into consultation some of the women who have great practical and great social experience, and bring <Col N="744" /> them into a council when he is planning the new houses.  I am sure our colleague, Senator Miss Butler, would be very glad to preside at a little meeting which the Minister might call. I make that suggestion very diffidently and I hope the Minister will welcome it.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Senator Baxter for welcoming me to the House, and also other Senators who have been helpful, particularly Senator Mrs. Concannon, who made some very useful, as well as constructive suggestions.  That is the type of suggestion we want, because the best of Ministers and the best of Departmental officials cannot envisage every detail that would produce perfect legislation.  It is very pleasant to every Minister to be met with constructive suggestions in both Houses.</P>
      <P>Senator Hawkins asked for certain figures.  Under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts, 3,760 new houses were built, and 2,698 improved.  6,029 new poultry-houses were built, and 510 were improved. 3,009 new piggeries were built and 1,092 improved.  Quite a number of Senators were confused on the definition of &ldquo;Gaeltacht areas.&rdquo; Senator Baxter explained the position as it exists in the Schedule of the 1929 Act.  That has not been changed. Senator Honan was interested in the position of County Clare.  There are 79 electoral divisions in County Clare in the Gaeltacht area, and they will qualify under the Act.</P>

      <P>Under the Gaeltacht Commission a map was published with the areas marked red and yellow.  I think those with the yellow mark indicated the Breac-Ghaeltacht. I take it that the Breac-Ghaeltacht is entitled to grants under the Housing Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to make the position clear, all the various electoral divisions under the 1929 Act are based <Col N="745" /> on the fact that 25 per cent. or more in the area are Irish speakers.  That was the position when the map which has been referred to was used by the Gaeltacht Commission in 1926.  It is quite possible that the areas have now changed and that the percentage of Irish speakers has changed.  If there was a check at the present time, perhaps, some of the areas that qualified then, by having 51 per cent. or more of native speakers, might not do so now.  That would, of course, change the position, while other areas that did not qualify then might qualify now.  Senators who have any doubts on the question will find it explained in the Schedule to the Act of 1929.</P>
      <P>Senator Hawkins thinks that this Bill is not generous enough.  Neither do I.  The Bill is not as generous as I should like it to be.  Senator Baxter dealt fully with that matter.  We should like not only to give the full cost but to give a free gift of money in these cases if we had money to spare.  The trouble is that we have to do the best we can with available resources.  These proposals are not all that we should like them to be, just as the Local Government Housing Act of 1947 was not everything that the Fianna Fáil government at the time or the Opposition would have liked it to be.  We are very anxious that the Gaeltacht, above any other part of the country, should not suffer, but get any benefits that are going.  Even though the differential between the grants under this Bill and grants under the Local Government Act has been criticised in this House, the position, nevertheless, is the best that we can make it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the compulsory erection in some cases of piggeries and poultry-houses is not enforced under this Bill caused a certain amount of criticism.  May I explain that there is a very liberal measure available for having such cases dealt with by the Minister for Agriculture?  That measure gives much more than we are giving. I cannot see what would be gained by having a matter, which is one for the Department of Agriculture, dealt with by a separate section of another Department.  It could be argued that our officials could do it, but the experience, <Col N="746" /> even of our predecessors, has been that the compulsory erection of poultry houses and piggeries actually impeded the erection of dwelling-houses. When this Bill becomes law we want applicants to get houses built as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Mrs. Concannon wisely mentioned that, when building houses, care should be taken to see that good houses were provided, and, secondly, that labour-saving devices were installed. I agree with Senator Mrs. Concannon, that the lack of such amenities has contributed fairly considerably to the flight from the land. There is a good deal of drudgery in country life owing to the lack of hot and cold water and electric light, I am sorry to say, in country houses.  These amenities should be made available to people living in the country, particularly in the Gaeltacht.  This is an age of improvement, and we are moving on.</P>
    <P>I will give full consideration to the suggestions made by Senator Mrs. Concannon as regards consulting women about designs, so as to make life in the home more pleasant.  If we can provide some useful designs I can assure all Senators that their suggestions will be conveyed to the Minister for Local Government in the hope of embodying them also in the other housing schemes.</P>

      <P>I was speaking of possible improvements to dwelling-houses. I will have the suggestions put forward by Senator Mrs. Concannon examined with a view to seeing what can be done about them because I am in favour of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of play was made about the fact that poultry-houses and piggeries will not be erected under this Bill.  A good deal of pressure was brought to bear on me in the Dáil to have that function reinserted in the Bill, but I could not agree because experience <Col N="747" /> in the Department has proved that it had a delaying effect on the erection of dwelling-houses.  Under the 1929 Act, which was not repealed, we could not, without consulting the Department of Agriculture, erect either poultry-houses or piggeries for these people. It has been said that the fact that an applicant for a new dwelling-house must apply to another Department for a grant to erect out-offices will entail a good deal of trouble, bother and, possibly, irritation.  There is an element of compulsion contained in Section 7 of the 1929 Act that has not been repealed.  Section 7, sub-section (1) says:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No building grant or improving grant shall be made under this Act in respect of a dwelling-house in respect of which a grant out of public moneys is being or has at any time within seven years before the passing of this Act been made under any other Act of the Oireachtas or any British statute.</P>
    <P>(2) No building grant or improving grant shall be made under this Act towards the erection or the improvement or extension (as the case may be) of a dwelling-house unless either&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  there is in existence or will be provided with the aid of a grant under this Act or otherwise accommodation for domestic poultry ancillary to and suitable and sufficient in the opinion of the Minister for such dwelling-house, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the Minister is of opinion that, having regard to all the circumstances, the occupier of such dwelling-house could not be expected to keep domestic poultry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a similar paragraph dealing with piggeries.  There is only one relieving clause&mdash;paragraph (h) of sub-section (3), which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister is of opinion that, having regard to all the circumstances, the occupier of such dwelling-house could not be expected to keep pigs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that case our official had to consult with an official of the Department of Agriculture and to take the advice of <Col N="748" /> such official as to whether the applicant for a dwelling-house should be relieved of the necessity of erecting a poultry-house and piggery.  The grant was small in that case and the grants at present available from the Department of Agriculture are liberal.  All Senators, regardless of political affiliation, would like to see the grants bigger.  Nevertheless the grants at the present time are about four times as great as the old grants.  Surely that meets the situation.  In addition, the Department of Agriculture will give immediate attention to any application for an out-office by an applicant for a dwelling-house under this Act.  That should meet the case and that should set the minds of Senators at rest.  They must know that I have no desire to curtail any of the benefits enjoyed by these people under any previous Act. What I want under this Bill is that I should be a free agent to erect dwelling-houses, of the best possible type, at the shortest possible notice, for applicants in the Gaeltacht areas.  That is the whole spirit of this Bill.  I want to cut out as much red tape and trimmings as possible that may delay or hold up the erection of a dwelling-house. Every person in the House will agree with me when I say that these people deserve a great deal in the way of housing.  The quality of their land in nearly all cases is poor.  Their valuations are low and they are not well able to help themselves because their means of livelihood are limited as compared with people in other areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy was uneasy about the removal of the valuation test, if I might call it that, lest people with high valuations, £20, £30, £50&mdash; Senator Hawkins mentioned £100&mdash; would get a grant.  Every single application must be sanctioned by the Minister and I cannot imagine any Minister, myself or anyone who would be in charge of Gaeltacht Services after me, sanctioning a grant for a person who is obviously wealthy enough to build a house out of his own pocket and who is mean enough to apply for a grant.  I know perfectly well that Senators had visions of business people, for instance, with pretty stiff banking accounts applying for grants. They will not get away with it, as I <Col N="749" /> will reject such applications.  We want to give people in the Gaeltacht, Irish speakers, a neat, up-to-date dwelling-house and as good value as possible for their money, or, rather, for our money.  There is no danger of any grant being made to a person who has already liberal means.  I never came across even £20 valuations in the Gaeltacht, in Mayo or Galway.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the application comes under the scrutiny of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister has the discretion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has the discretion of ruling such a person out. Endless trouble and difficulty have been caused in the past through these applications.  For example, I know a man, living in the Gaeltacht, who is alleged to have 11,000 acres of land, but his valuation is only £9.  It is part of Ireland all right, but it cannot be described as land from an agricultural point of view.  It is just a sheet of barren rock.  There are no high valuations in the Gaeltacht, and very few of those people who have thatched houses or poor houses at the present time, and who want a grant, have a valuation exceeding £5.  Every member of the House can set his mind at rest about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why some of these things were dropped out was that we had the knowledge that we were not curtailing the grants in any way.  With regard to poultry-houses and piggeries, the matter is the very same with regard to the Department of Agriculture, and I cannot imagine why the Act provided that it was absolutely necessary for a person to erect them along with a dwelling-house.  A person in the Gaeltacht with limited means who applies for a grant to build a dwelling-house has enough on his hands for one year in erecting a dwelling-house and he will be very good if he is able to follow that up with a little out-office or two in the subsequent year.  It was said that they have to apply to the <Col N="750" /> Minister for Lands for a dwelling-house and to the Minister for Agriculture for out-offices.  There are agricultural instructors in every part of the country within easy call of every person in the Gaeltacht and in the plains, and these agricultural instructors, I must say, are most courteous and anxious to help all the people with whom they come in contact.  If people want a piggery or a poultry-house or a place for a horse, cows or calves, the agricultural instructors are at their command. They will fill up a form and send it off, and it will not entail any hardship, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    <P>I know the Gaeltacht fairly well. Some Senators come from the Gaeltacht and know I am speaking the truth when I say that.  I do not like the implication that some of the things which were in the previous Bill are being left out to try to deprive the people of the Gaeltacht of something or other.  They are not.  We are anxious to give them a good dwelling-house in the shortest possible time with the least amount of red tape.  The combined purchasing system which obtained under the old Acts will have the effect of buying materials for a house £20 to £40 per house cheaper, which means that this whole system is much better than that under the Local Government Act.  We will arrange for the stuff to be purchased, and in case any Senator gets the idea into his head, or her head, as the case may be, that the benefit of the combined purchasing system will not apply for out-offices, we will arrange also that it will apply to the erection of out-offices.  Senator Ó Buachalla mentioned the Aran Islands.  Materials will be dumped in the Aran Islands for the people, every ounce of them. We will try to have it landed on the site for them, and arrange to have it purchased at the cheapest possible figure, which means an additional £30 or, I hope, £40 free grant.</P>
    <P>The point was made that this Bill, like the other Acts, was only to replace existing dwellings.  Such is the case, because almost all the Gaeltacht is a congested area.  I think it was Senator O'Farrell who seemed <Col N="751" /> to think that a congested area was a line drawn haphazardly to divide one portion of the country from another. There was a very hard and fast test applied by the Congested Districts Board, namely, that the number of inhabitants in a given area was divided into the poor law valuation of the area.  The congested districts want all the attention they can get, even yet.  Some areas have been very well relieved in the past by the Congested Districts Board and, since its abolition, by the Irish Land Commission, but a great deal remains to be done.</P>
    <P>Some Senators were inclined to confuse the activities of the Land Commission and Gaeltacht housing.  The Land Commission build their own houses either by giving a contract or by employing direct labour under the supervision of their own engineers.  I should like to tell Senator Hawkins that there will not be any contractor and that there never was one in the case of the erection of Gaeltacht houses.  Let me pay this tribute to the people there. While they may not have had the same opportunity as the people in the plains, and so forth, of becoming acquainted with tools and thus becoming handy, they built most of the houses themselves and from what I saw myself and from the reports in my Department they are excellent houses, and their out-offices are too.  The result is that I believe that in the Gaeltacht areas to-day there are handy-men of the more advanced kind and hard workers. Mention was made of what certain Senators actually saw.  Let me say that I believe that the people in the Gaeltacht are very probably the hardest workers in the country and, from the point of view of health and physique, they do not seem to be any the worse for it.  We all admire a good, thorough-going, hard-working man. The people will build the houses themselves without contractors.  I am proud to say that they are handy enough to build them.  They have passed the test and, mind you, the test of our engineers is pretty stringent.  We will not allow any bad work.  Anybody who goes through Connemara or the Gaeltacht <Col N="752" /> areas of Donegal, Mayo, Clare or any of the other counties, will find that every one of the houses is bright and well-built.  Most of them are made from stone, and are excellently roofed. There is no danger of slates blowing off, and so on, and the same remarks apply to the out-offices.</P>
    <P>Senators were anxious to know whether the present figure, the sum of £240,000 which will be available under this Bill, will be sufficient to complete the task.  We do not believe that it will but we know that the present sum will build approximately 1,000 houses. We hope that more will be built because the anticipation is that the cost of building materials will go down rather than increase but even if the cost of building materials stays as it is we will build approximately 1,000 houses.  I know quite well that the Houses of the Oireachtas that will be sitting in the days when the present money is spent will not have the slightest hesitation in voting a further sum to complete the project.  I would say, although we have not any accurate figures, that almost as many more houses have to be built as have already been built.  In other words, the job is only half-done.  We are anxious to get on with the work and to give the people their houses as soon as possible.  I believe that no matter what political Parties may be in the country in the days when this money will have been spent, the Dáil and the Seanad of the time will joyfully vote as big a sum to get on with the good work.</P>
    <P>The question of the floor area was raised&mdash;whether the same 1,250 square feet of floor space will apply as applies under the Department of Local Government. I would point out that that is fixed by regulation of the Minister.  We shall not be hard and fast; we shall not make it unworkable because of hidebound regulations.  I do not believe in that.  I believe a little leniency will be very good and I hope no Senator will be uneasy any longer on that score.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the Bill should have been introduced some time ago. It should have been introduced long ago.  It is not so easy to draft a Bill <Col N="753" /> in such a manner as to be as near perfect as human ingenuity or brains can devise.  The drafting of a Bill takes time.  All I can say is that I did not lose any time in getting it under way since I came into office.  I want to make it clear that the Bill was not in existence before I came into office, but at the same time I do not want to take this opportunity of throwing blame, because that would only engender bitterness and I do not want that. The whole object and spirit of the Bill is the erection of the houses as soon as possible.  We are anxious to get on with the work.</P>
    <P>I would say, in regard to poultry-houses and out-offices, that I feel the applicant, in the case of a dwelling-house, should not be tied down to erect them.  We would rather leave the matter to himself.  He may build the dwelling-house this year and if it is possible to improve on the designs that existed up to this, we will do so. I do not know what can be done in that regard, and I am making no promises, but we are anxious to build his dwelling-house first and, if he wants to keep poultry or pigs, then let him apply to the Department of Agriculture in that respect, but we do not want to compel him to build an out-office which he may not require. He will have every assistance from our inspectors if he wants it and he will have the full co-operation of the officials of the Department of Agriculture in regard to out-offices, in addition to the combined purchasing section to cover any out-office he may wish to erect.  I do not think we can do much more.  We are cutting out red tape. We are giving him the benefit of the agricultural grant for out-offices, and freedom to erect whatever out-office he may desire and we are giving him the benefit of the combined purchasing section to purchase the materials for his out-office as cheaply as those for his dwelling-house and, lastly, we want to do it speedily.  If anybody can improve on that I should like to hear about it.</P>

      <P>I have not much to say about this Order on this occasion.  I said all that could reasonably be said when it was last before the House.  I should explain that this Order adds a few days at the beginning of the normal summer time period and a number of days at the end.  If this Order was not moved, summer time would come into operation on April 10th of this year and would expire on October 2nd.  The Order brings summer time into operation on April 3rd and it will expire on October 30th, so that there are eight added days at the beginning and about 28 days at the end of the period.  That is all the extension.  If this Order is not made it would mean that railway companies, particularly the Great Northern Railway, would require a new timetable, which would cause a good deal of inconvenience.  The position is the same regarding shipping. I am satisfied that the Order is in the best interests of everyone connected with agriculture as well as with business and I ask the House to approve of it.</P>

      <P>When summer time was discussed on a previous occasion the Minister promised to look up the report of the commission that sat in 1941, which made certain recommendations, which he found he could not then look favourably upon.  I do not object to summer time but I objected to extending it as much as 25 minutes. As to the objection by the railway and shipping companies, Britain and Northern Ireland had double summer time during the war, while we had single summer time.  I am still opposed to the taking away of the 25 minutes.  If the Minister recommended that the 25 minutes should be taken off the present arrangement, it would be a gesture to agriculturists of half an <Col N="755" /> hour and similarly to industrialists and everyone would be happy.  I am opposed to the present proposal, but I hope the Minister will not lose sight of the half promise he made to consider the recommendation of the commission.</P>

      <P>Nobody will object to the extension of summer time that the Minister has asked for.  I think many farmers would approve of an extension to May as being more suitable for them.  I have no fault to find with the Minister's remarks.  He left the question to the lower House and on looking at the voting it could be seen that the Taoiseach, the ex-Taoiseach, Ministers and ex-Ministers were included in the big majority, the voting being 76 in favour of the motion and 36 against. We cannot complain that the Minister was not acting democratically.  He put the case before the Dáil and is abiding by majority rule.  I have still to protest but not against the motion as it stands. The scheme was brought in to implement the recommendations of a committee that sat in 1941 to inquire into what action should be taken about summer time.  Their recommendation was that we should add half an hour, go back to Irish time and adopt that as summer time.  It would be very much to the advantage of farmers if that recommendation was carried out.  Some people may say that half an hour would not matter but half an hour would be very useful to farmers when harvesting or hay making with sunshine.  Looking at the voting in the Dáil one has to come to the conclusion that the outlook of Deputies, and I think a majority of Senators, where farmers' business interferes with the pleasures of those in the towns and cities, is to-chuck the farmers.  I suppose I cannot discuss the Act now.</P>

While I am loath to criticise those who speak for farmers, I think people in the country, just as much as those in the cities, welcome summer time.  The country as a whole is looking forward to summer time.  I doubt if in the lifetime of any of us such a boon has been conferred on humanity as this summer time legislation.  As the Minister stated, the pros and cons have been reiterated, but I want to put it on record that I think a big section of the community welcomes this proposal.</P>

      <P>Some years ago, I was a member of a harvest bureau and the chief complaint made by the farmers was that the people in Dublin put back the clocks to the old time without considering the farming community. In the town in which I was living, all the buses were an hour late in bringing people out to work in the country, and, as a member of the bureau, I got several complaints from farmers about the inconsiderate action of the people in the city in going away from the new time so early and bringing men out late.  I think the other aspect ought to be considered&mdash;the saving to the country in the matter of imported fuel and the benefit to the health of the people in the cities and towns in enabling them to get out to play games in the summer time.  These are two great benefits and the small inconvenience which can be caused to the farmer&mdash;and it has never been proved that any real inconvenience has been caused by the introduction of this measure&mdash;is outweighed by the great advantage to the health of the people and the saving effected for the country. Some people have asked why it is necessary for the Minister to come here every year with this proposal.  Personally, I like to see him coming here on such an occasion, because he heralds the approach of summer and all the benefits that come with it.</P>

      <P>I do not like the <Col N="757" /> extension of summer which is being provided for.  It may be all right in April, but it is being carried too far into October.  I do not think it should be extended so far into October.  This is the second time we have done this, and, while it might be desirable that the same time should apply in both countries, on account of the trade relations which exist, it would have been well if negotiations had taken place and if the British authorities had been got to end their summer time period at an earlier date.  It is carrying the thing too far to extend it so far into October.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am in entire agreement with the Minister and with the proposal in the Bill, I want to point out that there is a general consensus of opinion amongst the agricultural community in favour of the abolition of summer time; but while I know that there is formidable opposition against it, there is a whole lot to be said on both sides.  One Senator spoke of the chance which it gave young people to engage in games and so on&mdash;all very healthy recreation, I admit&mdash;but there is another side to the picture.  Young children, particularly in areas formerly known as slum areas, are in many cases suffering from various diseases, the diseases contracted by young people, because of the late hours they keep by reason of summer time, and the mothers of these young people tell social workers that they cannot get their children to go to bed at night while their elders are out, which leads in many cases to grave illnesses amongst the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very easy to condemn the farmer because he seeks to have this Act abolished, but the farmers were great men, white-haired boys, when they were working harder than ever they worked during the emergency.  I think that many of us are too city-minded, and it might do Senators a lot of good if they met the farmers in their own bailiewicks from time to time and got to understand their problems.  It is acknowledged that agriculture is our main industry.  We have been calling for extra efforts on the part of farmers for some time <Col N="758" /> back, and we will continue to call upon them for these extra efforts, and it is no encouragement to these farmers to be told that they are looking for too much or that the country is doing too much for them.  No doubt, to-day, the farmer is infinitely better off than he was for many years, but none of us can tell how long that state of affairs will continue, and nobody can say at what moment we may have to call on them to produce more again.  I deprecate any references of that character to the farming community. All of us in this House, whether from cities and towns or rural areas, spring from the farming community, and I deprecate any remarks from Senators, Deputies, or any other public men, decrying the work of the agriculturists. That is the one thing which brought me to my feet&mdash;I would not have spoken on this matter otherwise.</P>

This little country is divided badly enough, but the position will be much worse if we are to have two sets of time.  We had it before, and I think it is a reasonable gesture on the part of the Minister to suggest that we should sacrifice eight days of winter time in April and 28 days in October, so that, at least in thought, the country will be one in the matter of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:-</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Seanad is of opinion that persons serving on juries should be refunded the amount of out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred in the performance of this public service <Col N="759" /> and should be compensated for loss of time; and the House requests the Government to introduce proposals for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the members of the House have given attention to the subject dealt with in this motion.  If they have, I hope there will be little objection to it.  We are trying to preserve the jury system.  It has been challenged from time to time; in fact, trial by jury on occasions has been abrogated, not merely here but in other countries. Yet I am one of those who believe that we ought to preserve trial by jury, not merely in criminal cases, but in civil cases&mdash;in the case where two people quarrel as to their rights.  In cases where a man is claiming compensation because of the negligent conduct of somebody using a road vehicle, it is much more satisfactory that 12 citizens who know the local conditions, who live in the community amongst the parties involved in the proceedings, should determine the issue rather than it should be left to a judge, no matter how competent he may be, to make a determination as between the parties.</P>
    <P>It has been the function of the judge to determine questions of law: it has been, and still is, the function of the jury to determine questions of fact; and I am anxious that that system would be preserved.  The best definition of the functions of the jury may be expressed in one sentence:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Juries are bodies of men convened by process of law to represent the public and to discharge upon oath or affirmation defined public duties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is taken from page 226 of the 18th volume of Halsbury's <i>Laws of England.</i> These are still the laws of Ireland, so far as the common law is concerned.</P>
    <P>We in the Seanad are in the fortunate position that we can be academic about this subject, as none of us is liable to serve on a jury.  That is one of the advantages you get by being elected to either House of the Oireachtas&mdash;you are exempt from jury service. I notice in recent years there has been a great rush to have peace commissioners appointed and I have a suspicion that that is not entirely dissociated <Col N="760" /> from the fact that peace commissioners are exempt from jury service.  We ought to deplore that attitude, that people normally entitled to give public service should try to dodge it.  It means putting a greater obligation on those who are called on to give service, if an ever-growing body of the community who normally should give service can escape it by a subterfuge of any kind. Large numbers of people&mdash;civil servants, civic guards, military, professional people, peace commisioners, members of the Oireachtas&mdash;who normally might be expected to make good jurors, are exempted altogether.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, certain people are called upon who can ill afford to do this public work at their own expense.  There are areas, even in this small country, where people travel 80 miles or more from their homes to attend in town or city where the-court is sitting, to answer their names when the jury list is called.  Even if these people are not called to serve they must remain in the town, as they cannot return that long distance.  A man with a high-powered car may face the task of coming in in the morning and going home at night over a long distance. One cannot imagine a person with only a bus service morning and evening between Limerick and Dublin doing that journey in order to perform this public work, free of charge to the community, yet that is what is expected from a man in Berehaven if he is summoned on a jury in Cork City, as has happened.</P>
    <P>Dublin has its own problems.  The distances are not great and most people concerned in the city or county can come in every morning very conveniently, be in time for the roll call and get home at night.  However, they have other grievances, if I may so refer to them.  All serious crime&mdash;all murder cases, for instance&mdash;are brought to Dublin for trial, and Dublin City has to provide the jury for every trial coming to the metropolis to the High Court or the Central Criminal Court, from all parts of the Twenty-Six Counties.  The result is that you have in Dublin at times as many as five juries sitting simultaneously.  That is 60 people taken away from their work <Col N="761" /> or their homes.  In the case of a murder trial, they are locked up at night, perhaps for three, four, five or even ten days at a time.</P>
    <P>This all gives rise to great hardship, but I want it noted that I am not making the complaint in respect of the hardship of public service.  The claim I am making is that people who render this service should not be placed at a disadvantage, contrasted with their neighbours who do not render public service.  Why should a farmer in West Cork be expected, without fee or reward, to spend a week or a fortnight in Cork, waiting his turn to be called on a jury or perhaps serving on a jury, when the local schoolteacher who lives next door to him at home is exempt from jury service altogether?  Not merely is the farmer concerned required to go away from his work, but he is required to pay his own travelling expenses and pay his hotel or lodging expenses in the city.  In the case of the farmer, it may be a great hardship or it may not.  Some people will probably recall instances in which the farmer can perform this duty without much disadvantage, apart from the expense in which he is involved.  But take the case of a wage-earner in Dublin, a carpenter earning £7 a week.  He attends the High Court or Central Criminal Court on Monday morning to answer his name and then he is waiting around until the jury is empanelled for a particular trial.  If he is not empanelled, he may go home, but he has lost certainly a half-day's pay.  When going home, he is told to watch the newspaper in the morning to see whether he will be wanted the next day or not.  He does not know, when going home at night, whether he will be required the next day or not.</P>
    <P>I think these facts are known to everybody.  Members of the House appreciate them as well as I do.  I would like to quote certain complaints which have been addressed to me, so that the House may understand and appreciate the viewpoint of the people outside who are affected. This matter really was forced upon me, the question of moving this motion was <Col N="762" /> forced upon me.  I was approached by a deputation, about six months ago, and asked what could be done in either House of the Oireachtas to get exemption for wage-earners from jury service. I expressed the view that I could not support a proposition that a person would be exempt from jury service because he was a wage-earner. Then the deputation said: &ldquo;Well, surely he should not be asked to lose a day or a week's wage, plus the cost of travel and the cost of maintenance, if away from home?&rdquo;  I sympathised with that and asked that some investigation be made, to let me see how far this complaint had a basis in fact.  I have received a considerable number of letters in connection with it.  I have made extracts and would like to quote from one or two of them.  Here is a complaint contained in a letter written to me by a secretary of a trade union branch in Dublin:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One of our members, a pay clerk, was summoned for jury service a few times and on each occasion his pay was docked for the time he was absent in court.  In the case of a man with small pay this is a great hardship.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another kind of case is dealt with in another letter which indicates that a man, married, with six children, had to travel to England on family business at night.  He was detained there longer than he expected and did not get back in time to answer his name when the panel was called.  For this he was fined £3.  He attended later in the day and also next morning, when he was empanelled for a case which took four days.  He lost his entire week's wages and, into the bargain, had to pay a fine of £3.  He was told if he did not pay his effects would be seized.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there no remission of that fine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not inquire.  That was the letter I got.  But it does say that he lost a week's wages and had to pay a fine of £3.  I had the distinction of being fined £3 for failing to answer my name on an occasion on <Col N="763" /> which I was not lawfully entitled to be a member of the jury.  I made representations to the proper authorities and the fine was immediately remitted.  It is very easy for a judge to pronounce a fine of £3 in court.</P>
      <P>I have another example of a fine, which is rather interesting.  The writer says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;My experience is that you are expected to be in court day after day whether or not you are on a jury. It is too risky to leave the place even when you have nothing to do except to hang about all day.  The last time I was summoned there was a bricklayer beside me who answered his name at the first call-over, but later on decided to escape the jury when his name was called for a murder trial.  He did not answer his name and was fined £10. This man was prepared, evidently, to pay a fine of £10 rather than risk serving on a murder trial.  I do not know whether it was because he was not anxious to serve on a murder trial or because he wanted to avoid serving on a trial that was bound to take several days.  I can well believe that this man would be earning £8 or £9 a week and, if he were called and had to serve in the case, it was very likely he would have lost a week's pay and, on balance, he came to the conclusion that he preferred to pay a fine of £10 rather than answer his name when called for jury service in a particular instance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A Dublin writer says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Now about the man called for, say, October who has to attend daily until close on Christmas.  How much is he going to lose?  Who is going to feed his family, especially at a time like this when most men are trying to get a few shillings together to cover the extra cost and expense of Christmas?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A suggestion has been made that if the obligation was placed on somebody&mdash; particularly on the State&mdash;to pay the expenses of jurors there would be very much more care taken in the manner in <Col N="764" /> which juries are summoned and in the manner in which they are empanelled. For instance, a writer says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a most dictatorial system in the courts where jurymen are concerned. The summons tells you where to go the first day.  From that on you must find this out for yourself.  The court clerk is condescending enough to tell you the first day that you must get a morning paper next morning and every other morning to see for yourself at what court you must attend.  If they had to pay expenses they might learn to plan in advance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to over-emphasise this point.  It must be clear to the House that in the circumstances described, jury service, although obviously a public duty that none of us should shirk, can become very onerous and can, in fact, become very unfair where it involves the loss of time day after day for men who have to live by their daily wages. I should, perhaps, draw attention to the fact that this question has arisen and has been dealt with more or less satisfactorily elsewhere.  It has been dealt with in Great Britain, for instance, and I imagine that it is because of the publicity given to the provisions made for the payment of jurors in England that the matter was forced upon my attention so consistently for some months by interested people in this country.  I do not know whether the British Parliament has yet passed the Bill or not, but I have here a leading article which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on the 1st January of this year.  The leading article is, perhaps, characteristic, and I might be permitted to quote a few sentences from it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the Juries Bill now before the British Parliament becomes law, jurors in both criminal and civil cases will be given compensation up to a maximum of ten shillings for a four-hour day and a pound for more than four hours.  They will also be given travelling and subsistence allowances.  The Bill does not extend to coroners' juries...</P>
    <P>The rate of remuneration is not extravagant.  No doubt the jurors will suppress the temptation&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" />&mdash;this is where the originality creeps in&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;to provide themselves with a refresher by prolonging their deliberations for the necessary four hours and five minutes.  In any event it is only a beginning.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then says the editor of the <i>Independent:</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;By appropriate agitation the Jurors Trade Union&mdash;an inevitable sequel to the Bill&mdash;will raise the standard of pay in good time.  We may even be prepared for occasional strikes, official or unofficial, when justice will be brought to a standstill while my lord or his tipstaff carries on without prejudice parleys with the picket, and the prisoner at the bar hopes for the best or protests against the indignity of being tried by blackleg jurors.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However the <i>Independent</i> became repentant after this indulgence in frivolity and concluded&mdash;this is what I want the Minister to take notice of because it is a prophecy and you cannot ignore prophets, depending on how you spell the word.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Payment of jurors was bound to come.  The days when men did public service without reward have passed into history.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is unfortunately true that the days when men did public service without reward have passed into history, but jurors have been picked for special treatment and are not free agents.  They did not just come into this service as you would join, for instance, a voluntary fire brigade.  They are compelled by court summons to attend in court, to answer their names and do their best between the parties before the court.  I do not think it is a good thing for justice that you should have jurors sitting in judgment in important issues who are dissatisfied and have a grievance themselves, who feel that they are there under duress and that they are being done an injustice by being there.</P>
    <P>The claim I am making is not extravagant. I am proposing merely that the citizen who is called upon to perform this public duty should be refunded all the out of pocket expenses <Col N="766" /> reasonably incurred in the performance of that service and that he should be compensated for his loss of time. No doubt difficulties will arise in determining the loss of time.  It is easy enough in the case of a wage earner. His loss is his day's pay.  There may be a question sometimes as to whether the loss is of a whole day's pay or a half day's pay and cases where it might be contended that if he wanted to get back in time he could work for a half day.  It is not so easy to determine the loss incurred by a businessman or a farmer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about writers, not journalists.  The two broad classes where it might be most difficult to determine the loss are farmers and businessmen.  The motion is left open and I have no doubt that if there is goodwill and if the Government makes up its mind that the proposal is a reasonable one they will bring forward proposals which will reasonably commend themselves to everybody.</P>
      <P>Travelling expenses are quite simple. In a place like Dublin it would be entirely unnecessary to think of travelling expenses because they would be only a few pence at best.  Subsistence is also a matter that could be dealt with.  I am leaving the question open as I am trying to establish the principle that there should be recompense. I am prepared to listen to any reasonable proposal to determine what that recompense should be and the form which it should take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One question remains to be considered: who is going to pay the sums which, it is determined, should be refunded to men who have incurred expense in connection with jury service? I have an open mind in the matter so far as civil cases are concerned.  In a civil case in an action for damages for slander or libel, or in a running-down <Col N="767" /> case, if one citizen takes an action against another he brings expert witnesses to the witness box to testify his loss or the injury inflicted upon him, and the courts have little difficulty in making up their minds as to the services rendered by professional witnesses.  A doctor gives evidence on behalf of a person claiming damages against a motorist by whom he is alleged to have been injured, and the courts have no difficulty in making up their minds as to whether the doctor is entitled to three guineas or five guineas for his services to the court.  It is similar with an engineer or other people who come to give evidence of an expert character. Is there any reason why, in assessing damages, the court should not have the right to award against the unsuccessful litigant in a civil case the amount payable under this scheme in respect of jury services?  If, on top of a decree, £20, £50 or £100 is added in respect of lawyers' expenses, counsels' fees and witnesses' expenses, why not also include expenses payable under this proposal to jurors who have listened to and tried the case?  In criminal cases it is somewhat different. Usually in criminal cases the State is the prosecutor and some citizen who has got into trouble is the defendant.</P>
    <P>He may be tried for his life or he may be tried on a serious charge.  In most of these cases the person who is being tried will be a person of very little substance, not in all cases I agree, but in most cases.  I think that whatever is decided upon in relation to the payment of jurors would have to be a State charge.  I cannot see any escape from that, but I do think, as one correspondent stated in a letter from which I read an extract, that if the State is made liable for the payment of expenses of jurors they will take very good care that the expenses are reduced to a minimum.  As it is, there is no inducement for the State, State solicitors, Garda officers or anybody else, to minimise the inconvenience to jurors because they are not paying for it.  The juror himself has to foot the whole bill.</P>
    <P>I think I have submitted what seems <Col N="768" /> to me a reasonable case and I would urge strongly that this House should pass this motion so that the Government would be given an opportunity of examining the whole question and, as I confidently hope, arriving at a decision which will be calculated to remove the grievances and hardships under which our citizens suffer when they make themselves liable for jury service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this motion strongly.  I think the jury system is an essential safeguard of the liberty of the citizens in this country.  I think any tendency to weaken the jury system will tend to undermine our whole judicial system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the jury system is an extremely important weapon for the ordinary private man to use against the abuse of State privilege in the modern world, but I do not see why people who render this invaluable service should be asked to be out of pocket.  I do not think the proposal concerns the payment of jurors, but simply that the juror should not be actively out of pocket by doing this very essential public service.  When you come to think of it, the jury service is really a form of conscription. It is rather like the press gangs of the old days where people went about and forced other people into the Navy without their consent.  As has been said, some people escape having to render this service while others are caught into the net.  The system of selection is somewhat irrational.  If you look through the list, you will see that all sorts of professions are exempted for no particular or obvious reason.  That puts a greater strain on the people who are not exempt, although some of those who are not exempt are people such as waiters and small business people of that kind who can least afford to serve.  Even the conscript to-day in the modern army, although he does not get so much as the professional soldier, at least gets his keep.  He is not asked to pay for himself.  Even the conscript in the <Col N="769" /> most totalitarian army in the world to-day is kept during the period of his conscription.  He receives his travelling expenses when he is moved from place to place and he receives a certain modicum of sustenance and entertainment while he is doing his involuntary service.</P>
    <P>Jury service can be very inconvenient indeed.  It can be very onerous especially if the case goes on for several days when the juries are frequently locked up.  In the old days the jurors were locked up for the night while, paradoxically enough, the prisoner went out on bail and if the jurors failed through no fault of their own in the slightest performance of their duty they were heavily fined.  It is really all part of a larger question on which I shall not dwell for longer than a minute&mdash;a thing which we shall have to face in this country sooner or later.  I refer to the fact that the time has come when we cannot expect people to be unremunerated or unpaid for public service.  In the old days, 100 years ago, there was a very unequal type of society.  It was a society resting on the existence of a privileged class in this country and in England. They performed a great many public services free of charge.  Members of Parliament were not even paid their travelling expenses and the administration of justice was, generally speaking, carried out by unpaid justices of the peace.  All that is now past. Members of Parliament in this and in other countries are remunerated.  The old unpaid justice of the peace in this country has been replaced by the district justice.  Even the county councillors are now, I believe, soon going to receive travelling expenses and so forth in connection with the carrying out of their duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall have to move with the times.  All this old system of the privileged class rests on the basis that certain people in society had a privileged position in return for which, to a large extent, they governed the country without receiving any specific remuneration.  As I say, that is past and swept away.  There is no <Col N="770" /> privileged class to-day.  In fact, nobody in modern society can afford to give his time for nothing and certainly nobody can afford to lose several days' work, and incur expenses in doing so. That, to my mind, seems to be the case. It is an anachronism that one particular type of public service should be unpaid. In saying so, I am not advocating the payment of juries although I understand that special juries in Dublin have always been paid in the past, and common juries in civil cases also.  That juries should be compensated for their out-of-pocket expenses and their loss of time seems to me to be a very reasonable proposition. The danger is that if this is not done, if jury service continues to be as irksome and as onerous as it is at the present time, it may become more and more difficult to get people to act.  Just as the administration of justice on the local bench has passed out of the hands of the unpaid justice into the hands of a paid justice, and so forth, it might sooner or later come to the point when more and more cases would be decided by judges without juries.</P>
      <P>I myself am a member of the legal profession, although I have not practised for a great many years.  I know the profession well and I have a great respect for it as a profession.  In fact, I may say that nobody could hold the Irish Bench in higher esteem and honour than I do.  Many of the members of the profession are my friends and I look up to them as people of the highest honour.  I still say, however, that there is a certain type of case where the ordinary man does gain something by the protection of the jury.  It has been shown over and over again that, in certain types of cases, an ordinary jury of 12 fellow-citizens, drawn by lot, is an invaluable institution to save the ordinary man from the possibility of injustice.  I am afraid that in this modern age when people have so many claims on their money, when people have to contend with rising prices and when people have not got the same leisure as they had, we may not be able to get that unpaid service in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In supporting Senator Duffy's motion I am not doing so in the <Col N="771" /> interests of juries themselves but in the interests of the institution of the jury.  I think that that institution is a very valuable institution in this country and that the people who perform that essential public service should not be out of pocket thereby. That, I think, is the basis of the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should be expressing the views of the majority of the Senators when I say that this motion by Senator Duffy has the wholehearted support of the members of this House.  It is only fair that those who serve a very useful purpose in the discharge of justice should not be out of pocket.  This applies more in rural areas than, perhaps, in the City of Dublin.  We have at the present time a Circuit Court system.  The court sits in Galway.  Men from various parts of the country are often called on to act as jurymen at their own expense and at great inconvenience. The least we can do is to ensure that they should receive sympathetic consideration from the Government with a view to recouping them their out-of-pocket expenses.  Senator Duffy asked whether the State should bear the cost in all cases.  I certainly would recommend that payment of out-of-pocket expenses should be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusOFarrell" hpid="Mr. S. O'Farrell Mr. S. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I give somewhat lukewarm support to this motion, not because I am against the principle, but because I do not like the way it is drafted, or some of the arguments used in its favour.  Like Senator O'Brien, I have great respect for the jury system.  I would not like to see anything happening which would in any way minimise a system that is so beneficial for the country and so essential to a democratic form of government. I have been long a believer in the principle of equal pay for equal work.  Therefore, I think a system of payment for jury service would be better than Senator Duffy's proposal.  He would have out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred refunded and would compensate each person for loss of time.  That would involve considerable calculation and investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There might be half a dozen different <Col N="772" /> types of persons on a jury.  One man might reasonably expect to stay at the Gresham or the Shelbourne Hotel, while another man might be in the habit of going to a cheaper place. One man might say that he had a big business, and that a loss of a day on a jury meant £100 to him, while another man might be unemployed, and all he would lose would be the dole, yet each would be equally useful as jurors.  It might possibly happen that the unemployed might be the better juryman.  Therefore, let there be equal pay for equal work for all jurymen, and no favouritism.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Duffy's remarks regarding civil actions, that the payment of juries should be included as, under the present system, the loser pays.  He might as well pay for the jury as for the barristers.  If we had the system advocated in the motion, merely to pay out-of-pocket expenses, there would be a tendency to pick the lowly paid or the unemployed. With a Government carefully watching every penny of expenditure, there might be an objection to every juror likely to cost more than £1 a day. In that way, it might be found that the wealthy might escape jury service altogether, and it would become practically, only work for the unemployed.</P>

      <P>I will support this motion.  Having served on juries I feel that great hardship is imposed on people in rural districts who are called for such service.  They may have to travel 20 or 30 miles at their own expense.  There is no reason in calling people to serve on criminal cases without paying their expenses.  I agree that there should be a flat rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion as I consider that it is time to face up to this problem.  I am more concerned with the position of people living in country districts who are called to serve on juries.  Very often they have to travel long distances and are inconvenienced as far as hotel accommodation is concerned.  They may have to go to adjoining towns for such accommodation if they cannot get to their homes.  I believe that it will be necessary to have a commission to examine <Col N="773" /> the whole question before the Government could take action.</P>
      <P>There is another point to which I wish to call attention, even though it may not be appropriate to this motion. Very often when jurors are called the person first called by the registrar is generally made foreman.  I think that system is wrong, as the man first called may not be the proper person for the position.  There should be some change in the code covering the selection of foreman.  That matter might be considered as well as the payment of jurors.  I can assure the House that the proposal will meet with approval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. D. Burke Mr. D. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this motion.  In my opinion there has been too much pampering about it.  I am thinking of the position of a poor man who is knocked down by a motor car and who wants to bring an action. He might find, in order to pay the jury, that he would be asked to lodge £150 in court to provide for such payment in case he lost his case.  That man might find it difficult to raise the necessary cash, and a man, perhaps, with an income of £10,000 a year would then not have to go to court to defend himself.</P>
      <P>In criminal cases it has been suggested that the State would pay the cost.  That would mean that the cost of a jury would become so high that some Minister for Finance would favour the abolition of jurors, and there would be an approach towards a system that is now being pursued in some parts of Europe.  I think the idea of public service is great and that we have gone away too far from that ideal.  I consider it to be a pity that mayors of towns are not allowed to act as justices as in the past.  The tendency now is to depart from such codes.  One of the things that I stand for is that people should be tried by their peers.  Now we have impersonal peers.  I do not think such system a good one.  Trial by 12 Irishmen is good justice and is enshrined in our Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all agree that anything that would continue the jury system is desirable.  There is <Col N="774" /> general agreement on that.  I was rather taken by Senator Duffy's references to the exemptions in the jury system and I think we all feel, especially in Dublin, that the weight of jury service falls on too small a number of people.  Over a period of perhaps ten years, I have been called three or four times, and when I went to Green Street or the Four Courts, I noticed a lot of familiar faces, faces of people who had been there the previous time.  It would seem that there is a comparatively narrow circle from which these juries are called, and, if the Government are considering the whole question, I suggest that they might consider extending the duty to a greater number of citizens.  I do not know enough about the objections, but I do not see any reason why everybody who has a vote should not also have the duty of jury service.  That brings up the main proposition that there would have to be some method of compensating the people who came to serve on juries.  There is, however, a snag in this matter of compensation which I see and which nobody seems to have mentioned.  People already object to the high cost of litigation and we are always talking about the rising cost of living.  We will need to be very careful before we decide to put more expense on litigants going to court.  While I have pleasure in supporting the proposition, I feel that it is a matter that will have to be very carefully gone into and I think the Government ought to give it consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Duffy has done a service in putting down this motion.  The whole principle of trial by jury is most important.  As Senator O'Brien has rightly said, things are changing and things have changed so much that the conditions which were acceptable to people who were called to serve on juries 15 or 20 years ago are not at all acceptable to-day.  I feel that Senator Duffy made a very good case for his motion.  It is important that the motion, as worded, should be carefully considered.  Senator Duffy, let it be noted, is not asking for payment for juries, and I think that is right.  Any chatterbox can advance <Col N="775" /> that point of view and speak of equal pay for equal service, but anybody who has any experience of juries knows that you do not get equal service on a jury. People are called to serve on juries who have not got one sensible contribution to make to the resolving of the problem with which the jury has to deal.</P>
      <P>It is important that we should preserve the idea of public service and it is not very good public service, if people are to be paid for it, and perhaps some of them overpaid.  That is fundamental.  It is true that people who serve on juries to-day, a number of them, are people like those who attend meetings of county councils and other local bodies, people who get their travelling expenses and their out-of-pocket expenses.  They get something to cover what it costs them to live out for the day, but there is no consideration for what they may have lost by attending.  That is something which it would be very difficult to assess.  I agree that if people have to serve on a murder trial jury, which may run into from four to seven, eight or ten days, you have a rather different type of problem and that is a difficulty which would have to be very carefully considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly would be very averse from any proposition to pay juries. If you are going to attempt to compensate a man in relation to that sort of service, the whole spirit of trial by jury changes and I commend Senator Duffy's wisdom in wording his motion as he has.  While the House may agree to accept the motion as it is&mdash;I think Senator Fitzsimons, Senator McGuire and others have indicated that this is something which cannot be resolved by the stroke of a pen, because there are many implications&mdash;while the House might accept the motion in spirit and pass it, we all recognise that if the system of trial by jury is to be preserved, if it is to stand for what it has stood for and to mean what we believe it means in the administration of justice, it is important that we should have the system continuing in such a way that men will be prepared to come forward and give service, <Col N="776" /> not because they are paid but because a higher sense of duty still lives amongst us.</P>
    <P>I suggest that while the House may agree to accept the motion and the spirit of the motion, we appreciate the fact that there must be, for the Minister and his Department, many considerations which must be carefully weighed, because I and other members of local authorities can see quite clearly what is involved by way of expense, so far as some of the people on county councils, committees of agriculture, and vocational committees are concerned. The Minister and his Department can get from these people experience of what takes place in other branches of the Government service.  I have seen farmers often coming in to the county town a distance of 30 or 40 miles to find that they were not called, and, if they could not get home again that day, they had to remain over until the following day.  In many counties, amongst the small farming community, these are hardships of a kind that press heavily on the individual.  I do not think these people would want payment and I would hate to think that we would establish such a principle because it would be entirely wrong, if these people felt that it had not cost them anything and if they were still prepared to serve because there is still that spirit alive in the country.  Commercialise it and the whole atmosphere surrounding the administration of justice takes on an entirely new look.  I think that would be unfortunate.  I do not agree with Senator Burke that this motion should not be accepted.  I think that, generally, it should.</P>

      <P>I support this motion which, to my mind, is long overdue.  I agree with Senator Baxter that there was never any suggestion of payment for juries in Senator Duffy's motion. What I think he and the Party had in mind, and what everyone should agree with, is that travelling expenses and such out-of-pocket expenses as hotel expenses should be paid to jurors. While Dublin has its own problem, I <Col N="777" /> am not so concerned about Dublin jurors.  They have a great many privileges and facilities that country jurors have not got.  They have buses and trams at every street corner, if they do not wish to bring out their high-powered cars, to bring them to the Four Courts, as well as trams and buses to bring them back to their comfortable homes.  The only qualification for a juror, I believe, is his valuation, and the people I have in mind are the unfortunate farmers trying to exist on ten or 15 acres in a rural district.  In my own area, I know cases of people travelling 40 miles; they are summoned to appear in court at 10.30 a.m., when there is neither bus nor train service to bring them there at that hour of the morning.  They have to travel either the previous evening or by taking a car.  If they take a car, they have to bring it home and it is quite possible they may have to return on the following day and on the day after that.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of the hardship inflicted on people in that way.  It is a disgrace that jurors do not get at least their travelling expenses and out-of-pocket expenses. I hope the Minister will take notice of this motion in this House and recommend that some measure be brought in to enable jurors to be paid the expenses to which they are entitled in justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this motion for two or three reasons.  My chief reason is that I have had practical experience of the losses sustained by ordinary workers when called upon juries.  Within the last week or two, I had two complaints from two jurors who had to absent themselves from work and they were docked their wages for that particular day.  These men could ill afford the loss of their wages.  It is true that they had not to travel a long distance, as they were resident within the city borough and 1d. or 2d. bus fare would be the amount of their travelling expenses.  However, in regard to what Senator Baxter said, is it not true to say that county councillors and others are remunerated to the extent of bus fares?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter of payment.  I have a reasonably good knowledge of the King's English and I cannot read in this motion any question of payment except compensation. The question is to put jurors, especially those coming a long distance, on a par with county councillors and others.  They should at least get their return railway fare for the journey they make.  Of course, in many cases, as in County Cork, many men have to come from West Cork and make very long journeys by bus and rail and they are delayed overnight, and possibly two nights, in Cork City as jurymen.  That would be inflicting a good deal of hardship on such people. If they are small farmers, this happens especially at a time when we are looking for production and still more production.  I am not confining my remarks to farmers; I know a number of my own friends in the commercial life of Cork City who are taken away from their jobs occasionally, much to the chagrin and annoyance of their employers.</P>
      <P>We must accept things as they are until the law is changed.  I know we have a sympathetic Minister, but I do not know what he can do.  There is one solution I would offer.  It may be considered rather Gilbertian to suggest such a thing.  We have heard about the mountain and Mahomet. Could not some arrangement be arrived at by which judges would travel to various towns and hear the cases for the particular neighbourhood?  Dublin, of course, is in a different position, as Dublin is top heavy and has more transport services than any other part of the Twenty-Six Counties.  However, what I suggest is the only solution I see.  I know many of the courthouses in country districts are in very bad repair, but there could be some arrangement by which the judge and jury could be properly housed during the period the court would be sitting. Only one man and counsel would be affected and they could travel, say, 20 miles outside Cork City, to hear cases on the spot.  That would solve the difficulty to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one more example of a case I met in the last fortnight or so.  Two men engaged in most important <Col N="779" /> work as craftsmen, where such workmen are very scarce, were summoned for service and this meant a day or two absent and this was holding up production.  We have started building on a very promising plan and gone in for extensive constructive work, but does it tend towards more production when we take off this work, from time to time, three or four operatives, perhaps plasterers, masons, carpenters or others?  These matters should be considered very carefully.</P>
    <P>The whole system is antiquated.  It has been there so long that there have been very few reforms, either in the jury system or in many other things pertaining to the law.  I would suggest to the Minister that this is a case to which he should listen and, if it can be done, he should lessen the hardships of the present system under which jurors are compelled to travel long distances and remain away from home without any compensation whatever. It is not a question of professional jurymen I am advocating. That may not be a bad point, but I am not suggesting it.  I would preserve as far as possible the good old traditions, but things were very free and easy in the old days when these things began to operate.  I think the first step would be to put those men travelling long distances on a par with county councillors, namely, pay their travelling expenses.</P>

      <P>This motion has taken me somewhat at a disadvantage, because the period of time was very short when I got notice of it.  It is a very important question, but I had not time or opportunity to consult my colleagues on the whole subject.  I do not know what the Government view would be on it, nor have I, indeed, any very positive views myself.  I will give expression to some that I have very positively, but, not having any clear views on it to submit to the Government, all I can say to the House is that if the House passes this motion I will convey its decision to the Government and, in so far as the brief I have here goes, I will impress upon them the views of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" /> There is one thing that struck me about this motion, that is, that it is a great proof of the advance towards both political freedom and freedom of conscience that we have made in this country that such a motion could be put down.  Some 35 years ago, if the British proposed to pay jurors to try a single one of those in this country, we would all go mad and the British would be charged with attempting to buy over jurors and we would say they were paid Castle hacks.  But, thank God, the day has come, apparently, in which the Upper House of this State is fairly well convinced that the integrity of our people is now so great that everyone can depend upon a fair trial from their peers, whether they are paid or unpaid.  That is a great advantage.</P>
    <P>There is another point I would stress.  It is true that, in the country, jurors have to travel long distances. I was reared in the country and I know all about it.  In reality, what happens is that a certain number of jurors have to travel on a summoned panel on four occasions in the year. There are four openings of the Criminal Courts in the country towns. Therefore, the farmer who is a juror is called upon to exercise this great public function.  As far as I know, he does it gladly and is very proud of the fact that he is a juror, that he will stand between a fellow-citizen and the State, that he is called upon to find the facts, without fear, favour or affection, upon the evidence before him.  I admit that in the City of Dublin there is a completely different situation and that the Dublin jurors have an obligation placed upon them which is out of all reason.  In every High Court case in which one party claims the privilege of a jury, a jury is called and that is every running down case, every big case arising out of a motor car accident, every slander action, libel action or anything like that, and the Dublin juror has to attend for that whether he likes it or not.</P>
    <P>I want to make a correction.  Somebody said that the person who loses the case pays the juror.  There is a fee of five shillings for the juror trying <Col N="781" /> a civil case, which the juror does not get.  It goes to the tipstaff, I believe, according to practice.  It is the party who wins the case who pays the jury, not the loser.  Every murder case is triable only by the Central Criminal Court.  That means that every case of that description is tried by a Dublin jury and that it is the dumping ground for all these trials which&mdash;to come to Senator Anthony's point of view&mdash;could be tried in the country.  It is unfair to place this obligation upon the Dublin juror.  The Dublin juror has always had a very high regard for his public duty and, notwithstanding the hardships that have been mentioned, has performed it very well.</P>
    <P>It is true that grave losses and hardships have been suffered by a great number of people but, in the long run, it is better that it should be so than that there should be any question that a juror could be swayed by any emolument or compensation for time lost. The benefit of the voluntary service outweighs the other.  If this House passes the motion I will have the matter examined and, while I am anxious that no person should suffer losses in the interests of the community, I will put the case that I am putting now to the Government.  I may perhaps take the view that, in the long run, it would be only a further mark of the advance we have made in our conception of our freedom and independence.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to point out that there is something wrong with Senator Duffy's notes.  The maximum fine for failure to report or to answer your name under any circumstances is £3.  If a man was fined £10, the judge has been guilty of contempt of his own court and I would be glad if the Senator would give me further information on that point.  As to the man who was fined £3 and who served on a jury for four days, I would consider that an outrage.  I do not doubt that that is the information the Senator has but, if it occurred, it would be an outrage.  When he was called on a jury again and had to serve four days, surely any reasonable judge would remit the £3 fine.</P>

      <P>There was a question of extending the class.  The idea is that you are tried by your peers.  It is difficult to understand a person from the slum area in Dublin being tried by people from Grafton Street and property owners in Rathmines.  It is hardly a trial by peers but it is the system.</P>

      <P>The characteristic of this debate is the unanimity which has prevailed. The Minister can tell the Government that he saw something in the Seanad which he would rarely see in the Dáil.  With the exception of a vote of condolence I have never seen the Dáil unanimous on anything.  The Seanad is unanimous, with the one exception of Senator Burke, that this motion should be carried.  Senator Burke is opposed to it, not because of what is in the motion but because of something that is not in it.  I would recall that what the motion asked for is that there should be refunded to jurymen the amount of their out-of-pocket expenses, plus compensation for loss of time.  Without being egoistic, I would say that the words are carefully selected.  Their meaning may have eluded some people here but they are selected with great concern for moderation.  It has not been suggested that the man who says he lost £100 by serving on a jury would be paid £100.  It would be very hard to assess a figure and it was never in my <Col N="783" /> mind that you could accurately assess it.  I referred to this at some length in relation to farmers and shopkeepers, but I omitted to say that a man might say that if he had not had to serve on a jury he would have backed a horse which won at 50 to 1 and won £10,000. It would be very difficult, but what this motion calls for is that a juror should be compensated to some extent for his loss, not that he should be paid an amount equal to what he claims he would have earned if he had not served. I gave the British figure, so much for four hours and so much if it went beyond four hours.  It is not related to the actual loss but is given as a relief in the case of a person who incurs specified loss which he can show to the court as having been sustained by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to travel over the ground covered by certain speakers who were not concerned with this motion but who were concerned with something else.  I am entirely with Senator Baxter and Senator George O'Brien that we should not pay a salary or an allowance or give a gratuity to jurymen as such.  I have great regard for public service voluntarily given and given for nothing.  I know the country nearly as well as the Minister and I know quite well that there are hundreds of men who are delighted to be able to tell their friends on Sunday that they served on a jury during the week and have dealt with some cases of importance.  They know all about the law and if the Attorney-General heard them he would be amazed at their grasp of the law as a result of their experience in court, but they all growl because they have to pay railway fare, pay for a car or a hotel. I can remember very, very many years ago when people attended court as jurymen and travelled a distance of 21 miles.  They got there in the morning. Somebody in the neighbourhood had a horse and car and the three or four local jurors travelled together and got back that night.  They had not much expense, but the expense to-day would be quite a different matter.  What one of these men would pay in a hotel for his luncheon to-day would be as much as the whole four of them spent in a <Col N="784" /> week 40 years ago.  That time the half-one was only 2d., and look at what it costs now.</P>
    <P>Senator Professor O'Brien recounted the old-time experience of the privileged classes who gave their services to the community free.  I am not so convinced that it was as free as the Senator thinks.  A landlord who served on a jury trying a fellow for stealing sheep was concerned with seeing that somebody hanged for stealing the sheep or trapping game or hares.  The stealing of a sheep was a hanging offence and the landlord who served on a jury gave free services in the interests of his community but he never thought of himself as serving the interests of the community of sheep-stealers. I am anxious about the circumstances of 1949 instead of 1849. and I think Senator Professor O'Brien would agree entirely.  Undoubtedly he was enthusiastic in his view that circumstances had changed and that there was a good case for having regard to the expense of people reasonably incurred in performing public duty.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister himself, while recognising the Spartan lives of the western farmers, realises that the Dublin carpenter, plasterer or bricklayer who loses £1 for the day and who cannot make it up is entitled to grumble if he is called upon to serve frequently or serve a number of days at a time.  In Dublin, I understand, there is a jury panel of 300 for each court.  The Central Criminal Court and the Circuit Court may be on, and the High Court judges may be trying criminal cases and, while not all are detailed each day, each of the 300 may be called three or four times a year, so it is a matter of importance.</P>
    <P>I do not desire to press the matter further, as the Minister has met us very reasonably.  Looking back, I find that the motion was only handed in on February 16th, and usually motions are very much longer on the Order Paper. There was not time to consider it as it should be considered, and I am satisfied with the assurance that it will be considered now.</P>
    <P>I would urge that the Minister would <Col N="785" /> not have recourse to the method suggested by Senator Fitzsimons. There is no need for a commission to examine this matter.  This House is as representative a body of commissioners as he is likely to get, and this House has expressed its support of the motion subject to reservations very properly made by two or three <Col N="786" /> members, and I think the Minister can regard it as equivalent to a recommendation made by a commission.</P>
    <P>Motion agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 3rd March, 1949.</P>
