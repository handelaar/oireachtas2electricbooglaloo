      <P>At the outset of the proceedings to-day I wish to advert to the recent lamented death of Mr. Tadhg Murphy, Minister for Local Government, and to give expression to the regret of the members of the Seanad on the passing away of a member of the Government and one who, as a member of the Dáil, was associated with the Parliamentary life of the country for the past 26 years.  Mr. Murphy brought to the service of the State an alert intelligence, a deep knowledge and wide experience of local government, an absolute sincerity of purpose and a determination to spare himself in no way in the discharge of the duties of his office.  At the same time he endeared himself to all by his gracious and unassuming manner and his integrity of character.</P>
      <P>His loss will be felt by the Government and the community.  To his widow and family his death comes as a very heavy loss.  On your behalf I would like to convey to his relatives the deepest sympathy of all members of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take the motion standing in my name, No. 6 on the Order Paper, at the beginning of business and to take the other business as on the Order Paper, except No. 8.  Senator Counihan does not desire to take No. 8, the motion standing in his name, this week.  The business, therefore, will be, first No. 6 and then as on the Order Paper.  It is the intention to take the Second Stages of Bills as set down here to-day and to sit to-morrow.  It is the intention of the Taoiseach to attend, but he has, I understand, to answer one question in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Seanad Éireann,</P>
      <P>SOLEMNLY REASSERTING the indefeasible right of the Irish nation to the unity and integrity of the national territory,</P>
      <P>REAFFIRMING the sovereign right of the people of Ireland to choose its own form of Government and, through its democratic institutions, to decide all questions of national policy, free from outside interference,</P>
      <P>REPUDIATING the claim of the British Parliament to enact legislation affecting Ireland's territorial integrity in violation of those rights, and</P>
      <P>PLEDGING the determination of the Irish people to continue the struggle against the unjust and unnatural partition of our country until it is brought to a successful conclusion;</P>
      <P>PLACES ON RECORD its indignant protest against the introduction in the British Parliament of legislation purporting to endorse and continue the existing partition of Ireland, and</P>
      <P>CALLS UPON the British Government and people to end the present occupation of our six north-eastern counties, and thereby enable the unity of Ireland to be restored and the age-long difference between the two nations brought to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" /> The terms of the motion which I have the honour to propose seem to an Irishman to be very clear and very simple.  A great deal was said yesterday in the other House about the political aspect of this problem but it might be well to remark that there are other aspects too.  It is true that no State for any part of Ireland, in the modern sense, emerged until 27 years ago&mdash;1922&mdash;but it is also true that there has been for a great many years, perhaps for a couple of thousand years, in this island population with a keen sense of Irishmans; a population not necessarily of the same race but composed of people who felt that Ireland was their country, that they were Irish &mdash;people who were attracted by what has sometimes been called &ldquo;the personality of Ireland&rdquo;.  Various races contributed to that position&mdash;Gaels, Norwegians, Normans, Welsh, English, Scots, even French Huguenots and Palatine Germans.  All made their contribution to Ireland and all showed that sense of unity and that sense of being Irish.  That is one of the first facts that has to be taken into consideration when we discuss this motion.  It deals with the difference between the nation and the State and the fact that the nation comes before the State in point of time. There is, in Irish literature, a very great deal of the most beautiful poetry dealing entirely with deóruíocht, or exile.  As far back as the sixth century there is the story of Colmcille, the saint who evangelised Scotland and who founded schools in Scotland as well. Saint Colmcille was exiled from Ireland &mdash;not from Derry, the city which bears his name, but from Ireland.  In all our poems and in all the literature and folklore of our country up to the present moment this country has always been regarded as an island which included Antrim and Down as well as Cork and Kerry.  As a matter of fact, that particular attraction of Ireland, that particular capacity of Ireland to attract people and to hold people and to make them Irish, had many manifestations. In the County Down, in the early part of the 19th century, a Presbyterian Minister could not take up a living unless he were able to preach to his <Col N="1024" /> flock in the Irish language.  That applied to other religions too.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest that that Irishness is a natural historical growth.  It is something of very great strength and something which no Act of Parliament of Great Britain or anywhere else can destroy or arrest.  It is evident everywhere, particularly in the North, because even the Belfast Orangeman is incurably Irish and the notion that he can be made British by any form of propaganda is simply foolish.  Nobody is clearer upon that than himself. When I speak of this Irishness which is so remarkable in this country with its natural boundaries, I do not mean that I desire accomplishment here, or that there ever was an accomplishment here, of complete uniformity, unity or sameness racially.  I do not speak for racialism at all.  I believe that variety of population, variety of culture and variety of outlook lead to strength in a nation just as variety in industry and agriculture leads to economic strength.  This Irish nation of which we speak is something of natural and historic growth.  Northern Ireland as an area is something brought about by the British, an entirely artificial thing created by the British Parliament for its own purposes and, it is well I think to observe, exclusively by British votes.  It has no roots in history, geography or economics.  It has no natural boundaries, either river or mountain.  It has no homogeneous population.  In many areas, as has been said over and over again, there are nationalist majorities, but even in the place where there is the most homogeneous Partitionist population, in Belfast City and its surroundings, there is still a strong, vocal, dissatisfied minority of one-third of the people. Neither from the point of view of history nor from the point of view of present population, therefore, is there anything but artificiality in that carefully selected area.  The boundary deprives a countryside of its natural markets and deprives country towns of their natural customers.</P>
    <P>Both the central and local government in Northern Ireland have had many charges made against them, charges of bigotry, charges of favouritism <Col N="1025" /> on political grounds, charges that membership of the Orange Order is more important if you want a house or a job than service in the British Army or wounds honourably received in war in the service of the King.  Our objection to the existence in this country of another State governed ultimately from Great Britain does not depend on the nature of that Government.  If it were flawless and without reproach our objection would still subsist.  It is also well to remember that the differences between us are not differences as to loyalty to the Crown.  I can remember the time when a Home Rule Bill was going to be accepted here with enthusiasm by a great number of people and with the acquiescence of the vast majority of the remainder and which contained a full-blooded Oath of Allegiance to the Crown and no provision for an Irish Army or an Irish voice in foreign affairs.  It was to fight that particular Bill and to prevent the Irish people from accepting it that arms were brought into Ireland by the Orangemen, and Great Britain observed towards those arms brought in by Orangemen a very benevolent neutrality, a neutrality for which they have since paid a very heavy price indeed.  We hear of other objections to unity; objections based on genuine fear.  Surely these fears could be met by the repeated declarations of the minority in this State and the record of Government in this country since 1922 where different Governments of widely different points of view have agreed, not only in theory but in practice, to accommodate themselves to people who, for cultural, historical and religious reasons, are in disagreement with the majority.</P>
    <P>We in this country have every reason to desire that Great Britain should be strong.  There are ties of blood between us and I suppose that even blood spilt between nations gives certain ties.  Recently we have had messages from the King, from the Prime Minister of the British Government and from the Prime Minister of other States in the British Commonwealth and we believed that our friendship was being accepted.  Now, however, this Bill which is being brought into the <Col N="1026" /> British Parliament seems to shatter that particular illusion.</P>
    <P>But there is no necessity for us to be excited about British Acts of Parliament. The British Statute Book is cluttered up with Acts of various kinds against the Irish people.  There have been Acts of the British Parliament and of the Parliament in Ireland, misnamed the Irish Parliament, against the Irish language, Irish customs, Irish law, the Irish way of wearing clothes, the Irish way of wearing one's hair and the Irish way of riding horses.  These Acts have been put into operation, or an endeavour has been made to put these Acts into operation, with every possible weapon at the disposal of a Government and a State.  They have all now lapsed into being musty, historical documents, into something, as has been aptly said, for Englishmen to remember and for Irishmen to forget.  This Act will pass into the same sphere of mustiness and of history and the Irish people will survive it.</P>
    <P>We sometimes hear it said that there is a special peculiarity about Irishmen: they ask for something nobody else wants.  They are strange, odd, or perhaps they have a double dose of original sin.  We ask no more for ourselves in this island than what the people of Great Britain have for themselves politically in their island, something they have and enjoy, something they have so often and so recently heroically defended.  We feel that there is nothing strange in asking for that.  The Irish sense of unity, Irish persistence and Irish prayer will surely survive this Act of the British Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Act itself purports to give certain guarantees to some of our people in the North.  One would imagine, if a guarantee were to be asked for, that it would be asked for and given by us, not by the British.  If it were given by us it would last longer and be more valuable than a guarantee given by the British because this guarantee contained in the Ireland Bill is surely illusory and was inserted for a political rather than for a legal purpose. No British Government can guarantee the future.  No British Parliament can <Col N="1027" /> bind the next.  Nobody can be more eloquent and persuasive than a British statesman explaining that he is going back on something that has been passed and guaranteed.</P>
    <P>We are not hostile to the British Labour movement or to the Labour Government in Britain.  In fact, we are not hostile to any movement or Party there.  On the contrary, we are very friendly towards them and recognise that in many ways our fate is bound up with theirs.  We want to see Britain strong and we will lend our assistance, the assistance of our people everywhere to that end, but if she persists in pursuing the present course of action with regard to Ireland, that surely cannot happen.  I have been at conferences and was received with the greatest courtesy by British Ministers and members of Parliament.  But when they were discussing problems concerning the ends of the earth, I always asked myself: are they as ignorant about other places as they are about Dublin because if they are their foreign policy must be a pathetic thing indeed?  There is a blindness there with regard to us.  The vision of British statesmen pierces to the Eastern world, pierces to the ends of the earth, but Irish problems are hidden by a curtain of ignorance, blindness and ancient injustice.</P>
    <P>Nothing would strengthen the cause of Britain in the world or the cause of these islands more than the just solution of Partition or even a movement towards its solution, but this Bill now before the British Parliament seems to go directly contrary to that particular idea.</P>
    <P>We could ask a great variety of questions. Great Britain made it her business to declare and fight over five Continents for what they call the recognition of every people's rights to self determination and for the elimination of racial prejudices and religious discrimination.  Britain prevented France from going into the Ruhr and from going into the Rhineland.  If the Ruhr, why not Fermanagh and if the Rhineland why not Tyrone?  England applies one rule to the world and another special rule to Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" /> We feel that we can face this situation with calm, with discipline and confidence.  All of our history teaches us that there is in our people persistence in the idea of the unity of their own country and there is an enormous number of Irishmen with that sense of Irishness beyond the seas to assist us. That makes us confident that no Act of the British Parliament, no matter how it is passed or by whom it is passed, can prevail against us.  We need not be anything but disciplined and calm on the subject, and I think we can be confident that in the future, and perhaps the not too distant future, we shall see another British Government and another British Parliament, more enlightened and, we would hope, more powerful than the present British Parliament, regretting and annulling this Act, regretting the haste, the ignorance and the furtive bigotry that seems to me to be behind the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second the motion proposed by Senator Michael Hayes.  The motion asks us to join with Dáil Éireann in making a solemn protest against the action of the British Government in introducing the Ireland Bill, which attempts to perpetuate the unnatural division of our country.</P>
      <P>The history of Great Britain's relations with this country is in the main a series of blunders, and this latest blunder which has aroused bitter resentment from one end of this country to the other is all the more difficult to understand when such great efforts are being made by the democracies of the world at the present time to build up anew a world where the natural rights of man would be safeguarded against dictatorship and tyranny in whatever guise they may present themselves. The leadership and generosity of that great Republic with which we have so many ties, the United States of America, in this matter have evoked warm admiration and expressions of appreciation from democratic minded people the world over.  This country is one&mdash;and it is a natural geographical entity&mdash;and Antrim is as much a part of Ireland as Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great statesman who in his day served his country well, said: &ldquo;Frontiers traced with ink on other inks can <Col N="1029" /> be modified.  It is quite another thing when the frontiers were traced by Providence.&rdquo; The Irish nation has the right to decide its own forms of Government and the vast majority of the people of this country have decided most emphatically that a republican form of Government suits the needs of this country better than any other. Surely it is not asking too much of the minority to respect the firm convictions of the majority&mdash;it is the democratic way.  Minorities have their rights&mdash; our Constitution safeguards these rights&mdash;civil and religious liberty is guaranteed&mdash;but majorities also have their rights.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning that England's relations with this country had been in the main a series of blunders, and that this latest blunder was the most difficult to understand.  I had hoped that in the course of the years better relations were growing up between the two countries&mdash;better understanding by the peoples of the two countries of each other's problems and difficulties was surely developing.  The old prejudices and animosities, in the main, were slowly dying out.  The respecting of our neutrality during the last war seemed to me to give hope that might at last was giving way to right in England's relations with this country.  Now all that goodwill has been swept away almost overnight by this unqualified action on the part of the British Government.  The deepest feelings of the country have been roused and resentment is widespread. Partition will go&mdash;I have no doubt about that, and I think there is no one in this Assembly to-day who has any doubt about it either&mdash;but many, many years will elapse before the Irish people will forget the latest insult that has been thrown in their teeth.</P>
    <P>As to the future, we have to face the facts.  All our own efforts and the efforts of what the Taoiseach called yesterday in the Dáil &ldquo;our far-flung spiritual empire&rdquo; must be bent to the task of placing before the free peoples of the world the facts about Partition. Everywhere that England's statesmen prate about democracy and democratic principles they must be met with the question: &ldquo;Why not apply those principles <Col N="1030" /> to the small nation at your own doorstep?&rdquo;  These efforts of ours must be persisted in.  The leadership in these efforts rests on those who have the right to lead&mdash;the elected representatives of the people.  Let not ill-considered or rash act on the part of anyone, no matter how high the motives may be that actuate him, be attempted that would harm the national cause.  The passage of this motion in the Dáil yesterday and its certain passage in the Seanad to-day indicates clearly that the full resources of this small nation are available to make our protest effective in a disciplined and orderly manner.</P>

      <P>I feel it to be my duty to comment on some aspects of this motion and on the speeches which it has evoked.  I would like to say at first how much I appreciate the spirit of Senator Hayes' opening remarks in general.  It breathed the spirit of Thomas Davis, who is my ideal in Irish politics.  I welcome the universality of his definition of Irishmen.  I welcome his statement that variety leads to strength and I hope I may be forgiven if I introduce a little variety in this debate this afternoon.  I hope ultimately it will strengthen the debate and do it good and if I say anything that is wrong, that it will fall on my head and on my head only.  I share in the firm belief in the persistence of Irish unity, and most of those for whom I stand do the same.  I have heard with interest and general agreement Senator Hearne's remarks on the respect due to the firm convictions held by the majority.  I heard with solemnity his remarks on ill-considered and rash acts.  What I am doing is not an ill-considered act&mdash;it may be a wrong one: time will tell.  In speaking on this motion I share his ultimate belief that Partition will go, but I insist that the would must first be cleansed and healed in the right way or it will go septic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say how much impressed I was by the dignity and force of the language in this motion?  It has the whole weight of tradition behind it, the tradition of the Irish independence movement. But this tradition was that of a revolutionary movement and we must <Col N="1031" /> consider very carefully whether we should still use words, in this year of grace, 1949, that always before led to violence.  It is the idiom of violent action.  Are we wise to use it?  I felt the weight of tradition behind these words and felt that tradition vibrant in every phrase of the speeches coming afterwards, but I think it is for us to keep cool heads in this matter and I wonder are we quite sure where these words will lead us.  I feel there is danger in the phrasing of the motion and misrepresentation in one paragraph. I think it is my duty, as representative of the university, to keep a cool head and a calm heart.  This I will try to do.  Many people may regret any note of criticism or dissentience in this debate; I do not enjoy the task of introducing it.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the whole problem of Partition turns on this very issue, namely, a true understanding and fair handling of the problems of our minorities, north and south.  Accusations of disloyalty or treachery will do no good.  We must on both sides, on the side of the majority and on the side of the minority, exercise patience and forbearance.  I have said I was deeply moved at the solemn emphasis in the wording of the motion. Let me, as a token of respect, borrow some of its phrases to express certain sentiments which I feel deeply and which the majority of those whom I represent feel deeply also.  I use the words of the motion out of respect.  I solemnly reassert the indefeasible right of every Irishman, north and south, to disagree with any majority when he is convinced that they are doing wrong.</P>
    <P>I reaffirm my loyalty and the loyalty of many of my constituents to the Republic and to its ideals of liberal nationalism.  I pledge my and their fullest efforts to bring about a genuine concurrence of wills.  I feel I may fairly say that the university which I represent, Dublin University, in its own way is doing something to bring about that concurrence of wills.  Within its walls, 30 per cent. from the North and some 50 or 60 per cent. from the South live happily, without disorder and without bitterness&mdash;and I believe that, when they go from our halls, they are better <Col N="1032" /> Irishmen as a result of that friendly living together.  Lastly, I repudiate the belief that violence of language can do any good in this context.</P>
    <P>I come to my specific criticism of the motion.  It is of paragraph 5, which states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Places on record its indignant protest against the introduction in the British Parliament of legislation purporting to endorse and continue the existing partition of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have read the clause in the British Bill with the greatest care and I firmly feel that this is a misrepresentation.  It seems to me that the sole purpose of that clause in the British Bill is to transfer the ultimate decision about Partition from Westminster to Stormont. Now, I agree that this is a constitutional development.  It gives power to the Stormont Parliament which they did not hold under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.  We must ask ourselves is it in the right direction, is it more or less democratic, to leave the final word to the minority concerned? Or to put it more cogently, do we want to force unification against the will of 800,000 Irishmen?  That is the ultimate question.  Do we want to force unification against the will of 800,000 Irishmen? It seems to me that the British Act leaves it open to us to persuade the North, but they will only accept a process of persuasion.  In other words, I feel that the language used in the motion is too strong.  The clause does not, to my mind, purport to endorse and continue; it accepts the present <i>de facto</i> state of affairs and says: &ldquo;Go on that, if you wish.&rdquo;  The implication is, &ldquo;persuade&rdquo;.  In fact, the leading article in the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> emphasises most emphatically that, if the Irishmen, North and South, desire unity, England will do nothing to stop it.  There I believe the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> speaks the true voice of England.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in this British Bill.  I find no reference in our motion to what is the most important clause to thousands and tens of thousands of Irishmen to-day, especially graduates of our universities, namely, the fact that this Bill confers a special citizenship on our people.  I wish to put <Col N="1033" /> on record here, as representative of Dublin University and as a representative of others who wish to have an open market for their talents when they need it, that we are grateful for that clause, that we consider it is proof that there is no vindictiveness in the British Government's attitude.  Many have questioned the motives of the British Government.  May I say quite definitely that there is nothing more futile in practical politics than questioning other people's motives.  Let us question our own with the utmost scrupulousness, but when we begin questioning others', we are simply putting our progress back.</P>
    <P>I have a further general criticism to add.  I feel that the general tone of the discussion in the other House and outside it&mdash;not here&mdash;has been that of violent words.  I do feel that violent words may lead to violent deeds.  I feel that if we or anyone else, by violence of word, move violence of deed nearer by one hairbreadth, we may be guilty of the most terrible crime to the Irish people.  We should be guarded against using even such words as we find in this motion, restrained and all as it is in its general phrasing. &ldquo;In violation of those rights&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;violation&rdquo;&mdash;very close to violence; &ldquo;indignant protest&rdquo;&mdash;I think we should be most guarded and restrained in this matter.  I heard elsewhere such words as &ldquo;resentment&rdquo;, &ldquo;indignation&rdquo;, &ldquo;hate&rdquo;, &ldquo;blame&rdquo;, &ldquo;vindictiveness&rdquo; and &ldquo;bigotry&rdquo;.  When I hear language of that kind, I feel like Kubla Khan&mdash;&ldquo;and mid this tumult Kubla heard from far ancestral voices prophesying war&rdquo;.  God forbid that that be so, but there are already echoes of that tumult of ancestral voices prophesying war.  I welcome the Taoiseach's phrase that we must be dignified, orderly and calm.  Are we to live up to it?  Senator Hayes has endorsed it.  I welcome the Minister for Finance's phrases, that we should do this calmly, dispassionately, quickly and quietly.  We will all agree about quickly, but will we entirely agree with the other terms?  I wish to express the attitude of the minority, which I on the whole represent, to violence of words or violence of deeds.  We cannot accept the suggestion: &ldquo;We would, if we <Col N="1034" /> could, but we can't.&rdquo;  The majority I represent repudiate that suggestion.  It will not support in any way words or deeds of violence against our fellow-Irishmen.</P>
    <P>I want to make one more remark in general.  Since the national collection in this country there has been a steady propagandist pressure on the minority in the Twenty-Six Counties to toe the line and I want to talk about that. The minority in general is entirely agreed with the ends before us in this House.  We do want unity, but we are not agreed about the means which are or may be employed.  Some of us are not &ldquo;determined to do everything that lies in our power to put an end to this wrong.&rdquo;  There are things that lie within our power that may be wrong. If they are wrong, we will not support them.  I recall Daniel O'Connell's statement on Repeal&mdash;that it was worth not one drop of Irish blood.  I wish that every leader in this country would say the same thing firmly and emphatically on the present issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera yesterday used a prophetic and profound phrase when he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It seems to me that, if a malignant spirit was attempting to stir up the old animosity, it could not have discovered a more effective means.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was deeply and profoundly right. There is and has been since the Fall a malignant spirit trying to foster this old animosity, but a more effective means it could not find than that one side to the quarrel should think it had the whole truth and the whole right and that one side to the quarrel should believe that depth of feeling is a proof of rightness of action.  I insist that, though there are strong rights on our side, there are other rights to be considered. I insist that depth of feeling is not a proof of rightness of action.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to occupy the time of the Seanad at any great length.  Indeed, I had hoped that I would not be expected to speak at all this evening.  It was not the speech of Senator Stanford that brought me to my feet, but that I felt that it might be misunderstood if I did not say at least a few words here <Col N="1035" /> to-day.  I spoke at length yesterday evening in the Dáil on this motion and I endeavoured to speak as calmly as the circumstances warranted.</P>
      <P>I spoke as forcibly as I knew how and with all the ability and eloquence that God has endowed me because I felt that not for very many years had this country faced such a serious situation as we face to-day.  I endeavoured to interpret the feelings of the vast majority of our people from North to South when I spoke yesterday evening, and, in endeavouring to do that, I spoke strongly and forcibly and, I hope, calmly and, as I said, with sobriety of language. Looking back to-day, I feel that, far from having spoken too strongly, far from having uttered the expressions to which I endeavoured to give expression, too forcibly, I failed to express in adequate language the feeling of deep resentment that exists amongst our people, North and South, on this issue, and, if I intervene to-day, it is merely to state that anything I said yesterday was a failure properly to express that depth of feeling and to put into words as solemn a warning as could possibly be given to these people who are responsible for the situation which has been brought about.  Further than that, I do not intend to go to-day.</P>
      <P>Since I took up the leadership of the present Government, I have enunciated the policy for which I stood and stand and the policy for which the Government of which I am head stands and has stood.  That policy was friendship with Britain.  That policy, first of all, was peace at home.  The enmity and bitterness between Irishmen at home had, at all costs, to be ended, even if in ending it, we did tread upon the feelings and the prejudices of certain people at home and certain people in Great Britain.  That, I felt, was our first duty and, thank God, that has been achieved.  We stand here on this issue of the unity of our country a unified people, with a unified purpose and a resolute determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise fully with the views to which Senator Stanford has given expression. There are not many things he has said with which I am in very <Col N="1036" /> great disagreement, but it did appear to me that, while he was speaking about a one-sided approach to the problem, the real criticism of his approach is that it was one-sided.  He spoke about our attitude to the North. What about the attitude of the 800,000 about whom he spoke towards our minority in the North?  I will endeavour to do what Senator Stanford said and meet him in the spirit in which he has spoken and to speak with calmness; but I do feel that, unless the terrible consequences that may ensue from this action are made clear, as it does not yet appear to have become clear to people in Great Britain, we may be facing a very serious situation which we cannot control.</P>
    <P>I have wanted peace at home, first of all.  I want peace in the North and, above all, we want unity, North and South, and it is only a few short weeks since I stated in the Dáil my policy with regard to this minority, these 800,000 of whom Senator Stanford has spoken.  I said that, whatever the provocation might be and however great the temptation might be to answer in kind the insults hurled at our people during the general election in the North of Ireland, the slights cast upon this Government and this people down here by the spokesmen of the Northern Government, it was our duty to restrain our language and our feelings, so that when Partition is ended, as it must inevitably be ended, we would have these people coming in on a basis of friendship with us and not in a surly way, with feelings of resentment and hatred smouldering in their hearts. That is my policy and the policy of the Government towards these people.</P>
    <P>As we wanted the friendship of Great Britain and her people, so we want the friendship of the Irish people who differ from us in religion but not in race, in so-called Northern Ireland.  Is there anything wrong with that&mdash;peace at home and an end of bitterness in this free part of this country, the taking of the necessary steps to achieve that, and then the achievement of the unity of our country on the basis of friendship and the fullest recognition of the rights of minorities?  No Government in this country since 1922 has ever been accused of ill-treating minorities. <Col N="1037" /> Can that be said of the Northern Government?</P>
    <P>I cannot put into words what I have been told is the feeling of our minority in the six north-eastern counties, and it is for that reason that this motion was put down in the Dáil and Seanad. It is an unusual step for a Parliament to take, to pass a motion commenting upon the action of the Parliament of another State.  We are now a sovereign independent nation with the right of audience in the councils of the comity of nations.  There is a definite diplomatic procedure by which protests against the action of one State infringing the rights of another may be made.  We have taken all these steps and adopted that procedure, but we felt that the situation was so urgent, the conditions were so fraught with terrible consequences, that, unless we took this unusual step of getting the Parliament of this independent State to pass a resolution of the kind which was passed yesterday, we could not get our views and our feelings heard and our warnings issued sufficiently far flung and with sufficient emphasis to try to stave off the terrible consequences that may ensue.</P>
    <P>I speak to-day, as I said, merely to emphasise and underline the purpose of this resolution and again to issue a warning.  I spoke in a recent broadcast of our policy as regards force and the use of force.  I referred in it to the Christmas message of His Holiness, the Pope, speaking to nations who might have a very good and just cause, in which he exhorted these nations, however good their cause, however just their cause, to pause before they resorted to the terrible arbitrament of force, because of the frightful moral consequences that would ensue.  We followed that lead in this country. Senator Stanford deprecates the suggestion that we would use force, if we could.  If we had the force here to-day to use against the North, I would follow the lead of His Holiness, the Pope, before I used force or allowed force to be used, because I want these people in the North to live with us, as they must eventually live with us as Irishmen and Irishwomen with Irishmen and Irishwomen, on the basis <Col N="1038" /> of friendship and equal citizenship of a free nation.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford has spoken about the true understanding and handling of minorities.  I have stated frequently in public and in private, in official and unofficial conversations I have had about this issue with various responsible people, that, if these 800,000 people referred to by Senator Stanford think there is anything more they want in the way of guarantees than are written solemnly into our Constitution, let them write their own ticket and we will give them to them.  If they are afraid for their religion or the exercise of their religion or the free expression of their views, if human language can find any more emphatic method of expressing it than is to be found in the Constitution under which we operate in this country, let us have it and we will give it to them.  If they are afraid of their industries, we will give them guarantees.  If they are afraid of their social services, we will give them guarantees. What more do they want?</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford asks do we want to bring about the unification of these 800,000 people without their consent?  We have the right to do so and we do want it, with or without their consent, but preferably with their consent.  The British people through their representatives have signed the North Atlantic Treaty and in the preamble to that treaty parties who become signatories thereto express their determination to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilisations of their people founded on the principles of democracy. We ask for no more than that the problem of Partition and the conduct of our ancient nation of Ireland should be governed and guided and founded on the principles of democracy and the essential principle of democracy is that the majority of the nation decides, with due reference to the rights of minorities.  This nation is one and undivided.  It is the right of the majority of the Irish nation, without interference from outside, to say what its form of government will be and then to give every proper safeguard and due observance for the right of minorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1039" /> This area of the six north-eastern counties, as Senator Hayes has pointed out, was created by a British Parliament for British purposes.  It is an artificial area.  It has no right to say that that Six County area is to be taken as a separate entity and the principles of democracy applied to it without any reference to the fact that it is essentially a part of this whole island of ours, the island of Ireland. That is not democracy.  The case that is endeavoured to be made for these 800,000 of a minority is that they have a little piece of our country carved out deliberately for them by the British Parliament to bring about the situation that is in existence at the present time and has been in exisence for 27 or 28 years past, that they must always have a majority in that particular area without reference to the wishes of the people of the whole island.  That is not democracy.  It is spurious democracy, artificially created in order to give a false impression throughout the country and throughout the world. That is all we ask.</P>
    <P>I said yesterday there was a choice. We offered friendship to the North, friendship to Great Britain.  We have endeavoured to strengthen the bonds that exist, or ought to exist, between us and the people of Great Britain.  We have achieved the strengthening of the bonds that have existed and should exist between us and Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and we have the friendship of the new Republic of India and the Dominions of Ceylon and Pakistan.  With all countries of the world we wish to live in friendship.  We wish to give the contribution that we can give to the spiritual values that are so much needed in the world at the present moment and to the maintenance of world peace, but we are prevented from doing that.  We are prevented from joining this North Atlantic Pact, which we would join if it were not for Partition, as, I believe, in accordance with the wishes of the people, and that veto is given by this Bill that was introduced into the British House of Commons a little over a week ago, not to the Parliament of a democratic <Col N="1040" /> country but to the Parliament deliberately created and artificially set up in order that there should exist in that particular area a majority which would always be in a position to enforce its will against the majority of the Irish people, and a minority that was brought into that area against its will and is being kept in there against its will.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford asks, do we want to have this unification of 800,000 people against their will?  Who asked for the will of the people of Fermanagh, Tyrone and Derry City?  Were they consulted when they were brought in by force of British arms and are kept there at the present moment by force of British arms?  What is the use of talking about bringing 800,000 people against their will into this country when hundreds of thousands of Irish Catholics and of Irish Protestants are being kept in the North against their will and were brought into the North against their will?  If there is any truth or any justification for this proposal that these people should be consulted and given a veto let them as a first instalment of justice give us back Tyrone, Fermanagh and South Armagh and where would your homogeneous area of North of Ireland be then?  Our Catholics were brought into the North of Ireland in order to create an economic entity of such a kind that could stand as an economic unit. Without Tyrone and Fermanagh and the other areas that I have referred to, Northern Ireland as an economic unit could not exist for a moment. That is why we were brought in, forced in and kept in by force.</P>
    <P>I feel that it is essential to bring these facts before the decent people of England and the decent people of Northern Ireland and I do sincerely believe that there are decent people in England and decent people in Northern Ireland who want to know the real facts and to do justice to us. We have to get over the veto of these people, a ruling, privileged class in the North.  We have to get beyond the politicians in England and get down to the decent people in England.  We have had many troubles, many trials and many conflicts with Great Britain <Col N="1041" /> and the British people.  Always after tragedies and always too late, the essential decency of the British people rose up and gave us at least some measure of justice.  It is to those people we have to appeal.</P>
    <P>There are, as I said in the Dáil last week, many decent people in the North who wish this ended.  There is a growing volume of opinion, I believe, in the North that is being prevented from giving its expression by the ruling privileged class in the North.  We want to get to them.  We want to get to the decent people in Great Britain and that is the way we will do it without resort to arms and by the force of the justice of our case just as we won in days gone by, by the justice of our case.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford said that we must not fall into the error of thinking that right and justice lie all on the one side.  I agree.  But what is wrong is that these people in the North think that right lies on their side because they have might to back them up.</P>
    <P>I want to end the remarks I have to make by again stating that those people of ours in the North, who were coerced into that area by a British Act of Parliament and who are being kept there by British force and who are going to be handed over by this Bill to the permanent veto of the ruling privileged class of the North, have had a feeling of frustration.  Their minds and their bodies have been tortured with this Partition, not physically tortured but tortured spiritually by the lack of hope.  They want to get out of that prison in which they are being coerced and kept at the present moment.  If we here in this country do not give them the lead, if we, with the unity we have here now on this issue, cannot restrain them from doing what we, all of us, want to do, then I shudder at the consequences which this Bill that was brought in by a Labour Government may bring about.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford appears to think that we have in some way minister-preted the effect of this Bill.  He gave the precise interpretation that we have given, namely, that it transfers, or purports to transfer, the ultimate decision from Westminster to Stormont.  I <Col N="1042" /> think Senator Stanford has not fully appreciated the significance of that undoubtedly correct statement&mdash;from Westminster to Stormont.  Stormont means an artificially created majority of a privileged class who will always say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  That is what we object to. Why was it necessary to put into this Bill language such as this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In no event will Northern Ireland or any part thereof cease to be part of His Majesty's Dominions&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Was it not essential to see that the privileged ruling class in the North, who were expressly and artificially created for the purpose of having a majority there all the time at the expense of our people there, would have a veto?  Why was it necessary that they should have that veto, even as against the majority of the British people in the Parliament of West-minister, even though a majority of the British people in the Parliament of Westminster might want to let Tyrone, Fermanagh, Derry City and South Armagh, where there are undoubtedly nationalist majorities, have their right, and wanted to give that instalment of justice?</P>
    <P>Why should that privileged class have that?  What was the necessity for putting it in that language?  The fact that it is in that language shows the sinister motives behind this Bill. That language, the form of the language, the reference to the territorial integrity of Northern Ireland in the long title to the Bill, using the phrase in Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty&mdash;these are the things that have roused our people North and South. These are the things that have gratuitously and unnecessarily caused the bitter and widespread feelings that are in existence to-day.</P>
    <P>However strong the language that I might use, whatever words of hyperbole or even exaggeration I might employ, I assert here solemnly and, I hope, calmly and with all due sense of my responsibility, that they would be inadequate to express the feelings of rage and frustration that exist in the country to-day amongst the vast majority of our people North and South.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Dr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators can see, this is a very simple and very brief Bill.  The Bill is merely an empowering Bill that empowers the Minister for Defence, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, to bring in a new scheme with regard to the retiral pay and pensions of members of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>If authority is given to this Bill that new scheme must, like the parent scheme, be submitted for approval to both Houses.  The permission sought in this Bill is to empower the two Minister to bring in a new scheme which will embrace the Army chaplains. The existing scheme includes members of the Defence Forces and members of the Army Nursing Service, but it does not include Army chaplains.  There are at the moment a number of Army chaplains who have service of 20 years or more and, under the existing scheme, they are not pensionable.  This proposal has been submitted for the consideration of the Bishops and they approve.  In the Dáil exception was taken to the term &ldquo;chaplaincy service.&rdquo; It is not a very elegant expression but I had the matter looked into and I find that those are the words that have been used in Defence Force regulations since the first reference to the chaplain service of the Army.  I have been advised by the legal people in the office of the Parliamentary draftsman that it is wiser and safer to stick to the terms that are already used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for an increase in the maximum number of district justices. Originally, under Section 68 of the <Col N="1045" /> Courts of Justice Act, 1924, the number of district justices was limited to 33.  The Courts of Justice Act, 1928, provided, however, for the appointment of not more than four assistant justices.  No further change was made until 1946, at which time there were three assistant justices holding office. In the meanwhile, the volume of business in the district court had increased considerably, particularly in the Dublin Metropolitan District, with the result that it had become necessary to employ temporary district justices on an ever-increasing scale.  A stage was eventually reached when as many as seven or eight temporary justices were being employed almost continuously. Manifestly this was a most undesirable position and one that should not be tolerated any longer than was absolutely necessary.  Accordingly, in the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, 1946, provision was made for an increase to 40 in the maximum number of justices.  The office of assistant justice was abolished at the same time so that the actual increase in the permanent strength of the District Court Bench was four, that is to say, that, under the new arrangement, there were 40 jusstices as compared with 33 justices and three assistant justices under the old system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the enactment of the 1946 Bill, the three assistant justices then in office were appointed justices and permanently assigned to the Dublin metropolitan district where, in fact, they had been continuously employed for several years previously.  There were then six justices permanently assigned to Dublin.  The four additional justices appointed were not permanently assigned to any district, the idea being that they would be available to be assigned, from time to time, to any district in which their services might be required.  They became known in consequence as &ldquo;moveable&rdquo; justices.  It was thought, or, at any rate, hoped, that the four &ldquo;moveable&rdquo; justices with, perhaps, occasional assistance from &ldquo;temporaries&rdquo;, would suffice to meet all requirements, including the provision of reliefs for country justices while on holidays or on sick leave, as well as the extra help <Col N="1046" /> which, it was known at the time, would continue to be required in Dublin for some considerable time to come.  In point of fact, two of the &ldquo;moveable&rdquo; justices have been employed exclusively in Dublin ever since their appointment and a third &ldquo;moveable&rdquo; justice has been similarly employed in that district for the last 15 months or so.  It has been necessary to allocate the fourth &ldquo;moveable&rdquo; justice for more than one-half of his time to assist in one of the districts adjacent to Dublin, in which the volume of work for several years past has been more than the permanently assigned justice could cope with.</P>
    <P>In view of what I have said, it will not, I am sure, come as any great surprise to Senators to learn that the hopes entertained at the time of the passing of the 1946 Act have been completely falsified in practice.  The services of temporary justices have continued to be required although, admittedly, on nothing like the scale on which they were required before 1946, but, nevertheless, to an extent sufficient to be still a source of serious concern to the Government.  Except for one brief period last year, there has been no time since 1st October, 1946, when there has not been at least one temporary justice operating, and on occasions there have been as many as four, five or six.  In the period of two and a half years, from 1st October, 1946, to the 31st March last, temporary justice were employed to an extent which was the equivalent of more than two full-time justices.  So far as can be foreseen at present, additional assistance to much the same extent will continue to be required for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>As I have explained, two of the &ldquo;moveable&rdquo; justices have been employed exclusively in the Dublin metropolitan district for the last two and a half years, and as these two justices were doing exactly the same work as the permanently assigned justices and as there was no prospect of being able to do without their services in Dublin in the foreseeable future, the Government recently decided that these two justices should be given the status of Dublin metropolitan justices and be thereby entitled to the increased <Col N="1047" /> salary of £1,430 as compared with the salary of £1,300 per annum payable to an ordinary justice operating outside the Dublin metropolitan district.  The Government, in pursuance of this decision, formally assigned the two justices in question permanently to the Dublin metropolitan district as from 1st April last.  The present position, therefore, is that instead of having four &ldquo;moveable&rdquo; justices as was contemplated by the 1946 Act, we have only two and one of these is at present immobilised in Dublin and is likely to remain so immobilised for a more or less indefinite period while the other will continue to be required to devote at least one-half of his time to one particular district near Dublin.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it was abundantly clear that additional assistance would continue to be required and the Government, having carefully considered the matter, came to the conclusion that the wiser course, on the whole, would be to increase the number of permanent justices rather than carry on as has been done for the last couple of years by appointing temporary justices.  The Bill, accordingly, proposes to raise to 42 the maximum number of justices that may hold office at any one time.  The figure of 42 is a maximum figure and I would like to emphasise that there will be no obligation to have that number of justices always. No doubt, if at any time, the state of the business in the district court so warrants, the number of justices employed will be reduced accordingly, this being done by not filling vacancies as they occur.  On the other hand, it may be as well that I should make it clear that I can give no assurance that, even with the maximum number of justices raised to 42, it will be possible to dispense entirely with temporary justices but we may hope that their services will be necessary only very occasionally. As I said when introducing the Bill in the Dáil, to maintain a permanent establishment of justices sufficient to meet all and every kind of emergency would be a needlessly extravagant arrangement but we should try to secure that the permanent establishment is as nearly adequate as possible so that the occasions upon which recourse <Col N="1048" /> must be had to the services of temporary justices may be reduced to a minimum.  This is the underlying idea in Section 3 of the Bill and is one which I believe will find a ready acceptance on all sides.</P>
    <P>The second matter with which the Bill deals is concerned with the retiring age of district justices.  Under Section 15 of the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, 1946, all justices must retire on reaching the age of 65. The only exceptions to this rule are three of the present Dublin metropolitan justices and the present Cork City justice who have a right to remain on until 70 by virtue of a provision in the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  There is one other justice whose age of retirement was extended to 70, under Section 47 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936.  This particular section empowered the Government to extend the retiring age of a justice assigned to an Irish-speaking district provided that the Government were satisfied that he was able to do the work of his courts through the medium of Irish and that he was not suffering from any disability which would render him unfit to continue to discharge the duties of his office.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as originally introduced in the Dáil, proposed to confer power on the Chief Justice, after consultation with the Minister for Justice, to continue a district justice in office from year to year after he had attained the age of 65.  The maximum period for which a justice might be so continued in office was to be five years and the justice would each year have to satisfy the Chief Justice that he (the justice) was not suffering from any disability which would render him unfit to discharge efficiently the duties of his office.</P>
    <P>Somewhat to my surprise, I must confess, this proposal met with considerable criticism from members of the Opposition in the other House.  It was argued that it was a mistake to reverse the decision which had been embodied in the Act of 1946, fixing a retiring age of 65 for all justices.  I want to say, first of all, with reference to this particular criticism, that I do not accept the proposition that what <Col N="1049" /> we are proposing to do in the Bill amounts to a reversal of the 1946 decision.</P>
    <P>Properly understood, the proposal in the Bill amounts to no more than a modification of the 1946 decision by getting rid of the inflexible rule of automatic retirement at 65, but subject to the provision of adequate safeguards with the object of securing that any justice who may be continued in office after 65 will be able to discharge his duties satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Apart from the provisions of Section 47 of the 1936 Act to which I have already referred, and which conferred power to extend the retiring age of justices assigned to Irish-speaking districts, a precedent for what is now proposed is also to be found in Section 35 of the Court Officers Act, 1926, which empowered the Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to extend the retiring age of county registrars up to 70. This latter power has been frequently availed of during the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>While I myself am inclined to think that it is proper and desirable that the normal retiring age for justices should be 65, having regard to the nature of their duties and, in particular, to the amount of travelling that has to be done by justices in country districts, I may, perhaps, be permitted to recall that the Joint Committee of the Oireachtas, which in 1930 examined the working of the Courts of Justice Act, unanimously recommended that the age of retirement for district justices should be extended to 72.</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, that that recommendation was not accepted by the Government of the day, and I would not myself be prepared to recommend to the Oireachtas that it should be accepted now.  But if a committee of the Oireachtas, upon which all Parties were represented, apparently saw nothing wrong with a proposal that the normal retiring age for all justices should be 72, then I fail to see why the much more modest proposal contained in Section 2 of the Bill should evoke such strong criticism.</P>
    <P>It was urged also in the Dáil that the duty of deciding whether a particular justice should be continued in office <Col N="1050" /> after reaching the age of 65 should not be entrusted to any one person, no matter how high his standing might be. In defence to the views expressed by the Leader of the Opposition in the Dáil I agreed to bring in on the Committee Stage an amendment which has been incorporated in the Bill now before the Seanad and the effect of which is to entrust the duty in question to a committee consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney-General.</P>
    <P>Senators will, no doubt, have observed that provision is made in Section 2 for consultation with the Minister for Justice.  This provision is considered desirable because there may be circumstances affecting the particular justice seeking an extension of his period of office or the position generally in the district court at the time of which the Minister for Justice might be aware and which it might be proper to bring to the notice of the committee before they decide to extend the retiring age of the justice.  The committee, however, will have complete discretion in the matter and will not be bound by any representations or suggestions that might be made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is only one other matter to which I wish to refer, and that is the repeal of Section 47 of the 1936 Act. With the enactment of Section 2 of the Bill there will no longer be any necessity for the Government to have power to extend the retiring age of justices in Irish-speaking districts.  In fact, it would be clearly undesirable that there should be two separate authorities vested with the power to extend the retiring age of certain of the justices. The Bill accordingly proposes to repeal Section 47 of the 1936 Act.</P>

      <P>The Minister when introducing this Bill gave a detailed outline of what it proposed to do, as well as increasing the number of district justices from 40 to 42.  He made it plain that the passing of the Bill does not entail that permission is given for the appointment of a number of temporary justices, in addition to those already provided for.  I think that we should have now reached the stage, having emerged from the emergency <Col N="1051" /> and all the legislation and court work that arose out of it, when there should be some decrease in court work, and that it would not be necessary to appoint additional justices.  A stage should be reached when, at least, the services of those temporarily employed to get rid of arrears of court work could now be dispensed with.  Has any consideration been given to that question, or is this Bill being rushed through both Houses before a redistribution of the court areas has been gone into?</P>
      <P>I should like to know if there is any information available concerning the work discharged by district justices. I am quite sure that there must be many districts in which there is very little court work from one end of the year to the other, while in adjacent districts, as in the case of dispensary doctors, there would be a volume of arrears over a long period.  I think that by carrying out a redistribution of work in court areas we might be able to avoid being asked to consider the appointment of additional justices. I should like to have heard that some attempt was made to provide the people with cheaper law and to extend the jurisdiction of district courts.  It is well known that small, trifling, cases have to be sent to the circuit courts because district courts have not the necessary power to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill should have been availed of to give the public a simple code of law, a code that would be less expensive for trifling cases, in which those interested have often to travel long distances from rural areas to attend Circuit Courts and also to employ counsel.  As it seems to be the policy, we should avail of every occasion to go into such questions in the light of present circumstances.  When the court areas were first carved out, the mode of transport that is now available, as well as other facilities, was not there.  For these reasons I suggest that the matters I have referred to should be given serious consideration in the near future.  I am sure that the Minister and the Department are aware of the position, and that being so, we must rely upon them, if they consider that additional justices are needed to <Col N="1052" /> expedite cases coming before the courts.</P>
    <P>Another question that arises on this Bill is that&mdash;while the Bill has been improved since its introduction&mdash;concerning the retiring age, where Parliament agreed that 65 should be the retiring age.  It is correct, of course, to say that provisions were made for districts in the Gaeltacht where it might not be possible to get a man capable of transacting business in Irish and where it might be essential for the existing justice to carry on for a number of years, provided he was capable of doing so.  We know that the function of a district justice requires that a man be not so much physically fit as mentally clear.  He must be a man who is clear and alert enough to take in the various arguments put forward and to give a sound judgment.  It is very difficult to decide when a person is or is not in such a state of mind.  This Parliament gave a measure, a measure that was to apply to all persons, which laid down as a basic rule that the retiring age should be 65.  No good reason has been advanced by the Minister, to my mind, that we should depart from that decision now.  We are making a provision for the appointment of additional persons.  The case can nowhere be made that there are not able barristers and solicitors who are quite prepared and willing to take over the position of district justice.  There is no lack of persons capable of filling the position, and there is no good reason for the extension of the age from 65 to 70.</P>
    <P>We are to make provision in this Bill for one section of the people, a very small section which only comprises 40 persons at the present time and 42 when the Bill is passed.  We are asked this, I understand, for one particular person. I am not interested in the individual as I do not know the person and it is not for any personal reasons that I am putting forward this argument.  On the one hand, we are asked in this Bill to deviate from a principle which was accepted a few years ago, whereas on the other hand, we are compelling experienced civil servants, experienced employees of local authorities and heads of various Departments to retire at 65 as no provision <Col N="1053" /> is made for them.  I hold that if we pass a Bill applying to one section, if we are to be consistent, we should apply it to all sections.  We all hope at some time to reach the age of 65, and if a committee were appointed or if it were left to the Chief Justice to decide whether we should be accepted as being capable of carrying on, we would hope to be accepted.  Having made a decision applying to all State and local authority employees, no case can be made, or has been made so far, for deviating from that policy in connection with district justices.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister how many, if any, district justices have been retired under the 65 rule since this decision was made.  If any have, I think an injustice has been done.  If we are to change this regulation for one or two persons&mdash;or, as I said before, for one&mdash;or even for a greater number of people, if any person has been compelled to retire at the age of 65 I say that an injustice has been done to such a person.  I do not wish to make any further case in connection with this because I think the House and the Minister understand that it is not a good thing to depart from an accepted principle and to leave to one, two or three people to decide whether an individual is capable of carrying on in such an important capacity.  What will the qualification be?</P>
    <P>It is improvement to have a committee rather than an individual to decide, but if that committee decides that A, who has reached the age of 65, is a fit person to maintain his position and if in a few weeks time the committee decides that B, whose application is before it, is not fit to occupy that important position, no matter how just their decision may have been, it will be suggested that that decision was influenced through some other channel rather than by the evidence before that body.  I would advise the Minister at this stage to re-examine the question.  If that re-examination is not going to be given, then I think that the only course open to the Minister is to open the door to all civil servants and all State and local authority employees who are or who will be affected, now or in the near future, by the rule of retirement at 65. <Col N="1054" /> If we do not do that we are doing an injustice and creating a favoured class of a small number of people.</P>
    <P>I conclude with that and with the recommendation that at some stage the Minister and his Department might consider giving cheaper law and extending the areas and jurisdiction of the district court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. J.T. O'Farrell Mr. J.T. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I really do not think that any principle is involved in the Bill.  It is rather a matter of expediency.  I would suggest to the last speaker that the interests and welfare of district justices are not so much involved as the interests and convenience of the State.  After all, any district justice who has been allowed to serve until the age of 65 has no genuine grievance if he is then asked to retire. If he is asked to stay longer it is not to oblige him but to enable the work of the courts to be done more effectively and more punctually than would otherwise be the case.</P>
      <P>I do not see any consistency in allowing High Court judges to remain on until the age of 70 and in requiring district justices absolutely to retire at the age of 65.  I fancy that the mental strain and the alertness necessary on the part of a High Court judge is just as great as on the part of a district justice and if the former is considered in all cases to be capable of discharging his judicial duties up to the age of 70 it is rather difficult to suggest a reason why a district justice should be finished at 65.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, no two men are absolutely alike in physical or mental capacities. Some men are young at 70 while others are old at 50.  I think it is sometimes a great pity to have a rigid rule that applies to all men in a particular class. The result is that you have to get rid of, and retire into the backwaters of oblivion, men with splendid capacities based on great experience who could render splendid service for some years longer just because a rule applies without exception.  On the other hand, I think it essential that there should be some age at which men should have to retire, and 65 is a reasonable age. Some of us have had to retire at 60 without complaint, but it depends on the form of employment in which you <Col N="1055" /> are.  If there is any post in which experience is of value and should not be lightly cast aside, it is on the judicial bench.  This Bill would seem to be not for or against the interests of any particular set of individuals, but merely a matter of necessity where the work of the courts is concerned.  Any justice who retired at present at the age of 65 would not, in those circumstances, have any complaint to make.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there is anything at all in the suggestion that this Bill has been brought in for the benefit of one person.  I fancy that is not so.  I feel that no Minister worthy of the name would be guilty of introducing a Bill to the Oireachtas for the benefit of one particular person, unless there were very special reasons for doing so.  At any rate, that is beside the point.  We accept the Bill on its merits, as the causes stated by the Minister seem to be ample justification for its introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CecilLavery" hpid="Mr. Lavery Mr. Lavery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lavery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only a few words to say on the Bill, which is one within a very narrow compass.  Senator Hawkins referred to some matters not raised by the Bill.  He did so only in order to suggest that they might be discussed or considered at some future date.  That is a very dangerous line to take, because observations of that kind can be very provocative.  It is very easy to state a particular point of view on some very important question, like that of cheaper law for the people, and then, having made your point, as if there was only one side to be put, to leave it at that.  Some people think that cheap law is always bad law; some people think it is far better for district courts to have frequent sittings in various small places all through the country, so as to give quick and rapid decisions in small cases, and that you serve the needs of justice better by keeping the jurisdiction of the district court within reasonably low limits, in order to enable that to be done, rather than charge the district court with jurisdiction of a higher kind which would involve substantial sums for poor people, or comparatively poor people, who are entitled to have their cases very fully argued before they are <Col N="1056" /> decided.  On this question, on which one could speak at great length, there are considerations to be taken into account on both sides.  The matter is not raised by the Bill.  Senator Hawkins has indicated one view and I feel I should indicate another, as I have done already, perhaps sufficiently, which is, that it may be better that the district court should be able to decide rapidly and, it is to be hoped, efficiently and justly, small cases.</P>
      <P>There is also to be considered that the District Court has a tremendous body of work to do.  It deals not only with civil cases within a limited jurisdiction but also with criminal cases of a very wide kind.  Apart from that, it is its task to make a preliminary investigation in the case of indictable offences.  I do not think it right to say that the district court in any part of the country is doing very little work. In fact, the experience of most district justices is that they are pretty hard worked and it is hard to find spare justices to take on when necessary to cover the volume of work at a particular time.  Of course, these are not matters that arise under the Bill, which is a simple measure providing for an increase in the number of justices. Senator Hawkins has agreed that the Minister is the best judge of the number of justices that are necessary.  That is obviously so.  It is certainly within my knowledge, in the position I hold at present, that there are delays and that there have been complaints of delays, especially in Dublin and other districts, through the pressure of work and the inadequate number of justices available to deal with it.  There are some cases&mdash;I do not say they amount to a public scandal but they show the situation exists&mdash;where people charged with offences, or who have cases to be tried, have to wait an unreasonable time before they are heard.  There is no doubt that some increase is necessary, though, as the Minister said and as Senator Hawkins recognised, some ease may be obtained in the redistribution of court areas.  That is a very difficult problem, which also will require legislation and will have to be considered separately.  It does not arise at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" /> One question which does arise is that of the retiring age for justices.  It must be remembered that the judicial task is one specially calling for ripe experience and for the sound judgment that comes, or is thought to come, with mature years, and certainly ought not to be lost, as many members of the House will agree, as early as the age of 65.  I had a very learned teacher at one time and one of his sayings was: &ldquo;Man attains the use of commonsense at 30&mdash;if ever&rdquo;.  I do not think age is a very good guide, but there has to be some general rule and there it is.  The appointment of any judicial person does not take place until maturity, in the sense of 30 years at least or upwards, has been attained. That is quite different to servants of local authorities or civil servants, who commence their careers at 20 or perhaps earlier and who have a recognised career of 45 years before they attain the age of 65, at which time they have earned a pension which may or may not be adequate, but is at least some provision for their later years.  It is not outside the experience of members of this House that civil servants who retire at the age of 60 or 65 are by no means spent forces and employ themselves very usefully and bring the benefit of their great experience and ability into other spheres of life, to their own advantage and that of the State.  The civil servant who retires at 65 has by no means ended his useful career as a member of the community. It may be that his most valuable work is still to be done.  Any of us can think of examples of men who retired at 65 and who have done useful work.</P>
    <P>A judge is in a different position, whether he be a member of the District Court bench or in a higher position. The holding of his position is, in a sense, a disqualification for many spheres of activity.  I can illustrate that from particular examples, if necessary. It is not a desirable thing that a man who has held judicial office should go back to the practice of the only profession which he is qualified to practice, the law.  I do not say there is anything wrong in that.  There is nothing wrong in it, and instances have occurred where retired judges in <Col N="1058" /> various courts have gone back to the practice of the profession.  Although it may have happened, and it may not be a very serious thing in itself, it is in some degree undesirable.  Certainly, for members of the judiciary to come back and practise in the courts in which they previously practised is highly undesirable.  I could draw upon the fund of my experience to show that that view has been generally taken.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned already that justices and judges are appointed at a later age than the age at which civil servants or employees of local authorities enter upon their careers.  If they are appointed at the age of 45, they have 20 years' service at 65, and, if they are appointed at 50, they have 15 years' service at 65.  They will have small pensions if they are retired arbitrarily and necessarily at 65.  They will be in a degree unfitted for taking up any other career, because the practice of the law is practically the only career open to them and they are therefore in an entirely different position.</P>
    <P>It has already been adverted to that judges of the Supreme Court, High Court and Circuit Court sit to the age of 72 in one case and the age of 70 in another.  It has also been adverted to that justices in Irish-speaking districts may be continued in office until the age of 70, a clear recognition that their faculties are not considered to be dulled, even though they exercise their judicial functions through the medium of Irish. Irish has many virtues, but I do not know that it has any preserving qualities, that it preserves the brain from decay and that justices in Irish-speaking districts might be supposed to retain their intelligence to a later age than justices elsewhere.  But the Dublin justices also sit to the age of 70, and a very strong case&mdash;a case which I would think is reasonable&mdash;could be made for fixing the age of retirement of all justices at 70.  In these days, with the aid of medical science and the tenor of life in general, I think it is generally recognised that mental powers ordinarily do not decay at as early an age as 65.  As Senator O'Farrell has said, men vary infinitely but one must make a general rule, and 70 seems to be the <Col N="1059" /> age at which it may be assumed that the ordinary man will still be able to bring to bear upon judicial problems, not only ripe experience, but a keen and alert mind.</P>
    <P>Finally, the provision in the Bill is that the question of extending the career of a justice beyond 65 shall be dependent upon his continued capacity to discharge his work, which is to be certified by a committee.  As the Bill was introduced it was provided that the Chief Justice, as head of the judiciary, should be the person to inquire into that matter and give the necessary certificate, and that he should do so after consultation with the Minister for Justice.  It was, of course, highly desirable that the independence of the judiciary should be preserved and that this question should be determined not by any member of the Executive, but determined, and determinable only, by a member of the judiciary.  It was thought, and, I think, rightly, that the Chief Justice was the proper person to do that.</P>
    <P>An amendment was accepted in the Dáil by the Minister and now forms part of the Bill providing that, instead of this matter being inquired into by the Chief Justice, it shall be inquired into by a committee consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney-General. For myself, while I do not think the matter is one of any serious moment, I do not regard it as an improvement. I think it would have been better to have left it to the single individual who has to perform many functions of the kind in the control of the exercise of judicial office.  I think he was the appropriate person.  However, that is no longer under discussion and a committee is now proposed as the body which should deal with it.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins made the point that this committee&mdash;and the individual, the Chief Justice, if it had remained his function&mdash;would be open to suggestions, if they passed one particular case and declined to pass another.  I think it is sufficient to say that people holding responsible positions and entrusted with the discharge <Col N="1060" /> of responsible duties must be trusted to discharge these duties and if there are suggestions made against their <i>bona fides,</i> they ought, by virtue of their positions and the respect they ought to command, to be able to face up to these suggestions.  There are judges deciding questions every day, from the highest to the lowest, and there is always a dissatisfied litigant &mdash;they cannot satisfy both sides. Justices and judges every day have to meet the imputations of persons who do not trust them, persons who may not trust them and who may say that they are influenced by some consideration other than the proper discharge of their duties.</P>
    <P>Whether a man is a judge or holds any other position in life&mdash;a business executive, head of a company or carrying on his own business&mdash;he has to make decisions and do things which will be unpopular with somebody, and the only way in which the work of the State, the work of the courts or the work of business people can be carried on is by people standing up to their responsibilities and discharging their duties, and, if people impute improper motives to them, by repudiating the imputation and trusting that people of goodwill will believe that they have discharged their duties properly.  I think that is sufficient answer to the point made by Senator Hawkins.  I know that suggestions of the kind are made at times, but I do not think that any person who attains to the office of Chief Justice, President of the High Court, or, I hope, Attorney-General, will fail to discharge that duty, or even more onerous duties, or will fail to face with equanimity any suggestions of the kind that may be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister had any great difficulty in making a case for the two material sections of this Bill.  With regard to the matter of the maximum number of justices, everybody has acknowledged that no one can decide it so well as the Minister.  He knows all the circumstances and these circumstances, as he outlined for us in his introductory speech, made it evident that at present <Col N="1061" /> we need more justices.  He also pointed out that it is a maximum, and we may hope that, if our morals improve, that maximum need not necessarily be reached.  Unfortunately, it does seem necessary at present, and it certainly obviates what everybody acknowledges was an undesirable thing&mdash;a perpetuation of the system of appointing temporary justices.</P>
      <P>With regard to the power in Section 2 to extend the retiring age of certain justices, I read very carefully&mdash;I was interested for many reasons&mdash;the discussion in the Dáil and it seemed to me that the argument rather assumed that 65 was a sort of sacrosanct age.  We know how that age got in.  It is the retiring age in the Civil Service and, I think, for teachers.  Unfortunately, it is not the legal retiring age for women teachers, who are very badly treated in this respect, and I should like to interject a protest on their behalf.  At all events, that is how the age of 65 got in, but, as Senator O'Farrell and Senator Lavery have pointed out, in the case of these people, they go into the service young and continue in the service for a great number of years in order to quality for a pension. It may not be adequate, but at least it has some relation to their salary.  That is not the case usually with district justices and it ought not to be the case because for a district justice you want somebody who has had a good deal of experience.  You do not want, as somebody said in the other House, briefless barristers.  District justices will be far more suited to their tasks if they have had experience and come to the position at a rather ripe age.  If they do that, they cannot have very long periods of service if the guillotine is to fall at 65.  I am sure that consideration weighed with the Minister, as it would weigh with me if I were in his place, in extending the age, under proper safeguards, as appears to be done in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a particular procedure that I myself suggested&mdash;I am not sure whether it was on the Courts of Justice Bill or some other Bill&mdash;because there is a precedent in the practice of the universities.  The retiring age for professors in the universities is 65, but <Col N="1062" /> governing bodies of the various colleges and the president of the college can, if they like, ask for an extension from year to year up to 70, which is being done in this Bill.  I suggested that because I thought it would meet a great many difficulties.  I was very pleased to find this provision in the Bill.  I do not know whether I can claim maternity of it.  It is commonsense. Anybody would have thought it. I am glad of it and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that the post of district justice is one of the few positions open to solicitors.  They are really the cinderellas of the legal profession. Barristers and others have all sorts of openings.  We ought not to pare things down so much.  We ought to give them a proper chance.  Very often, if a solicitor takes a post as district justice, he has to give up whatever practice he has and, perhaps, a good practice.  In one case that I know of the person concerned gave up a practice that he could have passed on to his son.  He sacrificed that to serve his country in the very important and noble function of district justice.</P>
    <P>Another argument that occurs to me is that if we make 65 the sacrosanct age for retiral, it is logical, if we want logic, to give old age pensions at 65. The theory underlying retirement at 65 is that everybody is past his best work and should be put on the scrap heap at 65.  I do not see why old age pensions at 65 would not be perceived as a logical consequence.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I welcome the Bill and I am glad it passed through the other House.  I am not in a position to judge as to whether it was an improvement or not&mdash;I think it was an improvement&mdash;to have the committee.  A district justice would welcome the advice of colleagues such as the President of the High Court and the Attorney-General, and consultation with the Minister for Justice.  I think all that gives proper safeguards.  It is a good thing that district justices should be allowed to continue from year to year, under proper safeguards, for the public good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful for the manner in which the Bill has <Col N="1063" /> been received.  It would be a mistake for me to attempt to improve upon the advocacy of Senator O'Farrell, Senator the Attorney-General and Senator Concannon.  They have argued as to why the Bill should be passed. I should like to say, for the information of Senators, that the question of the districts is under consideration.  It is not an easy matter.  We will have to bring in additional legislation and there is a question of the worsening of conditions of members of the judiciary which I do not want to go into but which could be rather difficult to overcome.  While we hope, by this little token of goodwill, perhaps, to buy off, not one, but all of them, we might be able to do something that would be in their interests.  I do not put that up as a reason for bringing in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The reason for bringing in the Bill was to get rid of the permanent appointment of temporary district justices who were, as a matter of fact, mendicants on the doorsteps of an executive.  They could not be free because they were being appointed now and then again, and all that sort of thing, and there was the danger that the independence of the judiciary was to some extent being undermined.  We want to get rid of that.  We hope that the number provided for in the Bill will be the most that we will require.  There may be some unforeseen circumstances in which a district justice might get ill, or two or three might be ill at the same time.  If that should happen and we are not able with the number we have to meet the requirements of the community, we will have to appoint a temporary district justice, but we hope it will be only to meet a very grave emergency or some unforeseen circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in my opening statement, it was not possible to cover every situation that may arise, but we have gone as far as we can.  We hope that with the development of time and the abolition of many restrictions that we have had the number of district justices <Col N="1064" /> may not be required, but I would point out that there were other courts in existence during the emergency which are not now operating.  These courts did a lot of work with which the ordinary courts are now dealing.  We want to get to normality as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The question of the extension of the jurisdiction is being examined, and I know well that when the Bill is introduced to the Dáil dealing with districts and the extension of the jurisdiction, the Minister will not have as easy a time as he had on this Bill.  There will be many points of view put forward with very great vigour, but there is no necessity for me to deal with that now.  We hope that these temporary district justices, who will now be permanent, will do all the relief for holiday work and everything else, where necessary, and that where there are, as has happened in the City of Dublin, long cases where depositions have to be taken, there will be somebody who can be assigned to a job so that people will not be kept in custody and their constitutional rights infringed, except for the shortest possible time.  It is a very important matter.  I am doing my best and the Government is doing its best to give everybody, not only good administration of the law, but speedy and equitable administration of the law. For that reason, I recommend the Bill to the House for acceptance.</P>
