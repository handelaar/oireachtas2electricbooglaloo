      <P>The question is: &ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;  Amendment No. 1 is ruled out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Orpen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have a little clarification on the part of the Minister on what, I presume, Section 1 defines, the work that it is proposed to do.  Under (b) we have land reclamation. I think it would be advisable or very desirable if the Minister would expand a little on the subject of the word &ldquo;reclamation&rdquo;, to say what he considers is included within that word.</P>
      <P>Under (f) we have the improvement of hill grazing.  I do not think it would be altogether fair to ask the Minister to define the limits of &ldquo;hill grazing&rdquo;, the lower limit or the upper limit, because that is a very variable quantity, but I would like to know if he has some idea in his mind of what he expects &ldquo;hill grazing&rdquo; might cover in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say just a few words on the reclamation of estuarine marshes. I take it that that might include the <Col N="1670" /> building up of land in salt estuaries with Spartina and the reclamation of land from the sea by a larger process than mere embankments.</P>
    <P>Under (h), which is any other operation ancillary to the foregoing, I wonder whether the Minister has considered the possibility with regard to land in the neighbourhood of rivers that have been drained by arterial drainage of including walking the land. Most of our rivers to-day are clean and, therefore, no large body of valuable sediment is being carried down. Following extensive arterial drainage work, you would get anything up to 50 years of sediment being carried down and some of our riverside flats might be very much improved if, in conjunction with any works installed to prevent flooding, consideration was given to whether these lands could be converted into warp lands such as are to be seen in the neighbourhood of rivers like the Humber.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite frankly, I must ask you to help me.  I do not know what warp land is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Captain Orpen Captain Orpen">
      <NameTxt>Captain Orpen</NameTxt>
      <P>Water that is carrying valuable sediment can be run on land and then the water can be let out. It is a matter of the provision of sluices through your embankments.</P>
      <P>Is it in order, Sir, under this section to refer to No. 6 in the rehabilitation project?  Although it is presumably implied in the Bill under Section H, about which I was talking, I wanted to get some information under item 6, which says that the Department will assist you.  As I understand it, the Minister's hope is that local contractors will come in and do some of this reclamation, drainage and general rehabilitation of the land.  I wonder if the Minister has considered that while it is very desirable to get local contractors in to do this work, if a local contractor was secured or partially secured in regard to repayment for his work in a manner similar to the system that operates for a contractor who builds a house, and if he knew that he would get the agreed price for the work, it would be very much more likely that you would get a local contractor to come along and put £4,000 or £5,000 into digging machines.</P>

      <P>I read it that this supplementary document which we have got might be referred to as relating to &ldquo;any other operations ancillary to the above&rdquo;.  That was my reading of it, but I bow to your ruling on the point.  You, Sir, would prefer to have it discussed on Section 2?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Captain Orpen Captain Orpen">
      <NameTxt>Captain Orpen</NameTxt>
      <P>I put forward these points to the Minister, because, so far as I see, there is a certain amount of misconception of what the Minister proposes to do and that applies especially to the second item, B, land reclamation, reclamation being often thought in this country of as merely meaning reclamation from the sea and, therefore, much the same as item A, land drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, want some further enlightenment in regard to what exactly&mdash;if indeed it is fair at this stage to ask the Minister to speak exactly&mdash;land reclamation may mean. Frankly, while I seek information on it, I have the feeling that at this stage it is rather difficult to speak definitely and specifically of what exactly will be done under the term &ldquo;reclamation&rdquo;. The amendment put down by Senator Finan has been ruled out, but if you look at the pamphlet which has been circulated, you will see in paragraph 7 the phrase &ldquo;land rehabilitation programme&rdquo; so we take it that the Minister is giving us, under the title of a Land Reclamation Bill, a land rehabilitation project.  I would hope so; I would hope that that is what it would turn out to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reclamation has probably different meanings in different localities.  In a rather poor county like mine, reclamation, in the minds of quite a number of people, will mean reclaiming land which had gone back to moor and heather and bringing it into a proper state of cultivation, which would mean lime, a balancing up of the soil and getting it into a state of fertility.  In other places, reclamation will mean something else.  In a case of low lying <Col N="1672" /> lands which require drainage, drainage would probably be the main activity in which you would have to engage in order to reclaim the land.</P>
    <P>I want to speak on this aspect for a moment or two because I think that when the Minister's agents go through the country, whatever viewpoint men may have who study and ponder over maps in offices at headquarters, and when they go into the fields where the reclamation projects are to be carried out, they will find a rather different sort of problem.  If you are going to carry out drainage on lands that are flooded and low lying, lands which have been neglected for half a century, I have no hope whatever that the reclamation is going to be anything like complete unless, in addition to the drainage, this land is to be ploughed up and reseeded.  In fact, I believe it will be very largely a wasted effort and that you would have to await the results of years&mdash;if indeed you could ever expect to get the land into such a fruitful condition&mdash;before getting a good crop.  It seems to me that over great areas, concurrently with drainage, this other activity must be engaged in.</P>
    <P>I speak of drainage because I think that in our small farm areas we are not going to do much in the way of using bulldozers to level fences and so on.  You may do it, and no doubt will do it, in Meath and Westmeath, on some of the larger farms, where you are going to carry out drainage.  There will be that kind of activity in which bulldozers will be used to deal with ditches, or rather the remains of ditches with whitethorns growing on them in the middle of a great field which was once two fields; but you are not going to do so much of that work on our small farms.  While I know that some people criticise the way in which we manage our land in the sense that we have so many small fields, if we are to utilise our land to the full from the point of view of rotational grazing our farmers have to have fences and on many of our windswept hillsides they want wind breaks and shelters and it is not going to be too easy to persuade them in the beginning that many of their ditches ought to be levelled and that wire fences and so <Col N="1673" /> on should be put up.  That may come after a time but certainly not just yet.</P>
    <P>We are at the point when drainage, in the main, is the sort of activity in which we are going to engage, but unless, over great areas, the Minister's agents when they go on a field and discover the kind of grasses being grown, if they can be called grasses at all, make up their minds on a policy of advising the farmer what he ought to do and how it ought to be done, a great deal of this work will not yield the fruits which we expect and hope will come from it.</P>
    <P>I spoke briefly on this matter on the Second Reading.  I regard it as vital. If I may say so with a certain degree of modesty, I have given this problem of reseeding of our pastures as much study as most people in the country, and I think I can say that I have seen as much of the soil of the country as probably any member of the Oireachtas. I was just going over in my mind how many fields in how many counties I have been in and I can say there are probably only two counties of the 32 in which I have not crossed the fences and been on the soil with some knowledge of what it is like.  I have seen something of fields in other countries, too, and I urge that, concurrently with the plan of drainage, liming and the application of phosphates, it will be a part of the Minister's plan to impress on the farmers the absolute necessity of reseeding their pastures, if we are to get the full fruits from the initial expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has adverted to the last paragraph in the leaflet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have.  I hope that the Minister is going to push that plan with vigour.  I do not know whether the Minister himself has any doubts about this or not.  I have none on the value of the reseeding of pastures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, in that sense we are pushing an open door, as far as the Minister is concerned.  I realise that it is not going to be so simple for our farmers.  I know that a number of plots were laid down, up and <Col N="1674" /> down the country, for a number of years before the Minister's time.  I saw the reports of the experiments carried out then in the Department's journal and since then.  Here and there, many other people have been laying down plots, and with rather different results but, on the whole, I think that on some of the Minister's own farms&mdash;I think in Ballyhaise and elsewhere&mdash;there is evidence of the success of this method of what we call grass or animal husbandry.  We know how low the yields are from grass farming in the country at present.  We know that some of our best land here on test is not giving more than one-third of what farmers are getting from not so good land in other parts of the country.  The Minister has knowledge of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been on these farms in both places and I have seen the work that is being done.  It seems to me that that is as urgent an aspect of the Minister's policy as drainage and the application of lime and phosphate to the soil and that it must be pursued as vigorously as possible.  I had an opportunity of discussing with a gentleman who is a pioneer in regard to this method of farming many of the difficulties that arise out of the reseeding of pastures and the management of these pastures afterwards.  I have seen something quite recently of this myself and last night, in the restaurant of this House, I discussed the problem with this gentleman.  He knows a good deal about our farming methods here and their fruits.  He knows what the farming methods in his own part of Ireland are like and he knows what they are like in Britain too because he has been in many of these places.  He gave as his opinion that the most valuable development in Britain previous to the war was the decision of the British Government to encourage the reseeding of pastures by the payment of £3 per acre for the work carried out.  That had two beneficial results.  It encouraged men to do something which they had not done before and it brought the Ministry into it in a responsible way so that they were interested in the success of the project, in studying the results and in advising the farmers as to how best the question could be <Col N="1675" /> managed.  I am quite convinced that the trials carried out in this country which were not a success were not a success because of causes which can be easily determined and I am quite convinced that the success of cultivating and developing our soil resources here is probably even to a greater extent dependent on the management of the pastures afterwards.  That is something, I think, for which there is necessity for more study than has been given to it up to the present.  I do not know whether the Minister has gone to the full limits of his desires when he decides to drain and subsidise to a certain extent the restoration of the soil's fertility, but I am quite convinced that the whole project will be incomplete on a great part of our land unless we decide to sow fresh pastures.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the other problem of the improvement of hill grazing.  The Minister indicated on the last occasion that he has under consideration the question of the securing of the services of the best expert available in these islands on the development of field pastures.  He was not then in a position to say very definitely that the services of this specialist had been secured and we are not going to press him on that point because I am sure that he is going to do the best he can.  There is an immense field for development there too.  However, I am quite convinced that there are soils on the lowlands that really should be classified as hill farming judging by the soil, its characteristics, its physical structure, its fertility condition&mdash;all these things that enable the scientist or even the practical person to make up his mind as to the value of any particular soil and its capacity for giving life to grasses or crops, whatever they may be.  I think it is going to be very difficult to engage a specialist and assist in the rehabilitation of our hill pastures, at the same time having knowledge of the fact that there are pastures in the lowlands which are producing just as little as these hill pastures are producing and which are as incapable of giving life to any sort of valuable grasses as the hill pastures are&mdash; the proteins or carbohydrates that are valuable for animal consumption&mdash;unless there is a policy of rehabilitation in <Col N="1676" /> regard to them too.  Further, if I were that sort of lowland farmer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator is, no doubt, aware that we are dealing with hill reclamation now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying comes under that heading.  I want to know whether hill farming can be extended in its application to the same type of soils when these are to be found in the lowlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator mean that we are to give free manures to farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>You have here sub-head (f)&mdash;Improvement of Hill Grazing.  We have not heard from the Minister, and I have not pressed him, what methods are to be employed in order to rehabilitate our hill pastures. I do not know, even, that it would be fair to press that point on the Minister. I take it that he is awaiting the advice and study of an expert.  I think that is the right procedure.  I do not think we have many experts in the country, so far, to advise us on what ought to be done.  I know some of the people who have gone to the exhibitions in Wales and other parts of Great Britain and who have seen things there.  We have not that knowledge here.  I do not know exactly what is going to be done in regard to the rehabilitation of hill pastures.  A variety of things will require to be done.  They do not require drainage but rehabilitation.  However, in regard to poverty-stricken land, I would say that there is as much use in spreading artificials on some of it as there is in spreading them on the road, because grass will not grow on the road.  Perhaps grass might grow on some of our roads but it will not grow in sufficient abundance to feed stock. There are many of our hill pastures and soils in the lowlands in respect of which it would be just as fruitful to spread artificials on the road in the expectation of getting a crop from the road as to expect to get a crop from them.  There is nothing there&mdash;nothing whatever to produce it, and the seeds have to be sown.  I think there are a great many soils in the country like that and that it will not be possible <Col N="1677" /> from the point of view of this scheme to leave these soils out of account.  If I had that type of poor, hungry soil, almost derelict, and saw neighbours with a different type, wet soil but much stronger soil, who had come under this scheme and saw other neighbours getting the advantage of expert advice and State assistance for rehabilitation of their soil, I would feel unhappy, discouraged and dissatisfied, feeling that the State was not dealing fairly by me. These are matters which require clarification.</P>
      <P>No one knows much about all these things.  Our soils are as different and as varied as the temperament and approach of our people to their problems. What is suitable in one town-land will not suit in another.  The whole problem must be studied and there must be experimentation.  I presume that the Minister has a general plan in his mind.  The biggest contribution he can make in this rehabilitation project will be to ensure that the reclamation will only be completed when the old sod has been turned up and new grass is sown, so that it will give a new life, a new appearance and a new capacity to feed stock, that did not exist before the Minister put his hand to the work.</P>

      <P>The Minister would like to intervene on one or two points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two things which ought to be clarified at once.  It is not part of the land rehabilitation project to distribute the contents of the Treasury in large lumps to a multitude of individuals who conceive themselves to be deserving of eleemosynary benefactions.  That must be faced.  If the Seanad is of opinion that legislation should be enacted which will authorise the Minister or any other member of the Government so to proceed, I conceive they must wait for another Government, for I know no member of the Government to which I belong would bring such a proposal before the Seanad.  Therefore, any proposal to bestow free, gratis and for nothing, on farmers who have workable farms of arable land, quantities of fertilisers has no relation to the Bill before the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1678" /> Senator Baxter proposes that, in certain categories of cases, the land having been rehabilitated, it would be spoiling the ship for a ha-porth of tar if we did not then plough the land, harrow it and sow it.  I do not think it would be irrelevant to inquire what, in the name of Providence, the man who owns the land would be doing. Sitting on his sash?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we are <i>ad idem.</i> That is what we are hoping to do.  I am hoping to put an agricultural agent in every three parishes in Ireland. One of his first duties will be to recommend to suitable landholders, in the area committed to his care, the necessity for the rotational cultivation of the most valuable crop which the land of Ireland is capable of producing, to wit, grass.  His first job will be to explain to our people what for 15 years they have been bidden to forget, that is, that grass is a crop, not an accident, and that it has to be treated as a crop, sown as a crop and set in a suitable rotation if it is long to remain a profitable crop.  Senators will have observed that it is my hope ultimately to make available to our people, in so far as Perennial, Cocksfoot and Timothy are concerned, unlimited supplies of indigenous varieties propagated under the supervision of the Department itself.  Senators will sympathise with me in the fact that the propagation of seed of a leafy strain of grass takes time.  Therefore, <i>ad interim</i>, we propose to get pedigree strains of grass from abroad to supply the requirements of farmers until adequate supplies are made available from our own propogation centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder why Senators imagine that a man who was reared in East Mayo, where the average field is about one acre and a rood, should suddenly be seized with a passion to sweep through the country like an avenging fury, <Col N="1679" /> levelling every fence and allowing nothing to remain but 40-acre fields. Could anything be more remote from the minds of us who come from the West of Ireland?  Any rational man will agree that there is a surprising acreage of the land of Ireland at present encumbered with sod fences, which have fallen down to a greater or lesser degree and have developed middle-aged spread.  They are frequently attended by copious shoughs and they are receptacles for nettles, thistles, docks, vermin, and <i>si sic omnia.</i>  We propose to destroy the docks, nettles, thistles and the denizens thereof, to eliminate the ditches that have acquired middle-aged spread and to substitute regular fences and suitable pipe drains to take the place of the shoughs.  Of course, as Senator Baxter said, quite apart from the function of dividing one field from another, on every mixed farm there will be fences which have an intrinsic worth as wind breaks for live stock, and due regard must be had to the circumstances of every farm when determining in how far it is proper or wise to remove existing fences or to alter their location.</P>
    <P>The Senator requires no acquittal from me of an excessive tendency to model our ways on British ways, but we can often be very strangely misled if we look across the Channel at our neighbours, hoping to model our habits and customs on theirs.  Theirs is quite a different civilisation: they are a great industrial people, whose national income is derived from industry and whose agriculture is the spoilt child of great industrial wealth, which for convenience and sometimes for amenity, desires to preserve domestic agricultural production without undue anxiety as to the cost because their entire agricultural output is sold on the domestic market and prices and distribution are controlled by their domestic authorities.  Whenever they want people to do anything on the land it is quite legitimate to pay them but let us not forget in Ireland that we all live out of the land.  My wages come out of the land.  Senators' allowances come out of the land.  The carpets we stand on and the amenities which we enjoy are all ultimately paid for out <Col N="1680" /> of the land, and if the land does not earn a profit we will all be going about in furry jackets and pampooties like some of the people we see in Eastern Europe.  I wonder if Senators ever reflected on why you get these characters of Eastern Europe going around in furry jackets and pampooties. It is not because they like to wear them because they would much prefer to wear navy suits like we do, but all they can afford is these skin jackets and pampooties.</P>
    <P>We would soon reduce ourselves to this stage if we ever forgot that every acre of land has got to be made pay its share of the national income.  You cannot make the land of Ireland pay if the man who works it has to be paid to do that which should be done.  I am proceeding on the assumption that if an Irish farmer has good land he will work it well.  If I am to concede that the Irish farmer with good land must be paid to sow the right crops and cultivate the land are we not mad to be investing £40,000,000 in the land of Ireland?  Sanity would demand that we should take out of the land of Ireland everything that we could and not leave it at the disposal of predatory lunatics who intend to sit down until somebody pays them to work their holdings.  I am proceeding, on this matter of recommending this Bill to the Seanad, on the assumption that by and large the farmers of this country are hardworking, intelligent men who are much better fitted to run their holdings than I am and there is no one in Merrion Street capable of telling the farmers of this country how to run each individual farm.  I can see the duty of my Department is to provide within ready access of every farmer who wants it the most modern methods of agricultural science and production and I am entirely satisfied in the limited experience I have had through my period in the Department that, given that access, 95 per cent. of our farmers will jump at it and the reason why they have not done so heretofore is because it has never been put within their reach.</P>
    <P>I do not apologise to the Seanad for pursuing that further because Senator Baxter emphasised the necessity for carrying out surveys and instruction on <Col N="1681" /> the farms.  I think Senators might overlook the fact that we have not had a proper system of agricultural instruction. I know of one county not 1,000,000 miles from Dublin where there is an inspector for the whole county.  That unfortunate man spends most of the 12 months wearing the rib off his bicycle tyre.  He may be able to tell the chief of his Department or the chief agricultural officer that he has visited every part of the county but he never had and never will have time to instruct anybody.  There are a large number of counties which have only two instructors.  I propose to put 14 in Tipperary.  Senator Baxter pressed me to see was it wise to lay out all this money on the land when I did not propose to follow it up with an adequate system of instruction.  Have I reassured the Senator of my intention in that direction or perhaps I could convince him more by saying that in his native county I propose to provide 15 instructors?</P>

      <P>Senators have asked about hill farming. If the Senator wants to know the kind of work I envisaged I will refer him to pamphlets published by Moses Griffith describing his work on hill reclamation projects in Wales.  I am at present seeking the advice of distinguished agriculturists on that particular type of work and I will abide by their advice on the work to be carried out under that particular head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the reclamation of which Senator Orpen asks further particulars, I think if we segregate reclamation from drainage the reclamation must be deemed to mean the removal of superficial obstacles in fields such as rocks, hollows, what we <Col N="1682" /> call small holes, humps and bumps which in the ordinary course of small farming operations hinder activities.  It is not possible to distinguish these with precision because, as the Seanad knows, in parts of Ireland you get what are called &ldquo;gentle places&rdquo;.  The utilitarian would commission a bulldozer but the romantic would consecrate them to the fairies.  Our aim will be to deal with them according as to whether the proprietor is a romantic or a practical man.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to raise again this question of progressive land reclamation.  I notice in the Bill that the term &ldquo;rehabilitation&rdquo; is not mentioned once and I also regret the omission of a phrase like &ldquo;soil fertility&rdquo;. Could we take it that &ldquo;reclamation&rdquo; in paragraph B may include rehabilitation and also not only soil fertility but the preservation of soil fertility?  I do not know what is really behind this land reclamation project but the term &ldquo;rehabilitation&rdquo; should be incorporated in the Bill and a phrase like &ldquo;the preservation of the fertility of the soil&rdquo;.  It is not sufficient to ensure that the soil is fertile.  Soil fertility like liberty requires constant vigilance and I would like such a phrase incorporated in the Bill for subsequent Ministers.  That might be achieved by its insertion in brackets in paragraph 2 or in some other manner that the Minister's ingenuity would devise.</P>

      <P>If the Senator has ever sailed into the harbour of Haifa he would have seen the Horns of Hattin. Substantial as the land reclamation project may be, the Department of Agriculture does not intend to wither away and the daily purpose of the second of the Horns of Hattin is the maintenance of the fertility of the soil of Ireland.  I am getting £1,525 to look after that, and my predecessors, Deputy Smith, Deputy Dr. Ryan and before that the late Paddy Hogan, got the same.  I mean that quite seriously. It is possible when concentrating one's <Col N="1683" /> attention on this specific project to envisage it as being the whole of the functions of the Department of Agriculture but it is not.  Over and above all that this envisages, the regular duty of the Department continues and if Senator Baxter inquires what subsequent measures are to be taken to preserve the benefits conferred by this project the answer is the day-to-day exertions of the Department whose duty it is to conduct research at Thorndale and the other research station, to apply the result of that research through its instructors, inspectors and other people and in the operations of the schools we endow.  That work should not ever flag but it is not preeminently part of this project but part of the regular work of the Department.</P>
      <P>This project envisages a completed task, the reclamation of the land which over the last 100 years has suffered. That done and this project consummated, the Department should maintain the benefits which have been created and see that the lands do not fall back into the desolation from which they have been saved.  I would beg the Seanad not to lose sight of the fact that the Department still lives and has every intention of going on living.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (4), at the end of line 15, to add the following words: &ldquo;provided that if the occupier on receipt of the Minister's certificate of completion of the works notifies the Minister that in his opinion the terms of the agreement have not been carried out and that the work is defective, the Minister shall have a new inspection made and defects, if any, <Col N="1685" /> rectified as early as possible.  On completion of such works the certificate shall be deemed to have been issued.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should first like to thank the Chair for accepting this amendment and apologise to the House for any inconvenience caused by the short notice. The success of this scheme will depend largely on the confidence created in the farmers' minds and that confidence to my mind will be undermined to a great extent should any disputes arise between the Department and the occupier. This is to make provision for some form of arbitration other than recourse to the courts which to my mind would be bad for the scheme and for all concerned.  When we examine the provisions of Section 2 we find that the first step to be taken is to apply to the Department of Agriculture and the necessary forms for application are sent to the person making the inquiry.</P>

      <P>When the form is filled up the inspector arrives and when the land is inspected an estimate is made and presented to the occupier. If the occupier accepts it the Minister proposes to proceed with the work. That may be done in either of two ways.  It may be done by the owner of the land carrying out the work himself with his own family labour or employed labour and in that case a grant of a certain amount is made&mdash;60 per cent. of the total cost of the scheme. Very little difficulty, I expect, would arise in that case, where the work is carried out by the occupier.  It will be inspected by the Department inspector and a certificate of completion issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> In cases where the Minister undertakes to carry out the work, however, and the occupier contracts to pay the sum of £12 per acre to the Department for the carrying out of the work, we have the Department inspector as the person who carries out the inspection, the person who makes the estimate, the person who carries out the final inspection and the person on whose instructions and report the final certificate is issued.  It is possible to foresee cases &mdash;I hope not many but some few cases&mdash; in which the occupier is not satisfied either with the manner in which the work has been carried out or the manner in which it has been completed. According to sub-section (4), immediately on the issue of a certificate of completion by the Minister, the payment falls due.  My proposal is that if the owner of the land feels he has a grievance in regard to the way in which the work has been carried out, he may so notify the Minister who will have a second inspection carried out by an independent inspector, and, if delects are found, that these defects would be made good, and that only from the date of the making good and of the completion of the works as set out in the report of the independent inspector would the certificate of final completion be deemed to issue.</P>
    <P>If we do not make a provision of this nature, the only recourse the occupier who is not satisfied has is an action in the courts.  We had views put forward on Second Reading by no less a person than Senator McGee, who is an experienced landowner and who has already carried out schemes of this nature on his own land and at his own expense, and I am sure that the Minister felt, when he heard the Senator putting forward these views, that there was no very bright future for the proposals in the Bill because Senator McGee pointed to the difficulties of having these works carried out in a proper manner.  The greater part of the works which will be carried out under the Bill are not works which the ordinary farmer can undertake.  They are works involving skill and, that being the case, we can foresee difficulties and disputes arising as between <Col N="1687" /> the Department and the occupier who will be compelled to pay no small sum, £12 per acre, in respect of the land reclaimed. It is natural that he will be most anxious to see that the works are carried out to his satisfaction.</P>
    <P>It may be said that I am seeking to provide for the cranky individual, who, when a work has been completed, is going to find fault with it and thereby raise a dispute which would have the effect of prolonging the contacts between himself and the Department, but he will gain nothing under either of my proposals by so doing.  If this provision is not made, the only redress the occupier has is an action against the Minister in the Circuit Court.  Here we will have counsel and engineers employed by both sides and the Minister will agree that, if even one case of this kind arises in a particular district, it will not be any great inducement to other farmers in the area to undertake works under this scheme.  So much for the proposal in my first amendment, which provides for cases in which there is no serious dispute but in which the landholder feels that the work has not been carried out to his entire satisfaction. In that case, it provides for an independent inspection, and if that independent inspector reports that defects should be made good, that they be made good and that from the date of completion of such work the works be deemed to be completed.</P>
    <P>In my second proposal, I deal with the more serious aspect of the case, where there is a real dispute and where the occupier feels that he has a serious grievance with regard to the manner in which the works have been carried out.  I propose that, in such a case, the Minister shall provide that the dispute be referred to an arbitration board consisting of an officer of the Office of Public Works, an officer of the Irish Land Commission and an officer of the Local Government Department. I suggest an officer of the office of Public Works, because the Office of Public Works is the drainage authority and must be interested in the carrying out of works of this nature and has the necessary knowledge of how such works should be carried out.  Secondly, <Col N="1688" /> the Land Commission are as keenly interested in the project as the occupier himself, because in all cases the Land Commission are the real owners of the lands, and, thirdly, I suggest that the officer of the Department of Local Government should be the county surveyor for the county in which the work is carried out.</P>
    <P>I do not think the importance of accepting both amendments needs to be greatly stressed for the Seanad, because they will help to remove any doubts which may exist as to how disputes, should they arise, may be dealt with.  We know from experience that the farmer particularly has no great wish to seek redress in the courts and, as I say, if one case is brought into court, it is going to act as a deterrent to other farmers and will have a bad effect on the whole working of the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in such complete sympathy with the underlying purpose of the Senator's proposals that I feel free to ask him not to press these amendments.  I do not contemplate, nor would I contemplate, seeking under this Bill any authority to deny the farmer, if the necessity ever really materialised, access to an arbitrator, to wit, the Circuit Court, before which he and the Minister would stand on an absolutely equal footing.  I think that, if things go to the point at which a man feels that a Department of State is threatening him with injustice, there is no tribunal before which that dispute can properly be brought, except the tribunal of the courts, because the little man cannot beat the big man before any tribunal but one whose constitution redresses the disparity in power and influence between the two litigants.  I think that is the very essence of courts of law&mdash;that they are so constituted as to ensure that no matter how powerful, no matter what resources one litigant possesses, the smallest and humblest person in the State, once he throws himself on the protection of the law courts, is assured that that seeming disparity will be redressed by the power of the judge.  We have provided under the Bill that if an individual applicant is dissatisfied, when we <Col N="1689" /> declare the work to be completed, his complaint would go at once from the district officer who is responsible for the scheme to the regional officer&mdash; that would be the man who would be in charge of an area approximating to a county.  That man would be expected to go and review the whole thing and ordinarily use every effort not only to do what was enough to convince the man on whose land he was working that enough had been done but, if that failed and the farmer was still dissatisfied, it would be referred to the provincial director&mdash; there are four, one each in charge of areas approximating roughly to a province. Now if that man fails to restore peace and harmony he will refer the matter to headquarters and the director will send down the technical director.  That makes three appeals already.  Doubtless, before matters reach the stage of litigation, the director himself will come down.  That is the fourth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, before allowing this matter to reach litigation the Minister's own attention will be directed to the matter. The whole reputation of the officers responsible for the scheme is bound up with giving satisfaction.  The political welfare of the Minister is bound up not only with doing good work but with giving satisfaction so that, in this case, you have five appeals to persons, each one of whom is profoundly interested in creating a situation which will persuade the farmer to say: &ldquo;Whereas I was dissatisfied, now I am satisfied.&rdquo; But if, having exhausted all those five appeals, the farmer feels that some dark conspiracy is afoot, I do not think it is suitable, if a man has that deep feeling of persecution and injustice about it, to invite him to sit down to an arbitration between a high officer of my Department and three high officers of another Department who have, after all, come up through the service, side by side with a high officer of my Department&mdash;and men would not be human if they would not be open to suspicion inasmuch as they are not charged with judicial functions of seeing this business from the judicial point of view.  How much better is it to say to a person suffering under a deep sense of grievance: &ldquo;If none of the five <Col N="1690" /> appeals made satisfy you that you are getting justice then go to the courts where the Minister and all his paraphernalia carry not one ounce more weight than you do, and let a judge decide between you as to whether wrong has been done or not.&rdquo;  That is the reason why I would ask the Senator to withdraw these proposals.  I do not believe they would give the odd individual who might carry to the end of all we could do to please him a feeling of grievance.  I think it is wrong to make a proviso which, in effect, denies the right to anybody in the last analysis to hail the Minister before the courts.  He should have that right. The Bill as it stands provides that my reputation and the reputation of all the officers of my Department concerned with this project is involved not only in doing good work but in satisfying the man on whose land the work has been done that it is good work&mdash;and I think the Seanad is safe in depending on those guarantees that hardship will not be wrought.  If it emerged, of course, in practice that improper use of these powers was being made, I do not think we can doubt that Oireachtas Eireann would take suitable measures to bring that under control but I ask the Seanad to extend that degree of trust to the Department&mdash;at least to put them on their trial and not to adopt so unusual an arbitration procedure as is here envisaged unless and until it appears that the rights of individual farmers have been ignored or trespassed upon.</P>

      <P>Where is the method whereby a farmer, according to the Minister, can have his complaint considered and if there is some fault in the work can have that fault rectified? It is not mentioned in the Bill in the manner in which the Minister has outlined <Col N="1691" /> it to us.  I do not see that the Minister has any powers to make regulations which will embody the points he has made in his speech.  As far as I can see, the only Minister who can make regulations in regard to specific things is the Minister for Finance.  I feel that the Minister for Agriculture has no power to make regulations of the type which he has just outlined.</P>

      <P>I am not a lawyer or a good draftsman but I do not see any provision in the Bill giving the Minister for Agriculture power to make regulations under the Bill.  The only person to whom there is any reference in regard to the making of regulations is the Minister for Finance who, under Section 7 (1) is referred to as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Finance may make regulations for the calculation, period of payment, redemption and disposal of annuities under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I raise that point because, while I do not consider that Senator Hawkins's idea is workable, I think that if there is to be any question, or if there is any problem arising out of the way the work is being carried out, the proper time to make the complaint is when the farmer-owner sees the mistake.  If I saw some drainage work being carried out in my place&mdash;either an open drain or a closed drain which would have pipes&mdash;the proper time for me to make the complaint would be before the drain was closed and the work completed.  I should begin to complain at the beginning of the work and have the matter rectified at the outset.  There ought to be some machinery whereby there would be responsibility on the farmer-owner to look after this matter in time and whereby the obligation of the Minister or the Minister's agents to hearken to what the farmer had to complain about would be clearly defined.  That is not in the Bill.  The Minister has announced a grand plan, but I want to hear how it can be done.</P>

He has general powers to direct the officers of his Department. I am telling the Seanad what those directions are to the officers of my Department in respect of this project and I am inviting the Seanad to say that they will give them a trial, with clear notice that unless that attitude is scrupulously maintained they will take the initiative to make the necessary legislation to place upon the Minister and the officers of his Department whatever check may be necessary to prevent their acting capriciously in any individual case.  I appreciate what Senator Hawkins says&mdash;that, having heard what the Department's intention is, they will be given a trial; and if they proceed on the lines indicated that will probably work out all right, but they ought to know that if they do not, notice will be taken and legislative steps will be initiated.

However, we would be profoundly reluctant to leave a job of this kind doing damage to a neighbour's land and if we could persuade the neighbour to permit us to carry out whatever work was necessary to avoid such injury, we would consider it undoubtedly part of our duty to do it.  That is why this Section 6 was not in the Bill when I submitted it to the Dáil, but inasmuch as the Opposition in the Dáil felt that it would be more satisfactory to have a statutory guarantee of that kind I was very happy to concede it, though I am satisfied that it will never have to be availed of.</P>

      <P>Regarding the allocation of the £140 grant mentioned in the Minister's pamphlet, I am not quite clear about it yet, in spite of the Minister's explanation.  Leaving aside the question of fertilising, we arrive at the position that if the farmer undertakes the work himself the Government will present him with a grant of £140, on the assumption that the work is going to cost £210&mdash;that is, the farmer pays £70, which is one-third, and the State pays £140, which is two-thirds.  That takes no cognisance of fertilisers, which the Minister told us five times is outside the scope of the Bill.  It will cost £210 to reclaim the hypothetical nine acres.  The farmer's contribution will be £70 for that nine acres, if he is doing it himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming the Minister does it for him, he will be asked to contribute £108 or £12 an acre.  I want to know the total cost of the scheme in the second place, the amount of the grant and the Government contribution.  Why should the farmer be asked to pay £108 where he is asked to pay only £70 in the first case&mdash;and even not asked to pay £70, as the Minister says that, if the farmer found he could do it for £150, he could put the £140 in his pocket and it would cost him only £10. In the second case, he will have to pay out £108.  I am aware of the Minister's character and I am sure he never made out this plan himself, but someone did it for him.  They made it out on the assumption on which Government Departments make these things out&mdash;that <Col N="1694" /> it will cost them more than it would cost the farmer to do it himself.  They draw a balance and to have the two statements ready for the Seanad to swallow, they introduce the red herring of the fertilisers which the Minister says do not apply to this Bill at all.  I am in the dark as to the total cost to Government in the second place, eliminating lime subsidies and the ramifications which some previous predatory lunatics may have had on the same land.</P>

      <P>This all arises from excessive desire to illuminate a problem. If I had any sense, I would not have given anybody any examples at all.  In an unfortunate moment, I said that we should apprise the Legislature of precisely what would happen if a farmer applied to have his land done under the project and we should put in the hands of every Senator and every member of the Dáil exactly the same indication that the tenant of the holding would receive.  Whereupon, Bedlam has broken forth and mathematicians have locked horns.  This seems to be like a crossword puzzle to some Senators.  I have certain sympathy with them, but I hope they will sympathise with me, in that this results from excessive solicitude to tell them all that is involved in this measure. Would it simplify matters for the Seanad if I try to resolve the matter by saying that, if the farmer does the work himself, he will receive a grant of two-thirds of the cost of the operation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the farmer asks us to do the work, there will be levied upon his land a sum equal to two-fifths of the cost of the work, plus the cost of the fertilisers spread upon his land, subject to an overriding maximum of £12 per acre.  In case the Senator should think it, we do not contemplate giving uncertain or unpredicated assurances through setting out every conceivable contingency of expenditure on <Col N="1695" /> every conceivable acre of land for the charge which falls to be met if the farmer does the work or if we do it, with fertilisers and without fertilisers, with half fertilisers and with all the fertilisers.</P>
      <P>If we start analysing the way in which each case will fall to be dealt with we could go on for ever because there is not any rule of thumb.  Each case is the subject of individual agreement between the applicant and the Department.  The basis on which we make our proposal for the farmer's expenditure is that we estimate to the best of our ability what the job is going to cost and we offer him two-thirds as a grant to do it himself.  If he tells us to do it we estimate what it is going to cost us including that quantity of fertilisers which the land reclaimed by us may require to rehabilitate it, as we think necessary, and without committing him to anything, we tell him that if we do it, and we will not do less, we will charge his land with so much per acre.</P>
      <P>In either event he is quite free, having reviewed the works and studied the map supplied, to say, &ldquo;I do not think you are giving me good value, good-bye,&rdquo; and we must go disconsolate. So that there is no danger of anyone being taken for a ride and it is not possible for me to provide the Senator or anybody else with mathematical precision as a general rule because each case stands upon its own merits and no farmer can be charged with one farthing and nobody can do a hand's turn except at his option and request, after he has received the maps and has had time to consider them as long as he wishes to brood over them. I think that is adequate reassurance.</P>

      <P>I do not quite follow what the Senator means but if he refers <Col N="1696" /> to the figures in the documents circulated I have not the faintest notion. I am the Minister for Agriculture and not a drainage engineer.  These conclusions were made by highly skilled officers of my Department.  When I want an estimate for drainage I go to a drainage engineer and when I want an estimate for any other work I go to a highly qualified specialist in that particular type of work and invite his estimate and by his judgment I am guided.  I am not an engineer or a contractor and it would be ludicrous to hold myself out as such.  If the Senator cares to call to my Department personally the officers of my Department will be flattered to give him all the help at their disposal or if the Senator would write a specific inquiry to them the officers of my Department would be pleased to answer to the best of their ability.  I guarantee that I can and will get the best men in Ireland to make drains, estimate the cost and draw up a bill and they are at the disposal of all Senators who wish to consult them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister for some information on sub-section (4) (a):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Unless the occupier, in accepting the Minister's proposal, informs the Minister that he wishes to pay his contribution by means of an annuity, the contribution shall become due and payable to the Minister by the occupier for the time being on the date upon which the Minister certifies that the works have been completed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is, where the works are carried out by the Minister, on the issue of the certificate the payment is due.  If the contribution is not paid within three months after it becomes due the Minister shall notify the Land Commission of the default.  I take it that what is meant in this sub-section is that if an occupier does not pay the contribution within three months of the receipt of the certificate the Minister shall notify the Land Commission, who will proceed to transfer the account to an annuity basis chargeable on the land.  Will the occupier be so informed? Will he be given due notice that the transaction is about to take <Col N="1697" /> place or will he wake up some morning and find that because his cheque did not reach the Department of Agriculture on the 1st April he is debited by the Land Commission and will have annuities for the next 60 years bearing the cost of the scheme?  I hold that three months are too short a period.</P>
    <P>This scheme is expensive and the contribution may be a considerable amount.  That three months might be a period within which a man might have stock on hands or might not have credit but he would probably be able to pay in four months or six months. I would like to know from the Minister if a man has made a part contribution inside three months what will happen.  I think it would be wise if as few occupiers as possible who avail of the scheme were put on an annuity basis because we do not know what the future holds and instead of a benefit we might be putting a hardship on people who had to compete with those who did not avail of the scheme and had cheaper annuities.  Is the occupier to be notified before being transferred from a contributory to an annuity basis and will time be given, provided an instalment has been paid at the end of three months?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the problem falls in the Senator's mind into these two difficulties; one, can we reassure him that the defaulter will be given adequate notice that he is now deemed to be a defaulter and leaves himself open to Section 3; and, two, is there a danger, inasmuch as a term of three months had been described, that the Department will capriciously put a farmer to the inconveniences of charging his land whereas if they waited a couple of weeks they would get their money?  I can only ask the Senator whether he thinks it likely?  I quite agree with him that if either thing was done it would be utterly scandalous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That default procedure is procedure to which we would have recourse no more readily than to putting a mortgage charge on the land.  I sat long enough in Opposition to feel the natural solicitude for putting checks and stays on a Minister.  It is a good thing to do.  I want to say that while the aura of virtue is about me before I have become <Col N="1698" /> too Ministerially-minded.  I agree that it is necessary to watch these things because people do get inconsiderate, sometimes with the best intentions. I do not think there is any real danger here.  There could be if people acted viciously and irresponsibly, but the check of the Parliamentary Question is a pretty sound guarantee if any Minister did so act.  He would be opposed with such ferocious criticism that he would never dare to so act again.  I hope that the aura of virtue will be as much about me if ever a Parliamentary Question reveals me to have been guilty of conduct such as the Senator envisages, in which case I will walk into the Lobby with his colleagues to censure myself.</P>

      <P>What it is intended to mean&mdash;and I am creditably informed that it does mean that&mdash;certainly is that the putative owner for the time being is the person liable, but where you are dealing with Land Commission land I think the Senator will remember that sometimes in Ireland a man will be in occupation of his grandfather's farm but has never taken out administration either to his grandfather or his father.  While his name is John Delaney, the holding of land is in the name of Henry Delaney and it has meanwhile been in the possession of Pat Delaney.

      <P>Surely we are working on the assurance that thousands of cases would not arise.  The Bill leaves outstanding for a reasonable time contingent liability, which is a source of great difficulty for Departments of State.  If it was the intention under <Col N="1700" /> the Bill to act ruthlessly, or with no care whether the work gave satisfaction locally, either to the applicant or his neighbours, I think this kind of provision would be defensible, where you had to hedge the individual round with that kind of protection.  Is it not fair to say that, if a man's land shows no deterioration 12 months after the completion of work on a neighbour's land, it is rather hard to demand that a period of two years should elapse when we should be faced, perhaps, with the task of dealing with tens of thousands of cases?  If the Seanad thinks from observation or experience, or if the Dáil finds from experience, that any substantial number of persons are coming along, 18 months or two years after completion of work, and that there were complaints that were not perceived, we would then have to consider the position.</P>
      <P>I do not anticipate that happening and to provide against that contingency I can assure Senators that this would represent a very material and added burden of work at the administrative end, from which I ask the Seanad to deliver us unless the necessity exists.

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey) Daniel Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm a number of Orders which were made by the Government under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act imposing certain duties and varying certain existing duties.  I am afraid I cannot suggest to Senators that the Bill explains itself, because it is all contained in the Schedule, where the Orders are set out, and it does not give very much information as to their purpose and meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to give certain detailed particulars regarding each of the six duties set out there.  The first deals with corrugated paper and board and certain printing and writing papers.  I should explain that the Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 237) Order, <Col N="1703" /> 1949, was made by the Government on the 4th January, 1949, and imposed a duty of 45 per cent. full and 28? per cent. preferential on corrugated paper and corrugated board and modified the scope of the duties on certain writing and printing papers.  The duties on the writing and printing papers which had been suspended from 1st July, 1943, were reimposed by an Order made by the Government on the same date.</P>
    <P>The manufacture of corrugated paper and board commenced in June, 1947, and in December, 1948, additional machinery was installed specially to produce corrugated paper for the chocolate trade.  I am glad to say that as a result of the imposition of the duty the rate of production has doubled and the firm in question is now able to meet the country's full requirements of corrugated paper and corrugated board.  Employment in the industry has also increased and as a result of the increased production an appreciable reduction has been made in the prices.</P>
    <P>There are four mills engaged in the manufacture of paper, but only one of these made writing and printing papers pre-war.  A second mill commenced this manufacture recently.  The production capacity of these mills had increased to a point which would more than satisfy the entire home demand for the types of paper produced by the Irish mills, but owing to the suspension of the duties the mills were not in a position to work to anything like their capacity.</P>
    <P>Representations were made to me by the Paper Mills and the Printers' Association to have the duties restored. There was also the point that certain types of paper costing 3d. or less per lb. and another type costing 3¼d. or less per lb. were specifically excluded from the pre-war duties.  The interests concerned submitted a joint recommendation that these exemption limits be raised to 8d. and 8¾d., respectively, to keep in line with the increased prices of paper generally.  I accepted this recommendation and the amendments were effected by the Order now before the Seanad.</P>
    <P>It is well known that the paper mills <Col N="1704" /> were in a very difficult position prior to the granting of this degree of protection. As a result of the duties one mill which had laid off about one-third of its employees resumed full production immediately and there has been a general increase in employment in the industry.</P>
    <P>The next reference relates to woven artificial silk fabrics.  The purpose of this duty on certain woven artificial silk fabrics was principally to protect Irish manufacturers of artificial silk linings.  These manufacturers obtained their requirements of artificial silk yarns mainly from Britain and are being charged an export premium of about 33? per cent. above the British domestic price.  Efforts were made by the interests here to reach agreement with the British Federation to eliminate this price differential but without avail.</P>
    <P>This, I might say, is a rather difficult duty to administer and the definition which had to be adopted for administration purposes covers some plain fabrics other than linings.  Provision was, therefore, made for the admission, free of duty, of fabrics not made here and for any requirements of the home market in excess of the capacity of the Irish manufacturers. A small committee of the trade was established to advise on the types of fabrics for which duty-free licences should be recommended.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that, in this case also, home production has shown a marked improvement since the imposition of these duties and the employment position has also improved very considerably.</P>
    <P>The third reference relates to aluminium hollow-ware.  This duty was imposed in 1937 to protect an Irish manufacturer of aluminium hollow-ware for domestic or household use.  There are now two other firms engaged in this line.</P>
    <P>The original duty did not apply to partly finished hollow-ware or to component parts.  It was found, however, that advantage was being taken of this exemption and that aluminium utensils were being imported without handles, the only further process of manufacture <Col N="1705" /> required here being the riveting on of the handles.  This practice caused the existing Irish manufacturer the loss of 40 per cent. of his market. There was an obvious case for amendment of the duty, and the required amendment of the tariff definition was made in the Order now before the House.</P>
    <P>The next reference relates to men's and boys' woven outerclothing.  This duty applies to men's and boys' overcoats, coats, suits, jackets, waistcoats and trousers.</P>
    <P>Pre-war an <i>ad valorem</i> duty of 60 per cent. applied to these articles and there were, in addition, certain minimum rates of duty.  From 1942 the reduced rates of duty&mdash;37½ per cent. full and 25 per cent. preferential&mdash;operated, but this was entirely suspended throughout 1947.  In January, 1948, this suspension was revoked and, accordingly, the reduced rate of duty operated until the Government imposed the new duties at the rate of 75 per cent. full and 50 per cent. preferential as from 11th May, 1949.  The minimum duties were restored on the same date.  The effective rate in this case is the preferential rate of 50 per cent. as the bulk of imports are from Britain.</P>
    <P>Before the war, under the existing rate of protection, Irish clothing factories supplied practically the entire home market.  In 1938 there were 64 factories making men's and boys' ready-made clothing and employing almost 4,600 persons.  Prior to the increase in the duties it was represented to me that there was considerable unemployment and short-time working in the industry.  Imports, excluding the parcel post, had increased from £32,568 in 1938 to no less than £251,581 in 1948.</P>
    <P>Prices of Irish-made clothing are, as far as the medium and dearer end of the trade is concerned, no higher than those of imported articles and in many cases below the latter.  With regard to the cheaper end of the trade, evidence was produced showing that boys' suits were being sold here from Britain at prices not only below those at which they could be made here but below production costs, without profit, of similar articles made in Belfast.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1706" /> As the increased duties have been in operation for only a short time, it is too early to assess their effect.  We expect, however, that the clothing industry here should recover the position it held before the war.  The large number of factories engaged in this production should preserve sufficient internal competition to safeguard prices and qualities.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 5 relates to iron and steel chains and manufacturers thereof. This Order was made to enable an Irish manufacturer of electrically-welded steel chains to secure a reasonable share of the home market.  The protection here is limited to the types and sizes of chains manufactured by the Irish firm which has a capacity adequate to the needs of the home market.</P>
    <P>The prices of the Irish and British products are approximately equal though raw material costs to the Irish manufacturer were much higher, at any rate until very recently.  The Irish firm's failure to secure a reasonable share of the home market was considered to be due not to any question of price and quality but to the longer established connections of Irish purchasers with English manufacturers and distributors.  It is estimated that 60 per cent. of the chains of the sizes to which protection applies are used by farmers.  The remainder would be distributed over hauling, timber, engineering, etc.  There will be no increase in costs to these industries by reason of the use of Irish-made chains.</P>
    <P>With regard to Reference No. 6&mdash; linen piece goods&mdash;this duty which was imposed from 28th June, 1949, is at the rate of 40 per cent. full, 20 per cent. preferential on piece goods containing more than 60 per cent. by weight of linen.  There is a provision under which the Revenue Commissioners will admit, free of duty, certain types of fabric such as printed linens, curtaining, upholstery and bookbinding cloths, etc. A duty at the same rate previously applied but was suspended in March 1943.  The former duty applied to clothes which were wholly linen.  Fabrics made partly of linen and partly of some other fibre were liable to duty <Col N="1707" /> as &ldquo;union piece goods&rdquo;.  As this latter duty is suspended it was necessary to make the new duty apply to piece goods with more than 60 per cent. linen content.  The preferential rate of 20 per cent. is that agreed for linen piece goods under the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement of 1938.</P>
    <P>Before the war Irish mills produced about 2,400,000 square yards of linen or linen-type fabrics, of which about half were exported.  Last year about 750,000 square yards were exported. The possibility of expanding linen sales abroad depends on production at the lowest possible price and, accordingly, it is necessary for the mills to get maximum production so that costs can be kept at a minimum.  The reservation of the home market for linen fabrics will give the mills scope for the extra production which will enable them to market their goods abroad competitively.  This is doubly necessary now, as they cannot get licences for the sale of their goods in Britain, where, before the war, they sold substantial quantities.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should indicate to the House that in accordance with Government policy the more important of the protective measures I have outlined will be subject to constant review to ensure that the purpose for which they were imposed will be achieved and that the consumers' interests will be adequately safeguarded. It was only after the fullest possible examination that these duties were imposed, and from the necessarily brief outline I have given I feel that the House will agree that the protective measures were necessary in the interests of Irish industry and employment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the statement by the Minister for two reasons. He has given us a detailed explanation of the circumstances that led up to the reimposition of the duties and their effect.  We have had in this country and in this House from time to time various people crying out against the imposition of such duties.  I think the statement made by the Minister justifies the action taken from the point of view which he was able to put before <Col N="1708" /> us in more than one instance of where it led to increase in employment and at the same time reduction in the cost to the consumer of the article produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. J.T. O'Farrell Mr. J.T. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In Bills of this kind the most unpopular speaker of all is the person who voices the claims of the consumer, although no matter what we produce we are all consumers.  The Minister, as Senator Hawkins has said, has gone to the trouble of explaining to us the type of duties in question, how they are applied and the reasons for them.  One aspect of the new duties is rather discouraging&mdash;for instance, the duties on wearing apparel. Pre-war, when our factories quite obviously were not nearly so well-developed nor, I presume, so well-equipped as they are at the present time, the highest tariff imposed was 60 per cent., with 40 per cent. preferential. Now, in 1949, the Minister finds it necessary to raise these tariffs to 75 per cent. and 50 per cent., respectively. That surely means that in relation to competition from outside we are in a weaker position industrially to-day than we were 11 or 12 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that the Minister has stated the case put up to him by the manufacturers that goods were being dumped here.  As the Minister for Finance on the Finance Bill admitted, all competition is referred to as &ldquo;dumping&rdquo;. It is extraordinary the number of people from outside who can dump goods here and sell them allegedly at less than the costs of production whilst we never seem to be able to do that in the reverse direction no matter what we turn out.  The Minister says that the highest-priced wearing apparel is as cheap or cheaper here than elsewhere. That may be so.  However, that is not the sort of wearing apparel we are really concerned with.  We are concerned with boys' cheaper suits and the cheaper suits that the average workers and the small farmer and people of that type buy.  Has it been made clear to the Department that the cheaper suits the average worker and small farmer buy are being sold as cheaply as they could be got elsewhere where wages are at least a high as they are here?  I am all for giving the <Col N="1709" /> whole Irish market to our manufacturers to the extent that they can supply it at a price that the people can pay, and quality for quality, and give the same return as workers drawing the same wages elsewhere get for their money; but to the extent that they get the market and are not able to fulfil those requirements, they are imposing an intolerable burden on the community.</P>
    <P>I hope the Department will see that this very ready imposition of increased tariffs and embargoes, nearly always at the first time of asking, will not be availed of for the purpose of avoiding proper equipment and greater efficiency than obtains at present in some factories.  New industries require protection and we must be prepared to pay somewhat higher for the Irish-produced article, because of the employment it gives and because of the industry and technique it develops.  But that surely must not go on indefinitely, as if it did we should have a very low standard of life, or wages and prices so high as to be equivalent to a low standard of life. We cannot hope for reductions in costs if we are paying higher than the world price for every commodity we manufacture ourselves.  I daresay that new developments which have taken place, and the appointment of the new Industrial Development Authority may result in a check on this tendency to substitute protective tariffs for greater efficiency.  We are blistered in many directions by high prices.  It is time we worked towards getting down the prices of materials to something in the region of the level that obtains in countries where wages are at least as high and, in many cases, higher than they are here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make it absolutely clear that I welcome this protection for our Irish industries under this Bill and I support full encouragement being given to Irish enterprise.  However, I would like to add the very important condition that it should be done without unnecessary hardship on the consumer or other people in the community.  Protection is given after examination, and the factors that are considered, I presume, are the employment situation, the <Col N="1710" /> ability to fulfil the requirements of the market, the quality of the goods, the supply of a reasonable variety of goods to the consumer, and, of course, the price.  Before any protection is given a case has to be put up by the person who wishes to be protected.  I am not satisfied that heretofore all the factors of the situation were properly considered. I know from experience that even in regard to some of the cases being considered to-day the case was made that Irish manufacturers could supply certain needs when it was only too apparent that they could not supply the market to the degree of the control given over imports.  In regard to the new Industrial Authority, I feel that the consumer should be much more considered than he has been in the past.  The difficulty is to get someone to defend him, and I am going to propose perhaps a rather inadequate advocate, about which some people may be rather sceptical.  I propose the distributor.  Some people may think he would not have the highest motives, but I say he is the only person who knows what the consumer wants and he has got the skilled interest in the consumer's needs and the technical knowledge.  You cannot take consumers off the streets and get them to make a case.  The person to make the case is the distributor.  When a man is looking for protection for his industry, the person to answer the case &mdash;the devil's advocate, as it were&mdash; should be the distributor.  If the manufacturer has a good case he has only to produce his facts and figures and the Minister or the authority can sit in judicial capacity and decide how far his case is made and how far the distributor is making the case for the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, there is the interest of the distributor himself and the interests of other types of manufacturers.  When tariffs and protective measures are put into force to protect one specific thing, a variety of other interests are immediately affected&mdash;not only distributors but makers-up of all kinds and, ultimately, of course, the consumer. I feel that the employment content of a particular industry being protected is not the only employment that has to be taken into consideration. <Col N="1711" /> There is the employment in subsidiary industries and in distributive trades to be considered.  That is not a small thing.  In the distributive trades there is a very good type of worker required.  Unfortunately, manufacturing industries all over the world are inclined to be mechanised&mdash;the operation and work is carried out by mechanical means and, therefore, does not require such a good type of worker.  On the other hand, in the distributive trade&mdash;especially when there is a buyer's market&mdash;a very high type is required for salesmanship and they have to be well paid.  It has been found out, even in Socialist England, that it was all right as long as there was a seller's market, when all you had to do was produce in factories and ignore the distributors, but now, when it is a buyer's market, it has been found by the manufacturers that one of the most important factors is the distributor, who is placing the goods on the market.  Therefore, I suggest that consideration be given to employment in the distributive trade and also to the necessity for keeping up sales. That is where I want to stress the hardship you impose unnecessarily on other trades, just to protect one industry that cannot do anything like supply the market for which it is supposed to be manufacturing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusOFarrell" hpid="Mr. S. O'Farrell Mr. S. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also am in favour of the imposition of duties for the protection of Irish manufacturers and I am glad that the Minister gave us the assurance that the protection here will not be used as a means of getting unduly rich with undue haste: but that the interest of the community will be safeguarded.  We had got a definite assurance in the case of steel chains, which very few of us want, and which the manufacturers undertook to produce at competitive prices, but I am not so sure that all other protected industries have kept their promises and produced goods at the prices at which they should be marketed.  I think Senator McGuire has made a very good case and that there are other interests to be considered when imposing duties of this kind.  Senator McGuire has made a clear and definite <Col N="1712" /> case for the distributors.  I can imagine that the distributor's job might be made far more difficult under a high protection system than it would be under a competitive system, because if you allow a few manufacturers a monopoly of the home market they know that whatever they produce they will be selling without competition, and the problem of persuading the public to take the goods, which is bound up with questions of price, quality, style and pattern, is thus passed on to the retailer and it may take the retailer a long time to make a sale and he may never have a satisfied customer.</P>
      <P>That is another argument in favour of some sort of reorganisation of our society here which would give every section of the community a voice in matters of this sort.  Naturally we are all interested in employment and want to see as much as we can manage given in this country, and we want to see it as well paid as possible.  We want to see a good quality work and if possible to have the material going into the clothing, particularly in the case of boys' and men's wear, turned out here.  If we buy from abroad we hire foreign labour not merely in the manufacture of the particular garments such as a suit of clothes but also in the woven cloth.  We should ensure that the cloths as far as possible for men's and boys' clothing are made from Irish tweeds.  There has been some difficulty at the moment and for some time past in disposing of tweeds, and a lot of the readymade clothing firms in this country&mdash;I am not saying all of them&mdash;show a preference for the use of British shoddy material in making up these clothes and then selling these for Irish-made garments.  If we put an import duty on this cloth high enough it would prevent them from doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope some Minister will take his courage into his hands and see how he can get Irish women to wear Irish cloth.  I know that the bulk of women do not like heavy material for two reasons.  The first one is that they want a fine material and they like variety, and the second one is that the local papers are always setting before them what the film stars are wearing, and <Col N="1713" /> women will always copy women.  I think something should be done to ensure that if the mills in this country are going to get protection that they should devote some attention to producing finer materials and varied designs.  There is at present too much tendency when looms are set up to go ahead with the same old tweeds and threads from beginning to end.  There should be some attempt made to design cloths in this country and more attention should be paid to texture, pattern as well as quality of the cloth and dyeing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always easy to generalise in regard to tariffs and I think, personally, it is always a mistake. The last speaker appears to be unaware of the fact that only a short time ago the Government changed the basis of restrictive quotas in regard to woollen texture goods, reducing them from 7 to 4½ ozs.  I am not interested in that particular matter except as a distributor but I assume the object of that was to enable or encourage Irish manufacturers to make a lighter type of cloth.</P>
      <P>There is something in what Senator S. O'Farrell said in regard to the matter of design, but I think we will have to face up to the fact that a country of 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 cannot get the same variety of designs from the manufacturers making for a home market as you can get from a country of 48,000,000 or 50,000,000.  You can get a wide variety of designs if you are catering for a wide market, and if you have substantial production.</P>
      <P>I am not interested, again except as a distributor, in the question of men's and boys' clothing, but I think I can say definitely that, in that particular case, I believe that the material supplied in that trade at home compares in the vast majority of cases with anything that could be imported.  In businesses which I know, they have not imported material of that type for many years and have no intention of doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a mistake to assume that the only reason why goods are imported by distributors is that the prices are lower.  That is not necessarily the case.  A distributor must always look to providing variety and if he can buy <Col N="1714" /> from all over the world he can get better variety.  Therefore, as long as you have a free market the distributor, when he can get something different, will always import it even in cases where the home prices are not any higher.</P>
    <P>With regard to the price of a number of cotton and linen and some rayon textiles in which I am interested, speaking as a person with some personal knowledge, I spend a good deal of my time comparing the home prices and prices of goods offered from abroad.  As a distributor, goods are offered to me from the other side and I go to a good deal of trouble comparing the prices.  At the present time there is very little if any difference in the case of the majority of cotton piece goods that are being supplied here.  In the case of certain types of rayon and linen goods, namely those made from continuous filament, there are higher prices here.  That is mainly due to the fact that the Irish manufacturer has to import continuous filament yarn from Great Britain.  There is a special system there which I think will not last indefinitely but which is still in force.  An arrangement is made by the Government by which the home manufacturers obtain supplies at approximately two-thirds of the price at which they are able to export it.  I do not believe that it will continue indefinitely.  It is, I think, an abnormal situation.</P>
    <P>While I am mentioning that, I think it rather important to mention one thing which did not strictly arise and was not mentioned by the Minister. There is an impression that all rayon cloths are subject to duty but that is not the case.  A large proportion of rayon cloth is made from spun rayon and is not subject to duty or any restriction. There is considerably increased development both in the spinning of spun yarn and the weaving of cloths and I have no doubt that will have to be considered.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy with what Senator J.T. O'Farrell said and with much of what Senator McGuire said, but I think I should say that, although I am a distributor, I am not satisfied that it would be desirable to bring in the distributor to a consultation about a prospective <Col N="1715" /> tariff before action is taken.  I think it places those consulted in an almost impossible position.  Those consulted would hear officially of the proposals intended&mdash;I do not think the position would be abused by anyone&mdash; but the news would get out and their competitors would buy outside.  We had that in the past.  For that reason I would rather not know because I would feel debarred from using such information and that would create a difficult situation.  I do think that the Government, that is I presume the new authority, should keep in close consultation with the distributors from the time the duty is enforced and have periodic reports from individual distributors because they can give more effective information as to prices and the probable effect of the tariff on the consumer than probably anybody else could.  For that reason I agree with Senator McGuire that use should be made of the distributor to assist the Government, but I do not think it would be practical politics in the case of a preliminary investigation, certainly in the case of a proposed new duty.  That is mere detail but my main reason for speaking is that I am sure that certain industries here have reasons, sometimes justified and sometimes not, why the Irish prices are higher.</P>
    <P>With regard to industries of which I have knowledge as a distributor, I would say that at the present time there is less differentiation between the Irish price and the price in England than there has ever been in my lifetime.  In many cases the difference is very small.  In the case of cotton goods, which are in very wide use, the other day I was offered a quite substantial quantity by a well-known English firm.  I examined them carefully&mdash;and I think I can claim some knowledge&mdash;and the Irish article was 6d. or 8d. cheaper and definitely better value.  It may be an isolated case, but it is a case which deals with goods in general use.  I would like to make it clear that I agree with Senator J.T. O'Farrell that prices must be watched and that here in Ireland a very good reason or explanation should be given.  Sometimes <Col N="1716" /> the reason is good and can be given, sometimes not, but I do not think that the impression should go abroad now that goods of Irish manufacture are in anything like all cases dearer than the English.  We must remember the changes that there have been in Britain and standards are more on a par here now than they were immediately before the war.</P>
    <P>One factor which must be borne in mind by the Industrial Authority and the Government is that in any small country with a small number of manufacturers, but particularly where there is only one or two, you have to keep your eyes very wide open for the possible effect of abnormal conditions in a neighbouring country.  I was told, probably inaccurately&mdash;this does not refer to articles in which I am interested &mdash;that as a result of the dock strike in England the price of a certain type of fruit offered here was lower because if it had been left until the strike had ended it would have fetched nothing.  That is one type of abnormal conditions.  Another is that if a British manufacturer with whom we compete were to find a sudden drop in his export market&mdash;he must follow Government regulations with regard to exports&mdash;it would pay him, if not immediately, in the long run, to divert a quantity of goods here at prices not fairly competitive.  I do not believe in general in the talk of dumping.  To think of it in every case is ridiculous, but it is equally absurd not to recognise that there could be at certain times abnormal imports.  It all requires watching and is of considerable difficulty. I am very hopeful that the action of the Government in creating a body of men whose whole-time job is to watch the situation and who will not be concerned with other Department activities will result, as they get experience, in most matters being dealt with more quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say just one or two words.  There has been a great deal of discussion and a fair amount of criticism on the policy of tariffs over the years.  I made some contribution to it myself.  We are all wiser and have more knowledge and <Col N="1717" /> practical experience of the result of a tariff policy, an extravagant policy and a cautious policy, and now we are to have the Minister's approach which is new.  We have reached a situation when there is no very animated controversy as to the wisdom and necessity of building up Irish industries.  We want to see successful Irish industries. How is that going to be achieved?  Not, we hope, at the expense of consumers. If Irish industry is to succeed that is going to be done by management and workers being adequately and efficiently equipped.  Sometimes we have criticism of managements and at other times of workers.  It may be said that managements expect too much out of an industry in too short a space of time.  It is argued, on the other hand, that the output of workers is not so good as it might be.  It is sometimes said also that our industries are not adequately capitalised, and that machinery is not sufficiently up to date to give best results.  The whole situation should be faced fairly and squarely. We cannot get maximum output from industry any more than we can get it out of the land at lowest cost, unless there is proper equipment.  That should be the aim of the new body which the Minister had the wisdom to bring together and from which it is hoped there will be major results.</P>
      <P>Another aspect is this, that there was no reason why Irish men and women should not be able to provide goods required by our people.  I think that on the whole we are not less competent or less intelligent than other people.  Perhaps we are disposed to take things rather easily.  I must say now that I commend speeches that the Minister has made on that aspect of our industrial policy.  It is refreshing to have a Minister who has the courage to come out&mdash;coming as he does from the Labour side of our society&mdash;telling people that the way to succeed in building up successful Irish industries is by everybody working harder.  That should be the persistent call of all who want to see Irish industries successful.  None should hear that call louder than those engaged in industries and those managing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Managements cannot expect to get output from workers unless the latter <Col N="1718" /> are convinced that the managements are playing their part.  There is necessity for a spirit of all round cooperation. There is, no doubt, a necessity for an attitude of pride in Irish industry, as well as a desire to make it a success, as well as a conviction on the part of the people that Irish workers and Irish managements are as good as those to be found anywhere; that they are capable of giving a decent output, at a reasonable price, and meeting competitors and, in many respects, beating them.  Physically our people are as good as their neighbours.</P>
    <P>The one thing lacking to make Irish industries even more successful than those operated by our competitors is the spirit to make them successful.  If we put our backs to that work rather than have frequent complaints about unsatisfactory products, we will be able to take pride in the development of Irish industries.  We will then have the welcome situation brought about where managements and workers combine to give our consumers the best possible products at prices at which none can cavil.  This Bill gives a chance to do that and we should make such an approach to the problem.  The fact that the Minister is asking for high tariffs, for which he is to get authority under this Bill, is something to make us ponder.  We hope that that is not a situation which will have to be continued indefinitely.  If there is a change those engaged in Irish industry must face up to their job with a resolution that some of us feel has been lacking previously.</P>

      <P>While tariffs on items such as paper may appear small in their own way, they really affect everybody.  Small overhead charges on business are often overlooked by the Departments of State when there are no organised bodies to raise such questions.  I wish the Department to keep that aspect in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak but, after Senator Baxter's speech, in which he took advantage on a simple Bill like this to lecture Irish industry I had to intervene.  I am diffident in intervening in agricultural matters but I take this opportunity to say that no matter how efficient Irish <Col N="1719" /> industry is&mdash;and thank God most of our industries are efficient&mdash;it must be remembered that we are dealing with a domestic market for 3,000,000, not 50,000,000 as in Great Britain or hundreds of millions in America and the Continent.  Every Senator knows that in order to make us in some degree independent of outside sources of supply many industries had been created, and are being deliberately maintained, that would not be called economic industries.  They are here because they are more important than the mere economic return. They are here because they serve the community with a vital need, with something that the community needed in a national emergency.  I make no apology for Irish industry in that respect.</P>
      <P>I think it is time carping criticism should cease.  We want to establish the fact that we have in a varying degree industries which are necessary for the common good.  Irish industries proved that they catered for the common good and for our people when they were anxious to get goods irrespective of price.  If Irish manufacturers could not answer at that period, then Senator Baxter would have been left without a shirt to his back or a shoe to his foot.  I think we should give up discussions of this kind on simple Bills.  People should have a little more appreciation of the important role that Irish manufacturers played, and continue to play in our national economy, despite what is said about lack of efficiency.  Managements and workers are playing a very good part in the development of Irish industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Seanad for the manner in which it discussed this Bill, and for the approach and the helpful way in which Senators directed their remarks to it.  Two fears were expressed: one, as to whether we were paying sufficient attention to the interests of consumers and two, whether we were giving a greater degree <Col N="1720" /> of protection than was absolutely necessary.  Senator J.T. O'Farrell said that one of the things that he did not like about tariffs was that they were so rigidly imposed almost at first asking. I can assure him that in respect of every one of the six items in the Schedule, I have been accused of delay, of procrastination, and of raising all sorts of queer points, by asking questions that were alleged to have nothing to do with these proposals.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Seanad that every one of the six items set out in the Schedule was very carefully and very fully considered and that they were imposed only when the Government were absolutely satisfied that it was not merely desirable but necessary in the public interest that they should be imposed.</P>
      <P>I mentioned in respect of one or two of the industries which got this protection that not only had there been a stepping up in employment and production but there had been a reduction in prices.  I think I should go further and say that in no case covered by this Bill where protection was given have I got any evidence, or even a suggestion, that there was any attempt to increase prices.  I should like to say also that one of my main concerns is the protection of the consumer and every effort of mine and of the Department has been used to keep the cost of living at the lowest possible point and to secure reductions in costs, wherever they could be secured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want on this Bill to enter into any discussion of the general merits or demerits of protection or of Irish industry&mdash;its competence and the quality and price of the articles produced. We will have another opportunity of doing that later on when we get the Industrial Development Authority Bill before the Seanad.  I think, however, that some of us are inclined to talk as if this country were the only country in which tariffs, quotas and other forms of protection have been, are being and will be imposed.  In practically every country in the world, there are restrictions put up by the respective Governments to protect <Col N="1721" /> their own citizens, to protect the development of their country and the manufactures which have been started there.  We find it very difficult in most cases, and in some cases entirely impossible, to get one ounce of what we produce here inside the door of that particular extern market.  I should like to assure Senators that, so far as I am concerned, only that measure of protection which is necessary to enable a particular industry to get a fair chance of getting on its feet and a fair chance of competing will be afforded.</P>
    <P>It is only fair that I should say that Irish industry is at the moment, and has been for some considerable time, subjected to a form of unfair competition, particularly form Great Britain. We have evidence that certain British commodities are being put into this market at a wholly uneconomic price. I can quote as an example a case which was brought to my notice some couple of months ago where a particular article was imported here, the duty on it being 1/-.  It was offered for sale retail in the shops in Dublin at 10½d., although the actual duty charged and paid on it was 1/-.  I should also say, in fairness to some of our manufacturers, that in many cases&mdash;one was mentioned in the course of this debate, but there is quite a range of others&mdash; they are compelled to pay anything from 25 per cent. to 40 per cent. more for their raw material than their British competitor has to pay.  These are all factors which we have to take into consideration.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, generally speaking, Irish manufacturers are doing a good job.  I believe that, with the protection and increased security we are giving them, they will do a much better job, because the more of the market we can conserve for them, the more we stabilise their position and the more confidence we give them, the more inclined they will be to get more up-to-date machinery and to adopt more efficient methods.  Having a greater and a more efficient output, they will, I think, be able to lower their prices.  I think I can safely ask the Seanad to pass the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this piece of legislation is to enable a widow's pension and the appropriate children's allowances to be granted to the widow and children of any Minister, Ceann Comhairle, or Parliamentary Secretary, who dies in office, irrespective of the length of service the deceased person has had in office.  At the moment, the matter is regulated by Section 20 of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938.  Under that section payment of pensions to widows and of the allowances in respect of children is restricted.  The restriction arises in this way.  A person only becomes entitled to a pension if he has served a minimum period.  The minimum period stated under the Act is three years.  If the piece of legislation that is before the House is carried, that limiting period of three years will be neglected in the case of the holder of a qualifying office who dies while holding that office.  As to the rate to be given, the Act at the moment has a statutory minimum.  The amount that is payable at the moment is £150 in the case of the widow of a Minister or a Ceann Comhairle and £100 in the case of the widow of a Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed, in the case where the holder of a qualifying office dies while holding the office, to pay the widow the minimum pension that would be payable under the Act&mdash;in other words, £150 in the case of the widow of a Minister or a Ceann Comhairle and £100 in the case of the widow of a Parliamentary Secretary.  The appropriate <Col N="1723" /> rates then of children's allowances will follow.  I should mention in that connection that in Dáil Éireann last night I indicated that certain increases in pensions were being permitted.  They will be stabilised by a piece of legislation which, in the end, will come before this House but, on foot of certain token Supplementary Estimates which I was given by Dáil Éireann yesterday, certain additional pensions will be paid.  I stated in Dáil Éireann that it was proposed, in the legislation which will be before the Dáil in the autumn to increase the pensions of widows of Ministers and Parliamentary officers, and of the children, but I gave a guarantee to the House that no such pension would, in fact, be paid until such time as legislation had been passed.  Widows of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, and their children, are the only people whose pensions, based upon the Central Fund, are being increased.  All the others are based upon funds of other types.</P>

      <P>It is obvious that we have travelled some small distance on the road of political education in recent years when we cast our minds back to the introduction of the original Bill making provision for Ministers' pensions, of which this Bill is an amendment, and to the criticism and political propaganda that was made in respect of that Bill at that time.  I welcome the change and the fact that we have now come to a realisation that it is only right that provision should be made in respect of those people who gave service to the nation as Members of this House or as Members of the other House&mdash;and particularly in the case of those people who may be called upon to give their services as Ministers of State and who thereby relinquish any interests they may have in private life.  We have, in the past, seen cases of many people who gave services both in constitutional and other activities in this country, just the same as in every other country, being neglected just at the time when the State should come to their rescue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I say that, we may not agree entirely with the method adopted in the present case but the responsibility <Col N="1724" /> is that of the Government who have chosen this method.  Therefore, on my own behalf and on behalf, I think, of all the members on this side of the House, let me say that we have no objection to giving all stages of the Bill this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the remarks that have been made, I want to say that I welcome the change as indicated by Senator Hawkins on behalf of his party.  There was a time when the walls of this country were plastered with very vituperative comment with regard to salaries at a time when there were no pensions for Ministers.  The change is not on the part of the present Government.  It is the present Government who are accepting a change of heart on the part of people who previously opposed salaries, let alone pensions.  I may say, also, in that connection that the precedent for this is to be found in the Presidential Establishment Act, 1938, and that when we began to consider a recent lamentable death we found that under the Act to which I have referred provision had been made to grant the widow of the President a pension if he died while holding the office of President irrespective of any term of office. That is the precedent that has been followed.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take the remaining stages to-day.</P>
      <P>Bill passed through Committee without recommendation, received for final consideration and ordered to be returned to the Dáil.</P>

    <Title>Housing (Amendment) Bill, 1949&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes) Michael Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I will secure the goodwill of the House for this measure by explaining that the Bill is of a standard type dealing with housing which has been before the Oireachtas a number of times in the past.  Its two general principles are, first, the extension of <Col N="1725" /> time for the completion of certain building operations to comply with the conditions for grants under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948; and second, to increase the aggregate of the moneys made available by the State by way of grants under that Act.</P>
      <P>The classes of operation affected by the measure are the building of new houses by private persons for their own occupation, by public utility societies for their members, the building of new houses for letting and also the reconstruction of existing houses in rural areas.  It, therefore, covers that very valuable contribution towards the solution of the housing problem being made by private building which has for many years been given support and encouragement by different Governments.</P>
      <P>The effective provisions of the Bill are contained in Section 1, which provides for two amendments of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, dealing with the qualifying conditions for grants for houses built or reconstructed by private persons or public utility societies.</P>
      <P>The first amendment is contained in paragraph (a) of Section 1.  It extends to the 1st April, 1952, the latest date for the completion of houses, the erection or reconstruction of which was begun on or after the 1st November, 1947, or on or after the 1st November, 1945, in the case of houses erected by persons for letting.  The latest completion date at present is the 1st April, 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second amendment is contained in paragraph (b) of Section 1.  It increases the aggregate of the grants which may be paid by the State towards private building operations under the 1948 Act from £580,000 to £1,750,000.  The amounts of the grants to individuals are not reduced by the Bill.  So far as new houses and reconstruction commenced on or after the 1st November, 1947 are concerned, they will still remain at the amounts shown in the Schedules to the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948.  When the Housing (Amendment) Bill, 1947, was being discussed in the Seanad, the Minister indicated that an exact measurement of the financial requirements <Col N="1726" /> under the Bill was not then possible and that, if the aggregate inserted in that Bill proved to be insufficient, a short amending Bill to increase the amount would be introduced.</P>
    <P>The position now is that the aggregate of £580,000 allowed under Section 26 of the 1948 Act has been practically exhausted.  This is due to the rapid growth in the number of grants allocated and the exceptional acceleration of the administration of the grants in the past 12 months.  Up to the 30th June last, grants had been approved for 6,292 new houses.  Of these, 867 grants had then been fully paid and instalments had been paid in 1,364 cases.  As regards reconstruction in rural areas, grants had been approved in 4,247 cases of which 450 were fully paid and 601 had received instalments. The total expenditure under the several relevant sections of the Act up to 30th June, 1949 was distributed as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  Section 16.  Grants for erection and reconstruction begun on or after the 1st November, 1947&mdash;approximately £425,000.</P>
    <P>2.  Section 17.  Erection begun on or after 1st November 1945&mdash;approximately £55,000.</P>
    <P>3.  Section 18.  Extra £20 grants for reconstruction begun but not completed prior to 1st November, 1947&mdash; approximately £7,000.</P>
    <P>4.  Sections 19, 20 and 21.  Recoupment of letting grants paid by local authorities&mdash;Nil.</P>
    <P>In the cases of letting grants, applications for between 400 and 500 houses have been made to local authorities, who are at present investigating these claims.</P>
    <P>It is obvious at present to everyone acquainted with the measure of the housing problem that private enterprise is an essential supplement to the efforts of local authorities towards its solution.  Uncertainty as to future policy in the matters of grants is, therefore being removed by this Bill so as to allow full scope to persons intending to plan for the building and reconstruction of houses within the next two or three years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1727" /> It was the intention to consider a larger Bill which would include the provisions in the present short Bill.  It would be unfair, however, to Deputies and Senators in the present pressure of Parliamentary business to press for the immediate passing of an amending Bill involving changes in important points of policy without giving them a reasonable opportunity to consider fully a wider Bill so that they would be able to study carefully the need for such amendments as they might consider necessary.</P>
    <P>There are a number of important aspects in which the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, has not yet been given sufficient trial and I feel that we should have greater experience of its working before proposing amendments either in that Act or in earlier legislation. I hope, however, to introduce a more comprehensive Housing Bill dealing with some general aspects of housing policy later on.  The present urgency for providing further moneys before the summer recess makes this short Bill of limited scope necessary, and I accordingly submit it for the approval of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out in his statement, this is just a continuation Bill and I do not think it would be fair to the Minister or the House to engage in a full-dress debate on housing at this stage.  We have been promised that at a later stage a comprehensive Bill will be brought in but I would like to avail again of the opportunity of drawing the Minister's attention to something to which he has already given expression and that is the question of a reexamination of the whole system of carrying on housing, particularly as it is carried on by local authorities.  It is a big burden on the rates at the present time and while that burden is being placed on the shoulders of many people to provide houses, in a great many cases the people who are paying the rates to subsidise houses so that they can be let at an economic rent are people of lower income than those who are getting the houses to rent.  I think, some scale&mdash;a sort of sliding scheme&mdash; could be devised to meet this case, at <Col N="1728" /> the same time placing the obligation on the local authorities to provide the houses because they are the only people able to do it.  I think it is becoming a very serious matter which requires consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I welcome still further the statement of the Minister that he is looking into some of the wider aspects of the whole housing problem.  I suppose everyone is agreed that the provision of housing for the working classes is a very desirable matter which should be carried out with the utmost speed.  The Minister has made some progress in this regard but I take it that he would not for one moment suggest that the full powers of the building trades have been mobilised in producing houses.  I think houses that are built under contract for local authorities or for public utility societies are being proceeded with in a fairly satisfactory manner, but the housing question is one that calls for steady progress.  If the progress is interfered with and employment is stopped even for a short period the workers cannot be hung up on hooks until the next job is available.  I would like to suggest to the Minister&mdash;and I rather think he is aware of it&mdash;that one whole section of the building industry has not been able to give its full powers to the work.</P>
      <P>I am referring to the speculative builders.  I am sure the Minister will forgive me for pointing out that speculative building is a very important section of the industry and provided almost as much employment as any other section in that houses used to be built in advance and there were many circumstances which rendered that most desirable.  Prospective purchasers could come along and inspect the houses being put up and suggest that they would suit or that with minor modifications they would be most suitable. The function of the speculative builder was then to cater for that trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned with pride that there have been some houses built for renting but I think that is due to the very exceptional circumstances of a minority of very large employers.  I would like to suggest to the Minister that houses for renting are <Col N="1729" /> houses that will have to be built by the speculative builder and I think the Minister is quite well aware of it.  The restrictions on that progress will have to be removed by the Government itself.</P>
    <P>I think Section 16 and Section 19 of the Housing Amendment Act, 1948, contain many matters that require revision.  Surely it is an absurd position that a person who puts up houses to rent can never sell them afterwards. I would like to suggest to the Minister that once he has got the house built for renting and it is put upon the market it really does not matter if somebody comes along and buys that house.  The purchaser may be the tenant who was renting it.  The position at present is that the owner of such a house cannot sell the house to the tenant because he is debarred from doing so.  This and some of the other provisions, which I hesitate to call absurdities, are standing in the way of a large section of the building trade being mobilised for the purpose of producing houses along the lines that have been carried out for generations.  Surely it is an absurd position when this country is gasping for houses, that men are being prevented from earning their living in the traditional manner that has been theirs for generations.</P>
    <P>There is no use in my labouring this matter if the Minister can give us an assurance that in the amending Bill a section dealing with these matters will be introduced.  But I would hate to think that this Seanad would regard with complacency this Bill as a solution of the housing problem.  I do not for one moment suggest that it is not necessary, but it is only one section of a very complicated measure that calls for the united effort of the whole community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this Bill as a gift to the builders.  It continues the giving of the grants for a further period and I have never yet come across a case where the grants given lowered the price of a house to the prospective purchaser.  I directed the late Minister's attention to an advertisement that appeared in the newspapers offering houses for sale at a certain price plus £275.  I showed him that the purchase price of identical houses <Col N="1730" /> built in the same area by the same builder two years before was £275 less. All the builder did was to add £275 to the cost of the house.  If that £275 or any part of it went to the buyer's credit, something could be said for this principle, but in no case did it go to the buyer's credit.  If a newly-married couple want to buy a house, look for one, go to a building society or anywhere else and finally decide on one, they will have to put down a deposit, £100 or £150.  They have to scrape that up and their difficulty is as great as ever it was before the Oireachtas passed an Act subsidising these houses. The £275 or whatever the amount may be will not ever count to the purchaser's credit.  I had, as I say, drawn the previous Minister's attention to this.  He had the case investigated and his reply was that the builder was building the same type of houses in the same place but with an area increased by 50 square feet.  He had set out the front wall six inches in order to say that there was a difference between the new house and the old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A difference of six inches in the front wall will not justify an extra charge of £275, and I want to know if the Minister, when he is considering some new legislation to deal with housing, will see whether any method can be provided to help financially the small purchaser.  A newly-married couple may be put to the end of their resources to provide something in the way of furniture.  They have to put down a deposit of £150 perhaps and pay for 30 years charges amounting to £2 or £2 10s. a week.  They are tying a mill-stone around their necks for the whole of their married life and the speculative builder gets away with a grant of £275.  Building costs have not gone up since the Act came into operation and I can see no justification for putting up the prices.  As far as my inquiries go&mdash;and I have spoken to a lot of people who are looking for houses&mdash;in no case has the cost been reduced by anything as a result of the grant.  I will not be the one person to say &ldquo;discontinue the grant.&rdquo;  Maybe it does good in some way I do not know about, but it does not do good in the way it should.  The man with £150 or £200 who wants to get a house <Col N="1731" /> is as badly off as ever he was in spite of the State being prepared to make a grant.  If he could keep his limited amount of money to buy necessary things for the house it would be an advantage.  I cannot see exactly how the State would put the £275 to his credit.  If they found a way, perhaps people would claim that they wanted a house and get the State to pay £275 and then default afterwards.  The trouble of removing them after they had been in a house for some time would be considerable, but some way should be found to improve the present position.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I want to draw attention.  Whether it is relevant to this Bill or not I do not know, but as the Minister has promised that he will introduce new legislation I will draw his attention to this matter.  Large housing schemes have been undertaken by private builders. In one case 800 houses of exactly the same type were put up.  They were not put up by a local authority but for sale to the public.  There was not the difference of a knob of a door between one house and another, but every person who went to the builder's solicitor had to pay the same fee, so much for investigation of title, so much for this and so much for that. They went to building societies and the same couple of building societies handled 800 houses but they demanded the same amount, £50 or more, from each purchaser for solicitor's fees for investigation of title, maps and the dickens knows what else.  Multiply that by 800 and see how much was taken out of the pockets of the newlyweds who were looking for houses. Building societies could co-operate with the State and with the public in a case like that.  Where houses like these were inspected and looked at by architects, where an investigation into title was made and every possible matter probed into, they should be satisfied with a nominal amount and to that extent relieve the prospective buyer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephMeighan" hpid="Mr. Meighan Mr. Meighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I mentioned here a week ago that the lowest tender for cottages in Castlerea was £2,000 Senators seemed to think that I was <Col N="1732" /> dreaming a bit, but it is a fact.  Is the Minister satisfied that the specification for those houses is not a bit above the standard?  I understand that corkwood has been mentioned in the specification and that it is expensive. That point was put up to me as one of the reasons for the tender being selected.  Very few private individuals put corkwood into their houses as they cannot afford it and I think the Minister should see to this.</P>
      <P>Some labourers are inclined to build their own houses but they have not the cash and there is a delay in getting the loan or grant.  If a way could be found of hurrying up at least part of the grant it would be an advantage. Many of these men wish to help to build their own houses and if they got any little encouragement they would go ahead themselves.  They have put up to me that they have the difficulty that they have not the money to go on. If the merchant who supplies materials to them were satisfied that the loan or grant was guaranteed it would be a great relief to them.</P>

      <P>D'fhan mé le haghaidh an Bhille seo go speisialta mar bhí mé ag súil go dtiubhradh an tAire sórt léirmheas dúinn ar scéal na dtithe ar fud na tíre.  Tá diomú orm nach raibh sé réidh le é sin a dhéanamh. Tá leithscéal glacaithe aige agus tá mé sásta leis an leithscéal, go mór mhór ó tá sé ráite aige go mbeidh sé ag teacht os ar gcomhair arís gan mórán moille le Bille níos leithne ná an ceann atá os ar gcomhair anois.  Ag an am céanna, agus go mór mhór ó tharla go bhfhuil sé ráite aige go bhfuil tuille beartaithe aige maidir le scéal na dtithe, ba mhaith liom tagairt do phointe nó dhó le súil go ndéanfaidh sé scrúdú orthu le linn dó a bheith ag ullmhú an Bhille eile.  Tá sé ceart dícheall a dhéanamh tithe a chur ar fáil le haghaidh an lucht oibre, ach sílim gur fiú cuimhniú ar an aicme sin den phobal nach gnáth dúinn oibrithe coitianta a thabhairt orthu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá cuid mhór daoine agus ní i mBaile Atha Cliath nó i Luimneach nó i nGaillimh atá siad, ach sna bailte beaga ar fud na tíre, daoine mar mhúinteoirí scoile, daoine mar státsheirbhísigh de shaghsanna éagsúla, <Col N="1733" /> agus ní féidir dóibh, beag ná mór, tithe a fháil gan trácht ar thithe feiliúnacha a fháil, tithe d'fhéadfaidís a fháil ar chíos réasúnach.  Ar fud na tíre, tá tionscail bunaithe sna bailte beaga agus tá cuid mhór daoine mar chléirigh, bainisteoirí agus a leitheid sin agus tá tithe ag teastáil go géar uathu.  D'fhéadfá a rá go mba cheart do na daoine sin tithe a thógáil iad féin.  Sin é an rud ba mhaith linn.  Ba mhaith linn go mbeadh a theach féin ag gach duine sa tír, ach tá níos mó ná cúis amháin ann faoi nach bhfeileann do dhaoine dul faoi chostas agus tithe a thógáil mar sin dóibh féin.  Mar sin, ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an Aire go dtiubhradh sé aird speisialta ar an taobh sin den scéal.  Tá sórt drugaill, is dóigh liom, ar chonrathóirí, nó &ldquo;contractors,&rdquo; dul i mbun tithe de shaghsanna áirithe.  Níl a fhios agam cén fáth go bhfuil an drugall sin orthu. Tá daoine a rá nach bhfuil airgead le fáil ó na bancanna agus tá daoine a rá go bhfuil an saol chomh héagcinnteach nach maith le lucht tógáil tithe dul i mbun iomarca oibre den tsaghas sin. Pé ar bith caoi é, is ceist an-tabhachtach í go ndéanfar rud éigin níos mó ná mar atá déanta go dti seo ar son na haicme sin atá luaite agam.</P>
    <P>Maidir le tithe don lucht oibre, ba mhaith liom go gcuimhneodh an tAire, idir seo agus an chéad uair eile a thiocfadh sé os ár gcomhair, an ceart rud éigin a dhéanamh i dtaobh tithe a tógadh ar chostas cuid mhaith na tíre le haghaidh gnáth-oibrithe a bheith dá n-úsáid mar shiopaí agus mar ionaid ghnotha.  Níl a fhios agam an cheart aon rud a dhéanamh faoi, ach tá mé in aimhreas an maith an rud é go mbeadh airgead poiblí á chaitheamh ar thithe le haghaidh lucht oibre agus go mbeadh na tithe sin á n-úsáid, ní mar ionaid chónaí, ach mar ionaid ghnotha, i gcoinnibh daoine a chaithfeas a lán rátaí a íoc agus a haithfeas a lán costas eile a íoc.  B'fhiú dó machtnamh a dhéanamh an gá aon rud a dhéanamh faoi sin agus an ceart aon rud a dhéanamh faoi.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a iarraidh ar an Aire freisin cuimhniú ar leasú éigin a dhéanamh ar an socrú atá anois ann i dtaobh na ndaoine a dtiúrfar tithe dóibh faoi scéimeanna tógáil tithe. <Col N="1734" /> Tríd is tríd, mar tá an scéal faoi láthair, ní fhéadfadh bardas nó údarás áitiúl teach a thabhairt ach do dhaoine a bhfuil tithe cheana féin acu ar cíos agus a bhfuil na tithe sin daortha ag dochtúir an cheantair.  Chomh fada agus a théas sé sin, is socrú an-tsásúil é&mdash;daoine atá sna tithe brocacha, is ceart go mbeadh seans acu teach a fháil má tá teach nua ar fáil&mdash;ach tá daoine eile ann agus gearrtar amach iad óna tithe sin agus chítear dom gur mór an éagcóir ar na daoine sin é.</P>
    <P>Mar shompla, duine a bheadh i dtionóntán, nach mbeadh aige ach seomraí agus, abair, clann mhór, 8 nó 9, aige, agus teastas aige ón dochtúir go mba cheart dó glanadh as na seomraí sin chomh luath géar i nEirinn agus is féidir.  Fiú i gcásanna áirithe&mdash;teastas ag an duine sin go bhfuil drochshláinte ar chuid dá chlann&mdash;níl aon tseans aige, beag ná mór, ar cheann de na tithe nua a fháil de bhrí nach bhfuil teach aige ar cíos go hiomlán cheana féin.  D'fhéadfainn cás antruaibhéalach ar fad a lua leis an Aire mar shompla más gá é, ach tá súil agam, nuair bheas sé ag machtnamh ar an scéal, go gcuimhneoidh sé ar a leitheidí de chásanna agus go ndéanfar réiteach dóibh.  Is cinnte, nuair a bhí scéal na dtithe os ár gcomhair sna blianta atá caite, nár cuimhníodh go mbeadh a leitheidí de chásanna ann agus dá mba rud é go gcuimhneofaí air, tá mé cinnte nach mbeadh an socrú ann mar atá.</P>
    <P>Thairis sin, ní dóigh liom gur gá aon rud eile a rá, ach gur maith linn go bhfuil tuille réiteach á dhéanamh faoi scéal na dtithe agus tá súil agam go bhfuighmid an comhoibriú atá riachtanach leis an scéal seo a réiteach.</P>
    <P>Mar adúirt mé, nuair a thosaigh mé ag caint, tá diomú orm nach ndearnadh survey ag an Aire ar an dóigh a bhfuil an scéal i láthair na huaire.  Mar shompla, bhí mé ag súil go speisialta go mbeadh eolas againn i dtaobh na n-oibrithe&mdash;an bhfuil na hoibrithe gann anois, an bhfuil daoine diomhaoin anois ba cheart a bheith ag obair ar na tithe.  Ba cheart go mbeadh cuntas réasúnta cruinn againn ar an obair a bheith ag dul ar aghaidh níos scioptha ná mar atá.  Tá mé an-fhoighdeach faoi sin, ach ní ceart dúinn bheith ródhian <Col N="1735" /> ar an Aire.  Bhíomar ag súil le cuntas uaidh, ach ós rud é go bhfuil sé anseo anois den chéad uair mar Aire, ba cheart go mbeimis foighdeach.  Is dóigh nach fada go dtí go mbeidh sé os ár gcomhair arís agus go dtiubharfaidh sé cuntas dúinn ansin faoin scéal.</P>

      <P>Senator Seamus O'Farrell made some useful suggestions with regard to housing grants, and I feel sure that nobody will be more anxious than the Minister to try, if it is at all possible, to arrange that the benefit of these grants will go to the purchasers or tenants of the houses. It would be incorrect to assume, however, that every public utility society failed to pass on the benefit of the grant to the tenant or purchaser. There are some societies which, I believe, gave the tenants or the persons who purchased the houses, the full benefit of the grant.  I know of one case, because I happened to be, for 12 years, secretary of the particular society.  The tenants in that instance were given the full benefit of the grant as the amount of the grant was written off, and the tenants were offered the houses, which could be purchased outright, or else paid for in instalments. In addition very good terms were given to the tenants when purchasing by instalments. That was due to the fact that certain people lent money free of interest, and, in some cases, lent it at 1 per cent. or 2 per cent., to enable the society to let houses at low rents to people with small incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree, however, with Senator O'Farrell that many builders apparently tried to charge as much as possible for houses, and that they would not be inclined to give tenants the benefit of grants unless some provision was made to make it obligatory on them to do so.  If the grant, as Senator O'Farrell suggested, was merely given to the occupiers, I think there would be nothing to prevent builders from putting up the price of the houses, unless the rents and prices were controlled by the Government according to the quality of the materials used in the house, the floor area, and the cubic content of the house.  I feel sure that the Minister is anxious to consider all <Col N="1736" /> aspects of this problem, in order to enable people to obtain houses at reasonable rents and prices.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cost of building, I can quite understand many Senators being surprised at Senator Meighan's statement of tenders of £2,000 being received for the building of labourers' cottages, when, it is understood, that somewhat similar cottages are being built in other parts of the country for about £800.  I think I am correct in saying that in County Galway cottages better than the average are now being built by direct labour for approximately £800, or less than half the figure mentioned by the Senator.  I believe that the direct labour system should be extended, especially if £2,000 is being asked by some contractors for building a cottage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the speculative builders, mentioned by Senator Dockrell, every type of builder should be given useful work to do in the building line, but I strongly urge that all house-builders should concentrate on small and medium sized houses, and that under no circumstances should they be allowed, as some were in the past, to use up a vast amount of building material and labour on mansions which were only within the reach of very wealthy people.  The amount of labour and materials which, in the past, went into the building of some big houses, would have built five or perhaps ten labourers' cottages.  I submit that it would be far better to supply five families with reasonably sized cottages, or houses, than to supply a wealthy individual with one large mansion.  All builders and all available materials should be engaged for the building of small and medium sized houses for those in the greatest need except those who are needed to build hospitals and other public utility buildings.  I feel sure that the Minister is most anxious to do everything possible to provide the people who are in the greatest need with houses, and I believe that the suggestions that I have made are worthy of his consideration.</P>

      <P>I wish to call the Minister's attention to the qualification for grant given for reconstruction <Col N="1737" /> of houses where valuations are under £35.  I suggest that the Minister should consider the question of increasing the £35 valuation.  Every Senator who knows rural Ireland is aware that there is a huge number of houses where the valuations are under £35 and that the position is a bad one. The occupiers find when they make application for the £80 grant that it is rejected.  There is not a complaint generally about the giving of grants for the erection of houses, but the Minister should have no difficulty in making a case to the Minister for Finance for increased grants and also in the case of valuations.  Occupiers of the houses I have in mind are seldom in a position to save much money, and consequently cannot undertake much repairs.  The grant should be increased beyond the £80 figure having regard to the cost of building materials compared with pre-war days.  I suggest that the Minister should consider making the grant £100.  Another snag concerns a house built more than 20 years ago.  Such houses should be available for grants.  The amount being given in the case of new houses is reasonable but, if what I suggest is conceded, I am sure farmers will feel grateful and that all sections will approve.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated that he hoped to bring in a more comprehensive Bill at an early date. In view of Senator Meighan's remarks, I take it that houses being built by local authorities are those for which contractors propose to tender up to £1,000.  I was prompted then to suggest that if that is the tendency in the building trade the Minister should give serious attention to it.  Otherwise it will come to the point that local authorities will not be able to continue to give the service in the housing drive they would like to give because of the effect it will have on their finances. The operation of the legislation at the moment seems to me to be such that when houses are built by local authorities certain houses will be let to people at the full economic rent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think, then, that if local authorities are to continue they will have to be indemnified and I put forward the suggestion of a sliding scale in rents.  I know that one group of people who are supposed to be in the middle income group are charged the full economic rent while another group of people, who are relatively well able to pay, do not pay the full economic rent.  That latter group constitutes a liability to the local authority in my county&mdash;particularly if, as Senator Meighan suggests, housing costs are going to soar.</P>
      <P>Let me conclude by saying that there is nothing in this Bill to which the House could take serious objection.</P>

      <P>As stated at the outset, this Bill is non-controversial.  It merely makes provision for extending the financial provisions and the time for carrying on the work on the same lines as we are doing at the moment.  I have indicated my intention to introduce a more comprehensive measure at a later stage.  The discussions in the Dáil and in the Seanad have encouraged me to think that I was wise in postponing the introduction of the more comprehensive measure.  In these discussions various points have been raised and these points will be helpful, when the comprehensive legislation is being framed, in indicating the leaks, cracks and faults that have shown themselves in the operation of the machine. However, I must say that I still think that the machine which is operating is not by any means a bad machine.  In the normal course it would be expected that it would be somewhat premature to have to amend legislation enacted as recently as 1948.  However, owing to the vast scale and scope in which housing activities have been undertaken in this country it is inevitable that weaknesses and faults should have shown themselves.  There is also evidence of some good under the Act because of <Col N="1739" /> the huge scale on which it has been embraced by our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various points of view have been put forward in the Dáil and in the Seanad in regard to matters which need to be amended.  For instance, Senator Dockrell suggests that some of the building talent is not being fully utilised owing to certain restrictions.  That may be true to a certain extent.  It has been said that speculative builders are not organising or working at full pressure in this housing drive but, against that statement, we have evidence that speculative builders are coming in increasing numbers and that they are paying special rates to tradesmen&mdash; more than those actually called for by trade unions.  I would be anxious to discover if any building force was not being pressed into service at the present time.  Irrespective of whatever flaws may be in the existing Act, it is our determination to try and secure the co-operation of every available operative in this drive.  The point which was made by Senator Dockrell will certainly receive consideration in the framing of the new measure.  Against that, however, there is the point made by Senator O'Farrell, and which cannot be ignored, that when these precautions were inserted in the measure there was a good reason for doing so.  It was the intention of the legislation then, it is the intention of the legislation now and I hope it will continue to be the intention of the legislature that the grant will go to the applicant rather than to the builder.  I feel that that ought still to be enshrined in the legislation.  Between these viewpoints, however, there is a gap to be bridged.  Anomalies have arisen in the course of the operation of this measure.  Take, for instance, the case of a man who ordered a building to be erected.  Having qualified for the grant, that person suddenly found, for reasons outside his control, that he was not able to go on with the contract. The position then would be that the grant would not be made payable in respect of the house.  I think that type of anomaly is unfair to the builder and to everybody concerned.  At present a grant would not be payable in such circumstances except in the case of a person who dies&mdash;when letters of <Col N="1740" /> administration would be taken out and it would pass to the next of kin.  That is a matter that will have to be resolved so as to ensure that justice will be done to both sides.  But the eventual determination is to see that the party to whom the grant will pass will be the applicant for the house.</P>
    <P>Senator Meighan referred to the £2,000 house.  I think that is really exceptional in the instance referred to. The Castlerea County Council regarded it as being excessive and they are considering alternative methods of building. Senator O'Reilly also spoke on the same line but I think the £2,000 house built by a local authority is the exception rather than the rule.  There is a tendency for prices to come down in building.  That tendency has shown itself definitely but not anything like the rate at which we would like to see it coming down.  However, there has been in the last 12 months a definite decrease in the cost of building due to the competitive spirit that has crept in.  I must say that I would not be very happy about reducing the standard of the houses.  It was suggested that we were building to too high a scale.  I do not think that we are.  I had much pleasure recently in opening a housing scheme in Ennis, under the chairmanship of our respected Senator Honan.  We had all to admire the provision made for the tenants of these houses.  I do not think we should reduce the standard of houses throughout the country.  The type of house which was built in Ennis is a very fine type of house but it is only in accordance with the standards to which our people throughout the country are entitled. Whatever about the financial position I think we ought not write down the standard of the local authorities in respect of houses.  They ought to be complimented on the enterprise and vision they have shown in carrying out these schemes.</P>
    <P>As has been said, there is nothing of a controversial nature in this Bill.  We have deferred the discussion of amendments which have shown themselves to be necessary to improve what is already a very good machine.  We hope to make it better in the fuller comprehensive measure.  This Bill is essential to enable us to carry on the work. <Col N="1741" /> Nothing ought to impede the speed with which the matter is going ahead at present.</P>

      <P>I think most Senators will agree that the White Paper circulated in conjunction with the Bill makes the contents of the Bill very clear.  At least, it made the contents clearer to me, as I do not mind confessing that I am puzzled and confused by the multiplicity of the Army Pensions Bills, Defence Forces Bills and Military Service Pensions Bills.  There are only two or three things of importance in this Bill.  One of its chief purposes is to provide new rates of pensions for officers and soldiers disabled by would or injury after the passing of this Bill.  The position with regard to ex-soldiers totally disabled is, even after the passing of this Bill, rather peculiar and will not be fully rectified until there is another Bill in the autumn.  There was a rate of 26/- a week under one of the earlier Acts&mdash;the Act of 1927, I think&mdash;for people totally disabled.  During the emergency, there was another Bill, operated only for the period of the emergency, which gave 42/- a week. Since the emergency, we are back at the old scale of 26/- a week.  In the meantime, the workmen's compensation rates were altered so as to give 50/-to people totally disabled.  This Bill brings the rates up to 50/- for people totally disabled, from the passage of this Bill onwards, but still leaves under the other Bill a rate of 42/- in one case and 26/- in another.  Those rates will be equated to these rates, under the Bill which will be introduced in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter of importance in which Senators will be interested is <Col N="1742" /> that this Bill reopens and extends for six months from the date of passage of the Bill the period during which persons can apply for medals, with the allowance attached to the medals.  The date had already passed and this Bill extends the date for six months from the date of the passage of the Bill.  The Bill also applies the Army pension schemes to nurses and First Line Reserve and takes power to prepare a scheme to apply it to the Second Line Reserve.  Up to this, in the case of pensioners, allowances were given for children only up to the number of four.  This removes every limitation and the allowances can be given for the full number of children.</P>
    <P>There was no power heretofore to restore a pension that was forfeited because of a court sentence.  Power is being taken under this Bill for the appropriate Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to restore a forfeited pension, that is, an Army pension that was forfeited because of a sentence in a civil court.  There still remain people who forfeited their military service pensions and similar power will be taken in the Bill to be introduced next October to restore forfeited military service pensions.</P>
    <P>If there are any points on which any Senator wants further information, I will endeavour to give it to him.</P>

Under it, those people who met with disability will get the same rates of compensation as they would under any other compensation scheme.

      <P>This is an amendment of the Defence Forces Pension Scheme.  You remember that when I was last before the Seanad it was with a Bill to authorise the extension of that scheme to chaplains. This is a scheme to extend the pension requirements to chaplains and there is just one distinction in it with regard to chaplains which does not apply to ordinary officers.  The ordinary officer is in full commission and when he is disabled or broken in health through injury then the disability pension is open to him to get a pension for the disability.  In the case of chaplains that does not apply so we are taking powers in this scheme to ensure that if the retirement is due to ill health or disability the pension will be payable after ten years' service instead of 20 as in the case of the officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are just one or two other minor things which I think will be acceptable to the Seanad.  Article 7 ensures that the widow or children of an officer will not be deprived of pension because the officer died before fulfilling the present conditions of being in receipt of retired pay.  Heretofore if the officer died before retirement and not actually in receipt of retired pay the widow lost her rights.  We are now altering that so that if he died with an entitlement to retired pay the widow will not be at a loss.  Article 9 removes the qualification, for a soldier's married pension, of being in receipt of the marriage allowance at the time of his discharge. Heretofore the position was that if a <Col N="1744" /> married soldier was not in receipt of a marriage allowance and he went on indefinite leave for which he gets no pay or marriage allowance and if he died during that period marriage allowance would not be paid.  We are rectifying that, as I think was necessary in this scheme.  Finally, in Article 16, in the case of certain area administrative officers, for the purpose of pension, ten years are added to their service but the question of married gratuity was overlooked.  I think these are some of the main provisions in this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to amend the provisions of Sections 11 and 17 of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1946, in relation to the special lawful additions to the basic rent in respect of what I may describe as exceptional repairs executed by the landlord.  The provisions in question have given rise to unforeseen difficulties in practice which have made amending legislation imperative and a matter of urgency.  It is only right that I should, at the outset of my remarks, express my gratitude to Senator Miss Pearse for drawing my attention to the matter in the first instance and so enabling the situation that had arisen to be brought under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (g) of Section 11 (2) and paragraph (e) of Section 17 (2) of the <Col N="1745" /> Act of 1946, which the Bill proposes to amend, are identical.  They provide that if a landlord, in any of the five pairs of years in the period 1945 to 1950, inclusive, expends an amount in excess of two-thirds of the basic rent on putting the premises into a reasonable state of repair, he shall be entitled to increase the lawful rent by a sum equal to 15 per cent. per annum of the amount by which his expenditure exceeds two-thirds of the basic rent. I think it is clear that the Legislature, when enacting these provisions in 1946, had in mind the difficult situation in which the landlords of controlled property were placed.  On the one hand they were compelled by the law to accept restricted rents&mdash;severely restricted, one might say, particularly in the case of premises that were still controlled on the 1914 basis&mdash;while, on the other hand, the Rent Code had, from the beginning, made the position of landlords more difficult, so far as liability for repairs was concerned, by placing special remedies at the disposal of tenants and, moreover, there were the powers of local authorities under the Public Health and Housing Acts to compel the carrying out of repairs by landlords.</P>
    <P>Landlords were able to complain with some force that controlled rents were inadequate to permit of the discharge even in a limited degree of their liabilities in respect of repairs, especially in view of the greatly increased cost of repairs.  One solution would have been to have allowed rents to be increased to such an extent as might have been considered necessary to compensate landlords for the increased cost of repairs.  But this would have resulted in automatic and, perhaps, substantial increases of rents for all tenants&mdash;a situation which, I am bound to say, could scarcely have been viewed with equanimity.</P>
    <P>Confronted with the dilemma which I have endeavoured briefly to outline, the Legislature in 1946 decided that an increase of rent should be allowed in respect of repairs, only when the repairs had actually been executed by the landlord to an extent which involved outlay in a particular period in excess of a specified proportion of the basic rent.  Such a provision seemed to <Col N="1746" /> have the advantage that tenants could not be asked to pay increased rents until the repairs had been done and that landlords would be encouraged, or could be compelled, to carry out necessary repairs and be assured of an increase in rent to recoup them their expenditure.  It is true, perhaps, that the provision was, in principle, open to the objection that it placed a premium upon neglect of repairs but to labour this objection too much would be to ignore the realities of the situation in which landlords had been placed for many years during which rents had continued to be severely restricted while repair costs had continued to mount. At all events, it seemed to accord with the requirements of a sound public policy, apart from any question of endeavouring to do justice to landlords, to have the state of the law such that there would be an incentive for landlords to carry out necessary repairs even though this might involve some increase of rents for tenants.</P>
    <P>In the examination of the various lawful additions to the basic rent permitted by Sections 11 and 17 of the 1946 Act, one is struck by the curious circumstances that whereas, in the case of expenditure on improvements or structural alterations, the lawful addition is reckoned at 8 per cent. of the amount expended, the percentage rate in respect of expenditure on repairs is fixed at the seemingly high figure of 15.  To find an explanation for this it is necessary to go back to the Rent Act of 1923.  That Act contained provisions on identical lines to the provisions of Sections 11 (2) (g) and 17 (2) (e) of the 1946 Act, but the 1923 Act's provisions (as extended by the amending Act of 1926) applied, of course, to repair work carried out in any of the pairs of years from 1923 to 1928.  The provisions in the 1923 Act had been recommended by a committee which had been appointed by the then Minister for Home Affairs to inquire into the operation of the 1920 Rent Act. The 1920 Act allowed a maximum increase of 25 per cent. of the standard rent in respect of the landlord's liability for repairs.  The committee criticised this provision on the ground that the 25 per cent. increase could be and was in fact usually claimed by <Col N="1747" /> landlords irrespective of whether the repairs were carried out or not.  They recommended that the automatic increase in respect of repair liability should be restricted to 10 per cent. of the standard rent and that the remaining 15 per cent. should be assessed, not on the standard rent, but on the actual outlay on repairs during a limited period over and above the normal outlay.  The committee regarded one-third of the standard rent as representing at that time normal outlay on repairs.  They considered that this change in the law would serve to induce landlords to undertake without delay the work of putting their houses into a reasonable state of repair.  But it is clear from the committee's report&mdash;and this is a point which I desire to stress as being of particular relevance now&mdash;that the kind of expenditure which the committee envisaged was expenditure that would, in the words of the report, &ldquo;absorb from one to two years' profit rent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It may be doubted now whether the 1923 committee's reasoning was altogether sound or logical, but, however this may be, their recommendation was adopted and the resultant provisions of the 1923 Act appear to have worked satisfactorily or, at any rate, did not occasion any complaints or critical comment.  In the light of this, the decision taken in 1946 to meet the demands of landlords for concessions in the matter of the allowances for repairs by reviving the idea first adumbrated by the 1923 committee is one about which we cannot now afford to be unduly critical.  However, it does now appear as if certain factors were overlooked, namely: (a) the greatly increased cost of repairs as compared even with 1923 costs; (b) the possibility that repairs amounting almost to complete reconstruction might be necessary, involving expenditure, not of the order of one or two years' profit rent as envisaged by the 1923 committee, but of such an amount as to absorb, perhaps, 20 or more years' rent; and (c) the possibility that some landlords, having purposely neglected to do any repairs <Col N="1748" /> for years, might set out, as a matter of deliberate policy, to incur heavy expenditure with the object of bringing about a very substantial increase in the rent.  To a certain extent, of course, the greatly increased cost of repairs is merely an aggravation of the other two factors I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>As Senators will readily realise, when a sum running into several hundreds of pounds or, perhaps, £1,000 or more is spent by the landlord on repairs and the landlord is allowed to increase the rent by 15 per cent. per annum of the amount by which that expenditure exceeds two-thirds of the basic rent (which would be a relatively insignificant figure), the result is a wholly disproportionate increase in the rent of the premises. Cases have actually occurred in which, as a result of the operation of the provisions which the Bill proposes to amend, rents have been increased threefold, fourfold and even fivefold. Clearly, if this situation were allowed to continue, it could only result for many tenants in the complete deprivation of the protection which the Rent Restrictions Code was intended to provide for them as their rents might be increased to such an extent as to leave them with no alternative but to give up possession.  In these circumstances, I felt that the matter was one which called for the immediate attention of the Legislature and the Government's proposals for dealing with the situation are embodied in the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>In considering the proposals in the Bill I want Senators to bear in mind two things.  Firstly, the proposals are of an <i>ad hoc</i> character framed to deal with the <i>de facto</i> situation that now confronts us in a number of actual cases and, secondly, these proposals fall to be considered in the light of the fact that the Act of 1946 is itself due to expire at the end of next year so that there will be a further opportunity of reviewing the whole position in the near future.  The Bill proposes that, as on and from its enactment, the allowance to the landlord in respect of expenditure on repairs should be modified to a sum calculated in accordance with the scale set out in the Schedule, <Col N="1749" /> that is, at the rate of 15 per cent. per annum on the first £100 of the excess of the landlord's expenditure over two-thirds of the basic rent, 8 per cent. on the second £100 and 6 per cent. on any amount over £200.  It is true that, even on this modified scale, comparatively substantial increases of rent will still be possible.  But we have to face the fact that landlords, apart from their liability in the matter of repairs under contract or at common law or under the Rent Restrictions Act, are often compelled by the local authority to carry out substantial repairs and that it would be wholly unreasonable, having regard to the severely restricted rents permitted under the Act, to expect landlords to carry out such repairs without giving them some increase of rent.</P>
    <P>As regards those cases in which rents have been already increased under Sections 11 (2) (g) or 17 (2) (e) of the 1946 Act, the rents will be automatically adjusted as from the passing of this Bill on the basis of the new scale and Section 3 of the Bill contains provisions which will enable any tenant who, through being unaware of the passage of this amending legislation, goes on paying the increased rent to recover the difference between that rent and the adjusted rent in respect of any period after the enactment of the Bill.  In addition to any other method of recovery, the tenant will be able to recover any such sum by withholding the rent until he has recouped himself the amount.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to pretend that the proposals in the Bill provide the ideal solution, but I feel that I can recommend them to the Seanad as providing the best practicable solution in the circumstances confronting us.  Senators will appreciate that, as I have already mentioned, we are legislating to deal with a <i>de facto</i> situation in which a number of landlords have exercised their legitimate rights under the Act of 1946 and this is something which we cannot entirely ignore.  It may well be that, when the whole question comes to be dealt with again, a more radical solution may have to be attempted for the problem presented by the conflicting <Col N="1750" /> needs of a reasonable standard of repair on the one hand and of a rent within the means of the tenant on the other hand.  I am bound to say that at this stage it is not easy to see what the solution for this problem may be and we can only hope that it will not prove wholly intractable.</P>

      <P>I want first to congratulate the Minister on having brought his amending Bill in so quickly.  It is only four or five weeks since a case in which I am interested was brought to his notice.  I have heard since that there are some other cases.  I do not know what the effect of this amending Bill will be, whether it will meet the case of reasonably poor people or not, but I am grateful to the Minister.  I am glad that my message to him has brought about this Bill, but I also want to say that much more credit is due to one of the Deputies than to me.  If I mentioned it, the Deputy worked on it. If was Deputy Briscoe who brought it to a head and the Minister knows that. I hope that it will have a good effect, but not knowing the technicalities I cannot judge.  The position will certainly be better than things have been but I do not think it will be ideal.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for making the change possible so quickly and, above all, before the recess.  I hope the Bill will have a good effect on those affected.  We cannot say they were unfairly treated, because they were treated according to the law, but those who framed the legislation, and the Oireachtas, did not realise that the results were going to be so serious, rents being increased, as the Minister said, four and five times.  In the case I am interested in it was increased four times on poor people.  I hope that after this things will be a good deal better.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take remaining stages today.</P>
      <P>Bill passed through Committee, reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.</P>
