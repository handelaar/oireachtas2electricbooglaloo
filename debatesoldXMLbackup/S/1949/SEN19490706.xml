      <P>It is proposed to take the business as on the Order Paper. When the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill has been finished the Minister hopes the House will see fit to take the remaining stages.</P>
      <P>Apart from the business on the Order Paper, three other Bills have been received from the Dáil, that is, the Land Reclamation Bill, the Seeds and Fertilisers Supply Bill and the Infanticide Bill.  It is intended, in accordance with the previous decision of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to put these Bills on the Order Paper for to-morrow, in spite of the Standing Order which says that there must be three days' notice.  I take it that there is no objection to that and that if any other Bills come from the Dáil to-day the same thing may be done.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>I would like to have from the Minister a more clear explanation as to the reasons that prompted the imposition of higher taxation in the case of a licence for a rifle as against a shotgun.  Arising <Col N="1302" /> from the emergency, many of our young people have been very anxious to equip themselves in the use of a rifle, and the 22 rifle was something recommended by those in charge of our Defence Forces.  I think the imposition of additional taxation on this particular type of activity is one about which we should have more information, before the Seanad should give the Minister power to impose such taxation.</P>

      <P>The whole tax brings in an additional £30,000 in the year and the rates, which are being replaced by the new rates, were fixed as long ago as 1925.  It is thought that as there has been a good deal of change in the aids to people by way of changes in the rates of value of money, the rates of 1925 could without any injustice suffer an increase.  I cannot say what amount of money has been got from the increased charge, raising the rifle tax from 5/- to £1.  On this matter, I took the advice of the Department of Justice, the Department mainly concerned.  My case, in the main, is that the rates were fixed so long ago that they are completely inconsistent with the licensing fees paid in respect of many other matters where changes have been made based upon the changed value of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcCrea" hpid="Mr. McCrea Mr. McCrea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCrea</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph (d) (ii), line 15, to delete the words &ldquo;five hundred&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;one thousand&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I intend to deal only with recommendation No. 2 but I should like to point out that when I was putting down these recommendations I did so because of complaints which were made to me and pressure which was brought to bear upon me not only from my own district and county but also from the adjoining counties.  I think that in that respect I am not alone and that many other Senators here have had similar experience. The matter was raised at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party and discussed at great length.  It was unanimously decided to ask the Minister to increase the limit of the population from 500 to 1,000.  It must be remembered in connection with the entertainment tax, that in 1947 the Fianna Fáil Government increased the tax by almost 100 per cent.  That was followed in the autumn of 1947 by the Supplementary Budget taxes.  We all know what followed.  I think the Minister for Finance, when he was replying to the debate last year, put it very properly when he said that these people were compelled to engage a pianist or the player of some other instrument and that they played to the four walls of the cinema for the duration of the programme for that particular night.  The present proposals have certainly made the matter considerably worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> Most of our cinemas are losing money. As a result of the present arrangements, a ring has been drawn around them.  Any travelling showman or any other person can come to within three miles of a particular town with a population of between 500 and 1,000 and set up a show and carry on free of entertainment tax, free of rent, free of rates and free of other expenses which are heaped upon the properly established cinema.  In my county, there is a cinema at Greystones, Rathdrum, Baltinglass and Carnew.  Since the imposition of the 1947 tax&mdash;and I think the Minister must be well aware of this because deputations have been with him from time to time about the matter &mdash;three of the cinemas have been losing money.  They did everything to try and stem the tide.  They curtailed their showings to three or four nights a week.  They cut down rent, heating and lighting expenses, and other expenses. Nevertheless they are still losing money.  If they are to be ringed in to a three-mile radius where, as I pointed out, the travelling showman or others can come along and set up free of entertainment tax, there is not a hope in the world that the cinemas will be able to continue.  I have authority to say that at least three of the cinemas I have mentioned are closing down in September when the present bookings have been taken up.  Further, I have authority to say that if the Minister has the slightest doubt on this point the proprietors of these cinemas are prepared to submit certified audited accounts for the past three years.  In Bunclody, a town with a population of 600, an enterprising man who came in there will have to close down his cinema because he has no option but to do so.  I have been asked to ask the Minister to increase the population limit from 500 to 1,000, and I do not think there is anything unreasonable in the request.  A document has just been handed to me.  It is an article which appeared in the journal <i>Hibernia</i> in October, 1948.  It was written by John Gerrard, and it is entitled &ldquo;Fair Play for Rural Cinemas&rdquo;.  I should like to read this relevant extract:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The majority of our sub-standard cinemas cater for so small a public <Col N="1305" /> that they can barely pay their expenses and, in fact, many would never have begun operation were it not for the public-spirited action of Parish Priests and local committees. Already an alarming number of enterprises have been compelled to cease the struggle and sell their equipment.</P>
    <P>Deputies in Dáil Éireann must by now be aware of the facts and should appreciate their significance.  Yet when the subject was brought up for discussion it was neatly shelved and has not since been brought into daylight.</P>
    <P>The attitude provides an unfavourable contrast to that of the British Government.  Over there the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated in his Budget speech:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;I am also anxious, for the sake of our agricultural communities, to encourage all types of entertainments in rural areas, including such things as cinema shows.  I propose, therefore, to grant complete exemption from duty in the case of all entertainments in buildings situated in places in the rural areas, where the population does not exceed 2,000.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the position in Britain and Northern Ireland.  All entertainments are exempt in Northern Ireland up to a population of 2,000, so I think that in asking the Minister to accept this amendment I am not asking anything unreasonable.  I do not want to prolong the agony any further but what is happening in Wicklow, Wexford and Carlow will happen all over the country.  Cinemas which have been built and are properly equipped, heated and lighted and which cater for large sections of the rural community will definitely close down unless there is some relaxation of the present arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMcCartan" hpid="Dr. McCartan Dr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to second the amendment.  I have a record of the takings of a cinema for three nights which were £35 13s. 8d.; the tax was £12 4s. 3d.; the net receipts £23 9s. 5d.; the renter's share £13 5s. 9d. and the exhibitor's share £10 3s. 8d.  The weekly wages of the <Col N="1306" /> staff, consisting of four girls, one charwoman and three men, were £20 10s. and taxes and rates were £120 per year.  I do not see where a man like that is going to make money.  The Minister is thinking of the queues in Dublin in imposing the tax, not of country cinemas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to support Senator McCrea's amendment and as a matter of fact to go much further.  Here and throughout the country there have been many complaints about the flight from rural Ireland into the larger cities and the suggestion has been made that it is due in no small way to the lack of entertainment and social life in rural Ireland.  The question which Senator McCrea's amendment puts before the House is whether we are prepared to levy a tax on an entertainment held in a town the population of which according to the census does not exceed 1,000.  We are exempting an entertainment held three miles distant from such a town, but I am a believer in Parliament passing laws in the knowledge that they will be respected by the people for whom they cater. I hold that in putting this condition in the Finance Bill we are suggesting to people how to evade taxation.  I am sure it has been brought to the Minister's notice, or if not to the Minister's to the Revenue Commissioners', that steps have been taken to evade this particular tax.  All one has to do is to erect a marquee or a temporary dance hall just outside the three mile limit. It is just the same as the <i>bona fide</i> travellers on Sunday who have been commented upon in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mere fact that the public houses are closed on Sunday in a particular area does not deprive people of their refreshment when they can travel three miles for it.  The people who evade taxation by putting up a dance hall outside the three mile limit would also make money because their expenses would be less.  They would have to provide a much better type of entertainment in a town.  In order to make a dance attractive they would have to employ a proper dance band but the people who are anxious to evade the taxation need only erect a marquee <Col N="1307" /> outside the three mile limit and engage a second or third rate band.  No case has been made for this proposal.  Of course the Minister will say in his reply that for a number of years there was a tax on dancing in particular, but I believe that one of the worst acts ever passed through this or the other House was that which licensed dance halls. It commercialised dancing and did away with an old Irish tradition, the social event of the dance in a farmer's house.  Now that is an offence as a result of legislation passed by the Oireachtas some years ago.  Since then various Ministers for Finance have considered this a ready way to collect revenue, but to my mind, and I am sure to the Revenue Commissioners and the inspectors concerned, it is not as pleasant as one would think.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator look at the side note to the section? It is an exemption section.  This is not a tax gathering section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>But provision is made in the section that an entertainment held outside a particular type of town does not come within it.  I hold, and I am sure many Senators will agree with me, that we should completely wipe out this form of taxation as it is very difficult to collect.  I know that the Minister has said that it costs 2½ per cent. of the total proceeds, but apart from the cost, those of us who live in rural Ireland know that there is a large amount of evasion of this duty.  Furthermore, by making a limit of five, seven, or even ten miles, you are inducing people to evade the law and I think that is a bad thing for a Parliament to do.  If you are going to pass legislation let the legislation cover the whole people and let us not induce people to go outside the three mile limit to evade it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular section was rather lengthily debated in the Dáil and as has been said, I think it is quite possible that it will lead to quite an amount of unemployment particularly of musicians engaged in dance bands. Surely the Minister and every member of the House will agree&mdash;and some references were made by some Senators to a statement of mine the last day&mdash;<Col N="1308" /> that we have sufficient unemployment at the moment without attempting to add to the numbers.  I would ask the Minister to accept this recommendation. While I would be prepared to support a recommendation that would go much further I am certainly prepared to give every support to Senator McCrea in getting the Minister to accept this one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdmundSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In a qualifying sense I am inclined to support the recommendation of Senator McCrea for the reason that I think this section is bringing relief to a certain sort of cinema.  We had this matter mentioned last year and also the question of the rural cinema and exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not exemption for cinemas but it includes small dance halls and everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdmundSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but from the point of view of the cinema if the Minister is satisfied from the Senator's arguments that the concessions would aid the rural cinemas or entertainment halls, in achieving the purpose which the Minister aims to achieve, namely, to assist such permanent structures, would he not be inclined to increase the population limit so as to aid such cinemas?  I am impressed by the suggestion that cinemas in small towns, far from being helped by this exemption, are being hurt by it.  I take it that it was intended to assist them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that was not the intention.  The intention was not to assist cinema proprietors but to provide for the rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdmundSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that it aims at aiding such cinemas to provide amusement and entertainment for the people.  Those with permanent cinemas will not be able to provide it at all and the travelling cinema would then supplant the more permanent structure. Possibly the concession was not intended for the cinemas but for the people, but if the effect of this section is to close rural cinemas, whether the intention was to help the people or the cinemas is immaterial if the people cannot see the cinema.  Can the Minister at this stage give us some indication <Col N="1309" /> as to what would be the loss to revenue by accepting this recommendation? If the loss is not a substantial one then, in my view, the amendment is a reasonable one which will assist the rural community and only in a small measure deplete the Exchequer funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will cost £25,000 in a full year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBurke" hpid="Mr. R.M. Burke Mr. R.M. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting Senator McCrea's recommendation. One point which I think should be emphasised is that the proprietors of many of these cinemas provide proper sanitary accommodation and heating, and if these cinemas are closed down and substituted by travelling-show tents the people will lose the benefit of these more substantial structures and the proper sanitary accommodation and heating provided in them.  The question has been raised of the loss to revenue by accepting this recommendation and the Minister might well ask where the money was to be found to meet it.  I would suggest that one method of raising the necessary money would be by increasing the death duties on large estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusOFarrell" hpid="Mr. S. O'Farrell Mr. S. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was inclined to support this recommendation until I heard the arguments in favour of it. Senator McCrea is a cinema proprietor and appeals for the cinema proprietors and the dance hall proprietors.  He has advanced the arguments that if this recommendation is not accepted many of the rural cinemas and dance halls will close down and there will be unemployment.  I do not like to see threats being made against any Government. If the remission of taxation was to benefit the people I would be in favour of it.  If, however, it was merely to enrich those who have speculated in business for themselves then I am not so sympathetic. In my opinion, if anyone goes into business he must run that business and take the risks, whether they are up or down.  I do not like to see the legitimate amusement of the people taxed and, like Senator Hawkins, I would like to see the people provide their own <Col N="1310" /> amusement; dancing when they like to dance and not to some commercial tune and not because they have paid for permission to dance.  I would like to see the tax kept on all cinemas and halls except those run by the people in parish halls for their own benefit. I do not see why it should be used for the benefit of one section of cinema owners.  Any remissions which are given should be passed on to the community. If the commercial cinemas do not pay then let them close down.</P>
      <P>Sometimes I think there are too many cinemas and too much commercialism about them.  If the travelling cinema comes in let them do so or let the people use the parish halls for their own entertainment and get a remission of taxation.  If the Minister consented to increasing the population limit from 500 to 1,000 he would still be in the difficulty of constant changes in the population, and I can imagine in some small towns with the population going over the 1,000 mark, some of the people engaging in the business being prepared to get rid of a few of the surplus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCrea</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest the impression get abroad from some of the remarks made here that I am a young Rank I would point out that I am interested in cinemas only to the extent that I am associated with a number of local people in establishing a cinema in the town for the people.  I, and my people before me, have always supported every local effort to improve the facilities for the people of the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Captain Orpen Captain Orpen">
      <NameTxt>Captain Orpen</NameTxt>
      <P>I look upon the section as a definite attempt to encourage and help the people in rural areas.  I do not know whether the Senators here live in what I call a rural area which is a place as far away as five miles from a cinema.  I look upon rural areas as areas so remote from the town that once a week is the most that some of the people are able to reach the town or city.  I think this concession which the Minister is offering to remote areas to provide amusement and entertainment for themselves is very encouraging. I wish we could do more to retain in rural Ireland facilities for <Col N="1311" /> the people living there to help themselves and I think that this section goes some way towards encouraging people in remote areas to help themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have this matter viewed in its proper perspective. This is an exemption section, a section which not merely exempts these places from cinema tax but from dance tax.  It is an effort to meet the argument made to me last year in Dáil Eireann, and, I think repeated here, an argument which I promised to consider for this year's Budget.  The stress last year was put upon the life of the people in remote areas, very remote areas, and, in particular, such remote areas as had meagre populations. That was the argument addressed to me and the case was made entirely on that.  I think I have met that case this year, because I am relieving, not merely from the newly imposed dance tax but from the old imposed cinema tax, places up to 500 population and places outside the three mile radius.  It is an effort to relieve these people.</P>
      <P>The argument this year shifts over to the cinema proprietor who was not in the picture at all last year, and with regard to him all I can say is that very elaborate forecasts are built up by those who have experience of doing that work for a number of years as to the yield to be expected from any tax, old or new.  The entertainment tax last year was almost entirely a cinema tax &mdash;although there may have been some other small items in it&mdash;and it yielded over £100,000 more than the estimate. That is not an indication that cinemas are on the wane.  I have been told in another connection that, while cinemas are on the increase and drawing greater audiences, they have helped to ruin dances and the great plaint made to me this year with regard to the dance tax was that dancing was on the wane and that the revenue could not be expected to be as great as was forecast because the cinema was so much on the increase that it would remove people from the dance halls.  I have no evidence to show that cinemas are going down&mdash;the evidence is all to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> I am yielding to the arguments addressed to me last year with regard to populations remote from big areas and populations which are rather scant, and meeting the case in regard to them. If I had felt that I would have to face the arguments which have been made this year, I would not have given any exemption but would have let the dance and cinema taxes run.  It may be that that will be the situation next year.  I am trying this as an experiment this year and I have already warned people who might be tempted to set up some sort of permanent establishment just outside the three mile limit, in order to draw away what might be regarded as a legitimate audience of a small town, that next year I will not be affected by any argument as to capital involved in any of these structures, because I have given warning that this is entirely experimental and next year the radius may be shifted.  I hold myself open to do anything according as experience educates me during the year.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a certain amount of misapprehension about country dances.  The farmer who used to invite people into his farm-house to dance can still do it and he does not pay a shilling to anybody, but, if he commercialises that dance, he will pay.  At the same time, even where it is commercialised by the farmer, he will get an exemption if he is within the ambit of Section 13 as it is.  I have had repeated to me the various arguments about the flight from the countryside and the terrific evasion being practised and the costliness of this tax.  The answer is that it is not costly to collect, but I feel inclined to take rather cynically observations with regard to a flight from the countryside because there is not a bigger exemption from taxes on dancing and cinemas and about the harm done by the evasion when they come from people who kept the tax on for 14 years.  I was told in the Dáil that this was persecution of the countryside.  It is a persecution which was conducted for 14 years, and, if I were to attend to the arguments about evasion, it would mean that one would have to have a very different view on such things as tariffs, because they undoubtedly give rise to a good <Col N="1313" /> deal of evasion, and, if I am to have regard to the evil effects of the corruption of youth which is caused, I do not know what we are to do with regard to places like Dundalk, where, I am told, everybody is educated to be a smuggler.  We would have to put up an iron barrier around the northern area.</P>
    <P>I ask Senators to accept this for the year as it stands.  If next year it appears that the cinema proprietors&mdash; although here the argument shifts its ground&mdash;in the towns between 500 and 1,000 population are suffering, we can see what relief can be given to them on another occasion.  The places between 500 and 1,000 population, if they are to be built into last year's argument and to be regarded as rural areas, or something attached to the rural areas, would include places like Manorhamilton, Moville, Kenmare, Portumna, Killaloe and Stradbally.  I do not think anybody would consider these as places which give habitation to the particular type of community to whom I was asked to address myself last year.</P>

      <P>My interest in the cinema business is very small.  I took an interest in it when certain gentlemen came along to start a cinema with a few local people.  I have nothing to be ashamed of in that respect because every organisation which has sprung up in my own district or county I supported all my life and will continue to do so.  There is only one matter in respect of which I should like to ask the Minister to give way.  The section speaks of &ldquo;the last available census.&rdquo; The last available census published is the 1936 Census but there was a census taken in 1946.</P>

      <P>There are a number of towns on the border-line of 500.  In the case of a particular town the census of 1891 showed a population of 689. In 1901, it was 652; in 1911, it had dropped to 583; and in 1936, it was 516.  It is 13 years since that census was taken and on that basis a number <Col N="1314" /> of these small towns will automatically be removed from the entertainment tax.  The tax is being demanded of them at present and I know well that the populations are not even 500.  We are not doing any damage to the Minister's idea with regard to giving facilities to rural districts, but I am sure that, within 12 months, he will find that there is no sense in hoping that the cinema can possibly exist on the basis of 500 population and three miles radius.  The statements I have made here are in accordance with the facts, and, even in the past three years, these cinemas have been losing money hand over fist.  I am not putting forward a personal point of view, although I have lost and spent more money in my time than would build some of them.</P>

      <P>I think the case made by the Minister, that this is an experiment, is sound commonsense.  It is not possible to make a limit of this kind and no one, no matter how clever, could make an exact estimate as to how it would work out.  The Minister has made it perfectly clear that he will watch the situation and see how it develops and that this limit is not regarded as anything permanent.</P>
      <P>I do not like to see amusements taxed.  I have not got the advantage of Senator Sweetman&mdash;he has been in a cinema four times, while I have been only once, in the last 12 months. Therefore, I am not directly interested in the question of taxation.  The matter before us is really not so much a matter of taxation as a question of a proposal to see if it is feasible to avoid taxation in certain country areas. It is a principle which we in the towns should recognise and support.  We do not know exactly how it will work out, but it is worth while trying and I am sure that it will require adjustment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McCrea, with whose argument I do not agree, seems to be under the impression that there is something to apologise for because you give information in connection with an industry or trade of which you have special knowledge through being connected with it.  No such idea was ever heard of in this House.  Senators on <Col N="1315" /> all sides are known to be interested in trades or professions, or Senators like Senators Hayes and Ó Buachalla have university knowledge, and they give that information and there is never any suggestion that they should apologise or explain.  We know it is all given in good faith and, in fact, one of the reasons why Senators are here, rightly or wrongly, is that, as a result of their experience, they have specialised information.  I do not see why Senator McCrea should apologise. It does not matter whether his business is a small or a large one. Even if he were Rank, or if Rank himself were in this House, it should not be necessary for him to give an explanation for making information available.  Everyone would know where he got it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Senator McCrea, we expect the revised census recently taken will produce certain results.  Possibly the report will be to hand within a month.  At any rate, the latest report will be the one applied and that will give some relief. I would ask Senators to consider that, if this section is passed, it means an exemption for all entertainment in these areas.  That is something considerable, given to the rural population for the time being.  I am aware of the danger which may be inherent in this, that of satellite places being built which would enable people to overcome the tax.  We will keep a watchful eye on that.  It is possible that harm may be done during the year. There is, however, a safeguard in respect of one matter.  If there is an attempt to set up dance halls just outside the limiting area, these places will have to be licensed, and we know the District Courts are accused of being very rigid&mdash;more rigid than some people think they should be&mdash;when they are investigating the conditions of these halls.  Therefore, as far as dance halls are concerned, I do not think we will have the type that Senator McCrea is afraid of.  The same point does not apply to the cinema, but the cinema is a much more formidable effort and I do not think anyone is likely, merely having a year in which to get in some <Col N="1316" /> quick money, to involve himself in such great expenditure.  There are regulations with regard to fire and other things there also, and the accumulation of all these will keep many of these satellite places from springing up.  The position will come under constant watch and we will make provision against it next year, if necessary.  I would ask that the experiment be allowed to go on for this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> I think I can do no better than quote an extract from the statement made by Deputy Blowick, who is now a Minister, when these provisions were first enacted in 1947.  The Deputy then stated, as given in column 1556 of the Dáil Report for 6th November, 1947:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A tax of 5 per cent. is being imposed on the purchase of house property so far as Irish nationals are concerned.  I do not know why such a step was decided upon.  No one takes exception to the 25 per cent tax on purchases made by aliens. But take the case of a young married person here in Dublin, who was looking forward to the day when he would own his own house or at least have his own house to go into.  On a house costing at the present time £2,000, a loan is available of say £1,600.  That means that the person concerned has to scrape up £400.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He says that the most thrifty people cannot scrape up that £400 deposit. Deputy Blowick at that time proceeded to put forward what seemed to him then many valid reasons against the imposition of this tax.  The particular circumstances of the time when this emergency duty was imposed brought about the necessity for the tax then. Since then, I think it is safe to say that every tax has been removed&mdash;the tax on beer and on cinemas, and so forth. This Bill makes provision for reducing the income-tax which was then increased. We have still provided, however, for the continuation of an imposition on those people whom we are most anxious to help and to cater for&mdash;the type of person who is anxious to acquire a house for himself.  We are putting a burden of £2 10s. 0d. per £50 or part of £50 on the person who now proposes to purchase a house for his own occupation.  A reasonable case was made when this matter was first introduced.  There was grave danger of inflation and people were anxious to put their money into house property or land in general, as a safeguard.  The Minister has assured us that we have emerged from that state of affairs. Therefore, it is only reasonable that we should ask him to remit this form of taxation now.  I was influenced in <Col N="1318" /> putting down this amendment by the statement the Minister made last week when replying to the Second Reading of this Bill.  He said he was not prepared to remit the taxation wholly. This recommendation proposes to go part of the way and I am not asking the Minister to make a total remission. I was prepared to ask the House at least to go so far as to give a reasonable reduction and encouragement to such people.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the position in relation to persons who are anxious to acquire houses for their own occupation. We are making provision in this Bill, as a result of taxation, to give to a person in the City of Dublin a sum of no less than £275 of a free grant, provided that that person proposes to erect a house for his own occupation.  Advertisements can be seen every day in our local and daily newspapers to the effect that sites are available, that contractors have plans and are prepared to build houses and that those houses will conform in every detail with the regulations and that there is available a free Government grant of £275.  On the other hand we have provisions whereby a person who, for reasons of convenience or otherwise, proposes to purchase a house that is already erected or has been erected for a considerable number of years will have to pay a levy of £2 10s. 0d. per £50 of the purchase money.  There is no reason in such a suggestion.  On the one hand we are making available a free grant of £275 of money raised under this Bill to assist one type of person to acquire for himself or herself a residence and on the other hand we are implementing another section whereby we are extracting from another type of person a sum of from £100 to £200, whatever the cost may be, according to the purchase money, because they propose to purchase a house for their own residence.  I quite agree that it was advisable, when this proposal was first put forward, to continue it and I would be prepared to support a suggestion that the 25 per cent. might be further increased&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so.  I <Col N="1319" /> think we were also told on the last occasion in the Finance Bill that that was not worth an awful amount to the Exchequer.  Neither is this proposal&mdash; nor could it be worth a great deal. But if we are going to come to the point that we must examine every proposal not on its merits but on what it is going to yield to the Exchequer, we are approaching the subject from a wrong angle.  There is no doubt but that in the times we are living in we should encourage and open up every avenue to every person in this State to enable him to become the owner of his own house and land.  In that way we might be doing more to overcome the dangers that threaten Europe than if we were taking other steps. However, we are putting a taxation on thrift in this respect.</P>
      <P>Take the case of a young married couple.  They first set out to acquire a house.  When they find a house up for sale and decide to take it they must first pay auctioneer's fees and legal expenses. Having done that they have to make a contribution of no less a sum than 5 per cent. to the Central Fund&mdash;for the privilege of being thrifty in the first place and of having had the courage to set up in this country of theirs a house for themselves.  I think that sufficient has been said.  The Minister should consult his colleague, the Minister for Lands in regard to what he and his other colleagues said in this respect in 1947, and he will then be convinced that a case has been made.  The majority of people in this country who set out to purchase their homes are not in a position to put down cash.  They generally purchase by raising a loan through one of the various building societies.  That in itself should be sufficient to encourage the Minister to accept this recommendation. As I said at the outset, the Minister was so definite, when replying to the debate on the Second Reading of this Bill, that he would not be prepared to remit the whole tax that I was prepared to put this recommendation to the House.  I hope the House will accept it as being a most reasonable suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. D. Burke Mr. D. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself to some <Col N="1320" /> extent in agreement with Senator Hawkins on this subject.  There is a lot to be said for the case he made and particularly for encouraging young people starting life to possess property and to be the owners of at least some goods in their own country.  That makes for stability.  I understood from the Minister last week that at some time or another he would consider the removal of this tax.  It is desirable that he should, as soon as possible, remit the tax, let us say, on the first couple of thousand pounds' worth of property a person possessed or wanted to possess.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that in the country districts the position is that the old man wants to hold on to what he has. If he goes to a solicitor and is told that the solicitor is going to charge so much and that the State will want another £100 or £150 out of it, there can be no doubt but that that is a deterrent to his handing over the property to his son, and a deterrent to production in the country.  This tax was brought in some years ago.  In view of the desirability of establishing a greater distribution of ownership in this country the Minister should consider how he could levy some other tax and remove this at some time.  If he cannot remove it in whole perhaps he could remove it on small establishments or small property such as dwelling-houses or farms under a certain value.  The enormous benefits that would thereby accrue in rural Ireland would be well worth a reduction of this tax and I would, therefore, ask the Minister to consider the points made by Senator Hawkins.  I consider it to be in the national interest that they should receive full consideration by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another example of the practice which has grown up of people who originally put on taxes objecting to their continuance. <Col N="1321" /> This was originally put on at a time when house property was running very high and when I met deputations this year&mdash;and I met quite a number over this point&mdash;I asked them for the benefit of their advice.  I asked the people interested in the passing of property of this type as to the reduction in the selling value of house property and even those who were most indignant about the tax and inclined to exaggerate the difficulties it was causing said that house property had fallen in value to about half.  One deputation from the Incorporated Law Society said that a house that fetched £5,000 a few years ago was going for £2,500 now.  In those circumstances I feel that I can more easily hold on to this tax than if values were as high as they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take a £5,000 house.  When the previous Minister for Finance put on the tax it was another £250. The purchaser paid £5,250.  In fact he paid a great deal more because the auctioneers who were very keen on getting this tax off claimed 5 per cent. and the solicitors who were very keen on getting the tax off claimed another 5 per cent.  If they agreed to take half I could agree to take less.  In the case of that £5,000 house running at £2,500 the purchaser pays £2,625 which is a big relief.  Of course if it were 1 per cent. he would only pay £2,525.  I was told also&mdash;in fact it was one of the heavy contentions I had to meet&mdash;that house purchase transactions had been brought almost to a standstill since the imposition of this tax of 5 per cent. The revenue from the 5 per cent. tax has been £600,000.  It is easy to calculate that the value of the property that changed hands during the year was £12,000,000 so it cannot be said that house property transactions are at a standstill.  Those are the circumstances that make me strong on keeping on the tax.  People ask me to consider some other tax in place of it to bring £40,000 or £50,000.  I do not know what would be said if I dropped a tax bringing in £600,000 and try to get it back some other way.  There would be an amendment to every section.  I am going to hold on to this tax for some years. Incidentally, I did not say that it should not be discussed on its merits; <Col N="1322" /> I said that the 25 per cent. tax was not worth much as of late so few properties passed to foreigners that the yield was negligible.</P>

It is of no value from the point of view of getting revenue and Senators will understand that it could not be increased to yield the amount of money I am looking for.  After all the remissions of taxation have been given and it must be admitted that there is more money in the citizens' hands at the moment as a result of these remissions and that is why it is necessary to ask that this be continued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular section of the people in whom I, and I am sure many Senators on the other side of the House, are interested are those people who wish to purchase a house of reasonable size and standard for their own occupation, something in the region of £2,000 at present values.  We find that if a person purchases a house for £2,000 he has no less than £100 to pay to the Central Fund together with what the Minister has already put <Col N="1323" /> before us&mdash;solicitors' and auctioneers' fees.  While a case may be made in the case of a transfer of property of greater value than £2,000, I hold that the Minister has not made a case for the retention of taxation on property valued up to £2,000.  It has another serious consequence, as Senator Burke pointed out.  The farmers in rural Ireland are of a very conservative nature and when they are making over their holding to a son, whether for the purpose of getting the old-age pension or otherwise, and are informed that together with paying the ordinary fees for the transfer they are obliged to contribute no less than 5 per cent. to the Central Fund, in their wisdom they will immediately calculate that if they had to pay £100 to the Central Fund on a £2,000 transaction they had better not transfer for the purpose of getting the old-age pension.  That will prolong the existing position and debar the son from getting married, taking over the holding and working it as it should be worked.  No matter from what angle we approach this we find that it can have nothing but a bad national effect.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, I am not so much interested in the transfer of property of large value, but I would press upon the Minister at this stage to remit this tax in the case of property up to the value of £2,000 or £2,500.  I do not wish to repeat myself but, after all, we make provision for lending money up to £900 to people who are prepared to purchase a house for themselves. The State is also prepared to make a free grant of £275.  Take that generosity on one hand, while on the other hand people who are prepared to take the same obligations but who want to purchase a house which is already occupied out of their own earnings or with money borrowed from a society which they must pay back, must pay a tax of 5 per cent.  I think the Seanad should press upon the Minister at least to give some small concession in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly obvious to Senator Hawkins and to me that no Minister for Finance is ever going to come into a Second House and withdraw <Col N="1324" /> a tax yielding £600,000.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with the last arguments made by Senator Hawkins.  Of course it is not the recommendation which he has asked us to vote upon but it would have been liable to get my support if that had been the form of his recommendation.  I think that his position has been made difficult by the fact that the Party of which he is a member brought in a tax which was unpopular, which hit the small as well as the big, and his successor finding that it yielded £600,000 is not prepared to give it up.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that between now and next Budget the Minister should examine this problem and see whether what he is doing in the matter of amusements and entertainment could not be applied to a certain type of house.  There is undoubtedly a considerable amount of bitterness amongst younger people getting married who simply cannot get a house to rent at anything relating to their income.  They manage by borrowings or out of savings to get enough together to make a deposit on a £2,000 or £3,000 house and then they find they have to pay a tax of 5 per cent. which used to be 1 per cent.  I have heard many bitter comments from people of this type who had been supporters of Fianna Fáil and were horrified to find that that Government imposed the tax originally, and from people who are supporters of the present Government and find it hard to understand why it is being continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system by which the transfer of certain properties bore a tax of 5 per cent. may not be a good one.  Certain transfers of property are unavoidable. No effort has been made and I do not think any system could be found of separating speculators from the gamblers.  I do not think to-day we have the type of speculation in property which took place some years ago, but I am not for a moment agreeing that the 5 per cent. stopped it.  It was undoubtedly a considerable check but other factors influenced the situation even more.  My main point, however, is to ask the Minister to see if in some way he could ease the situation of a person <i>bona fide</i> buying a house as a dwelling whereby he would come in <Col N="1325" /> under a lower tax.  You might impose conditions in such cases that the higher tax would be payable if the person did not reside in the house or if it was not occupied within a certain period.  Even the present prices of houses are too high in relation to the average incomes of younger people getting married.  That, of course, is a social problem but it is one which I think is very much related to the Minister for Finance also.  I would take this opportunity of urging the Minister to consider the position of the smaller house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have intervened in the debate at all but for the fact that Senator Douglas implied that the Fianna Fáil Government introduced this stamp duty and that its supporters were now running away from it and want to have it withdrawn in the present circumstances.  I want to emphasise as strongly as possible, and I speak with an experience of the situation as it then was, that the circumstances are now entirely different from what they were when that tax was imposed. At that time speculation in houses in the City and County of Dublin was rife.  The people dealing in them had no other interest in the property except to sell at a profit on a rising market which resulted in a vicious circle and this 5 per cent. tax was the first brake put on the speculators. I do not claim that it was the sole reason in stopping the speculation but I do claim it was the major reason and the first break that was put on what was becoming a very vicious state of affairs in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I also say that the price of houses to-day is undoubtedly a very severe strain on people who want to get a house for their own occupation. The State realises that and has given very liberal grants but they only apply to houses that are being built.  The dice is, therefore, loaded against the person who wishes to buy a house which has already been erected because that person is liable for the stamp duty.  There are some who would answer that these people could build houses and that there is every inducement for them to do so.  They will, in this way, get a house in six or nine months and in these circumstances <Col N="1326" /> would have to wait a little longer for it than if they were buying a house that was already there.</P>
    <P>In the one case you have the position that they will get a considerable State grant to compensate them for the delay but in that regard there is the fact that most people are not able to read plans and visualise from them what the type of house is going to be. Most young married couples prefer to see the house in existence.  There is very little use in telling them that a room is going to be of certain measurements. They prefer to see the room and know exactly what it will look like when furnished.  That is a matter which should be considered.  I have no sympathy for the person who can afford to pay £3,000, £4,000 or £5,000 for a house even if it is for his own occupation but I am very interested in the type of person who is in a position to pay between £1,500 and £2,000 for a house and I think that in that case some scheme could be devised whereby that person would get the subsidy on a house already erected even if they limited the space area to 1,250 square feet.  In the cases of such houses transferred to the persons requiring them for occupation the duty on that transfer should be dropped.  This would be a welcome change to the evils which might result in the Minister continuing to collect the tax and it would only mean a slight drop in the income of £600,000 a year.  It would be comparatively small, I think, and would ease the situation very much, particularly for those young people about whom we hear so much.  I emphasise that there is the aspect that these persons prefer to see a house actually in existence, because of their inability, which, as they are laymen, is quite understandable&mdash;I am not a doctor and do not understand a prescription&mdash;to visualise what a house will be like from plans placed before them by the architect.</P>

      <P>Most of the Senators who have spoken have referred to houses costing from £1,750 upwards. I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the type of houses which are found to a great extent in rural areas, that is, houses valued from about £700 to £1,200, the small type of house.</P>

      <P>I would certainly prefer the remission to be in respect of houses costing less than £2,000, and not over it, and I entirely agree with Senator Hawkins in that respect.  If the Minister, however, is not prepared to agree to that suggestion, I suggest that he should consider people who buy houses valued at less than £1,200, that is, people with small incomes.  The point has been made by some people that those who can afford to pay from £1,200 to £2,000, although not very wealthy, are fairly well off.  I would appeal on behalf of the people who cannot afford to pay more than £1,200 and who want to purchase a house valued at anything from £700 to £1,200. These are people with small incomes, who would, in most cases, have to borrow practically all the money, and, in cases of this kind, this tax is a hardship. I appeal to the Minister to consider such people, and I suggest that if he gave a remission in respect of them, he would not lose a very large amount of revenue in a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I promised in Dáil Eireann that I would consider for next year an extension of the graduation of the tax.  There is a graduated tax, the tax being low up to £1,000, and I promised to consider extending it beyond £1,000, but I certainly cannot do it this year.  I have not got any statistics to enable me to reply in regard to the amount of money that would be lost in connection with houses between £1,000 and £2,000, but last year the suggestion was made to me that the 5 per cent. should be made to apply only to estates of £3,000 and over. The calculation then was that it would cost about £220,000.  As I say, I have not got the figure relating to the lower amounts.  In connection with what Senator Hearne said, I am sure he is aware of the provision in the 1947 Act under which a certain number of people could form a friendly society and, having got grants, could transfer the property to members.  In that respect, <Col N="1328" /> the old rate applies and the new rate of 5 per cent. does not apply, so there is a loophole there for people to avail of.</P>
      <P>Senator Hearne has said that this tax, when applied, aimed at a particular matter and he claims that it was a major factor in reducing the price of houses.  If that is so, it was an accident.  The Minister for Finance, when introducing this in 1947, said, in reply to a question of mine, that the object of the tax was not to cheapen houses&mdash;it was to get money from the vendors of houses, and would not cheapen houses.  At a later stage, he made this statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I did not say in the Budget statement, or at any time since or before, that this was going to have the effect of reducing the price of houses.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It was not his aim.  I am quoting from my own speech of 23rd June at column 1311 of the Dáil Debates, wherein appears in quotes that statement of the Minister.  In the main, I find definite agreement amongst those with whom I have discussed this matter that the reduction in the price of houses has been due to a particular matter which was so very much and so severely commented upon both here and in Dáil Eireann, that is, the restriction by banks of the credit they were giving to certain people.  Whether that was a good or a bad move, whether it was good as done in the extensive way in which it was done, it did have the effect of reducing the price of house property.  I sometimes become amused when I think of all the annoyance caused because I mount on the shoulders of the young married couple who are looking for a house and find myself there in company with the solicitor, the auctioneer, the architect and the house builder.</P>

      <P>The other three, at any rate.  If I take anything by way of this 5 per cent., I channel it down to give remissions to the taxpayers generally, whereas the other three <Col N="1329" /> parties contribute only very indirectly to any remission&mdash;it is only through what I can get from them in relation to their incomes that any little remission goes to the taxpayers generally. I can get the matter of different types of houses considered as against next year, but with so many claims being made for increases&mdash;there are claims being made that the whole income-tax code should be readjusted to bring it more in consonance with the present value of money, claims to have the single man's, the married man's and the children's allowances raised and these are claims to which I lend a sympathetic ear&mdash;and with these having priority, as I think, I do not think there is much hope of getting rid of this tax within three or four years, although it may be brought down in its scope to some degree.</P>

      <P>In view of the general support which the recommendation has got from the House, regardless of what the Minister has stated, he must reconsider the position before he brings another Finance Bill before us next year.  I do not wish to hold up the passing of the Bill any further, except to refer to the suggestion made by Senator Douglas, that it is not easy to understand why persons who supported the imposition of a tax at one stage should be so anxious now to have it removed.  Senator Hearne has already answered that point&mdash;the circumstances have entirely changed and the condition of affairs which existed when the emergency Budget was introduced does not now exist.  The Minister said that when the former Minister was introducing the section he reminded the House that it would not have the effect of reducing the price of houses.  That is so, but it did have one effect, and I am quite satisfied that it was intended to have that effect; that is, it stopped the prices of houses soaring.  We have the position now that people know the value of a house and there are not so many people prepared to enter into the speculative market to buy houses for exchange almost weekly.</P>

The future that is held out, as the Minister pointed out, is that he will not be in a position for three or four years to remit this taxation on such people.

      <P>Last year, when I raised the point about this transition fund, the Minister stated it was being continued to the 31st March, 1949, and <Col N="1331" /> the reason for doing so was that the greater part of the fund had already been earmarked or allocated.  If that is so, I take it there is very little of the fund available for further development work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>This fund was first introduced to make available to local authorities grants from a particular fund in order to encourage them to undertake works of a development nature, particularly in regard to housing. At that time the grant to a local authority for the erection of a house was two-thirds of £350, together with an advance made out of the Transition Development Fund in order that the rent of that house might be something within the reach of the incoming occupants.  Since then we have had an increase in the loan charges to local authorities.  The Minister has said here and in the other House that there would be no increase in the loan charges for housing and that they would still remain at 2½ per cent., but that for other works the loan charges would be 3½ per cent. and that an arrangement would be come to as between the Department of Local Government and the local authorities to make good the difference between 2½ and 3½ on the loan charges for housing development.  What has happened? Something in the nature of co-ordination of the original grant of two-thirds of £350 and the Transition Fund has been come to.  The greatest amount now that a local authority may receive out of the Transition Fund is a sum of £400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the coming into office of the present Government, the position was that the local authority received from the Central Fund a free grant of two-thirds, plus the contribution from the Transition Fund in relation to the cost of the house.  Now it is stabilised at £400.  Therefore, regardless of the fact that labour charges have increased, that the cost of building sites has increased, and that the cost of general housing development work has increased, <Col N="1332" /> there is no compensation to the local authority for the increase in the rate of interest or to compensate them for the increased cost of materials and of labour.  From the Minister's statement the last night, I thought there was something like £1,000,000 available now in this fund.  If that is not so, I suggest that more money should be made available.  While we are pressing local authorities to make all haste with this question, we are placing on them and on the ratepayers a burden they are not in a position to bear.</P>
    <P>I would like to see, at some stage, an examination into this whole question of the conditions under which local authorities are compelled to erect houses for certain types of people. There is no doubt that, in many cases, they are erecting houses at a charge on the ratepayers in general, for people who, in many cases, are in as good a position to pay the economic rent as those people who are paying the rates to enable that subsidy to be given.  On the other hand, if this Transition Fund is to expire, in accordance with the terms of this Bill, on 31st March, 1950, what provision is going to be made to give to the local authorities grants in accordance with what is being given even at the present time, for houses or for development work in general that will not be completed, or for which grants will not have been made available out of this fund at that time? As regard costings, the Minister and local authorities generally are in much the same position that they were in at this time last year.  Local authorities do not know exactly what they may expect to get from the Department of Local Government in relation to work that they are carrying out in various centres.</P>

      <P>It is going out far too fast.  I have nothing to do with distribution.  I am astonished to hear that I stated last year that the fund was almost exhausted.  Originally, the fund amounted to £5,000,000 and on the 1st of April, 1949, the balance still available was £3,500,000 roughtly.  There were certain commitments since and it is expected that issues from it in the present year will amount to £1? million. I expect to have something short of £2,500,000 in the fund at the close of the year.  There is quite an amount of money there, and it requires a great deal of care to see that it will not go out too fast.  I stated the rate of interest last year and that, as far as housing is concerned, the difference between 2½ and 3½ per cent. would be met by increased subsidy.  That has been done.  I stated that in Dáil Eireann on May 4th, and I challenged contradiction on it several times.  If I challenge contradiction again I do not want general contradiction, but should like an example to be brought to my notice, that the promise I made was not carried out.  I questioned such statements on many occasions when interrogated, and the answer was always the same.</P>
      <P>The position has been regularised and the money given at the old rate.  I should like to say that the view I expressed last year, and which has been fulfilled during this year, is one that I would not express so readily again.  It is not possible to continue to finance housing at 2½ per cent. when money cannot be got at that rate.  I would rather do so by direct subsidy than have the pretence that people are being given such money at a time when it is impossible for the State or local authority to get money at that rate by way of popular issue.  As far as the promise that I made last year is concerned, I believe it was fulfilled and I should like an example if the negative is put to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one important aspect that concerns the Transition Fund and the drain on it caused by the <Col N="1334" /> cost of houses.  One of the most important factors in the cost of housing at present, both in Dublin and in rural districts, is an aspect that I referred to last year, the decline in productivity. Since then there has been published a report of a British Commission of Inquiry appointed by the Minister for Health there.  Figures that I gave tentatively last year from personal observation are borne out by the report.  The decline in productivity in this country is nothing new.  The same thing has occurred in England.  The decline is so great, as between 1938 and 1948, that it means an additional burden on the cost of housing that, in my opinion, should not be there.  Many reasons are given for that decline in productivity.  The report I refer to, it may be taken, was not a biased one, in the sense that it would make difficulties for the Government that appointed it.  The commission had largely a labour bias in personnel, and we may take it that it would not be biased against trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that the decline in productivity is one of the greatest problems facing the building industry.  It is facing members of the Oireachtas and others interested in the provision of houses so as to end the cancer of the slums.  I always held that three things were necessary to deal with the housing problem, men, money and material.  No doubt the resources of the State are sufficient as far as money goes.  Ministers of Finance, both in this Government and in the former Government, stated emphatically that money would be no barrier to the provision of houses. Supplies of materials are now practically back to the pre-war position. There is no real shortage of materials except minor things.  As far as one can find out from the figures available there is now as big a labour force of tradesmen and builders' labourers in Ireland as in 1938.  The decline in productivity and reduction of output has been very great, and will continue unless something is done about it.  I submit that it is a social problem.  The provision of houses is socially desirable, apart altogether from the employment aspect.  All concerned, master builders and trade unionists, will have to give very careful consideration to declining <Col N="1335" /> output, as it is a problem which has grown very much in the last few years.</P>

      <P>Referring to the decline in production, I am aware that labourers' cottages which were built in 1914 for £85 or £90 inveriably cost £1,200 now.  There has been a greater increase in the cost of building than in the cost of any other goods.  It might be desirable if the whole question of production could be investigated by some commission, so that it might be possible to let houses with a State subsidy to workmen at rents within their ability to pay.</P>

The then Minister for Finance wanted to claim tax from a local charitable society.

    <Title>Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1949&mdash;Second and subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Fishery (Amendment) Bill is one of three which, in due course, will be submitted to the Oireachtas.  The three Bills, if they receive the approval of Oireachtas Eireann, will, in effect, codify the whole fishery code into one Act; they will remove the existing anomalies which have grown up in the fishery code as the result of the fact that that code consists of a series of statutes dating from the earlier half of the 19th century down to to-day and it will also be a code of fishery law in which certain amendments have been made&mdash;and it is in regard to those amendments that the Bill which is now before the Seanad has to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill consists of four Parts and a series of Schedules.  Part I calls for no comment because it is mainly interpretation.  Part II comprises two sections and the object of it is to simplify and clarify the law applying to the audit of accounts and procedure of boards of conservators. Reference should be made to the Second Schedule which sets out in detail the procedure which should regulate the audit of accounts of a board of conservators, and Section 6 takes statutory cognisance of a duty which, in practice, <Col N="1338" /> has always existed and the failure to discharge which has, on rare occasions &mdash;and could in the future, on rare occasions&mdash;created considerable difficulty. It becomes the duty of boards of conservators from time to time to pay out moneys or to do other acts and, as will inevitably happen with boards that do not consist of experts in the fishery law, in desiring to do the right thing, they sometimes do something which is not in conformity with their statutory duty.  If a payment is made in those circumstances, when the auditor comes to audit the accounts surcharge falls to be made on the members who have been parties to the illegal payments.  It is really part of the duty of the clerk, similarly as it is part of the duty of a clerk of a district justice, to be on the <i>qui vive</i> and to familiarise himself with the law relating to any payments which come up for consideration.  He should warn the members of the boards of conservators if they are about by inadvertence illegally to make a payment or do an action.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, although that duty was recognised, it had no statutory recognition. It was open to a clerk to sit back and evade his responsibility, record the proceedings and, if the members went wrong, to say &ldquo;Let them go wrong&rdquo;.  Section 6 here enables the clerk and directs him to object if the members of the body are about to do an illegal act.  The only means whereby he can discharge himself personally from liability to surcharge is to satisfy the auditor that if an illegal act has been done he warned the members. Unless he can prove that he did warn the members he himself is liable.  If he can prove that he warned them and that they did it in spite of the warning he frees himself from liability and the liability falls on the members who, having been warned, acted illegally. It is also his duty, analogous to the duty of the secretary of a local authority, to take a note of the members of a board of conservators who voted for a proposal and against it and of those who abstained.</P>
    <P>Section 7 relates to the amendment of the law in relation to the fisheries rates.  But for the fact that I am in a position to tell the Seanad that this <Col N="1339" /> Bill is one of three and that the purposes of the Bill will not be fully realised unless and until all three Bills have become Acts of Parliament, I should feel constrained to apologise for the format of Section 7, because it is a thoroughly bad example of legislation by reference.  Inasmuch as it is only for the purpose of tidying up the situation with a view to producing ultimately a codifying Act which will set forth the whole law in one statute there clearly to be read, Senators will, I think, agree that in tidying up the short way is the best way as long as Senators have the guarantee that ultimately the law will be set out in permanent and comprehensible form.</P>
    <P>Section 7 amends the section of the Fisheries Act of 1925 which inaugurated the present system of fisheries rates whereby boards of conservators are empowered to strike a rate on all fisheries in their respective districts which are rateable under the Valuation Acts.  Every fishery liable to be rated by the conservators is exempt from liability to be assessed for rates by the local authority, and as a partial offset to the consequential losses to the local rates it is provided that where by reason of such exemption the rate collectible by a local authority has to be increased by more than 1d. there is recouped to such local authority from the Fisheries Vote the amount by which that increase exceeds 1d. in the £.  Now as Senators will see, this is a reasonably complicated formula to grasp when it is first read out in that way.  In practice, of course, it is well known to local authorities and boards of conservators and the calculation can readily be made.  When the arrangement was first introduced the provision was that it would last for ten years.  It was then extended for another two years by the Fisheries Act (No. 34) of 1935 and in 1937 a Fisheries Act passed in that year extended that arrangement for a further twelve years which carried it on to to-day.  We now propose to extend that arrangement for a further 15 years.  During the last 12 years the tendency of the Exchequer contribution has been to rise all the time.  When the arrangement was first made I think the <Col N="1340" /> Exchequer contribution used to be in the order of £2,000.  It has now gone to £11,200 but we anticipate, as I am sure Senators anticipate, that the rising trend of the rates has been arrested and we therefore hope that the liability of the Exchequer on this head will be stabilised at about £11,200.  In that confident hope the Minister for Finance agrees to the continuation of the existing arrangement for another 15 years.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with fines and forfeitures and shortly its purpose is this: fines and forfeitures arose down through the years out of a whole series of statutes with the result that a very complex procedure was attendant upon them and it was necessary for the district justice constantly to be on the <i>qui vive</i> to be sure under which Fisheries Act he was called upon to impose the penalty and what was the appropriate procedure for disposing of a fine which had been levied under that particular Act.  There were various funds to which these fines were paid according to the Act under which they were imposed.  We are seeking in this Bill to abolish that whole system of paying fines into specific funds and are seeking to provide that all fines will be paid into the Exchequer but that the Exchequer will be charged with the responsibility to pay out sums corresponding to what would have been payable if the funds created by the old statutes had continued to be the recipients of these fines.  If, therefore, under one of these statutes one-third of a fine was payable into what used to be known as the Police Fund and is now known as the Garda Fund and two-thirds into the funds of the board of conservators, the fine will now be paid into the Exchequer and the Exchequer will pay out of Voted moneys a corresponding sum into the Garda Fund and a corresponding sum into the conservators' fund.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear to the Seanad that the purpose of these changes is to allow the courts dealing with these matters to proceed with the certainty that their orders are good and not subject to quashing because having imposed penalties they directed the monies to be paid into the Police Fund or to the board of conservators instead of the Estuaries Fisheries Fund <Col N="1341" /> or some other fund which in the special circumstances concerning individual cases the relevant statutes would require the moneys to be paid into. Now the district justice directs that the fine shall be paid into the Exchequer and the Minister has the duty to determine the way he shall direct the proceeds of that fine and that decision shall be taken at leisure and whatever that decision may be it does not call into question the validity of the decision of the court as to the destination to which the fine was to be orientated.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, if a foreign trawler was found fishing within our territorial waters the district justice could impose a monetary penalty and he may or may not in his discretion confiscate the gear.  This Bill proposes that on conviction of the offence of fishing within our territorial waters whatever fines the district justice may determine to be appropriate he has the mandatory duty to declare all gear confiscated.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is for the purpose of making clear the meaning as we understand it, of Section 103 of the Act of 1942. A doubt has arisen as to whether a net of lawful design found on the banks of the river where netting is prohibited could be legally seized and forfeited without the apprehension of the owner or actual proof that an offence had been committed.  Under the Act the forfeiture is proposed of a fishing engine which was believed to have been used or about to be used in an unlawful manner at the time of seizure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to direct the attention of the Seanad to that matter and in asking the Seanad to consider the next Bill I shall have to refer to these things.  I shall ask the Seanad to take the view that all these methods of expressing the same thing are in fact identical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the disposition of the proceeds of the sale of seized gear.  Here again the difficulty arose that if an order confiscating the gear was valid and the order directing the sale was valid that unless the order directing the disposition of the proceeds <Col N="1342" /> to the appropriate fund was made it was possible to go to a higher court and have the order quashed.  In this section we proposed to adopt the same procedure as in the case of the fines and to have the moneys paid into the Exchequer, whose obligations will be to see that the moneys are passed through the appropriate channels to their ultimate destination.  Section 15, in fact, places on the Exchequer the obligations to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>There are three Schedules to this Bill.  To the Second Schedule I have already referred and it sets out the procedure of the boards of conservators. The Bill proposes a number of amendments. The first is repeal of the Fishery Act of 1925 and the Local Government Acts, 1941 and 1946, relating to the audits of the boards of conservators and which are replaced by the section and the Second Schedule to which I referred.  I think I have just said that it repeals the whole of the Fisheries Act, but actually it repeals so much of the Act as relates to the procedure at the boards of conservators.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries Acts of 1935 and 1937 are wholly repealed and they are the Acts to which I have referred.  I had told the Seanad that we are extending the existing rating system for periods of ten and twelve years, respectively.</P>
    <P>The enactments repealed in Part III of the First Schedule are enactments which heretofore governed the destination of fines, proceeds of the sales of forfeited gear, etc., and, as Senators will observe, there were seven such statutes, and under each of these statutes when a fine was being imposed it frequently presented a serious problem to the district justice.  It is in order to simplify that position that we are repealing them and making the Exchequer the sole fund to which fines are to be paid.  I do not think there are any further matters that I need mention at this stage and I feel the Seanad will realise that I am not unduly presumptuous in asking it to deal with these Bills in a rather more succinct way than they ordinarily would, because ultimately a codifying Bill will be introduced to the Seanad and will, I understand, be referred by <Col N="1343" /> it under the new procedure to a special committee for careful examination in the light of the certificate of the Attorney-General.  These two Bills are really tidying up in preparation for the other enduring one and I think I am right in saying that, in effect, these two Bills will be repealed by that measure, but it is necessary to pass these two, in order that the third may be clearly and effectively enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept the Minister's statement that this is more a tidying-up measure than anything else and we realise that we cannot on this Bill or on the other Bill which is to come before us discuss the fishing industry in general and whether it is nationalisation or otherwise of the industry, but there are one or two points I want to put to the Minister. I should like to know if it would be possible to extend the limit of our territorial waters by a mile.  We have advanced very far now in the matter of shipping, and, while the three-mile limit might have been quite all right in ancient times, it is a drawback for our fishermen, particularly on the west coast.</P>
      <P>I also want to draw the Minister's attention to the necessity for more supervision of our waters.  We have had complaints from time to time, particularly in Galway, about the inroads being made by foreign trawlers to the disadvantage of our native fishing industry, and, if some more active and efficient service in regard to the patrolling and controlling of our waters could be provided, together with an extension of the three-mile limit, it would be very welcome. Otherwise, the Bill is one which can be better dealt with in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the three-mile limit, as I understand the situation, it is a matter of international agreement.  A conference was held at The Hague about 1931 and certain nations wanted to fix 20 miles, while certain others wanted to fix 12 miles and others six miles, but the only minimum on which all could be found to agree was three miles.  That, so far as I know, is the source of the <Col N="1344" /> existing universal acknowledgment of the three-mile limit.  That agreement, however, was followed by a number of bilateral agreements between individual nations who exchanged undertakings to respect six miles or ten miles, as their specific treaty might provide.  It has, from time to time, very understandably occurred to certain people that we should declare our right to certain territorial waters and assert it, but, when one comes down to tin tacks, one has to recollect that, on the high seas, the authority of the Garda Síochána is not admitted, and a nation is well advised not unilaterally to announce its intention of policing the seas further than its strong right arm can do against opposition. We have agreement with all nations to respect the three-mile limit and all foreign Governments will render their nationals liable to our prosecution, if it is established that they have offended our law as it relates to the three-mile limit.  Outside that limit, if we wish to make a non-national trawler amenable to our law, we have to go out and bring him in.</P>
      <P>I think the Senator will agree with me that it is a wise course never to stick one's neck out further than one is prepared to pull it in again.  I agree that it would be a desirable thing if we could get a widely accepted agreement to extend the limit of territorial waters to six miles.  Although we intend to develop the practice of our people to fish further from our own shores than has been the practice heretofore, we would be glad to exchange with other countries reciprocal agreements for a six-mile limit.  At present there do not appear to be many takers.  If and when there are, we shall be glad to do our part. <i>Ad interim,</i> we are in a position to assert our authority over the three-mile limit and not beyond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned that within the three-mile limit protection did not seem to be adequate.  With that view I have considerable sympathy, and I am happy to be in a position to give the Senator the kind of news that he and I would both desire to hear.  One must first remember this, <Col N="1345" /> that a good many incidents which people who are not trained in these matters misinterpret as illegal fishing are not illegal fishing at all.  A good many trawlers come in for protection from rough weather, and they are, of course, welcome.  A good many come in with broken-down machinery or with their trawls caught in their propellers and they have to come into quiet waters to disentangle themselves. They, too, are welcome.  Of all the occasions on which trawlers are seen close to our shores I should say that not 30 per cent. are cases of illegal fishing. Secondly, it was common knowledge to all of us who had anything to do with the matter, and particularly those familiar with sailing or travelling at sea, that, to the average landsman, to discern what three miles at sea is is not easy.  He is quite likely to imagine, if he is standing at a height above the sea, that a boat which is, in fact, ten miles off land is only two miles.  It is an error which it is extremely easy to make if men are not accustomed to allow for elevation and other matters which are very relevant when judging distances at sea.</P>
    <P>But there are undoubtedly occasions when trawlers fish within our prohibited waters and, what is worse, when trawlers so engaged have been known quite ruthlessly to run down our fishermen and destroy their nets.  I share the Senator's view entirely that, over and above the strict economics of providing protection, our fishermen are as much entitled to expect the enforcement of the law within our territorial waters as any other citizen is entitled to expect the enforcement of the law on the roads and highways of the country.  I do not want to sound controversial, but the plain fact is that the naval equipment which we now have consists of motor torpedo boats and corvettes.  The motor torpedo boats have magnificently powerful engines which sweep them through the ocean at incredible speeds, but the hulls of the torpedo boats are built to stand about 100 hours' sailing, because they are extremely light.  They were originally designed for rapid incursion into naval battles and subsequent abandonment, having discharged their torpedoes. We are under the distressing obligation <Col N="1346" /> of not bringing them to sea at all, because if we bring them to sea on regular patrols they will shake themselves to pieces and ignominiously sink after a relatively short period of service.</P>
    <P>We were blessed with corvettes, but, unhappily, no one seems to have adverted to the fact when buying the corvettes that they draw so much water that there are only about three ports in the whole country into which you could bring them, and, as they are Diesel-engined, if you want to keep them in use you must keep the engine continually running, since, apparently, if the engine gets cold it takes about three hours to get hot enough again to get in motion.  But the engines consume Diesel oil at a parallel rate with an elephant's capacity for hay, so that if we are to keep the engines running awaiting the hour of summons, we might as well multiply the elephant population in the Zoo by about 20, as it would be a cheaper expedient.</P>
    <P>Plans are now under examination to persuade some more prosperous sovereignty to purchase these vessels, provided that with the proceeds we see our way to secure for our naval service vessels more adaptable to our requirements. In judging the adaptability of vessels in the future, due regard should be had to the use we will expect to make of them for fishery patrol in times of peace.  I hope that, before the end of this financial year, we shall have at our disposal fishery vessels sufficient to make available to any part of our coast an effective patrol within a very short time indeed of observers from the shore notifying the competent authority and asking that measures be taken to control any foreign trawler which seeks illegally to trawl within our waters.</P>

There is no proposal envisaged here for development or extension of existing services. In fact, in drafting these two Bills we have sought carefully to avoid, if I may say so, any progressive step.  Where amendment was necessary we have merely confined ourselves to corrections of what appeared to us to be faults.  Where anomalies had arisen, in the next Bill we have sought to <Col N="1349" /> reconcile them.  In the third Bill, we have sought to bring the fishery law up to the point where it is now.  With that before us.  I think it will become the duty, of the Minister for Fisheries to consider if any further progressive steps are required and, if they should be, to come before Oireachtas Éireann to that end; but there are no proposals in these Bills for any developmental step such as I think the Senator has in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to say that I am fairly well fraught with the means of providing Senators with a satisfactory answer.  There is a saving clause in respect of Section 13 of the Oyster Cultivation Ireland Bill, 1884, whereby the court may direct that forfeiture imposed in respect of trespass on a licensed oyster fishery be paid to the licensee or grantee for the improvement and cultivation of the said fishery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the proceeds are directed to the <Col N="1350" /> Exchequer, with the corresponding obligation on the Exchequer to redirect them to the grantee.  We have decided that in the uncommon case of a prosecution under the Act of 1884, where the penalty levied partakes of the nature of damage for trespass, that will continue to be the arrangement, and where the district justice declares a penalty, bearing in mind that it is for the benefit of the owner of the oyster fishery he will assess it on the damage done to the proprietor of the oyster fishery.  I hope that meets the inquiry raised by the Senator and by others.</P>

      <P>On the question of the disposal in these cases, I know from experience on many occasions that when equipment was seized or when boats entered the harbour and an order was made for the disposal of the gear, it was put up for auction and there being only one bidder the original owner got it back for much less than if he had been fined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Senator that that fact has engaged my attention. We are reviewing the position where machines are put up for auction, so that these people should not be in a privileged position.  If in fact, they get back the equipment at all they should only get it back by paying the full value.  It is a matter I think that we need not provide for by statute. Senators can rest assured that the matter is under review and that steps are being taken to ensure that what amounts to a fictitious auction will not take place in future.</P>

      <P>May I make a respectful submission to the Seanad?  These two Bills are tidying-up Bills.  I shall bring before the Seanad, so soon as these are disposed of, a codifying Bill which will contain all the fishery law in Ireland.  On that, of course, I shall be prepared to deal with fishery policy in its widest sense.  To admit a discussion of fishery policy on a Fisheries (Statute Law Revision) Bill I think <Col N="1352" /> the most resourceful Senator will find it extremely difficult to do because, I take it, the rules of relevance controlling the Seanad are analogous at least to those controlling Dáil Éireann and I have no doubt that we could have a very enjoyable discussion on fishery policy generally on the codifying Bill.  This is merely a definition Bill.  It really has no legislative effect in the usual sense of that word at all. It merely deals with such things as, for instance, where in one Act the words &ldquo;fishery engine&rdquo; have been used, in a second Act the words &ldquo;fishery instrument&rdquo; have been used and in a third Act the words &ldquo;fishery article&rdquo; have been used.  We declare that whenever these words appear we mean &ldquo;fishery engine&rdquo;.  That is the sole purpose of the Bill.  It is codifying.</P>

I, therefore, move the Adjournment of the House.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words on Section 8 of this Bill.  The Minister has said that on the whole there was no innovation of any kind in this Bill and that is clear, but it seems to me that Section 8 confers on the Minister powers which need the most elaborate and technical knowledge. He is permitted to &ldquo;authorise any named person at any season of the year to do one or any of the following things&rdquo; and so on.  For the purpose of administering this section he will have to make decisions of the greatest importance for the welfare of the <Col N="1353" /> fisheries of this country and it seems to me that a matter of general policy is involved here and perhaps I may be permitted to say a word or two on that.  It seems to me that the sturdy shoulders of the Minister for Agriculture are being burdened too heavily. It is a case of the willing horse being given most of the work.  I hasten to add that what I am going to say is no disparagement of the present Minister for Agriculture.  He has proved very clearly how fit he is to look after our land with energy, prudence, practical knowledge and, what is rare in agricultural matters, eloquence, but I do think that in the interests of the fisheries there is need for a separate Parliamentary Secretary and a separate Department for fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going through the numbers in the Department of Agriculture at the moment, I find that there are five officials looking after the harvest of the sea and over 100 looking after the harvest of the land.  It seems to me that something ought to be done to rectify the discrepancy there.  It is hardly fair to expect one Minister to look after the welfare of plough and prow, field and keel, sail and kale, wheat and fleet, udder and rudder, sugar beet and fishing fleet.  Did we not detect in the Minister in a speech on a previous Bill a certain diffidence and hesitancy about the rights of oysters in the case and a certain eagerness to have Bills put through rather faster than at an agricultural pace?  I may be wrong but in my opinion, and I know that many others share this opinion, fisheries do need a single Department of the Government. When we travel abroad and see the fine fishing market towns in France, Spain and Greece and see their harbours filled with fishing ships and turn to our own country and see our fish shops stocked more with flies than fish and our harbours filled with pleasure yachts or seaweed rather than fishing ships we can realise the need for such a Department.  The Minister has said that there is nothing progressive about these Bills and in that I entirely agree with him, but does he propose to present us with anything progressive in regard to the fishing policy in the near future?  I am quite certain that the only solution to the <Col N="1354" /> problems that the fisheries present very gravely, is a separate Department.  For example, it is almost impossible to buy fish except in Dublin or at one of our sea ports.  We need more trawlers and subsidies for trawlers: we need in other words a progressive policy.  If the fish in our seas&mdash;one of our most valuable foods &mdash; are to be harvested we must have a progressive policy.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister in his own interests and in the interests of the country to set up a separate Department to divide, as it were, the allocation of loaves from the allocation of fishes and to give us that progressive policy which he so eloquently declaimed in the early debate.</P>

      <P>Is ócáid an-tábhachtach í seo agus Bille i dtaobh na hiascaireachta a bheith os ár gcomhair.  Is gnáthach linn bheith ag smaoineamh ar thionscail thábhachtacha na tíre, tionscail a chuirfeas saothrú ar fáil agus a chuirfeas saibhreas ar fáil, tionscail a chuirfeas ar ár gcumas trádáil a dhéanamh, ní amháin sa mbaile, ach le tíortha thar sáile.</P>
      <P>Tá an talmhaíocht ar an gcéad cheann agus is dóigh liom gurb é an iascaireacht an dara ceann, má thugamuid faoi i gceart.  Tá margadh mór in Éirinn le haghaidh éisc má eagraítear an margadh agus ní amháin go bhfuil margadh againn ach d'fhéadfadh sé bheith amhlaidh má thugaimid faoi i gceart go mbainfimid margadh amach i dtíortha i gcéin, rud a bheadh soilíosach dúinn má tá sé indéanta. Mar gheall ar cheist seo na mara náisiúnta, sé sin le rá, an teorann cheithre mhíle, dúirt an tAire gur rud dainséarach ceisteanna den tsórt seo a lua.  Admhaím nach dtaithníonn le tíortha eile daoine a bheith ag cur isteach orthu, ach níor mhiste dhúinn inseacht do thíortha eile an spéis atá againn ins an gceist seo, agus inseacht dóibh chomh tábhachtach agus atá sé dúinne go ndéanfar réiteach ar an moladh agus, más féidir, é a dhéanamh chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom go gcuimhneodh an tAire ar chuid de na ceisteanna seo. Bhfuil aon scrúdú déanta aige i dtaobh iascaireachta na mara doimhne? Bhfuil aon tuairim aige nó an bhfuil <Col N="1355" /> aon fhiosrú déanta aige faoi céard is féidir linn a dhéanamh maidir le forás a chur ar an mbrainse sin de thionscal na hiascaireachta?  An bhfuil na fír againn oilte don iascaireacht, leis na báid a stiúradh agus leis an iascaireacht féin a dhéanamh?  Bhfuil aon fhiosrú déanta ar an taobh sin den scéal? Bhfuil aon bheartas ceaptha amach ag an Aire ina chóir sin?  Ar an chaoi chéana, tá scéal iascaireacht inbhir mí-shásúil.  Tá, ní amháin i nGaillimh ach ar fud na tíre, iascairí agus daoine nach iascairí iad, mí-shásta leis an tseilbh, leis an uachtaránacht, atá ag daoine áirithe príobháideacha ar an iascaireacht.  Níl fhios agam arb é leas na hiascaireachta go gcuirfí na daoine sin as seilbh nó a mhalairt, ach is ceist í a bhfuil a lán daoine sa tír ag machnamh agus ag caint uirthi agus ba mhaith leo treoir éigin údarásach ina taobh d'fháil.  Iascaireacht chladaigh nó éadoimhin, níl an scéal sin sásúil ach oiread.  Nuair a chuimhnaíos duine ar Chontae na Gaillimhe, áit a bhfuil suas agus anuas le cheithre chéad míle de chósta againn agus gan ann ach dornán beag daoine ag plé eis an iascaireacht agus ar éigin go bhfuighfí leath-chéad duine atá ag plé le hiascaireacht mar shlí bheatha, ní féidir a rá go bhfuil an scéal seo sásúil ann.  Leis an nganntanas atá ar bhiadh agus na tuairimí nua atá againn i dtaobh tábhacht bidh áirithe, is dóigh liom go bhfuil margadh anmhór ann don iasc má cuirtear ar fáil é agus má cuirtear ar fáil ar luachanna réasúnta é.  Ba chóir go mbeadh iascaireacht chladaigh anluachmhar agus níl fhios agam tar éis a bhfuil déanta ag Bord na nIascairí Mara an bhfuil rath ar an scéal an oiread agus ba cheart a bheith. Bhfuil an scéal sin scrúdaithe ag an Aire agus an bhfuil sé sásta go bhfuil an oiread déanta agus is féidir?  An dóigh leis gur féidir an brainse sin den tionnscal a fheabhsú thar mar atá?  Ar an chaoi chéanna, iascaireacht aibhne agus locha &mdash; tá fhios againn i nGaillimh an toradh maith atá ar an iarracht bheag atá déanta &mdash; agus níl ann ach iarracht bheag i ndeireadh na dála &mdash; maidir le síolrúchán bric i gcóir na loch.</P>
    <P>An méid atá déanta anseo agus an <Col N="1356" /> méid atá déanta in áiteacha eile an fianaise sáthach maith é gur féidir níos mó a dhéanamh ar an mbealach sin?  An dócha gur iarracht é gur fiú a chothú agus a leathnú agus dá réir sin tairbhe luachmhar an bhrainse sin den iascaireacht a chur chun cinn. Níl fhios agam an bhfuil aon mhachnamh déanta aige i dtaobh oiliúint, i dtaobh tréanáil, daoine i gcóir an tionscail.  Tá fhios agam le blianta go bhfuil scoltacha éagsúla ar bun sa tír gurb é a gcuspóir cuidiú le mairnéalaaigh oilte a chur ar fáil.  I nGaillimh, tá scoil seoltóireachta againn mar bhrainse den ghairm-scoil agus i mBaile Atha Cliath agus i gCorcaigh is dóigh liom tá scoltacha speisialta eile.  Tá cúpla scoil ag obair agus sé an chuspóir atá acu daoine d'oiliúint i gcóir na mairnéalachta, ach is léir nach leor sin má tá aon tuairim againn gur féidir an tionscal seo a leathnú. Más linn cabhlach cheart, láidir, bheith againn le dul amach ar an doimhin chomh maith leis an éadoimhin, níl aon mhaith bheith ag caint air go dtí go mbeidh na daoine ullamh chun na hoibre, agus ba mhaith linn léargas d'fháil ar an scéal seo chun go bhfeádfadh na daoine óga a shocrú dóibh féin an fiú dóibh dul isteach ar an mbrainse sin ceardaíochta le súil go bhfuighdís slí bheatha as an iascaireacht. Tá fhios agam nach bhfuil se furasta na daoine a mhealladh. Tá roinnt scoláireachtaí le fáil ag daoine óga chun dul isteach in sna scoltacha sin ach níl aon fhonn ró-mhór orthu glacadh leo agus an fáth atá leis an éiginnteacht atá ann ó thaobh an tionscail.</P>
    <P>Mar gheall ar an iascaireacht mhídhlisteanach, is baolach go bhfuil cuid mhaith de ar siúl.  Deireann an tAire gur deacair go minic a rá an bhfuil beart mí-dhlisteanach ar bun ag bád seachas bád eile.  Cinnte, má thagann bád isteach agus rud éigin ar cearr léi maidir le cabhail nó maidir le goireas, ba cheart gurbh fhurasta é sin d'fháil amach.  Ba cheart go mbféidir seilbhéirí bheith ann sna priomh-chaladhphoirt agus go dtiocfaidis uair ar bith is gá é ag scrúdú na mbád a fhógraíos go bhfuil briseadh éigin nó damaíste éigin orthu.</P>
    <P>Thug an tAire míniú dhuínn ar <Col N="1357" /> chomh mí-oiriúnach agus tá cuid de na bád atá againn faoi láthair le cosaint cheart a thabhairt don iascaireacht. Níl a fhios agam ar thug an tAire cothrom na Feínne do na baíd agus do na fir atá i mbun na mbád agus an dóigh ar labhair sé orthu.  An t-am a cheannaigh an tír seo na báid &mdash; torpedo boats agus corvettes &mdash; ceannaíodh iad le haghaidh cuspóirí seachas cosaint a thabhairt don iascaireacht.  Ní dóigh liom go n-abróidh aon duine gur báid iad atá feiliúnach le haghaidh na hoibre atá ar intinn ag an Aire.  Más dóigh linn go bhfuil na báid sin as maith mar bháid chosanta don tír, díolaimis iad, ach níor ceannaíodh iad le go mbeidís mar bháid chosanta i gcóir na hiascaireachta. Más dóigh leis an Aire gur féidir dó báid níos feiliúnaí d'fháil le haghaidh cosanta na hiascaireachta ceannaíodh sé iad agus beidh beannacht gach duine air.</P>
    <P>Thairis sin ní dóigh liom gur gá a thuille a rá i dtaobh an Bhille. Mhínigh an tAire cuspóirí an Bhille agus tá mé sásta nach féidir linn agus nach gá dhúinn mion-chur síos a dhéanamh uirthi anois ó alt go halt ach ba mhaith liom go háirithe, ós rud é go bhfuil Alt a 8 curtha síos ar an mbealach atá, go gcuimhneodh an tAire ar na ceisteanna atá mé tar éis a lua agus má tá ar a chumas, freagra a thabhairt dom &mdash; ní hé amháin freagra díreach ar na ceisteanna seo ach léargas éigin a thabhairt dúinn faoi céard is dóigh leis i dtaobh na hiascaireachta san am atá le teacht, beimid buíoch de.</P>

      <P>It would be helpful, and a great many people would be very interested, if the Minister would give his views on the several very important points raised by Senator Stanford.  Many people have spoken to me about fish since I became a member of the Seanad, on the same lines as Senator Stanford.  The complaint of many people seems to be that there is a very inadequate supply of fish in the country, and that the price of fish is very high in comparison with other foods of similar value and in comparison with the price of fish in Britain.  A statement by the Minister as to what he intends to do to <Col N="1358" /> rectify this position would be welcomed by many people.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to give some information as to what he proposes to do with the cot net fishermen who were precluded from fishing on the River Suir under the last Act of the Oireachtas.  These men have been deprived of the means of earning their livelihood in the manner of the vocation of themselves and their fathers, and no compensation of any sort has been given to them. I would like the Minister to give us some information as to his intention of treating these men.  Many of them are now old and it is time someone drew attention to it, as they are in a dire state and many of them are objects of charity.  Their numbers are not large and I think that, when action was taken to improve the fishing industry and these people suffered in so doing, the State should be able to give them some compensation for their loss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Orpen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not think it advisable to clear up the misunderstanding throughout the country as to his policy regarding fish, as it seems to be a complete reversal of his land policy where he believes in modern methods and efficiency.  When it comes to fish he leaves out the efficiency and continues on prehistoric methods.  I should like him to repeat what he has said elsewhere about retaining the inshore fishermen and excluding the trawler.  I would like him to justify that policy in the light of the fact that over a large part of Ireland it is impossible to get fish at any time of the year.  It should be possible to devise a scheme whereby the deep sea trawler could be used in some areas to supplement the inadequate supplies provided by those who have been styled part-time fishermen and part-time farmers.  I have been informed that men who previously were inshore fishermen and came from such families are now working as deck hands on trawlers functioning from Milford Haven, as they found that a more satisfactory life.  On more that one occasion people have asked me whether it would be possible to start a small fleet of trawlers <Col N="1359" /> under our Flag for our own coast, but up to the present these prospective trawler fleet promoters do not seem quite satisfied that they will be permitted to land their fish and sell it here.  I would welcome a comprehensive statement from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I would like to avail of the occasion to direct the Minister's attention to the grievances of some of my constituents who suffer from being denied the right to fish in certain stretches of the Moy, which they maintain have been leased to a private individual.  They fish for sport and have spent a certain amount of money on equipment and maintain at least two hatcheries at their own expense.  Some time ago, a party of them discussed this with me, saying that during the time of the late Government they directed a communication to the Department responsible stating that they were prepared to onerate themselves with the responsibility of looking after the fishery in certain stretches of this river and pointing out what they had done to increase the supply of fresh water fish through hatcheries.  They maintain they were replied to only after seven months and that within that period the fishing rights of that particular stretch were handed over to a private individual. There may be other such cases in Mayo and I would like an answer to that question.  I was not asked to raise it, but I am satisfied the Minister will see that the reasonable and legitimate desires of these people are catered for, in any future legislation he introduces into the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not under the impression that this was an occasion on which the Seanad would gladly hear a discussion of fishery policy at large.  It is sometimes difficult for a member of the other House to call to mind the fact that a subject which has been eagerly canvassed in the Dáil and dealt with very exhaustively has not been brought to the attention of the members of the Seanad.  Having an understanding heart, I accept Senator Professor Stanford's gracious observations in the spirit in which they are uttered.  I do not know that it is <Col N="1360" /> always complimentary, no matter how gracefully phrased, to be told that the best service one could do the nation would be to hand one's Department over to somebody else, but I can understand that it is a perfectly fair and legitimate view that there should be a Minister for Fisheries, a Minister for Agriculture, a Minister for Local Government, a Minister for Health, and that this combination of functions is calculated to do disservice to one or other of the Departments the Minister is charged to take care of.  However, I would be dismayed if so responsible a Senator as Senator Stanford felt on reflection that he was justified in laying at my door the charge of failure to operate a progressive policy in the Department of Fisheries.</P>
      <P>On the 20th and 21st May, in Dáil Éireann, the Estimate for the Department of Fisheries was discussed and I there expounded a policy, to which strong exception was taken by certain Deputies; and after a pretty vigorous debate going on for two days, I adhered to the views I had originally expressed and had the invigorating experience of actually making a convert.  That is one of the most interesting things that ever happened in the history of this Parliament, because, as you all know, converts are as rare, not as white blackbirds but as pink blackbirds.  One member actually waited on me and said that before the debate he had taken one view and by the time the debate was over he had actually changed his mind.  So, fired by that success, I propose now to start on Senator Stanford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal of well-intentioned talk about the desirability of modern methods for deep-sea trawling, and the necessity to provide big quantities of fish for the vast market that exists in Ireland.  Let us take these anxious one after another.  Is there a market for fish in Ireland?  I have forehand advantage of many Senators, because I was for a considerable time a rural fishmonger.  The only reason I got out of it was that nobody would buy fish.  Try to sell fish in any rural town in Ireland on any day except Friday and reckon up your profits at the end of the week's trading. It is true that you may sell some fish, but you will not sell enough to realise <Col N="1361" /> the cost of burying the fish you did not sell.  Where are the fishmongers in rural Ireland clamouring for supplies of fish and unable to get them? Does any Senator know of any fishmongers that have closed down thriving businesses in rural Ireland because they could not get fish to supply the streams of customers they turned disappointedly away?  Let us face realities.</P>
    <P>In normal times there never was any difficulty in getting supplies of fish, if you knew how to go about it.  You rang up a wholesaler and asked him to send you fish and he sent it.  I regret to say that in my experience it is only when the fish arrived that your troubles began.  I think most people who made the effort in rural Ireland will tell the same story.  Our people are not a fish eating people. They do not like fish.  I have been taken to task severely for saying what I conceived it my duty to say.  I did not believe it to be any part of my duty to persuade anybody that he should eat this or eat that.  I think when a free man has earned a week's wages by the sweat of his brow he is quite entitled to eat what he likes. My view is that anybody who wants fish should be able to get fish, and I charge myself with the duty of seeing that any Irish fisherman who catches fish will have a market in which he will have a profit.  When Senator Ó Buachalla states that there is a large market for fish in Ireland which we were failing to fill, I only wish there were&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think what I asked was whether the Minister had investigated the possibility of the market here, the possibility of the market abroad and, in view of the information collected, to divulge the policy he had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is that I closely investigated the potentiality of the market in a restricted area, but that personal experience, of course, could not influence my activities as a Minister.  I have made and continue to make inquiries on the potential domestic market and the revelations are not encouraging.  None the less, the limited nature of the domestic market, I think, may, in fact, be deemed to <Col N="1362" /> be a blessing in some way, because if the existing demand were very greatly in excess of the inshore fishermen's ability to supply, assuming maximum effort with available equipment, the Minister for Fisheries would be in a very difficult position; whereas my policy will be far easier of realisation on a market containing the potentiality of a demand growing in step with our development of inshore fishing, rather than on an existing market clamorous for supplies far in excess of our maximum capacity to supply.</P>
      <P>The Senator deplored the fact that we had no coal-burning trawlers for deep-sea fishing.  What do Senators mean by trawling?  Must it be a boat trawling for fish or a boat with smoke out of the funnel, bobbing up and down in the sea?  What virtue is there in a ship with smoke from the funnel over the ship that has not?  I often wonder if people who interest themselves enthusiastically in fishery matters ever try to see what they are aiming at. I know what I am aiming at.  I think most people who understand the fishery situation in this country agree that we can do one of two things.  We can either invite all and sundry into the fishing trade of Ireland or we can make up our minds that we are going to reserve the domestic market for fish for the 10,000 part-time and whole-time inshore fishermen.  It is important to remember that, when you think of those 10,000 men, the part-time men amongst them avail of fishing to add that modicum to the income they derive from their land which they would otherwise have to seek by migratory labour.  If this Oireachtas ever makes up its mind to wipe out the inshore fishermen in the holy cause of modern efficiency let them remember that it is an irrevocable decision.  If their way of life is brought to an end it can never be revived.  They will be scattered; their families will be scattered; their homes will become uneconomic &mdash; and an independent, self-supporting, dignified section of our community overnight will become a virtually insoluble social problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I entered public life first I represented County Donegal, which was very largely a constituency of fishermen.  I have no doubt at all that <Col N="1363" /> to preserve the inshore fishermen should be the primary purpose of the Department of Fisheries in this country and, so long as I am Minister for Fisheries, that will be the purpose of my Ministry.  It is entirely illusory to imagine that you can have trawling on the Grimsby, Norwegian or Icelandic model based on this country side by side with the inshore fisherman's industry.  Large trawlers such as are employed by these countries must, for their profitable operation, bring home substantial hauls.  Their very size demands that.  The landing of those hauls in Ireland at once provides, not only a sufficiency for the domestic market, but a substantial surplus which must be exported.  The justification for the existence of such a company is the building up of an export trade to consume the surplus catch. You cannot have a surplus until you have a sufficiency at home, but it is on the sufficiency at home that the inshore fisherman depends for his existence, and if you postulate the saturation of the domestic market before the steam trawler company begins to make profit, must you not postulate the elimination of the inshore fishermen?  I postulate the prohibition of the steam trawler and the protection of the inshore fishermen.  Both these views are perfectly legitimate.  One is not the quintessence of patriotism and the other a foreign heresy, but they are two diametrically opposed views for both of which a case can be made, but one of which I hold with profound conviction, and it is right that the Seanad should know that so long as I am Minister for Fisheries it is a view which I intend vigorously to prosecute.  Therefore, so long as I am Minister for Fisheries, no trawling company operating steam trawlers will be licensed to operate in this country.  I have already turned down four or five applications from foreign companies which were prepared to have part Irish capital, and even Irish companies, who desired to build up a fleet to saturate the domestic market and have some for export. Quite deliberately I have refused to <Col N="1364" /> license any company for such operations in this country and will continue to do so.  I think that an absolutely essential concomitant to that policy is that the consumer will be assured an adequate supply of good fish at a reasonable price and unless the inshore fisherman is equipped, and is himself willing to work hard to fill that requirement, neither he nor I can hope successfully to maintain the policy which I am at present concerned to defend. I am convinced that we can so equip him and that, given the equipment, he will deliver the goods and I think that it is eminently worth taking whatever measures may be requisite to bridge the interval required for his equipment and adequate training so that the market may be preserved intact for the inshore fisherman when he is fitted to fill it.</P>
    <P>To that end, therefore, I propose to reconstitute the Sea Fisheries Association on the lines of a co-operative representative of the inshore fishermen. That done, no one, other than the Sea Fisheries Association, will be licensed to land fish in Ireland.  The first objective of the Sea Fisheries Association will be to supply the demand from the fish caught and landed by our own fishermen operating their own boats.  In so far as lacunae may occur, owing to unforeseen circumstances in the continuity of supply, I propose to authorise the inshore fishermen's co-operative to purchase fish abroad and fill that gap. It may be a gap of two days or four days or, in exceptional circumstances, a week or ten days in the earlier stages. Therefore, the first duty of the Sea Fisheries Association is to provide whatever is required.  Remember, we have two problems &mdash; demersal fish and pelagic fish and they are very remarkably different problems.  The second duty of the Sea Fisheries Association is to provide the fishermen with boats and gear of types suitable for their particular kind of fishing on terms which it is possible for them to pay, and of a quality which will guarantee their ability to do the job if they are prepared to do the work.  To that end, we are purchasing every 50-foot boat that will be produced in all the boat <Col N="1365" /> yards in Ireland this year and seeking to purchase 20 more boats of that size engined and equipped in foreign boat yards.  Heretofore, our men had used 30-foot and 40-foot boats.  We are now concentrating on producing 50-foot boats and we are contemplating by way of experiment, procuring one or two 60-foot and, I think, 75-foot boats with a view to testing out whether vessels larger that the 50-foot boat, which is recorded as being the largest used by our men, would be more economical and more efficient.  It is by no means certain that they would. Up to this year we have found very great difficulty in getting any gear. That difficulty, I am glad to say, is beginning to grow less.  Gear is still a problem, but I foresee that at a reasonably early date the supply will be adequate to our requirements.</P>
    <P>Under existing conditions it is now virtually true to say with regard to all varieties of demersal fish that the fisherman knows what he is going to get before he goes out and our aim is regarding demersal fish to provide, once the fisherman returns, that the door to the market is open.  His pay and his market are our problem and when I say &ldquo;our&rdquo; problem I mean the Sea Fisheries Association.  There are seasonal exceptions with regard to whiting, but even in those seasonal periods of exception it is open to the men to go further afield and bring in the type of fish for which there is a guaranteed price.</P>
    <P>With regard to pelagic fish, herring and mackerel, there are a great many people, I venture to say, who labour under the illusion that vast surpluses of herrings are habitually hauled ashore and cast back into the sea &mdash; a complete illusion.  At the present moment our difficulty is that we cannot get enough herring.  Unfortunately the ways of fish are unpredictable and sometimes there is more herring than you can conveniently handle and again there is none to be had at all.  To meet that situation, however, we are, I hope, successfully promoting a canned herring industry for which there will be, I believe, a larger market abroad than there is at home.  The Sea Fisheries Association will regard it as their duty to supply <Col N="1366" /> the canners with the fish they want when they want them rather than to tell the canners to be grateful for whatever fish they get whether it is at a time they want them or not.</P>
    <P>We have recently had a trade delegation in Germany hopefully trying to sell fish.  I do not deny that I experienced some disappointment when I heard from the officials of my Department that when with sparkling eyes they announced that they were in a position to offer fish to the hungry citizens of the German Republic they were met with howls of horror that they were already inundated with fish.  I think there might be found in that company one to rival my indiscretion by saying that he hated the very sight of fish as they have so much of it.  Not in the least deterred, we are trying to find another market.  It is not so easy to get because when we have fish it very commonly happens that everybody else has fish.  Mackerel is a fish which, as many Senators here know, on our south-west coast arrives on occasion in uncontrollable shoals.  Can any Senator tell me where I can sell mackerel? Because I would be very ready and willing to send someone to any market any Senator cares to name to me to sell mackerel and we are quite prepared to follow the vaguest rumour of a market.  We cannot find one to date but we are still trying.  There was a time when we had a very good market in Hamburg and New England for pickled mackerel.  There was a time when Castletownberehaven depended very largely on the mackerel, but mackerel is very hard to sell now.  If it were not, we have plenty of mackerel, plenty of fishermen, plenty of people well able to deal with it and we would take a very competitive price.</P>
    <P>I often wonder what do people who have a really public-spirited and disinterested solicitude for the fishing industry imagine that the controlling officers of the Sea Fisheries Association spend their time at.  Surely it is ordinary human nature, if people have chosen to make their career in the service of fishermen and the fishing industry, to want to make a success of it.  It is the very odd man who philosophically consecrates his life to being <Col N="1367" /> a failure and a dud.  If you have to work eight hours a day you might just as well try to cut a figure and be a success as painfully and laboriously to earn the reputation of being a dud. Why do people cheerfully assume that everybody whose life is given to fishery interests, whose career depends on the successful development of fisheries, whose living and sleeping interest is the promotion of fisheries, in fact knows &ldquo;sweet Fanny Adams&rdquo; about it and cares less?  It is quite amusing.  The officers of the Ministry in charge of fisheries and the Minister who presides over it are poor creatures no doubt, but at least they are interested. They do their modest best and they do energetically seek any market where their wares may be sold even if they can only break even.  I beg Senators to believe that simply because those whom Oireachtas Eireann have put in charge of the Department responsible for fisheries were born in Ireland, that in itself is not synonymous with their being incompetent fools.  It is an interesting thing that the much-despised officials of that Department are consulted not infrequently by wiseacres who control the destinies of fishery departments in various parts of the world.  Mind you, I wonder when people speak lightly of the desirability of trawl and the indispensability of trawl do they ever ask themselves where is Great Britain at present with her fishing?  She cannot bring in enough herself to provide for her own people.  Who is to fill the gap &mdash; the Danish fishing fleet?  How many trawlers have they?  None.  What is the bulk of their fishing fleet?  Fifty-foot boats.  They have modelled their policy on the lines of the Irish Sea Fisheries Association.  How many Senators are aware of that fact?  Is it not an interesting thing that public representatives in this country see no inconsistency in saying that we cannot possibly fish successfully unless we equip ourselves with vessels that would enable our fishermen to travel to the Norwegian and Spanish coasts and to other fishing grounds but on the other hand we have those same public representatives <Col N="1368" /> complaining that foreign trawlers are invading our fishing grounds?  Those foreign trawlers would not come there if it was not worth their while to fish off the South Cork coast and other places.  If it is worth their while should it not be equally worth the while of our fishermen to go out from Berehaven?  Why is it if the fishing grounds around Ireland are an attraction to foreign trawlers of many nations seeking the prey here, that if it is not worth their while to go elsewhere and why, if they can find it profitable, is it considered that the same salt water is incapable of contributing a herring's tail to Irish fishermen? What consistency is there in that?  I can never understand that situation.</P>
    <P>Our purpose in any case is so to equip our fishermen that they can go where it best pays them to go in search of whatever quality of fish they can earn the best profit on in the knowledge that there is a guaranteed market for whatever fish they bring in.</P>
    <P>I have told you we are building boats in Ireland.  We have rebuilt the yard at Meevagh and at Killybegs and shall equip one at Dingle and we will soon probably develop one in South Cork. We aim to produce from our own yards all the boats our men require.  I believe we will meet their requirements from whatever sources boats can be got until such times as our own yards are capable of meeting the demand. We shall supply all the gear that is needed.  It is a remarkable thing that after the last war nearly all the fishermen were bankrupt and a high percentage of those debts had to be written off as bad.  We do not anticipate that even 5 per cent. of those now owing money will default because the men are able to pay out of the money they are able to make.</P>
    <P>In the matter of the shell-fishing industry, I hope that the reconstituted Sea Fisheries Association will take this under control.  I was born and reared in what must have been a very conservative atmosphere but as I grow older I move further to the left.  I am sorry to say that the more we have to do with the <i>entrepreneur</i> the more apparent it becomes that there are simple people available for exploitation <Col N="1369" /> and you will always have a few hyenas sniffing around to try and get in on the job.  Perhaps I have a jaundiced view.  If I have I am afraid that is the view the Department of Fisheries is going to have and the shell-fishing exports of this country will be substantially handled and controlled by the Sea Fisheries Association acting on behalf of the fishermen who catch the fish.  I do not say that that will exclude those desirous of engaging in the business but at some stage the Department will intervene to ensure that the man who catches the fish will get paid for it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into more detail than that, for if I did, I could tell the Seanad a strange story, but as this is an incident of yesteryear, I will not go into it now in detail.</P>
    <P>The Seanad has brought this upon its own head.  They asked for a statement on fishery policy and they are going to get it lock, stock and barrel, and I have only just begun.</P>
    <P>That relates to the beginning of the Department's policy on sea fishing. We turn now to the question of our inland fisheries.  They are of great importance and I must tell the Seanad, with great respect, that they constitute a subject on which a great deal of rubbish has been talked from time to time.  To begin with, in the Dáil ten years ago, an Act was passed by my predecessor providing that certain rights in freshwater fishing would be extinguished at the beginning of 1948. This matter was referred to by Senator Denis Burke.  In the extinguishing of these fishing rights on these waters, I am providing for adequate compensation for everyone injured in the process of extinction.  As is so often the case, even with a degree of anticipatory intelligence you cannot foresee every kind of case that will arise.  It was never the intention, when the legislation was before the Oireachtas, to imply that it could not be amended if difficulties arose.  Very soon it became evident that some small classes of persons who manifestly were entitled to compensation were not covered by the provision made. Senator D. Burke may reassure the people on whose behalf he spoke that they constitute, so far as I can see, <Col N="1370" /> one small category of many who will be provided for on terms no less favourable than those provided in the original Act, but it is undoubtedly better that we should wait a little to see the whole picture of those who have been left out by the general terms originally employed, so that when we come to amend the original legislation, we may do so with some degree of finality.  In any case, the Oireachtas will be asked to make whatever provision was then made retrospective to put it on a ground of equality with the compensation provided in the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>When you come to deal with the development of fresh water fisheries you can get as many opinions as there are men, and all of them respectable. It is not an exact science.  Ask the best of the experts, the most experienced men, what they would do on any given river or lake for its improvement, and I think it is true to say that you will get as many opinions as you meet consultants.  That being so, I am not in the least dismayed.  I propose to try them all, one after the other. Many people advocate the removal of coarse fish from a trout lake which is declining, and others will tell you that to remove all the coarse fish will result in a multiplication of the trout population, and a situation will arise in which all the fish are three inches long and are there in great multitude.  I propose to adopt the middle course and to remove half the coarse fish, and, on another lake, to remove one-quarter by the simple method of taking all out and putting three-quarters back again.</P>
    <P>I can see no approach except the pragmatic approach, of experiment, of trial and error, and that we propose to adopt.  Do not imagine for a moment that we have allowed ourselves to be driven to the pragmatic approach for want of research &mdash; far from it.  I suppose the Lough Leven trout lakes of Scotland are probably regarded as the very centre of learning in all matters of trout fisheries, and there we have had our officers for varying terms to learn all that could be learned and bring it home.  We are quite prepared to send our officers anywhere else in <Col N="1371" /> the world where we believe knowledge or information is to be gleaned.  We are in no way proud.  We are always willing to learn and are not infrequently flattered to discover that there are people in the world who think they can learn from us.  I can reassure the Seanad that there is no body in the world has so low an opinion of the Irish Department of Fisheries as Seanad Éireann or Dáil Éireann.  I suppose it is common experience that no man is a prophet in his own land, but it will be a consolation to Oireachtas Eireann to know that our reputation outside the country is not as bruised and battered as it appears to be at home.</P>
    <P>There are others who tell you that the P.H. content of water gravely affects the fish population of a river. We are not a bit proud.  We have hung a bag of lime in a river to see what the result would be.  We are taking other devices to alter the P.H. of the water in fishery rivers to see what the result would be.  There are others who will tell you that the correct provision of spawning beds in existing lakes contributes to an improvement.  We do not believe it, but there are certain earnest anglers' associations in this country who hold that view most strongly.  We think they are wrong, but we have built the spawning beds and we have built them in the way they want them built, and we shall be delighted if we discover that they are right and we are wrong, and be most grateful for their instruction.  If there is any other responsible body of anglers in this country who have any rational proposal to make to our Department of Fisheries, designed to improve the fishing in their river or any other river or lake they know of, they have only to send us a ½d. postcard, and, if it is within our capacity to try out their plan or help them in any other way, we shall be happy to do so, because we are longing for the opportunity.</P>
    <P>Has any Senator ever met anyone who approached the Department of Fisheries with a proposal that approximated to the rational who was not enthusiastically received and who did not get a reasonable and gratifying <Col N="1372" /> measure of co-operation?  It is quite an illusion to imagine that the Department is like an ivory tower into which no man may penetrate and in which no voice of counsel has ever been heard for the past half century.  Surely those who feel that the chill of death is descending upon us in the Department will at least pay us the compliment of paying us a visit.  It is harsh judgement to say that a man is dead but he will not lie down, if you have never even seen him, and it seems irrational to complain that nothing is being done, if you have never asked.  I want to put this test and by it let the Department be judged.</P>
    <P>Everything we know that can be done for the improvement of our inland fisheries is in the process of being done and will go on being done.  Ours is the pragmatic approach.  We have no desire to condemn any proposal put forward rationally and responsibly on purely theoretical grounds.  We are conscious of how inexact a science to date the development of fresh water fisheries undoubtedly is.  We will be grateful to any responsible anglers' association or individuals interested in fisheries who will come to us with any proposal.  Do not let him be afraid to come and say he heard it from his grandfather's grandfather, because there is a wealth of wisdom in the pishrogues of rural Ireland.  If it has not been tried before, and if it offers a new angle on an existing problem, we are quite prepared to try it.</P>
    <P>Where does the Department of Fisheries fail in its desire to serve either its employer or the interests of the industry it is charged to serve? What can it do that it is not doing? There is nothing being left undone for the want of means &mdash; nothing at all. If there is anything which any Senator has to suggest that should be done, with the prospect of serving a useful purpose, we can put it in hand forthwith, but we cannot guarantee that every poacher in Ireland will certainly be illuminated with the grace of the Holy Ghost and give up poaching.  Can any Senator?  Unless he can, there is one problem the solution of which would make a very real contribution to the development of fisheries.  I <Col N="1373" /> have appointed a multitude of water bailiffs and in other areas I have appointed every poacher in the district. They belong to every Party in the State and there was no suggestion of political preference.  There is no lack of versatility in the Department of Fisheries and we are prepared to have recourse to any device that will stop poaching.  There is a certain sum that may be used for preventive purposes. You may appoint a number of vigilant and active water bailiffs, paying them a substantial fee &mdash; actually, the appointment is done by a board of conservators, and submitted for approval to me &mdash; or you may appoint the poachers and have all the poachers go out and watch one another.  Both devices have been known to serve in the appropriate locale, both have been approaved by me, and if there is any other device within the four corners of the criminal law for deterring poachers we will be prepared to try it.</P>
    <P>I know there are certain Senators who are saying now within themselves: &ldquo;Tch, tch, I wish the Minister would not be so flamboyant, saying he approves of appointing all the poachers.&rdquo;  I did, quite literally, and if that is flamboyant it is just too bad. I would do it again to-morrow, if I thought that was the best way to stop poaching.  There is no use in pretending that our people are the kind who respectfully bow the head when you read the book of law and warn them they are all very bad boys if they do not conform to it.  We are not a very law-abiding people and I am not so sure that that is a bad thing.  We have so high a passion for individual liberty that we have been known to carry it too far.  Better to carry it too far than to carry devotion to discipline too far. The middle road is ideal, but if there be deflections, God grant that in this country they should always be on the side of individual liberty.  Therefore, we are not in the least afraid of unprecedented devices, always within the four corners of the criminal law, to abate any evil that exists.  Since the very unorthodoxy of these revelations to Senators will embolden the more diffident of your number to make suggestions to the Department of Fisheries <Col N="1374" /> for additional exertions, may I appeal to Senator Stanford to make his contribution to Thalassa?  I await it with interest and it may be made <i>per se</i> or <i>per alia.</i></P>
    <P>I was gravely taken to task in another place by those who had expert knowledge to commend their views. I demurred.  I was reassured that the views expressed were sustained by expert advice and I asked the experts to come and see me.  I treasure the letter which I received from them after the interview, to say that they thought I was perfectly right.  Could it be that if Senator Professor Stanford comes, flanked by experts, I should have a trinity of conversion? If I had, that fortunate coincidence of name would entitle it to respect.  I would value it very highly, for I would feel that it was a disinterested judgment honestly given by public-spirited men.  No Minister can be sustained by more valuable assistance.</P>
    <P>Senator Orpen speaks of my devotion to efficiency on the land and antediluvian methods on the sea.  No, I do not think one has to make smoke in order not to be antediluvian.  This passion for trawlers that make smoke may be found ultimately to be an antediluvian view.  I have no doubt that the natives in darkest Africa would be much impressed by a ship that made smoke, while one that went along under its own power without any noise at all would be quite a familiar object. I suppose we would say then that their devotion to ships that made smoke demonstrated how little removed from cave men they were.  Who said to-day that inshore fishermen were leaving their homes and found themselves happier and better occupied on trawlers sailing from Grimsby?  Was it Senator Orpen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so.  But I must say that anything I saw of trawling led me to believe that the conditions under which the men worked were as disagreeable industrial conditions as it is possible to imagine.  It is a standard <Col N="1375" /> of life and a standard of values as remote from our people as any standard I could conceive, and I doubt if it has very much changed.  However, it is not on sentimental or romantic grounds that I reject it.  I reject it on the very clear, plain and incontrovertible grounds I have put before the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Senators will realise that I have only touched the fringe of this problem. They will find a good deal more in Volume 115 of the Dáil Debates, Booklets Nos. 14 and 15.  If that fails to slake their thirst for knowledge, I invite any Senator here to pay us the compliment of writing down any query which occurs to him or which he has heard perplexing others.  We will esteem it a privilege to give him a full and comprehensive answer, as we see it.  We will welcome it if he can prove us mistaken and show us a better way. We mean that quite sincerely.  There is one thing that troubles us a little, though, and that is when our employers, without even taking the trouble to make our acquaintance, ask us if we have not heard the universal proclamation that we are dead but we will not lie down.  We do not think we are dead and we are not going to lie down.  We do not despair of performing minor miracles of restoring the fishing industry; and we do not even despair of performing the major miracle of persuading our own employers to give us a fair chance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to confer on certain local authorities, namely county borough councils, county councils and urban district councils powers to carry out works affording relief or protection from flooding, landslide, subsidence or other similar occurrences.</P>
      <P>These powers are conferred on them by Section 2 of the Bill &mdash; the other sections are either ancillary or consequential. The powers which are conferred can be divided into two classes. The first power is one enabling local authorities to execute such works as they consider reasonable for the protection or relief from flooding, landslide or subsidence of land owned by them, or any permanent construction which they are required by law to maintain, that is any road, bridge, house, building, wall or embankment.  In short, it gives them the power to protect what might be loosely described as their own property.</P>
      <P>At first sight it may seem unnecessary to confer such powers on local authorities.  Unfortunately, they cannot do these works as the law stands at present.  In many counties the periodic flooding of roads is the cause of serious inconvenience.  Rivers or streams which run alongside or under roads get swollen when there is a heavy or continuous rainfall.  The floods in some cases remain for a considerable time.  The remedy for this flooding is often very simple, consisting, perhaps, in the removal of obstruction such as tree trunks, silt or rocks, to the flow of the water, the widening or deepening of the bed of the stream for some distance on either side of a bridge, or the building of a retaining wall or embankment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes bridges are endangered by an accumulation of silt under the eyes of the bridge.  Notwithstanding the damage that may be caused to roads or bridges, local authorities have been advised by their own legal advisers that they cannot carry out these works.  They cannot carry out works outside the structure of the road itself.  They can spend public money on the fabric of the bridge, but <Col N="1377" /> they cannot clean the bed of the river flowing under the arches.  They are compelled to look on helplessly while roads and bridges built at great expense to the ratepayers are damaged and traffic on roads held up &mdash; all because of legal difficulties.</P>
    <P>Local authorities can, under powers conferred on them in 1851, force landowners to open drains from the road into their lands but in many cases this is not sufficient.  The land immediately surrounding the road might be higher than the level of the road, or the stream or drain in which the water flows in the surrounding land might be choked or blocked.  The local authority cannot enter the lands bordering a road to clear a stream which causes flooding on the road and, in most cases, on the land through which it flows. In so far, therefore, as roads and other local authority property are concerned, it will be conceded that the powers conferred by this Bill are long overdue.</P>
    <P>The second power which is given to local authorities in the Bill is that which enables them to execute works for the protection or relief from flooding, landslide, subsidence or other similar occurrence of lands not owned by them or a permanent construction which they are not required by law to maintain if they consider that it is in the public interest to do so.  Permanent construction is defined in Section I as including roads, bridges, houses, buildings, walls or embankments.  The word &ldquo;road&rdquo; is also defined as meaning any road, whether public or private.</P>
    <P>This will give power to local authorities to relieve flooding of houses and lands in urban and rural areas.  Very often one sees groups of houses or a large expanse of land subjected to periodic flooding.  There is no need for me to elaborate on the hardships which such periodic flooding causes.  It is heart-breaking to see people having to evacuate their houses year after year because of flooding.  When they do get back to their houses they have to try to dry them out and replace or repair their belongings.  The remedy for this type of flooding is, perhaps, <Col N="1378" /> beyond the resources of the persons concerned, but under the powers conferred by the Bill a local authority may undertake works for the alleviation of such flooding if they decide that it is in the public interest that they should do so.  Local authorities will have the advice of their engineers as to whether or not the flooding can be remedied.</P>
    <P>The works which a local authority may do under the powers conferred on them are described in sub-section (4) of Section 2 as including such things as the making of drains, the removal of obstructions in watercourses, the widening or deepening of watercourses, and the diversion of water into watercourses.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill gives power to one local authority to carry out works on behalf of another local authority in certain circumstances.  There are two parts to it.  The first part deals with the case where a local authority is unable or unwilling to execute works which are essential for the efficiency of other works which another local authority are able and willing to execute.</P>
    <P>In that case the Minister, after consultation with the local authority which is unable or unwilling to carry out the works, may by Order authorise the other local authority to carry out the works.  The second part enables one local authority to enter into agreement with another local authority for the execution by that local authority of works under the Bill.  This would cover the case of a county council carrying out works in an urban area, or a county council carrying out works on the borders of its own territory and going some distance into another county.</P>
    <P>Powers of entry for the purposes of the works are conferred on local authorities by Section 4 of the Bill. Except in the case of urgent works a local authority must either obtain the consent of the occupier or give 14 days' notice of intention to enter.  Where consent is not obtained and notice is given the occupier can if he still objects to entry go to the District Court within 14 days and apply for an order prohibiting the local authority from entering on <Col N="1379" /> his land.  The district justice may decide either to prohibit wholly the entry of the local authority on the land concerned or specify conditions to be observed by the agent, officer or servant of the local authority making the entry.</P>
    <P>I think it proper here to mention that this Bill is in no sense an arterial drainage Bill.  The only effective arterial drainage scheme is one which treats the catchment area as a unit. This involves a thorough survey which takes time.  The execution of arterial drainage involves the use of complicated and heavy machinery and the cost of the work is very expensive. Neither is this Bill a land reclamation Bill.  Land which is relieved from flooding may require suitable treatment in order to bring it back into productivity. This is not the function of a local authority.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that this Bill is not an arterial drainage Bill, and that its main purpose is to relieve flooding of what I have called local authority property and minor flooding of other land, there may be cases where damage is inevitably caused to a landowner by works undertaken for the relief of flooding in some other area.  It is not expected that any serious damage will be caused.  Local authority engineers have for some considerable time been carrying out drainage maintenance works.  They have also in many counties carried out minor drainage works as agents for the Office of Public Works under the minor employment schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides for compensation for persons who suffer damage by reason of any interference caused by the execution of works under the Bill to any land owned by them or any easements or rights belonging to them.  The compensation can be settled by agreement.  If agreement is not reached the person claiming compensation can, if his claim does not exceed £20, go to the district justice.  If the claim is for more than £20 the compensation can be fixed by an arbitrator appointed under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.  A claim for compensation must be made either within two years <Col N="1380" /> from the commencement of the work which caused the damage or one year after the completion of the works, whichever period is the later, Provision is made in sub-sections (5) and (6) of Section 5 for dealing with costs and expenses.  Under sub-section (5) a district justice may award costs not exceeding three guineas together with such witnesses' expenses as he considers reasonable.  Sub-section (6) deals with the case of a claimant who is made an offer by a local authority which he does not accept.  If he takes the case to the district justice and the district justice awards less than the local authority were prepared to give him, the district justice may then order that such costs and witnesses' expenses as he considers reasonable shall be deducted from the compensation awarded by him.  Similar clauses to this are contained in the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned when referring to Section 3 of the Bill, one local authority is empowered under certain circumstances to carry out works on behalf of another local authority.  This raises the question as to which local authority is to pay compensation. There are three different cases: (1) a local authority executing works on its own behalf and without reference to any other local authority; (2) a local authority which has got from the Minister an Order authorising it to execute works on behalf of another local authority which is unable or unwilling to carry out the works, the execution of which is essential for the efficiency of other works which the executing local authority is able and willing to execute; (3) one local authority agreeing as a matter of convenience to carry out works on behalf of another local authority.</P>
    <P>In the first two cases it is the local authority which actually carries out the works which will pay any compensation that may become payable. In the third case it is the local authority on whose behalf the works are executed that will pay the compensation. This is reasonable because if, say, a county council agrees to carry out works for an urban district <Col N="1381" /> council as a matter of convenience, then, surely, the urban district council should pay compensation for any damage that arises.</P>
    <P>Local authorities executing works under the Bill are exempted from the provision of the Fisheries Acts, 1842-1944, but notwithstanding this exemption, they must take such precautions for the protection of fisheries as the Minister for Agriculture, either generally or in particular cases, may advise.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of the passing of the Bill local authorities have been requested to prepare schedules of works to be carried out.  In all counties preliminary schedules have been prepared and these schedules have, by direction of the Minister, been placed before the elected body so that a selection therefrom could be made and submitted to the Department.</P>
    <P>I think what I have said gives a fair summary of the contents of this Bill. It is a Bill which I know will be welcomed, particularly by members of local authorities.  It will enable them to carry out works which for many years past they have been clamouring to carry out.  It will also enable them, when it is operated, to provide employment on useful and productive work in the rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as the Title tells us, is a Bill which proposes to give to local authorities power to undertake works that at present they have not the authority to undertake. The Bill was first mooted some few months ago when it was decided to withdraw the road grants from the local authorities.  It was then put forward as a means of giving alternative employment to those people who may, as a result of the withdrawal of the grant, have found that there was not on the roads the employment that would have been available had the grants been continued. The Bill, since it was first introduced in the Dáil, has been amended.  It meets with more general approval now, as far as safeguards, which were omitted in the Bill, as originally submitted, are concerned.  It is the first time, I think, that local authorities are charged with the carrying out of public works of this kind. <Col N="1382" /> Hitherto, works of this nature were, if at all, carried out by the Board of Works.  As such, the charge was borne entirely by the Central Fund.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not assured the House that the full cost of implementing this Bill will be borne by central funds but I understand that that is so, except in so far as the local authority will be required to provide the necessary staffs&mdash;engineers and so forth&mdash;to carry out the work, and that it will also be held responsible for the payment of compensation, which may be a considerable amount, where damage has been done to a person's property in the carrying out of these works.  While it is essential that certain and very definite powers must be given to a local authority or to any board charged with the carrying out of such works it is also essential that there should be very definite safeguards. Take, for instance, damage which was done and which could be attributed in a certain space of time to the carrying out of such works.  Provision is made for a decision in regard to compensation in such a case.  As I see it, the final result will mean a burden on the local authorities in so far as they will have to meet the compensation, if it is awarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his closing remarks, the Parliamentary Secretary informed us that the local authorities have already been asked to prepare schemes&mdash;which I understand all local authorities have&mdash; and a number of them have been forwarded to the Department.  However, from experience in the past, we know that a considerable length of time elapses between the date when the schemes are sent in to the various Departments for sanction and the date when sanction is given and when the work can be begun.  Therefore, if work under this Bill, when it is enacted, is going to be delayed over some years I think the real benefits that might accrue from this measure will be lost. It is not proposed to do very much under this measure.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, it is not an arterial drainage Bill.  It does not empower the local authorities to go ahead in any drainage or reclamation or land improvement projects.  As far as I see it, it is just a simple matter <Col N="1383" /> of making drains, of removing substances such as overgrown trees and so forth that cause obstruction, and of widening and deepening such watercourses. As far as employment is concerned, I must say that I fail to see where this measure can make any considerable impression in regard to the relief of that problem because the drains to be dealt with will all be of a very minor character and the amount of work which will be involved in the removal of substances causing obstruction&mdash;or even in the building or the remaking of bridges&mdash;will make a very insignificant impression on our present unemployment problem. With regard to the question of notifying the person on whose property you have to enter, while provision is made for giving notification of a kind, I am not satisfied that it is all we would like it to be.  An engineer draws up a plan that is approved in the Department, but, after all, there are times when it would be more convenient and more prudent if the lands were not entered upon and consideration should be given to matters of that kind.  If a man has a field under oats, potatoes or wheat, entry into the portion of the land under the crop should at least be deferred until the crops have been removed.  That is going to hold up the scheme if the engineer has proposed to go ahead with the scheme at that particular time.  While this may seem a very easily worked scheme I can see quite a number of difficulties arising from time to time.  These are matters, however, with which we can deal better on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As far as the general provisions of the Bill are concerned, we all agree that it is good to have causes of flooding removed as far as possible and to do the things the Bill proposes to do, but my theory is that there are more difficulties in it than were presented to us by the Parliamentary Secretary here or in the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that the Minister and the Department have taken a great deal of trouble with the Bill.  Going through the Dáil debates <Col N="1384" /> I find that they have been shown that certain clauses might be undemocratic or unjust and they have taken the trouble of amending them in accordance with the views expressed.  I have been asked by the Irish Association of Civil Liberties to get an assurance on one point and I would be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary would give it in relation to Section 5 of the Bill relating to compensation.  This, I see, has been amended twice, in each case with the intention to make it fairer and less liable to abuse in an undemocratic way.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell me whether the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; includes injury and loss?  Originally it read &ldquo;any land which suffered damage&rdquo;.  Now it reads &ldquo;any person who suffered damage&rdquo;. That might be construed almost as meaning only personal damage and it might be well to put in the words &ldquo;injury or loss&rdquo; to make it quite clear that general damage is included.  Does &ldquo;by reason of any interference&rdquo; mean that that is a limiting clause and, if a man is damaged by some other result of the entry on land, that he would not get damages?  Does the compensation include chattels as well as buildings and personal damage?  The Irish Association of Civil Liberties gives a particular case and, as the matter is rather technical, I will read it slowly:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A more likely example would be an interference with a right of way by the depositing on lands of sludge taken out of a watercourse for the purpose of clearing it.  The owner of the right of way, not being a person having an estate or interest in the land over which the right of way was exercised, would have no right of compensation under Section 5 as drafted.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he would have compensation under Section 5 as amended?  Those are the only two points I wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think everybody will agree that this Bill was absolutely necessary and in the form it has reached us here it can meet with our general approval, but I want to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to one or two things that occur by way of omission rather than by way <Col N="1385" /> of inclusion.  It is clear in the Bill that where one local authority refuses to carry out some work the local authority of the adjoining area can, with the consent of the Minister, carry out that work.  But what is going to happen if one, two or ten local authorities just decide to ignore the Bill? I can see nothing in the Bill that will enable the work to be carried on.  Such a thing as a general boycott could happen, or the local authorities could say that it was not worth their while to do it.  I do not say that it would happen but it could in some places like Carlow.  I know the amount of flooding that occurs around the town of Carlow.  No matter what drainage, clearing of banks, or removing of clay from the eyes of bridges is done, the water will not run off, as the Barrow will not take it and there is nothing that any local authority can do.  It has been said this is not an arterial drainage scheme or a land reclamation scheme and it will be limited by the fact that, unless there is a runaway for the water, the work will be a waste of time.  In a case such as I have mentioned, if it is not possible to drain an area where flooding occurs periodically and has occurred for a number of years, are the people to continue to pay rates on land when it is under water?  I know parts of the country where men pay rates on land of which they can make very little use. They cannot even get grazing on it. There is nothing in this Bill to help unless bigger drainage is carried out. Those are the two points to which I should like to draw attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather wish to follow Senator Stanford with regard to Section 4.  I think it is one of the peculiar functions of the Seanad at the present time to try to safeguard the rights of the individual against the constant and rising pressure of public interference.  I am not criticising the Department on the introduction of this Bill.  We had this evening an appeal from the Minister for Agriculture to err, if we erred at all, on the side of individualism rather than on the side of State-planned socialism and, perhaps, stirred by that appeal, I am <Col N="1386" /> drawing attention to one or two aspects of Section 4 which seem to me to contain possible infringements of individual rights without legal protection. Under this section local authorities must give notice before entering land for any purpose other than the execution of urgent works.  Of course, it is obvious that if the works are really urgent the necessity for giving notice might make the entering and the carrying out of the work quite useless. This exception, however, that notice need not be given in the case of urgent works gives a loophole whereby no notice might be given at all.  Who is the judge of whether the works are urgent or not?  Sub-section (6) of Section 4 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In this section the expression &lsquo;urgent works&rsquo; means work the immediate execution of which is, in the opinion of the local authority executing the works, necessary to prevent serious injury to any person, land or permanent construction.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It seems to me, looking at that section, that if a local authority expresses the opinion that works are urgent, whether they are urgent or not the provision of giving notice before entering on land can be evaded.  It seems to me that there should be some appeal from the local authority itself before the judgment is enforced.</P>
      <P>Another question I would like to ask the Minister is in connection with Section 4, which gives the right of appeal to the District Court.  Is there a right of appeal from the decision of the District Court or is it final?  As the section is phrased it does not appear as though there is any right of appeal and I suggest that in a matter of this kind where the rights of an individual are involved there should be some right of appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Arterial Drainage Act was going through the House as a Bill, I, and, I think, Senator O'Dea, voted against it because I wanted to have put into that measure some sort of provision which would give the local authorities power to execute such works as would be, in their opinion, of public importance. <Col N="1387" /> Remembering that, I wonder how far this Bill does give local authorities the powers which I then sought, probably quite wrongly, to have put into the Arterial Drainage Act.  At the time, I believed the then Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Smith, should have accepted the amendment but afterwards he convinced me that my point of view was wrong and that his was the right angle.  While I welcome the giving of the powers which are now being given, I hope the local authorities are not going to be bound up in red tape in regard to the works which they will execute. Generally, the execution of such works entails regulations which in many cases tie the hands of the local authorities and do not aim at getting efficiency, particularly in the matter of time.</P>
      <P>While welcoming that power, I have also fears that the powers contained in the measure will put on to the local authorities still more responsibilities in addition to those they are already carrying.  There is an indication that the cost of carrying out the works will be borne by the Central Fund, but other attendant responsibilities would appear to be left on the shoulders of the local authorities. Extra staff may, in many cases, be required to prosecute properly the works under this Bill.  Then there is the further question of compensation. I think it is unfortunate that when so much of the cost is to be borne by the Central Fund the local authority should not also be indemnified against the cost in compensation claims that may arise through injury to the people who are actually carrying on the work and who will be in the service of the local authorities. I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary would give us some information on that aspect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want this House to take it that I am severely criticising the measure but I am merely pointing out the added responsibility which might fall on the local authorities.  Many of these local authorities are uneconomic from the rating point of view and they have to be very critical even to the <Col N="1388" /> point where they may appear mean when they see that they are forced to undertake further responsibilities. From the rating point of view County Leitrim is a very uneconomic unit and as a local authority we have always tried to shoulder our responsibilities, but still we would be very critical of the addition of any further responsibilities which would add to our costs.</P>
    <P>I hope that useful works of public importance will be done under this measure.  Prior to the coming in of this measure, works that were too big to be undertaken by rural improvement schemes or rural employment schemes in drainage districts were left as an eyesore.  I would like to be assured that when this measure passes it will be possible for local authorities to execute such works as fairly extensive rivers having an outfall into a drainage district but which were at the same time works which would have been done under the drainage schemes but had not been properly carried out in the first instance.  It is impossible to get these works done by rural improvement schemes because they are too big and one can understand how hard it is to organise people in these matters when it is a question of finance having to be sought.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious to know if works of that nature will come under the Bill.  I hope they will, but, even if they do, I have no illusions as to the effect of that.  In many cases, I suggest&mdash;and this point was very ably put by Senator O'Farrell&mdash;it might constitute an awkward problem by reason of lack of co-operation on the part of local authorities.  Naturally I take the view that that will not be the case, and I take it that local authorities will be co-operative, unless there is some grave reason for not co-operating.  But we must face up to this fact, that many of these works have an outfall into existing drainage districts which, in many cases&mdash;in any case, I know&mdash; need reconstruction and, under the Arterial Drainage Act, local authorities are now charged with the responsibility of maintenance of these drainage districts, and maintenance is entirely different from reconstruction. The responsibility of the local authority <Col N="1389" /> is to maintain a work in as good a condition as that in which they found it, and, if reconstruction is to be carried out on a minor or semi-major river, it will have the effect of concentrating the water more quickly after a heavy rainfall into the drainage district.</P>
    <P>That is a fact that will readily be admitted by anybody here.  Even with the better maintenance that has been carried out by the joint committee set up under the Arterial Drainage Act, compared with that carried out by the drainage boards&mdash;I readily admit that &mdash;I still fear that it is possible to have more extensive flooding and damage than heretofore.  I am merely putting that forward for the attention of the House and the Parliamentary Secretary. I am not putting it forward as a criticism and suggesting that works of that nature should not be carried out. They should, but if that eventuality should arise, and if local authorities as a result are to be faced with heavy claims for compensation, having regard to that possibility, the question of the payment of compensation should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>If I were to offer any criticism of the measure, I would point to the lack of knowledge up to the moment on the part of local authorities as to what it is proposed to do.  Local authorities, the Parliamentary Secretary told us and correctly told us, were asked to formulate schemes.  I inquire now if any indication was given to the local authorities as to the type of schemes it was intended to carry out.  I know that some local authorities had entirely different views with regard to what it was proposed to do from other local authorities.  I felt in the beginning that the only work that could be done was a work where the property of the local authority was actually involved&mdash;say, the flooding of a road.  Naturally a road is the property of a local authority.  The Parliamentary Secretary, however, indicated, and I am glad to know it, that works of public utility can be carried out, even though the property of a local authority is not involved at all.  I do not think that local authorities so far had a proper appreciation of what it was proposed <Col N="1390" /> to do when the original list of schemes was sought, and I am not so sure that it would be a wise thing to give priority to these schemes in a particular county without a further survey, because I suggest that works should be carried out in the light of their importance in the district and in relation to other works in the same county.  I hope that is the view of the Department.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask if the Parliamentary Secretary can give the House any indication of how much he proposes to spend in this year and in the ensuing years, because it would satisfy me and answer the point raised by Senator Hawkins&mdash;a point which I intended to raise, were it not that he raised it&mdash;with regard to time.  Local authorities would be anxious to carry out many works, and, I am sure, will co-operate with the Department in carrying out these schemes, but I should like to be sure that, where there is co-operation by a local authority, there will not be technical delays by way of sanction for spending, by way of regulations and other things which might delay a local authority in doing useful work and in giving employment.</P>
    <P>While I welcome this measure, I would not like to think that it would be the answer of this or any other Government to this question of drainage.  We have heard a lot of promises about this matter of drainage at general elections and we heard them before the last election.  It is one of the first things I remember since I first took a small interest in public life.  While our drainage code may have improved from a legislative point of view, the actual position has not improved, except in so far as local authorities were allowed to do something which the old drainage boards were supposed to do, and if these authorities did not do it, it was the fault of the people who did not see to it that these boards were properly constituted.  That is scarcely relevant to the measure, but I will not digress any further.</P>
    <P>I hope, as I say, that this is not the Government's answer to the drainage problem.  The real answer would <Col N="1391" /> be the implementation of the Arterial Drainage Act, because, while many good things may be done under this measure, it is only tricking with the problem by concentrating the water more quickly in the catchment areas and in those arteries not in a position to take the water.</P>
    <P>I would be worried if I thought this was the answer of the present Government to the drainage question.  I may be told that the lack of plant and machinery prevents the carrying out of an arterial drainage scheme on the Upper Shannon, together with the existing drainage works, and on the other reasonably-sized rivers that do not, and should, form part of the drainage works.  I do not know when surveys will be carried out, but if it is to be put on the long finger and this measure operated to do catch-work drainage, that is a tragedy.  Useful work can and will be done under this Bill, but it is only tricking with the problem, as the whole question of drainage must be tackled.  It could be tackled with greater speed and more work could be carried out if proper machinery could be assembled and the right drive were in it.  I hope I am wrong, but I fear this Bill might be used to defer the carrying out of main drainage schemes that are badly needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. Ruane Mr. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to give my wholehearted support to this measure.  We could do with more of this type of legislation.  It diverts the attention of those of our rural population dependent on casual labour on road work at certain times of the year, work of an expensive and extravagant nature intended mainly to facilitate motor speeding and that is gradually putting the ordinary pedestrian off the main roads.  I welcome it because it gives local authorities powers they had not hitherto.  At certain times, in certain parts of the country, after very heavy rainfall the next meeting of the county council has to deal with applications by county surveyors for money for repairs of flood damage.  The orders are referred to as &ldquo;Sudden Damage Orders.&rdquo;  Whereas the council can periodically provide money for emergency <Col N="1392" /> repairs like that, they never seem to have the power to get at the root of the evil.  It may be the deepening of a waterway or the removal of an obstruction, but the cause of that periodic flooding may happen to be on private property and the power to enter on same was questionable, so the councils go on from year to year, carrying out the sudden damage repairs. If they had the powers provided in this Bill they could get at the cause of the damage and rectify it once and for all.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill because it provides for the case where obstruction to a necessary measure might be advanced by a public body.  There are unreasonable individuals who would hold up progress on the plea that their property would be interfered with, and there are also unreasonable public bodies.  I recollect an instance where a public body, by a majority vote, rejected a very beneficial and attractive scheme, formulated in 1927 by the Office of Public Works, because the people responsible for this obstruction were anxious to coerce the Government of the time to carry out a far bigger scheme.  I am glad to tell the Seanad this opposition was not political, as councillors of all Parties were united in their opposition to sidetrack the project and they succeeded.  It was an attractive scheme, as the Department of Finance was prepared to advance 50 per cent. of the cost&mdash;the estimated cost then was £12,000, but it could not be carried out now for four times the amount&mdash;and the balance was to be provided by people who would benefit as a result of the drainage work.  A moiety equivalent to the one-fifteenth part of a penny in the £ would have to be provided by the local authority.  That was the snag.  Because the local body would not accept that insignificant responsibility, the scheme was torpedoed.  I am glad to feel that that cannot happen in future.  For the past 22 years, valuable crops, turf and riverside hay have been lost annually in many areas because of the obstruction of that particular body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain criticism has been levelled as to the powers in the Bill.  One would imagine that, since the advent <Col N="1393" /> of local administration, no power was ever given to a public body to enter on private property.  We know that that is not so, and that in 1925, because of certain difficulties in providing road material, it was necessary to enable a local authority, by going before a District Court, to get authority to enter on the private property of any individual to secure road-making material, stones or sand, always, of course, paying reasonable compensation. With the advent of the Shannon hydro-electric scheme, it was necessary to get power to erect poles and transformers on private property.  There have been objections and some people have grievances, but no unreasonable damage was done to the private property of any person in carrying out that excellent amenity.  This measure is a very popular one in the country and I believe, once it becomes law, the popularity it enjoys will manifest itself in the manner by which the people will avail of the power it gives them to put up certain schemes.  The results achieved will be the best justification for it.</P>

      <P>The only point I wanted to refer to was raised by Senator O'Brien.  It seems to me that if you do not make some provision for the execution of urgent work it means that no work could be done within a fortnight, at least.  Therefore, some kind of provision would seem to be necessary.  I am not satisfied that the section as it stands does all that might be desired from the point of view of protecting the individual.  I am not quite able to visualise exactly how this may work.  The principal reason I am raising it now, rather than on Committee, is that I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary may be able to clear up the point.  I have been asked about it by several people outside. Under Section 4, sub-section (1), we read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A local authority executing works pursuant to this Act or any Order or agreement made thereunder, or any officer, servant or agent of such authority...&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Presumably it would always be an officer or agent, but there is a distinction <Col N="1394" /> made between the officer or agent and the local authority.  When you come to sub-section (2) of Section 4 we find references to &ldquo;urgent works&rdquo; and under sub-section (6) we find a definition of &ldquo;urgent works&rdquo; which, we read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;means works the immediate execution of which is, in the opinion of the local authority executing the works, necessary to prevent serious injury to any person, land or permanent construction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the expression &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; there mean an officer of the local authority or is there a distinction between the local authority and its officer?  If so, what standing would the officer have and how would he express that opinion?  Would it be possible for a servant to appear on certain land and say: &ldquo;I am told to do this&rdquo; and proceed with the work, or would he have to produce some written authority from the local authority?  If that was not made clear, what would be the position of the owner of the land?  It seems to me that it would be desirable to make some provision in that respect under sub-section (4). Sub-section (4) provides that,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any person to whom a notice of intention to enter on land has been given under this section may, not later than 14 days after the giving of such notice, apply to the justice of the District Court having jurisdiction in the district in which such land is situate...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that a person whose land has been entered should have the right, within 14 days, to go&mdash; naturally he would do it as soon as possible&mdash;to the District Court and claim that the work was not urgent and have it stopped until the matter would be examined.  I do not think we should go so far as to prevent it from being started.  You cannot wait for an urgent matter until you have gone to a District Court.  If, on the other hand, you had a proviso whereby the owner, if he really believed the work was not urgent, could go to the District Court and have it stopped, and then the ordinary procedure applied, that would give a safeguard to the owner and <Col N="1395" /> would be a check on any possible abuse of the description &ldquo;urgent works.&rdquo;  In a nutshell, my attitude is that you must make some provision for urgent works.  The section goes a bit too far.  It provides that if the local authority says they are urgent there is no remedy.  The occupier can apply, to the court where there is notice, but he cannot apply if there is no notice given and if the land is entered on the grounds that the work is urgent.  There should be something more and sub-section (4) should be amended to meet that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. D. Burke Mr. D. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like other Senators, welcome this Bill.  I should like to make a few observations on Section 5, sub-section (2).  We read under this sub-section that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every claim for compensation made under this section shall be made in writing to the local authority concerned before the expiration of the period beginning on the commencement of the works which caused the interference to which the claim relates and ending either two years thereafter or one year after the completion of such works (whichever is the later).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think one year is inadequate in that case.  After the work is finished a very dry period may follow.  You may have a winter like the past one and it could work out very unfair and unjust to some person that the claim would be restricted to one year only after the completion of the work.  I would, therefore, ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this matter.  If he increases the period to two years from the completion of the work rather than two years from the commencement of the work I imagine it should meet most of the cases that could possibly arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, too, that the introduction of this Bill will help the county councils in a great measure.  The removal of obstructions from the eyes of bridges and the removal of the causes of road flooding will help the county councils a great deal in so far as they will be relieved of a lot of expenditure which they have had to meet in other years after the occurrence of flooding.  I think <Col N="1396" /> that point has not been adequately stressed by Senators.  Any of us who are members of a county council know that if a tree or sand or gravel was blocking the eye of a bridge we had no authority to remove it.  We had no power to do anything like that.  This is a &ldquo;middle of the road&rdquo; Bill, which will apply to cases where arterial work does not take place at the moment. Therefore, I think it will be welcomed by all people in the country whose property has been subject to flooding, as well as by the county councils.  A further point in its favour is that it should increase the productivity of land adjoining those places which have been subject to flooding in the past.  The Bill, as amended, and the suggestions made in the Seanad for favourable consideration by the Parliamentary Secretary, should make a very good Bill&mdash; the type of Bill we should like to have oftener in this House for discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion there has not been introduced in the Parliament of this country any piece of legislation which has brought more joy and pleasure to the rural community than this measure.  The people have been asking for something like this for years but their appeals always fell on deaf ears.  They are heartened now by the fact that their county councils can do something to relieve them of the flooding which has impoverished many of them over a number of years.  I can sympathise with those Senators who worry about the endangering of civil or individual rights.  I appreciate that point very much myself.  But really, I think that what gave rise to the giving of extended powers to local authorities is that this question of the infringement of civil liberties can cut both ways.  City Senators may not be aware that it was impossible to have carried through a minor employment scheme in the past, even though it might confer a benefit on 21 people, if the 22nd person objected.  There you had an infringement on the liberty of 21 individuals by one person.  That system held up quite a number of very useful schemes.  When I say that the individual liberty of the citizen is a thing that must be cherished and preserved and protected it must not be <Col N="1397" /> carried out to the extent of allowing that individual to impose hardships on his neighbours.  Hitherto, local authorities had not power to enter on land unless with the consent of the individual owner.  That is a very important right and only in exceptional circumstances should it be interfered with, but when the exercise of that right imposed a hardship on other people who suffered losses thereby, something had to be done and this Bill comes into the picture then.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that some Senators understand the proper approach to this matter when they talk of compensation. The system as it operates in my county is that it is not a case of the local authority deciding to carry out a drainage scheme, but of the people in the area asking the local authority to carry it out, and I would not anticipate anything in the way of very serious compensation applications at all.  The local authority will be guided in the matter by the applications of various people in the area under its control, and as the people themselves will ask for a scheme to be carried out I do not think the local authority will be burdened with applications for compensation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the labour content of the Bill, the one snag, to my mind, will be the difficulty of obtaining the necessary labour.  I do not know if other counties are as ambitious as County Roscommon, but I know that up to last Monday the county council had schemes amounting to £60,000.</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon, that is not for cottages but drainage schemes.  They have other schemes for cottages.  If we are able to get men to carry out the work I have no doubt that we shall derive benefit, and long-needed benefit, from this Bill.  One point, however, is the matter of staff. Undoubtedly, the present engineering staff will not be capable of dealing with all the schemes, and were local authorities to engage extra staff it would impose certain financial responsibility on them which, perhaps, is not intended.  It might be possible for the Minister or the Department to arrange <Col N="1398" /> that the local authority would be remunerated to the extent of any additional staff necessary for the full operation of the scheme.  I do not think there is anything further I have to say on this point except to say that we welcome this Bill with all our hearts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the debate I am prompted to take a slightly different line from other Senators who have spoken.  There is a general tendency to have a rap at the county councils whenever possible.  It is a general thing throughout the country to say &ldquo;who are county councillors?&rdquo; In nine cases out of ten they are the common-sense men of the district and I do not think they would be anxious to do an injustice on any individual in the area.  I am sorry that the debate in this House gave support to these cranks and critics who belittle the good administration of county councils and impede them whenever they can.  The Minister should keep a very careful eye on the fate that awaits county councils in the courts of the country to-day. It is most difficult, practically impossible, to serve the ends of justice.  It is very easy to take proceedings against a county council and it is very difficult for a county council to defend itself. Evidence is not always forthcoming and it is almost as difficult to get evidence as for the prosecution in other cases. I know that compensation may be obtained at the expense of the county council and I would like the Minister to keep a very careful and shrewd eye on the limits to which a county council may find itself driven.  Where is it going to stop?  No men that I know in the country try to do a better job than the county councillors and they take a very great interest in it.  In nine cases out of ten they are the best people in the district who seek no greater advantage than to devote their spare time to the free discharge of a difficult and thankless task and they should be the first citizens in the land. It is depressing to find that these attacks are made on them and it is more depressing still to find that over the past ten years the Administration has made attacks upon them; they have made appointments, imported managers and limited their power and <Col N="1399" /> to-day if you stand up to defend a county council your activities are frowned upon in the courts of the land. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary and the present Minister will grasp the facts in the way the late Minister had and held them.  I hope they will act as fearlessly, bring out all that is best in the counties and make it worth while to be a public man in one's own county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that my colleague, Senator Finan, has touched every point on which I would like to speak with the exception of one, that is, the question of rural employment schemes.  I know a few rural employment schemes and I would like to be made clear on the following point. Some of them have been inspected and are, I understand, considered to be of a very serious nature, but still there does not seem to be very much anxiety to go on with them.  When schemes are done by the county council there is a tendency on the part of some of the people concerned which makes it <Col N="1400" /> pretty hard to collect the cash.  I would like to have an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that the schemes that are rejected as rural employment schemes will at least get priority under this Bill.  The schemes I have in mind are very important and deal principally with the widening and deepening of drains where there is annual flooding causing serious damage to crops and potatoes.  In most cases those crops are on farms of from five to ten acres in townlands where 20 or 30 people live.  They find it difficult for many reasons to get everybody to co-operate on the employment schemes and I think I should have an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that those cases would be considered on their merits and put high on the priority list.</P>
