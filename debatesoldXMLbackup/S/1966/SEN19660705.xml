    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the rate of income tax for this financial year.  I notice that the Minister was under pressure in the Dáil in regard to the methods of the collection of income tax from certain Government employees. There have been complaints about the way in which people have got bills for income tax which have placed them in financial difficulties.  I understand from the Minister's reply that he is considering what alternative arrangements could be made.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify for me the position in regard to the method of collecting income tax from employees of the State as opposed to the method which applies to other workers, namely, the PAYE system. From the financial point of view, and from the point of view of the Exchequer, there seems to be a lot of merit in the PAYE system.  If there is an adjustment in wages and salaries there is an immediate inflow to the Exchequer arising out of the increased wages and salaries.  The Exchequer is thereby in a better position to meet the cost of increases to its own servants. That does not happen in regard to State employees generally. They still continue on the old system. This year they will be paying income tax on their income for last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It occurs to me that this may have created some difficulty for the Minister, because we had last year and the year before pretty substantial and in many cases well merited increases for State servants but we did not have <Col N="1409" /> the position as it would apply to other workers that there was an immediate inflow to the Exchequer arising out of these increases.  The Exchequer had to wait a year to recover the income tax on the higher incomes and this seems to me to put the Minister at a disadvantage.  There seem to have been questions and complaints in Dáil Éireann about the situation because some people do not think it is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister explain why it was necessary to continue this system in regard to civil servants?  Would he say whether there is merit in my view that there would be a great advantage to the Exchequer under a system where increases in wages and salaries would be immediately brought in for income tax as applied under the PAYE system?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised in the Dáil in a rather different way.  The suggestion there seemed to be that because the rate under PAYE was lower than the standard rate on its face, people paying income under PAYE were doing better than those paid other than through the PAYE system.  In fact, all State servants pay other than through PAYE but the fact is that nobody, because he operates under one system or another, pays less or more income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There was at one stage some confusion when people thought that those, other than State servants, who paid under PAYE were getting away with something more than State servants.  There existed for a very long period a system whereby the tax was spread out over a number of months.  There is within that system room for option by State servants and when I use the term State servants I mean all workers paid out of State funds, whether established or otherwise. Some State servants do not opt for that form of deduction and for that reason they appear to have to pay <Col N="1410" /> larger sums but at less frequent intervals.</P>
      <P>I do not think the suggestion holds good that the State would do better out of the increases in wages if a system akin to PAYE were introduced whereby tax would be collected earlier in the lifetime of the increased remuneration. Taking the whole period, the same tax would ultimately be collected. I probably have missed the net point of the Senator's question.  I should like to know exactly what the alleged difficulty is that he wants me to cure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that over a period the State gets the benefit.  The system operated for State servants also operated for many employees up to the introduction of PAYE.  The introduction of PAYE, from the national financial viewpoint, had a certain advantage. If there was a round of wage increases there was an immediate inflow to the Exchequer.  Under the system operated for State servants, I agree the civil servants did not get away with anything. When they come to retirement they have on their pensions to pay income tax on their salaries of their final year.  It would be better for national finances if there was a situation where there would be an immediate inflow to State funds rather than have it a year later.  Am I making myself clear now? In a situation where you have a general upward movement of salaries and wages, where the State inevitably has to face up to that round of increases, there is a great deal to be said for the system that would make the money immediately available, as a system like PAYE would do, in that same year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there is that immediate problem but the Senator acknowledges the fact that where there is a general wage increase the same amount will be paid by the State servants in the long run.  There was a difficulty that the initiation of PAYE was a fairly substantial undertaking that stretched the resources of the Revenue Commissioners to the full in order to bring it in and have it applied universally as far as employment outside the State services was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1411" /> There has been for some years a very reasonable system of tax deduction which is payable, by and large, over the whole year in the case of State servants.  The State service organisations did not, at any stage, press for the introduction of the PAYE system and, therefore, it was not applied to them.  As I said, there is option in the case of a State servant to come in on the system that is spread over the whole year.  Some people opted for that system.  Those who did not opt for it can always do so if they wish.</P>
    <P>The State recognises that a person who does not pay tax in that way is perfectly right to opt to do so if he wishes.  I would suggest, so far as there is a divergence in regard to those paid out of State funds, they may opt for the easy payments system if they find its impact less onerous.  This will achieve what the Senator appears to argue, that is the accretion to the Exchequer of the tax on increased remuneration.  I do not consider that the argument made for doing away with the system, that has been built up over the years, is a very good one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>One regrets it, although one expects to find a section in the Finance Bill referring to income tax for the coming year.  I had great hopes at the time the Commission on Income Taxation was established that some new form of taxation would have been devised.  It now seems that even in England&mdash;I do not say it would be suitable here&mdash;there are other ways in which the necessary money can be provided.  Even if income tax can never be abolished completely from our taxation system, a determined effort should be made to get an alternative form of taxation and at least reduce the impact of income tax on the working public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income tax is a hated tax.  It is hated because it is unjust and it is unjust because people know they are being had.  A great number of people, particularly those on PAYE, and those on fixed incomes, are being had for the whole amount while they know there are people in this country who <Col N="1412" /> have incomes greater than theirs and they do not pay a halfpenny by way of income tax.  There are all classes of excuses advanced for allowing that position to continue but as long as the position obtains whereby people having taxable incomes are not brought into the income tax net there remains this hatred on the part of the people who have to pay the tax.</P>
    <P>Some amelioration of the tax burden, as far as income tax is concerned, could be achieved if an alternative means of tax were found.  The present means of assessing income tax is subject to dishonesty.  People subject to PAYE know they have no option but to pay this tax.  Those who are not on the PAYE system, particularly professional people, know that they are also caught because the Revenue Commissioners, with the skill they have had over the years, have a very good way of compelling people to disclose their incomes.  I know of people who have not disclosed their incomes and the Revenue Commissioners have dealt with those by saying: &ldquo;That is your assessment.  If you want to appeal that you have to go to the Special Commissioners&rdquo;. When a person goes to the Special Commissioners he has to go on oath.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is being cynical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  Most people are honest.  I want to point out that there are ways and means of getting people to disclose their incomes. There are some people, a fairly substantial section of the community, who are not, for good political reasons, liable to income tax.  As long as that position obtains income tax will be regarded as an unjust tax.  I want to say something about the methods of levying and collecting income tax. Since the computers came to the Revenue Commissioners' office they have become more impersonal than they were.  I do not know what kind of strange documents come out of these computers.  We get less and less information for more and more tax. That matter will have to be looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a lot of people who are on PAYE and who pay income tax <Col N="1413" /> under Schedule E but they never get an assessment of their income tax.  They are never told what they have to pay. I understand they are entitled to get an assessment if they apply for it.  I had the appalling experience recently of finding that I was being charged too much income tax and it was only by the merest chance that I discovered this.  It is an extremely difficult job to find out anything about income tax even when one looks at this tome, the new Income Tax (Consolidation) Bill. Many people would be happier about paying a bill if they knew the basis upon which it was assessed.  The Revenue Commissioners should tell the taxpaying public in detail what they have to pay and what reliefs they are entitled to get.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister now that he has seen the possibility of taxation on luxury goods to explore that with a view to finding some other form of taxation so that he would be able to reduce the burden of income tax on the taxpaying public.  The personal allowances given are quite absurd.  The married allowance is only £394 which is so absurd as not to bear any further discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Lenehan Mr. Lenehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>No tax is popular. Everybody must agree with that.  It does not matter whether it is income tax or any other tax.  There is no such thing as a popular tax.  Any Government hoping to carry on their duties must impose tax and no Government will be so foolish as to impose an unpopular tax.  It should always be the most popular tax.  No matter what system of taxation a Government operates the main attitude towards it is to try to get out of it, to try to avoid paying it.  No people, as far as I know, are getting away with taxation any more than some of those who have spoken here already.  We have lawyers, journalists, and people like that and nobody seems to know what amount they are making.  We have journalists who write for about ten different newspapers and it would be very interesting to know if these people pay tax on their income from these ten different newspapers or just on the income from one.  It would be very interesting to <Col N="1414" /> know how some lawyers pay their tax.  Mind you, if the necessary steps were taken to look into the matter we would all get shocked.  While we are blamed for getting £1,000 a year&mdash;and some of us have to travel 200 miles as well and do a lot of ground work&mdash; it would be very interesting to know what some of the people who criticise, or speak vehemently against us, pay by way of income tax.  When I speak about journalists I might as well include economists.</P>

      <P>The pure and simple fact is that the Government are trying to get the extra money necessary in this Bill.  The people who spoke against it are the same people who went out a few weeks ago and told us what should be done in this country.  We asked them where they are to get the money so that this can be done. Nobody said where the money was to come from.  I suppose the idea was to create a Utopia but nobody told us where the money was to come from. If we want a Utopia somebody has to pay for it.  We must still be honest about it.  There is talk about a 40 <Col N="1415" /> hour week, a 30 hour week or a 20 hour week but, unfortunately, nobody in this country is prepared to work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that anything Senator O'Quigley said calls for comment from me.  He said we ought to try to widen the basis of our taxation and that income tax, in so far as it is unfair, is unfair in its operation against people who have the ability to earn more, and that income tax being an unpopular tax people do not want to earn more to have more taken from them.</P>
      <P>The necessity arises of getting revenue to run the country.  We have had the difficulty over a number of years relying on the narrow basis of taxation which hit the few rather than the many.  As new taxation had to be raised one usually looked to the hardy annuals, as it were, beer, cigarettes, tobacco, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a person who is a consumer of one form, or, to some degree or another, a consumer of all three, I do not like to be hitting those particular items any more than I should.  There is, I suppose, and there always will be, a certain degree of evasion of tax. Whether they are newspaper men or lawyers or professionals of any description, people who evade income tax are usually caught because the income tax inspectors are usually fairly alert men.  If somebody appears to make a big income from sources which he does not disclose it often happens that <Col N="1416" /> the income tax inspector can get it off him one way or another but it is impossible for him to chase every one or every one hundred people who are under no obligation to disclose their incomes or to chase these home in every particular instance.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator O'Quigley referred to the necessity of looking for revenue outside income tax and the hardy annuals; we shall give him an opportunity tomorrow to vote in regard to such taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the improvement that has been made but I hope we have not heard the last from the Minister on adjusting allowances in income tax.  Because of the failure to properly adjust allowances over the years we are now extracting income tax from lowly paid people, people who previously in relation to their standard of living would not be liable for income tax but who now, because of the change in the value of money and the failure properly to adjust allowances&mdash;farm labourers and the like&mdash;are liable to PAYE.  I hope that, even if the Minister cannot do it now, when he comes to framing next year's Budget he will take a sympathetic look at the question of allowances and bring them more into line with the present day value of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to intrude on the note of amity between the Labour Party and the Minister on this question.  It has always struck me that the Labour Party have generally much concern about income tax allowances but have not equal concern for and interest in those who are not in the happy position which, I suppose, all of us are in.  This particular provision increases the amount of the tax allowance for children, and, as an income taxpayer, I welcome this wholeheartedly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1417" />
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lenehan seems to doubt that Senator Garret FitzGerald pays income tax at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I refrain from comment on Senator Lenehan's remarks which, as usual, did not do much credit to this House.  The provision here is designed to increase the amount allowed for children and it has the effect of improving the position of people with children over 16 who are paying income tax and who, as a result of this, can benefit to a greater extent if they send their children to school beyond that age.  It is an excellent thing that we should do everything we can to improve equality of opportunity in education.  Anything which encourages people to send their children to school beyond the age of 16 is a good thing.</P>
      <P>But what concerns me is that this provision is not impartial in its operation and is designed only for the benefit of the well-to-do.  There is no comparable benefit for people who are not in the happy position of being able to pay income tax.  I shall take the case of two people, both with a wife and two children, one of whom is a labourer on £10 a week&mdash;that is what an agricultural labourer would get if he were lucky&mdash;and the other&mdash; a well-to-do man with £5,000 or £6,000 a year.  The Minister has told another House, in another context, that £7,000 a year is the typical remuneration of a chief executive of a company.  I shall not go as far as that; let us just say £5,000 or £6,000 a year.  That man, as a result of this particular provision, has his purchasing power increased, when he sends a child over 16 years to school, by £90 a year.  As a result of his decision to send a child to school beyond the age of 16 years, he is left with £90 more to use for that or other purposes.  He sends the child to a school which is subsidised, on average, to the tune of over 70 per cent by the State, so he pays less than 30 per cent of the school fees.  Because he is well enough off to send the child there at all, he qualifies for this subsidy.  The National Industrial Economic Council, in their comments on &ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo; say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" /> The existing arrangements &ldquo;confer an automatic subsidy on all aided post-primary and university pupils, while a second subsidy is in effect conferred on pupils whose families are in a position to benefit from income tax concessions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now, contrast the position of the man we have just dealt with, who gets £5,000 or £6,000 a year and who gets a present of £90 with the man on £10 a week who cannot afford to pay fees, who cannot afford the cost of the books and transport and who certainly cannot afford&mdash;if he is not living in the neighbourhood of a secondary school&mdash;the cost of boarding the child in a secondary school.  He gets nothing whatever.  There are scholarships, of course, but how many?  The Report on &ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo; discloses that only 10 per cent of children in secondary schools have scholarships. It also discloses that only 20 per cent of our children are attending school at the age of 17.  That means that two per cent of the children at the age of 17 are getting scholarships and this worker's child would need to be in the top two per cent in intelligence to get anything whatsoever from the State to help him deal with his problem of being unable to pay for the cost of a secondary education, whereas the man with £5,000 or £6,000&mdash;which the Labour Party are so keen to get increased&mdash;gets £90 a year and nearly three-quarters of the school fees paid for him.  As an income taxpayer, I am delighted to get this present of £52 10s.  Eventually you would get over £100 a year if your income were sufficiently high.  I am delighted to get my £52 10s a year.  I am delighted to have a substantial proportion of my school fees paid by the State but I frankly have a guilty conscience that nothing whatever is being done in the case of parents who are not in this happy position.</P>
    <P>This provision makes it a system of allowance which has turned this country into a middle class paradise; where if you buy a house, you get income tax off the mortgage, where if you send your children to school beyond the age of 16 you get large <Col N="1419" /> sums of money to help you pay for them there, where somebody not well enough off does not get any benefit. I think broader taxes may be necessary. It is quite obvious that we cannot leave the whole burden of this country on indirect taxes, when no country in Europe draws so much of its revenue from those taxes and so little from direct taxes as we do.  I do not think we can go on with a system under which we have a higher proportion of indirect taxation carried by the whole community than anywhere else. This system of educational facilities and housing facilities available only to those well enough off to pay income tax, with no comparable or equivalent benefit for people who are not in this happy position, cannot be allowed to continue.  This type of society can only be described as anti-social.</P>
    <P>While we may welcome these benefits, we cannot do so without calling for equivalent benefit for those not in that position.  I should like to press this point because it is a matter of fundamental social policy constantly overlooked by the people who are vocal, who are in the Dáil and Seanad, those who find it easy to write to newspapers, all pressing for more and more tax allowances while the voice of the ordinary man in the street, who is not getting these benefits, is not heard.  It is not heard even through the Labour Party, who are supposed to be the spokesmen for this particular group. Therefore, I would press the point that we cannot support a proposal of this kind without voicing our desire and concern that these should be extended not only to the well-to-do but also to those who are not in that position.</P>

      <P>I must compliment Senator FitzGerald on his statement on Labour Party policy here this afternoon.  I hope he will have the courage of his convictions and do something about it.  But in this section we are dealing with the increase in allowance and how we can object to an increase in income tax allowance because we are not giving an increase in the allowance for people who do not pay income tax is rather beyond me. I am fully with Senator FitzGerald in asking for free education for those people but we are not dealing with that in this particular section.  We are dealing with the increase in allowance for people with children over a certain age and that is some easement to many wage earners, not the people with £5,000 and £7,000 a year.</P>

      <P>I should like to agree with Senator Murphy.  I believe that Senator FitzGerald is correct, and we would certainly agree with him that if we could afford it we should give further grants or scholarships to enable children to go to secondary schools, but I think that Senator FitzGerald is ignoring one point.  He mentioned the case of a man with a wife and two children who is earning £5,000 or £6,000 a year.  Although it is true that he benefits in the education of his own children from our present system, he will also be paying a considerable amount in income tax or surtax for other children's education.  He will be contributing substantially towards the 70 per cent of the cost of the education of other children in secondary schools and the 70 per cent subsidies <Col N="1421" /> by the State as things stand.  He is paying heavy income tax, so that he is paying not only for the education of his own children but also paying for the education of quite a number of other children.  This does not vitiate the point that we need more scholarships for children, but it is not quite fair to suggest that under the income tax system he is not also substantially helping the education of other children too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that he was not subsidising them, but I am dealing with one small point, what happens in the case of the man paying income tax or surtax who decides to send his child over 16 to school and who is paying his share for education and other services.  That is fair enough.  Presumably he is paying the right amount, but his decision is accompanied by the payment to him in effect by the State of £90 plus three-quarters of the cost of education of his children, while the person who is earning £10 a week taking the same decision under our system does not receive any benefit unless his child is in the top two per cent.  I am not arguing on the overall system which involves taxing the rich to pay the poor but the provision covered by this section which has this effect on people who decide to send their children to secondary school.  I shall simply leave it at that now that Labour and Fianna Fáil are closing in together on this, so I will sit down.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to find Senator FitzGerald stating this so clearly, because a strange doctrine seems to be just beginning to come into Irish thinking.  It appeared here and there in the report on &ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo; but that was only economists talking and they were not going to pass any valid judgment on it.  They were just giving a hint.  Over the weekend we had the bombshell from the NIEC where their main task seemed to hinge on this great principle that in future secondary education should live on its own tail, because the one point about secondary education and allowances that not all those experts have faced up to is that we are <Col N="1422" /> getting an absolute bargain under this code through a combination between the State, the parents through their income tax allowances and the schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am keeping to tax allowances.  By and large, the State is making a real contribution to secondary education either through tax allowances or otherwise, but it is nonsense compared with the level of contribution made by the State elsewhere. The only assistance given here is this contribution, in one way substantial, in the income tax allowances.  Surely, however, the basic principle involved is that the ability of the wage earner or the man who pays tax depends on the number of his dependants and, therefore, the ability to contribute to taxation of a person drawing, say, £800 a year with two children is higher than that of a person with the same income and three or four children.  That principle is an obvious one, but if anything the Government have been over-tardy in making the adjustments that this principle calls for.  Here in section 2 we have a minor adjustment based on this, that the increase in tax allowance is from £120 to £150. That certainly does not restore the differentials that operated in the early forties, but it is at least a step in the right direction.  We have always clamoured here for adjustment of the dependency allowances that come under this section.  Year after year we have failed to get it, and this is at least one small step in the right direction. Senator FitzGerald thinks that the time has come for the economists to vet it, and no doubt we will come to the position where the NIEC has suddenly descended from its Olympian heights of economics to become judges of everything.  As a colleague of mine said in discussing it over the weekend: &ldquo;I wonder will the Vatican Council decrees be submitted to them and will the Government have to have its acceptance recorded in the Reports?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not think that this should be allowed to pass without making this statement in public.  I happen to be one of those who over some seven or eight years past have been making an annual pilgrimage to the Minister for Finance pleading for the relief of taxation on behalf of deserving people.  It ought to be said in fairness to the Minister that to my knowledge representations were made to at least three of his predecessors on this specific point.  Up to now these representations have been met I shall not say with an emphatic &ldquo;No&rdquo; for that would not be fair&mdash;one at least expressed some sympathy with the submissions&mdash;but in all cases they said that it was not possible to allow this relief.  The Minister has shown some courage.  He is not afraid to take a stand on the matter and has come out on this particularly.  I am glad to defend his action on that against such attacks as we have heard from Senator FitzGerald on the Minister as well as on the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I just want to make one other point. <Col N="1424" /> The Party of which Senator FitzGerald is now a member had the opportunity from time to time to give plenty of reliefs either on this head or in some other direction, but in fairness it must be said that the Labour Party have not yet had that opportunity.  I suggest to Senator FitzGerald that if he and some of the people for whom he is speaking, perhaps, give the Labour Party that opportunity in the near future we might and we shall do something about it.</P>

      <P>I am always reluctant to sum up a Committee Stage debate on any section in case I stir up something else.  I should like to say as a general observation that personal reliefs in income tax are not designed to help anyone.  One has to take the broad spectrum of income taxation into consideration and see to what extent reliefs can be given in order to suit the burden to the back since we cannot do anything to suit the back to the burden.  You do not give anyone anything in these reliefs that they would not otherwise deserve.</P>
      <P>Assistance for education is a different matter altogether.  In fairness to the £5,000 a year man who Senator FitzGerald says gets a present of £90 a year because he is sending to school one child over the age of 11 years, he is not so well off at the other end of the scale because he would be caught for about £1,500.</P>

It is the partiality of the section I am concerned about.  I see no reason for this.  I see a reason for marriage and children's allowances.  I suspect that these allowances are still not adequate and that married people with children are still relatively overtaxed <i>vis-á-vis</i> single people.  However, I am not quarrelling about that.  What I regard as inequitable is that this is being confined to people in the better off bracket.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:</P>
      <P>Before section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965 shall not apply where the price or consideration in relation to the acquisition or disposal of an interest in land, the property of a charity, is held upon trust for the charity for the purpose of being applied in the acquisition extension renovation or repair of buildings or the acquisition or development of land for buildings used or to be used by the charity in furtherance of the primary purposes of the charity.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am sure there are many people in this country who will regret that the Minister did not do anything in this Bill to qualify Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965, or to amend it in some way so as to get rid of some of the strange anomalies to which that section gives rise.  Part VII provides that any development of land&mdash;which means any building on it or any construction or alteration of any building that has taken place between the time the person acquired it and the time he sold it&mdash;is liable for income tax.  If a person buys land for £1,000 and, after doing some development on it, sells it for £5,000, he is liable for tax on £4,000.  Where that type of development is carried out as part of a person's way of life that is fair enough in the broad context of levying income tax on income from economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965, went too far.  Indeed, as originally drafted, if a man bought a house for £2,500 and then built another room, if he sold it for £5,000 when his family had grown up, the fact that he had added a room rendered him liable on the difference between the £2,500 and the £5,000.  When that anomaly was pointed out to the Minister, in all fairness to the Minister, he removed it from the Bill readily enough, so that does not now apply within certain limitations.  The position has now been reached that this section applies even <Col N="1427" /> to the activities of charitable organisations. Because of the manner in which Part VII has been drafted they are liable to income tax.  I am aware of a charitable organisation with land, and buildings which were used for schools. They now require to build a new school which will be near some playing fields.  This charitable organisation by definition is run for the benefit of education, which takes the burden of paying for that education off the State. The buildings which they acquired were added to over the years, and in recent years, and because they have been added to they fall within the definition of having developed their land and buildings as provided in Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>The end result is that, because over the years they have extended their buildings and because they might now wish to sell them for, say, £300,000, they will be called on to pay £100,000 though the intention is to build a new school with the proceeds of the sale of the old buildings.  It seems that provisions in income tax legislation which provide that a charity will be deprived of one-third of the proceeds of the sale of buildings which are now unsuitable for carrying out the education of the children under the care of a charitable organisation is to be applied to income tax instead of being put back into new buildings.  We all know that the two-thirds remainder will not be adequate to finance new building and I do not believe the Minister does not agree it is absurd to have such a provision.  I am surprised the Minister has not amended the legislation. I hope he will accept my amendment so as to provide that Part VII of the Finance Act of 1965 will not apply.  What I am trying to provide&mdash;I am not the last word in draftsmanship&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope, however, that the Minister will accept the principle. I am trying to provide that if a charity sells its property, which has been developed within the meaning of <Col N="1428" /> Part VII of the Finance Act of 1965, and applies all of the proceeds of the sale to acquiring land for new building or to buying new buildings, more suitable for the primary purpose of the charity, that the proceeds will not be assessed for income tax.  It seems entirely right that where you have a charity you should try and encourage it and not take from it in one fell swoop as much as perhaps £100,000. The wording of the amendment is taken partly from the abstruse phraseology of Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965, and section 3 of the Act of 1955 on the question of economic activity carried on by beneficiaries of charities and applied for the primary purposes of the charities.  My purpose is to have these exempted from income tax under Schedule D.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been some criticism of Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965, which this amendment refers to and I should like very briefly to tell the House why Part VII was introduced.  If a person in the ordinary course of business makes a purchase, in fairness to the rest of the taxpayers that should be liable, but builders, developers of land, were getting away with non-payment of tax because of the difficulty of proving that they bought or disposed of land or entered into commitments in respect of the development of land and the intention that they had could not be established. In Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1935, it was laid down that any person who bought and developed or went into land with the intention of developing it would be liable to income tax on profits earned out of that development. Subsequent case law has been such as to make it impossible to prove what a person's intention was when he bought or went into land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been well known examples of builders who bought out tracts of land with a house.  In one case the wife ultimately said she would not like to live in the house and the builder said he would buy a house elsewhere and develop the original site in the ordinary course of business.  He paid no tax.  Part VII of the 1965 <Col N="1429" /> Act was widely framed so as to catch transactions of that nature.  There would have been so many means of evasion that it would hardly be worthwhile enacting a less widely framed piece of legislation.  In the course of the passage of the Bill I introduced a number of amendments to try to meet obvious cases of hardship.  If a person bought property and he lived in it for six years afterwards, it was provided that he would not pay on the profit earned out of the sale of that property. One can easily understand that, if the six year period did not apply, people could buy houses and sell them and buy other houses and make a nice profit, especially, in times of increasing house values.</P>
    <P>If in the type of case Senator O'Quigley has in mind, the people concerned continued to occupy the land for six years they would not be liable. It is possible that the population of the area in which a religious charity resided might grow and that the charity might require extensions to meet the growing need for accommodation. They might have to decide to sell after five years.  I appreciate there would be certain difficulties in that case because the community concerned were not in the development business for profit purposes.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of anomalies thrown up and I set up a special section of the Revenue Commissioners to deal with this matter, to receive complaints and tease out any difficulties that arise.  I said in the Dáil that after some experience of the operation of Part VII I expected to have got some idea of the operation of this section and that I intended, if necessary, to review the operation of that part of the Act and bring in amendments.  I suggest it would be better not to try to deal piecemeal with the operation of that part of last year's Act.  Next year I may be in a position to bring in necessary amendments.  As far as any transactions now liable to tax that may, as a result of this review not be liable, I have already decided to make any relief given retrospective. In the case of Senator O'Quigley's charitable organisations, any retrospection <Col N="1430" /> would naturally operate in their favour.  If the Senator is prepared to accept that I can assure him this will be taken into account.</P>

      <P>I read with care most of what the Minister said.  It seems to me that when a Minister for Finance is concerned around February, March or April with the introduction of a Budget, which will affect the economy for the coming year, he ought not be concerned with those kind of amendments.  There should be two types of Finance Bills, the first one to impose any taxation that is necessary to keep the State turning over and then a Finance (Miscellaneous) Bill, introduced later in the year, which could deal with some of those complaints and bring in amendments.  When the Minister and his advisers are concerned with bringing in a Budget, and, indeed, when the Houses of the Oireachtas are also concerned with financial matters, is not the time to bring in such amendments.  It would be much better to bring such a Miscellaneous Bill in when the Oireachtas has more time to consider such amendments to the income tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not advocating that we should have two Budgets every year but consideration should be given to having two separate Finance Bills.  We could then deal more easily with some of the matters which inevitably must rise in the provisions of Finance Acts such as Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965. I am glad the Minister has given the assurance that those reliefs will be retrospective. The charity of which I was speaking is not a religious organisation. <Col N="1431" /> It is a lay organisation so I will not get their prayers which I would have got if it was a religious organisation.  I may take it that the assurance given by the Minister will mean that those benefits will be retrospective in the same way as the Minister has happily made provisions regarding death duties retrospective.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 2:</P>
      <P>Before section 8, but in Part I, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Paragraph (h) of subsection (3) of section 71 of the Finance Act, 1963 is hereby amended by the substitution of &lsquo;fifty&rsquo; for &lsquo;five&rsquo; in subparagraph (i).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> This refers more to the administration of the Customs and Excise code than to anything directly concerned with the payment of taxes imposed by this section. I am sure the Minister will readily appreciate that the whole taxation system is very heavily weighted against the income taxpayer.  If it were not very heavily weighted against him the State would be in danger of losing a great deal of revenue and the administration of the code would be extremely difficult.  That being so, the Revenue Commissioners, where mistakes are made&mdash;mistakes are sometimes made&mdash;should treat the income taxpayer with the same kind of consideration one would expect from any normal person.</P>
    <P>The position at the present time in relation to many aspects of taxes administered by the Revenue Commissioners is that you have to pay what they say is payable.  When that is done if you see you have a grievance against them and that you have been charged at the wrong rate, you may take the proceedings to court.  That is the only way you can have an argument. That is very valid because if people found they could get out of paying their tax they would do so. If the tax people did not insist that the tax was paid first it could happen after proceedings were taken in court the verdict might be given against the person but there would be money to meet the person's liability.  Therefore, I consider the Revenue Commissioners have a very real obligation to make sure they facilitate the taxpayer in any dispute he feels he has with them.</P>
    <P>As I understand the position, as a lawyer, if you think you are liable to a particular rate of duty and you find out you are mistaken in your interpretation of the part of the Schedule or part of the Act you come under, if you make a mistake in your interpretation of the law, then you may very well find yourself not entitled to a repayment although, in fact, you have paid more money in the form of tax than you should have.  The Revenue Commissioners, where that kind of situation arises, should not stand upon the law.  They should stand upon what <Col N="1433" /> is fair and just as between them and the taxpayer.  I hope, in relation to this, in relation to the estate duty and in relation to income tax generally that the attitude of the Revenue Commissioners would be that laid down for them by the Minister, in so far as a Minister can dictate to a statutory body such as they are, that wherever there is any possibility that a mistake has been made by them, and if a refund is payable, then it should be repaid.</P>
    <P>I may be going too wide in this when I refer to the estate duty code but I want to assure the House that when I raise it on this section I shall not raise it again on the estate duty section.  I have had the experience of people being liable to pay more tax than they were liable to pay under a Finance Act relating to death duties. It has always been conceded and I am sure it is still conceded in the Estate Duty Office that people were entitled to a refund.  Whether the money is paid under misapprehension as to the effect of a document or misapprehension as to the effect of a particular section of an Act the Estate Duty Office regularly repay what has been overpaid.</P>
    <P>Equally so, in relation to the administration of customs and excise that position should obtain.  I think it is extremely important that the taxpayer should always have the feeling that what he is paying is what is due.  If the Revenue people, whether customs and excise, income tax inspectors, or people in the Stamp Office or elsewhere, are discussing the liability to taxation upon a particular transaction, instrument or Vote, the taxpayers should not have the feeling that the Revenue people were there merely looking for what was entitled to the State under the law, that they paid first and then if they had a grouse they could go and mitigate it in court.  My happy experience as a member of the Estate Duty Office was that you told the citizens they were entitled to a refund.  If it were known that the Revenue Commissioners took the extraordinary step of telling people they were entitled to be paid and that <Col N="1434" /> they were paid in full; if the Revenue people got that type of reputation you would have a somewhat different approach by people who are liable to pay customs and excise duty or income tax or anything else.</P>
    <P>That is a matter the public should realise.  It is something that should be undertaken and it is the kind of attitude that civil servants, who should be, and who are, impartial, should have.  They are always impartial on the side of Revenue but when it comes to liability they should be got to adopt that attitude of actual fairness to the public and it would generate a greater share of cooperation from the public.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, what the recommendation is about is that under section 71 of the Finance Act, 1963, and under the Finance Acts of 1963 generally, persons who had deposits in banks were liable to have these disclosed under the provisions of the Finance Act, 1963 and that has now been increased to £50.  Where the amount of interest is £50 or upwards the disclosure must be made.  I am told the position under paragraph (h) of section 71 of the Finance Act, 1963 is that provident societies, which I take it everybody would wish to encourage, must make a disclosure if the person <Col N="1435" /> has interest amounting to more than £5 per annum.  I understand that a number of provident societies feel there is discrimination against them which will not be helpful to persons wishing to invest in provident societies.  Then, perhaps, the Minister might take into consideration the fact that one Finance Bill is tidying up certain aspects of existing legislation.  That is the point I wish to make.  At the present time provident societies are liable to make a disclosure where the people receive interest of £5 or in excess of that.  People who have investments in banks or other finance houses, such as hire purchase, do not have to make such disclosure unless the amount exceeds £50 per annum.  I think that is a discrimination against provident societies which may act as a disincentive to people who would be inclined to invest small amounts in the provident societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This may appear on first sight as discrimination against provident societies but, in fact, the relief given in last year's Finance Act in the case of non-disclosure of the proceeds bearing interest of £50 or less is not the same type of thing that is concerned here at all.  The type of money deposited with provident societies is usually long-term money, interest being payable in the form of yearly dividends or otherwise.  The type of money that is invested or deposited in banks does not form part of the capital structure of the bank at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the original Act of 1953 was to ensure that people who made deposits to the banks or were earning a lot of money should be made liable for income tax, and not be avoiding the payment of income tax to the detriment of the rest of the community. In the case of provident or co-operative societies they may pay interest on deposits without deducting tax.  When it comes to payment by the co-operative societies or the provident societies of tax, and whatever profits they earn which are liable to tax, then the society must make a disclosure on payments of interest of £5 and upwards <Col N="1436" /> in order to give the opportunity to the Revenue Commissioners to determine properly what tax is, in fact, payable.</P>
    <P>In the case of an ordinary company who pay interest on share capital in the form of dividends, they are obliged to deduct tax at source and to employ staff in order to do that.  Provident societies and co-operative societies are not obliged to deduct tax at source. They can pay interest and it is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to get after the receipts.  It is a relief for the co-operative or provident societies not to be burdened with a deduction of tax.  It is suggested that in that way they have a certain advantage and that the obligation of disclosing interest payments of £5 and upwards is a small enough price to pay for the undoubted privilege they have over ordinary incorporated companies.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Senator that while it might appear at first sight to be discrimination, the two things are not, in fact, the same.  The £50 level for non-disclosure purposes concerns short-time deposits which do not form in any way part of the company's capital structure.  This is one of the cases where one has to strike a balance as between two goods.  The first one is to enforce a general principle that everybody who has an income should disclose it so that it should be liable to tax that can be levied on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think one also has to consider in a case of this kind whether this kind of requirement will not have a disincentive effect upon the people in those various provident societies.  I would have thought we should encourage people with small savings to make small investments in these kinds of societies and to invest in the co-operative movement.  If they do get away with some small amount of income tax, that may be the price we have to pay in order to keep developing these particular types of institutions which we consider desirable. I would ask the Minister not to close his mind to a further review of this at a later stage because I am not at all certain in regard to the upper limit in the case of bank deposits which he <Col N="1437" /> says is in relation to short term deposits&mdash;I have not got the information which the Minister has&mdash;but I take the liberty of doubting whether or not the deposits in respect of which these disclosures will be made were not the kind of deposits that were there year in year out and which formed a great deal of the till money available to the banks for their ordinary small loans to the ordinary man in the street.  I would ask the Minister, perhaps, to have another look at this in the context of his next Finance Bill, when he will be making some other changes in the Finance Act of 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that but I just want to make this further observation&mdash;that what the Senator suggests would perhaps present little difficulty if these provident societies were obliged to deduct tax at source; in other words before paying interest to their clients they would first deduct tax.  That, of course, would impose an obligation on the society.  At the moment they do not deduct tax at source; they pay the interest out, Therefore, the main purpose of this disclosure is not so much to catch the person to whom interest is paid but as a means of assessing what tax is payable by the co-operative society itself.  However, there is a counterbalancing advantage as against whatever disadvantage is incurred.  I shall certainly have a look at it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be well if the Minister could identify certain taxes with certain very useful work being done for the community, especially in the case of the beer and spirits tax if the Minister could identify any increases made in this with increases, say, to the social welfare group.  There is a great deal which can be done by way of public relations to make tax paying more palatable. The United States has brought this to a very fine art where, at every hand's turn, one is confronted along <Col N="1438" /> the highways with signs showing your tax dollar at work.  It does make the paying of tax easier and more palatable if it is brought home to you that this taxation has been used to increase the social welfare benefits; that some other taxation is being used for some other purpose.  You have got to take pairs which go together and, in this case, beer and spirits tax would be a very natural one to link closely with increases in social welfare.  I know the Minister would do it now but I have no doubt that he will be looking for further money in the future.  If this tax could be the means of increasing social welfare benefits, then signs displayed prominently, even in public houses and elsewhere, would do much to get the home drinkers to see that their tax is doing good work.  Also tourists visiting here, who might be inclined to object to certain high prices or to say that the price of beer and so on is out of line; their objections to paying would be greatly reduced if they were confronted with such signs.</P>

      <P>With the taxation on hydrocarbon oils, petroleum and so on, there is a great deal about which the public are confused at present.  They are confused at the petrol tax and the many grades of petroleum which are associated with this tax.  When the tax was imposed prices seemed to be at variance&mdash;Shell at 5/7d, Shell at 5/5d and so on.  This seems in the public mind to be linked with some suggestion that certain companies have cut their prices to absorb a certain amount of the tax increase. I do not know whether or not they have cut the prices or whether it is a question of blending a cheap mix with a dear one and getting this in between mix.  But there is some need for the work which is done by the Fair Trade Commission in the United States, <Col N="1439" /> where you can get a positive assessment of the various grades of article available.  In this case, the present confusion in the petrol market was intensified as a result of the Budget increases and it calls for giving some standard to the public to let them know whether certain of the bargains offered are genuine price cuts being brought in by some petrol distributors to absorb part of the tax or whether they are just sales gimmicks, by simply mixing two grades of petrol and, therefore, misleading people.</P>

      <P>I would prefer to decide social welfare apart from Budget time entirely.  I believe that to bring in social welfare or health assistance as a by-product of a Budget is not a very good thing.  We ought to be able to make up our minds in advance of Budget time as to what money would be required for health or social welfare to make sure that we could provide the money.  I think it was Senator O'Quigley and also <Col N="1440" /> Senator FitzGerald who referred to this point, too.  I think that that is the wrong way to do it.  We should look at it in advance and see how much we should expend on social welfare and health and frame our Budget accordingly.</P>

It could be an extra penny or halfpenny or whatever would be required on cigarettes, and that would give the public the reason why every specific rise in these increased taxes was being put on spirits and tobacco.</P>

      <P>Up to now when the next of kin of a person who died was entitled to a death gratuity, that death gratuity was not liable to estate duty because it was not property in which the deceased had an interest.  In one of the Finance Acts, non-contributory pensions were brought within the ambit of the death duty code.  Here we are bringing these gratuities within that ambit.  Subsection (5) of this section repeals section 5 of the Finance Act, 1945, which related to death duties payable by members of the Defence Forces.  I am wondering why this section is being brought into operation at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Death benefits payable if they were indefeasibly vested in the beneficiary were regarded as being outside the scope of aggregation. Last year's Finance Act brought these within the sphere of aggregation for tax on the estate of the deceased for estate duty purposes.  Death duties payable under superannuation schemes, such as to civil servants, were not indefeasibly payable to anyone.  They were regarded as benefits payable at the will and pleasure of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person paid all his life into a superannuation scheme so that on his death a lump sum would be payable as of right to his widow or some dependant, that was caught for duty.  It was thought unfair that having contributed to the superannuation scheme of a statutory body, or the superannuation scheme of a company, he should be caught on an excess of £5,000 and that a civil servant should not be caught.  The fact is that a person in a superannuation scheme has, by and <Col N="1444" /> large, an indefeasible right to a lump sum.  A civil servant cannot enforce that right under any circumstance and for that reason it was always considered for Revenue purposes that the lump sum could not be caught for estate duty.  At any stage it could be removed without any right on the part of the person whose life was covered, or the person who was benefiting, to demand payment of the sum.</P>
    <P>Comment was made in the Dáil last year&mdash;and perhaps in the Seanad; I forget&mdash;that it appeared to be unfair that civil servants should have the right of not having their lump sums liable for death duty.  In fact, most people who get lump sums no matter from what source are free of estate duty unless they exceed £5,000, and very few do, but in order that justice would appear to be done, and in order to satisfy the comment made last year, I introduced this provision this year to abrogate this notional benefit for civil servants.  In order to do that I had to do it across the board and apply it to what are called deferred benefits payable to members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle, I suppose, one cannot quarrel with this section.  It shows the difficulty of doing justice when you apply a general provision to a whole set of people.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with civil servants who now find themselves liable to this new tax.  I never knew of any occasion when civil servants went before an arbitration board, or met the Department of Finance or the Minister for Finance, looking for increases in pay, when they were not always told of all the advantages they had, and their pay was depressed proportionately on account of the advantages they had.  One advantage they were told they had was a non-contributory pension scheme, and that the lump sum payable on the death of a serving officer was not liable to death duty.  This has been foisted on them for 40 years and now the Minister says: &ldquo;That might be so, but I have to justify this to the rest of the community.&rdquo;  I hope the Department of Finance will never mention pensions again at arbitration in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> I hope that has gone out of their vocabulary.  I also hope this anomalous Victorian concept that pensions were payable at the will and pleasure of Queen Victoria's Commissioners of the Treasury will go out of the superannuation code.  I do not know whether the Minister has in mind a codification of the superannuation code for civil servants which is long overdue.  If I had known this applied equally to civil servants&mdash;I thought it applied only to members of the Defence Forces&mdash;I would have suggested a recommendation to remove that anomaly now that they will not have the benefit of a non-contributory scheme.  That recommendation would probably have been ruled out of order. Whatever about the civil servants, I greatly regret that a lump sum now payable on the death of a member of the Defence Forces will fall to be aggregated in the estate of the deceased soldier.</P>

      <P>This is the section on which I congratulated the Minister for the step he has taken in making it retrospective.  I wonder if it is now possible to say whether this has been done before.  Perhaps if it has he should not say so but should take credit for doing it for the first time by his silence. I do not follow this.  It was a bit vague in the Finance Act, 1965.  There is a reference to the widow and then to the children who are entitled to benefit and the children who are not entitled to benefit.  I wonder if the Minister would be good enough to give us a clear exposé of what the section is intended to mean.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my congratulations to the Minister for righting an obvious injustice in the Bill.  I should like to think that the debate in the Seanad, which took many hours, had some effect in shaping the Minister's policy on this.  If so, we might enter with renewed vigour amendments to future Bills in the hope that if they are not conceded in the Bill at issue they may affect Government thinking subsequently.  As it stands, the increase here is very welcome, being up to £250 in the case of each child.  I am sorry Senator FitzGerald is not here.  I am sure he would find it very repugnant to the principle he enunciated today.  One question I should like to raise is, in applying the £25,000 limit am I to understand that if there is a death gratuity of less than £5,000 it is not included in the estate calculated for the purpose of the section?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Another point is that many concerns are becoming conscious at the moment of the necessity for widows' pensions.  It is rather unfair that when an estate is concerned these pensions are aggregated on the life expectancy of the widow.  If she is a young widow the aggregation is far more than it is in the case of a widow with an expectancy of only a few years.  That is very wrong and I appeal to the Minister to right the anomaly.  The very least that should be done is that a widow would pay her share as she lived; in other words, rather than aggregating the pension and having the widow pay right there and then the total duty on the aggregation, it could be deducted from the pension over the period of her lifetime. That would spread the burden over the years left to the widow and at the same time free her from having to find a big sum of money immediately after a death when she is in no position to have to deal with financial problems.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister, therefore, to do something about the two difficulties I have mentioned, possibly not this year but next year.  The first is the calculation of the pension based on life expectancy of the widow and the second is that the widow should be allowed to pay as she gets her pension and not have to pay a lump sum on the expectancy that she will live for so many years.  Let the Minister get whatever he thinks he should get from the pension each year.  Why should he be paid in advance?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Senator has in mind will be kept under review. The question of liability for these annuities was not introduced for the first time last year.  It was always there. I am not surprised that Senator O'Quigley did not seem to follow my reply when he asked me who were the dependants and I said children with certain incomes.  That was a misunderstanding. Dependency is determined on the liability for income tax and children are dependants up to 16 years or more than 16 years who are receiving full time instruction in a university, school or college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to come <Col N="1448" /> back to that.  Section 29 defines a dependant as a widow or child and the child is defined as a person up to the age of 16 or more than the age of 16 who is receiving full time instruction in a university, college or school.  If there is a child of a deceased who is receiving full time instruction, that child is a dependent child for the purpose of the section.  May I here draw the Minister's attention to another anomaly?  Supposing there is a child not receiving full time instruction in any of the establishments mentioned but who is an apprentice earning a small amount of money and receiving part time instruction in a vocational school.  It seems to me that child would have been partially dependent on the deceased father.  The amount the child in apprenticeship might be earning would be extremely small in the first year.  I suggest the Minister should give consideration to bringing apprentices within the ambit of the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity Senator FitzGerald has not been here for this. We are now talking about not middle class society but upper class.  A lot of nonsense has been talked about death duty in recent years and the Minister has been put under considerable pressure. We have been told that if we remove death duties completely there will be an influx of wealthy people bringing in wealth, investing it in businesses, providing employment and revenue for the Minister by way of income tax.  A variation of that philosophy is the poor widows and orphans being pounced on by rapacious Revenue Commissioners who seize the wealth of the widows and orphans and reduce them to virtual starvation. There is being built up a climate and we are accepting these arguments without looking critically at them.  The people making these arguments have a very real vested interest.  They are people who have been accumulating a lot of wealth and have the ambition that because they cannot bring it with them they should leave it with their families without the State doing anything about the redistribution of capital <Col N="1449" /> which, I suggest, is a duty and an obligation of this and every other State. I sympathise with that natural feeling of wealthy people.  If I were wealthy I would have the same ambition to prevent my estate being broken up or taken from my dependants on my death.</P>
      <P>I was interested in the last report of the Revenue Commissioners, which is available in the Library.  It is for the year ending 31st March, 1965.  We have a lot of information in that about death duties.  It is shown that the Revenue Commissioners received £4½ million from death duties in that year. If we abolish death duties it means the poor Minister for Finance will have to find somebody else to pay this £4½ million and I suppose we will have more indirect taxation taken out of the pockets of the poor unfortunates instead of, as in this case, taking it out of the estates of the very wealthy. I underline the words &ldquo;very wealthy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We find in this report, for example, that the highest rate of duty operating here is 40 per cent.  It was 53 per cent previously and I think it is 80 per cent in Great Britain.  In that particular year there were 3,000 estates dealt with by the Revenue Commissioners. The total value of those estates was about £31 million after deductions.  If we start breaking down that sum we find that the number of estates exceeding £100,000 in value was 21.  Those estates had between them a total value of £3½ million.  Let me put that into percentages.  That meant that .07 per cent of the estates owned 10 per cent of the wealth of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now, in this Finance Bill, making further concessions and virtually exempting estates up to £25,000.  I was interested in the position in regard to those estates and I found that there were 211 estates exceeding £25,000.  They totalled between them £11½ million.  This, percentagewise, means that seven per cent of the estates owned over 37 per cent of the wealth of the country.  I suggest to Senators that it is a right and proper thing that the State should enter in and get some money from capital at that stage. Death duties, as such, are a good thing <Col N="1450" /> and they must be maintained in this country.</P>
    <P>Remember that death duties are the only capital tax we have in this country.  It seemed from the intervention of the Taoiseach in the Budget debate in the Dáil that he is finally coming around to the idea that we should have a capital tax, something on the lines of that which operates in Britain at the moment.  The only sort of capital tax we have is death duties.</P>
    <P>Let me deal for a moment with the argument about the poor widow and her children.  I applied that case to myself.  I have a wife and four children. I decided I would like to find out what estate I could leave without the Revenue Commissioners getting a halfpenny out of it.  I found the position is that a widow with four orphans gets the first £1,350 duty completely wiped out.  That represents an estate of about £16,000.  In addition, she could have the death benefits Senator O'Quigley has been talking about, of up to £5,000, without attracting any tax at all. Therefore, I could leave £21,000 to my widow and four children without attracting any death duties at all.  I may assure the Seanad I am in no danger in that respect of attracting death duties at all.</P>

      <P>Provided the Minister for Transport and Power makes me chairman of CIE.  We will learn about any chance in that direction tonight. If I felt I was in danger of paying death duties I could make gifts up to £500 to my wife and four children, They would probably die of shock.  That is another £2,500.  Therefore, I could dispose of about £23,000 or £24,000 without attracting any death duties at all. That is the extent to which we have gone to meet representations and arguments about the inequities of death duties and respecting the poor widow and orphans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest the Minister has gone far enough in this respect.  I am not opposing what has been done in this particular Bill but I suggest it is time a halt was called to the representations made <Col N="1451" /> in this respect in the Dáil every year. We cannot afford to forgo death duties.  We cannot afford to do without them.  I suggest, apart from whether we can afford to do without them or not, we should not do away with death duties.  They are a good thing and the State has a responsibility to enter in at that stage and prevent the accumulation of wealth in a few hands.</P>
    <P>We have heard the argument made about abolishing death duties in order to attract capital to this country to promote employment.  One of the fallacies in that is that death duties are at a much lower rate here than in Britain but we do not see people flocking over from Britain with wealth, investing it in industries and providing employment here.  When a person talks about death duties he is not at that enterprising stage when he wants to build factories and provide employment.  He wants to salt away his money in order to avoid the danger of attracting death duties when he passes on.  The only interest a person might have at that stage is to sink his money in land.  I suggest to all Senators that that is a very bad thing.  We do not want to build up the sort of society where people would sink money in big estates and leave less land available for others.  That is a bad system.  We are better off without that.</P>
    <P>Death duties in the Isle of Man are less than they are here but we do not have Irish people going over there with their wealth.  The Channel Islands are much the same in this respect.  Their death duties are much less than they are here.  Despite the fact that they are better off, climatewise than we are, people in this country are not attracted to invest their wealth there.  I suggest to the House and to the Minister that the arguments which have been repeated every year are wrong and the Minister should not give way to any further pressure regarding the abolishing of death duties.  He should not give any more reliefs either.  There may be marginal ones about what Senator Quinlan was saying in regard to aggregating death duties for widows' pensions.  There may be something in that.  Apart from that, we have <Col N="1452" /> gone far enough in giving reliefs in regard to death duties and we should not go any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one brief point in regard to what Senator Murphy has said.  In point of fact the section itself is just a section for the relief of hardship.  We hope that none of us will ever claim the allowance for dependent children under this section because that is for children under the age of 16 on the death of a parent.  We hope that Senator Murphy or any of us will not be availing of that section.</P>

      <P>I think the idea given by Senator Murphy was that this immediately means that in an estate under £25,000 death duties do not apply at all.  The section is concerned with hardship cases and the whole subject of death duties is, of course, not greatly affected by this section. I have a great deal of sympathy for Senator Murphy's views as a whole provided we do not cut off our nose to spite our face, in that something might arise that forces the break up of a family concern or that might ultimately damage that concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with stamp duties and a great deal of revenue is gathered in the form of stamp duty.  On the Housing Bill we urged the Minister for Local Government to converse with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, about stamp duty on houses purchased by young married couples.  This kind of stamp duty at a time like that is a severe burden and I do not know that the Exchequer would lose all that if a marriage gratuity by way of non-taxation were available to young married couples.  I should like the Minister to give consideration to that at some stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to other extra duties my experience is, in relation to court <Col N="1453" /> work, that there is a stamp duty on the issue of a civil bill, on the issue of a summons, on affidavits, notices of motions, and so on.  I wonder if the Minister or his advisers have ever looked into this method of collecting court fees by way of impressed stamps. It seems to me that there is an enormous amount of time wasted in the payment of stamp duties on 2/6 sometimes and 5/-.  There are clerks, solicitors and people like that queueing up in order to pay such small sums.</P>
    <P>In this particular section we are dealing with agreements to pay stamp duty on certain types of instruments in bulk sums.  I have often wondered whether or not we could get rid of this interminable waste of time in the life of the courts in getting documents stamped and paid for, whether it would not be possible to devise a system whereby at the end of the case people could pay out and recover afterwards as part of the cost of the stamp duty in one lump.  The amount of time wasted and the number of man-hours lost, nationally speaking, is a disgrace.  We cannot afford that kind of waste of time.  In addition to that, it has solicitors, their clerks and agents, bothered and bewildered in trying to have all the documents stamped.  If they are not stamped they are not received in court.  I think it ought be possible to devise a system whereby at one point the same revenue could be brought in with perhaps a saving of 100 man-hours.  I think the Minister will do a great service and would save a great deal of time, from the national point of view, if he were able to devise that kind of system.  I always thought that the idea of paying stamp duty on the issue of a civil bill in order to obtain justice is repugnant to my notion of a citizen's right of justice.  A citizen is entitled to justice as he is to fresh air.  It is part of the natural make-up of man. He ought to be entitled to go into court to get justice without having that obstacle before him.  That, however, is another day's work.  Perhaps the Minister might get an examination under way in relation to this and its elimination.</P>

      <P>On section 23 in relation to the dance hall tax, I wonder whether my arithmetic is correct because Senator Sheldon and I had a difference on this the other day. My interpretation is that the tax proposed is 10 per cent and, therefore, on a 7/6d ticket the tax will amount to just 9d.  Then going back to the age when 7/6d was really money, I think the Revenue tax on dances was much higher.  I think the tax on a 7/6d ticket was 1/3d and on a 10/- ticket it was around 2/6d.  Am I correct in assuming that the present tax on tickets under 15/- would be substantially less than was brought in on a corresponding ticket in 1940?</P>

      <P>I just want to make one deduction.  I hope in the <Col N="1455" /> next Finance Bill we will have a realistic tax on dance halls.  Perhaps the Minister would use the moneys got on dance tickets to provide money for education, particularly secondary education, and not have to take it, as Senator FitzGerald recommended in the NIEC Report, from the parents who are already overburdened and already doing a tremendous job in educating their children without thanks from anybody.  We are giving education at a price that is unheard of in the rest of the world.  I think there is plenty of money to be got for secondary education, if the Minister wants a source, by upgrading the dance hall tax to what it was in the 1940s.</P>

I have been rather puzzled at the interpretation which he seemed to put on the two.  I cannot see anything which would exclude a dance because it was a dinner dance.  Yet, the dance question was raised by somebody in the Dáil and the Minister seemed to imply that if, in fact, the dance was accompanied by a dinner it would not come in here.  He brought it a stage further in speaking of occasions when there might be a dance incidental to a social function.  Where is the line drawn? If, in fact, you have a dinner and people just dance after it, how is that distinguished from a dinner dance where people go to a dance and get dinner?  I thought the Minister did not draw the line clearly in the Dáil. That is a practical point and people want guidance on it.  It is quite normal at dances to have meals served.  I think the Minister should give rather more precise guide lines to people as to how they will keep out of the tax and in what circumstances they will be caught.</P>
      <P>I am also interested as to what is the meaning of subsection (9) which says:</P>
      <P>In this section &ldquo;dance&rdquo; includes &ldquo;a ball&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1456" /> I have always wondered what differentiated a ball from a dance.  I never thought I would be able to find out in this way but it seems as good a way as any to find out what is the distinction. I know that a ball is a fancy kind of dance but it seems that there is some distinction between the two. Perhaps the Minister could clarify this point for us also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that the Parliamentary Draftsman advised this definition of a dance to include a ball.  I do not know what the distinction is.  We hear such American terms as &ldquo;somebody has had a ball.&rdquo;  That does not necessarily mean that he has been cavorting in a terpsichorean way.  I am always prepared to accept the advice of experts in these matters and, once it does not do any harm and ensures that a dance is properly defined, there is no reason why a ball should not be mentioned.</P>
      <P>In regard to the distinction between dances and dinner dances, it is not intended that this section should apply to the functions, held in different parts of the country, where dancing is purely incidental to the main purpose of the gathering.  You have all kinds of re-union dinners at which speeches are made and at which dancing facilities happen to be provided&mdash;somebody can play the piano well.  Or take the Federation of Irish Industries or the Federation of Irish Exporters, who have a dinner mainly but if they advertise it as a dinner-dance, then those people would be liable to the tax on a dinner-dance.  But there will have to be a certain area of discretion; I could not define it.  The Senator put three or four examples here.  I could not say what is in and what is out but, by and large, the definition is that a function where dinner is the main purpose, where speeches are made and suffered, where somebody starts playing the piano and women want to dance around, well that is not a dance within the meaning of this section.</P>

      <P>Therefore, in order to avoid taxation, you ask a Minister to come and make a speech. I am not too sure that the Minister will be so pleased with this interpretation <Col N="1457" /> if it increases the amount of invitations he will receive from people wanting to avoid the tax.</P>
      <P>I suppose that the Parliamentary Draftsman, in regard to the other point, may be trying to obscure some possibility of evasion but he seems to have widened it.  The word &ldquo;ball&rdquo; has another meaning.  If dance includes a &ldquo;ball&rdquo; then do all balls, cricket balls, footballs, etc fall to be liable to tax? It would seem that the Parliamentary Draftsman in trying to clarify something has only obscured it.</P>

      <P>This is the kind of thing I take the most strenuous objection to.  I have no shares in dancehalls or anything of that kind but this is the kind of thing which gives rise to a great deal of resentment on the part of the taxpayer.  Here we have a new turnover tax in respect of dances and dancing and even the Minister is not able to tell us at this late stage in the Seanad what is within the scope of the tax.  What will happen is this&mdash;the Revenue Commissioners, the always all-powerful Revenue Commissioners, will say: &ldquo;That is a dance&rdquo; and you will pay your tax.  That is the kind of whip hand which the Revenue Commissioners are always inclined to wield and, certainly, the hand they have. One person says: &ldquo;Well, that was not a dance&rdquo;; another person will say: &ldquo;The Revenue Commissioners say it was and you are liable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where we are imposing taxation we ought to be clear as to what kind of dance we have in mind.  I would have thought, when I saw this, straight away that anywhere a dance was held this turnover tax applied.  The Minister made a reasonable enough case, I think, in the Dáil in connection with a hotel or people providing a meal&mdash; that that part of their activity would <Col N="1458" /> be liable, in any event, to 2½ per cent turnover tax and, therefore, you are not going to impose tax twice upon them at a rate of 2½ per cent and 10 per cent but you do distinguish between the provision of a meal, serving food, drink and so on and the other part of the revenue derived from a dance. There would be one price for the whole dinner-dance.  If that is the kind of thing which ought to be excluded&mdash; because it would be unfair to impose taxation twice&mdash;then what should be included and how it should be defined &mdash;it is not a matter, in my submission, for the Parliamentary Draftsman&mdash;is that dances at which meals are not provided are going to be liable to this full 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>We know the kind of big dancehalls where the Clancy Brothers attend and at which thousands of pounds are made each night.  I am quite happy to see ten per cent being taken there. I detest seeing it in a form of turnover tax, because I do not like this taxation in any event.  We ought to be able to define that.  I am wondering whether or not the Revenue Commissioners will have power, under any special regulation they have, to decide this matter.  I do think the Minister should seriously consider dealing in some other Bill with the kind of dance, the big dance at which the main activity is dancing and at which no meal is served.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan apparently wants this raised from ten per cent to 25 per cent.  In saying that, of course, he completely misunderstands the turnover tax.  The turnover tax was introduced as a small 2½ per cent but, in a couple of years, it is ten per cent and we may be confidently prepared that it will continue to grow.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that there is a misunderstanding about this. In a lot of the rural areas at the moment, wherever they have not a dance hall, they have to rely entirely upon marquees, and in these marquees, dances are usually cheaper than they would be if held in dance halls.  But they will have no escape from this tax. Practically every hotel I know has a dance hall as a part of the premises, whereas in the rural areas where everybody is trying to provide amenities we will be imposing a tax upon them.  I have not the slightest doubt that hotels having a dance hall attached will have no difficulty in providing something like a dinner that will exclude them from the tax but we will be taxing other people who will be better able to afford it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no exceptions in that form.  If there is a dance held and a dinner held with it, if the dance is the main function then it is caught.  By and large, it would be easy enough to distinguish what is a dance as against a dinner without a dance or a dinner at which dancing is incidental.  If there is a band hired&mdash;bands are usually hired for these dances&mdash;or if there is a resident band in hotels&mdash;these will all be caught.  For example, where the charge is 25/- to cover a dinner and dance, if a person has to pay 25/-anyway whether he will eat his dinner or not, that kind of thing will be caught as to 25/-, but the suggestion that the hotel proprietor paying 2½ per cent turnover tax anyway will be <Col N="1460" /> paying ten per cent on top of that is not correct.  He will be paying ten per cent turnover tax in connection with that dance if he is running it himself and he will pay 2½ per cent on the rest of his business.  I suppose that we could argue this all night without getting any clearer definition of what is covered, but, in effect, dances are where dancing is the primary purpose or where dancing is run in connection with another function for which a band is employed&mdash;these would be the conditions that would be covered under that turnover tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has missed my point.  I passed away from this question of definition as such.  I want to know the authority under this for excluding dancing under the conditions that the Minister mentioned.  As I read the section it says that in the case of dances this payment of turnover tax shall be at ten per cent.  The Minister would like, reasonably, to exclude certain functions at which other things happen as well as dancing, where speeches are made and dancing is incidental, but he does not seem to have done that.  At is stands, if in fact there is a dance, which I take it means a number of people dancing together at the same time, generally with some form of music, regardless of what else happens it falls within this section.  On what powers are the Revenue Commissioners able to exercise any discretion in the matter?  It does not seem to me that there is any discretionary power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other question we discussed was a different one, as to the standard to be employed in applying the definition. It appears to me that if dancing is a sufficiently notable feature of the whole performance that should bring it within the definition which the Revenue Commissioners will apply, with whatever legal authority I do not know, because a partial dance will also be a dance, chargeable at ten per cent.  Is this correct?  If so, it seems to me to be quite inequitable, and I do not know how the Minister justifies that.  If dancing is incidental to a dinner, nothing is taxed, but if it is not incidental then both dinner <Col N="1461" /> and dance are taxed, which makes an enormous jump between two conditions which are only marginally different, and I do not think that that can be justified.  The mere fact that dancing occurs with a dinner should not bring that dinner within the charge, and certainly if it is simply a marginal difference but that in one case the dance is merely incidental and is not taxed, and in the other both the dinner and the dance are taxed, that is ludicrous and I am quite puzzled as to why it should be done in that way.  Surely it should be open to anybody organising a dance to so charge for the dance that the dance charge is distinguished from the cost of the dinner by a reasonable apportionment, the Revenue Commissioners having their usual powers to determine what is reasonable apportionment and how much should be payable on the dance, but to say that in some cases dancing is not incidental to a dinner and both the dance and the dinner should be taxed does not seem to be reasonable.  The Minister should reconsider it and let us know on what authority he proposes to exclude certain dances under the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing to establish is that there is a dance.  The Revenue Commissioners must determine that there is a dance and, therefore, if they are satisfied that there is a dance it is taxable under the section.</P>

      <P>Let us say it is a ball, or whatever it is called.  In any case the Revenue Commissioners will tax it. If the Senator is going to make all these fine distinctions about how much is attributed to a meal and how much to dancing we might as well not introduce this at all.  Assuming that a function costs 35/-, by various devices <Col N="1462" /> a proprietor can say that he is putting up such a gourmet's meal that he has to charge 34/- for it, leaving 1/- for the dancing content.  Then we might as well forget about the dance tax.  Every Senator knows that there is an awful lot of dancing done in this fashion. People go to a hotel for a meal and a dance as well.  If they go to the dance and in order to get to it they have to have a meal, the whole charge will come under the tax.  If they go into the hotel and have a meal and dancing is incidental, then the meal will not come under the charge of tax on dances.  There might be two systems whereby you can go to one room for a meal and go into another for the dance, and that dance will be taxed as well.  If we are going to exclude the dances for which a substantial meal is served, then the possibility of making this tax effective would be very limited indeed.  The effective power is in the section as a whole, where the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to impose turnover tax on what they consider to be dancing.  Everybody knows what a dance is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister now says that the Revenue Commissioners can say that a dance is not a dance even if people are dancing, that they are capable of deciding whether the charge for a dinner at a dance is reasonable or not.  They have the power and ability to determine the apportionment as between the cost of the dance and the cost of the dinner, and say that it is reasonable, and they should be able to exercise that discretion.  They exercise a similar discretion on all forms of taxation.  But if the Minister announces in the Dáil, and is repeating here, that there is going to be distinction between cases, giving them discretion where the law gives them no discretion, if the Minister's intention is to exclude dancing which is incidental, he should not simply be able to decide that he will give them this power, but should put it in the legislation if he wishes them to have this desirable discretion. I cannot understand how the Minister can say that the Revenue Commissioners are going to be in a position to decide that a dance is not <Col N="1463" /> a dance, or how it can be suggested that a function at which people are dancing is not a dance, whatever else it may be.  If people are dancing at it it is by any possible definition a dance, and must be so regarded, unless the Minister decides&mdash;which he is perfectly entitled to do&mdash; either to provide some power for the Revenue Commissioners to decide otherwise, or redefines dancing to exclude functions at which dancing is incidental.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the setting up of a new Department of State to be known as the Department of Labour. Heretofore, matters concerning labour, including the administration of the Industrial Relations Act and the body of laws for the protection of workers' health and safety and conditions of employment, have been the responsibility, in the main, of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, though other Government Departments have carried some responsibilities which will be transferred to the new Department of Labour on and after its establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important of these is the administration of the employment exchange service.  The growth of manufacturing industry and the pace of the economic change generally have tended to extend and complicate the problems arising in industrial relations and in the discharge of the Government's functions to protect the interests of workers in matters which are properly the concern of Government.  It is no longer deemed to be practical and <Col N="1465" /> desirable to have these responsibilities kept as a part time responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the development of the manpower policy on which the Government are now engaged and the enactment and operation of legislation which the Government have announced in regard to such matters as the security of employment of industrial workers, redundancy and the introduction of codes of fair employment, will call for the close and undivided attention of one member of the Government assisted by a specialised staff. While industrial relations in the narrow, conventional sense of the term will not be the sole preoccupation of the new Minister, it is likely they will for a long time occupy a great deal of his attention.  It is hoped that by facilitating top level discussion between representatives of employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions it may be possible in time not only to evolve a more favourable climate but to initiate a system which will minimise the danger of stoppages of work through industrial disputes and lead to the introduction of procedures in regard to them which will be more closely related to modern decisions and needs.</P>
    <P>The importance of this to the successful solution of the country's economic problems needs no stressing. The proposal to set up a new Department had general support in Dáil Éireann.  It was the subject of some public debate since it was first put forward by the Irish National Productivity Committee and has been mentioned in reports published to the Oireachtas by the NIEC as well as in the report of the Interdepartmental Committee which considered the administrative arrangements for the operation of a manpower policy. The decision of the Government to proceed with it followed on their examination of the causes and the circumstances of the deterioration in the labour relations situation which followed on the failure of the joint talks between the Federated Union of Employers and the members of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions <Col N="1466" /> on another national wage agreement earlier this year.</P>
    <P>This examination made it clear that the policy heretofore followed by the Government of leaving these matters to be settled by joint action between the two parties in industry, without Government intervention, while theoretically the sounder policy in a free democracy, was not working out as we had hoped and that the situation called not only for more active Government participation in this area but for a general review of the present institutional arrangements, and of the legislative foundation of industrial relations and for the development of a specialist Department where day to day administration could be related to and guided by some basic research activities aimed at the generation and the exploration of new ideas and their discussion with leaders of management and unions.  The general acceptance of this proposal by the Parties in the Dáil and by the Irish public also makes it unnecessary to argue the case for it at any length, whatever differing views may prevail as to how the new Department should function or the nature of the problems with which it will have to contend and the best methods of approaching those problems.</P>
    <P>When the Bill has become law, and the new Department has been constituted, orders will be made transferring the appropriate functions to it from other Departments.  In particular, the administration of the employment exchange service will be transferred to it from the Department of Social Welfare. The employment exchanges are now mainly occupied with the administration of unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance benefits. The employment service proper, that is to say, the service set up to put unemployed workers in touch with employers needing workers, is underdeveloped. It is used mainly by public authorities who, under direction from the Government, are required to fill their labour needs from the employment register.</P>
    <P>It is intended now to make a sustained effort to extend the utility of this service both to workers and employers <Col N="1467" /> and gradually to shift the emphasis in the employment exchanges from the administration of employment benefits to helping workers get in touch with jobs suitable to their needs and skills; to encourage the more active use of the exchanges by employers, involving the canvassing of employers to avail of the exchanges and the linking up of their work with the development of arrangements for industrial training and retraining.  By this I mean, in the case of a worker reporting to an employment exchange that he is unemployed, whether or not he is claiming unemployment benefit, that consideration will be given to the prospects of improving his employment prospects by training of some kind.</P>
    <P>The administration of unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance will continue to be the responsibility of the Minister for Social Welfare but the staffs of the employment exchanges will become the responsibility of the Minister for Labour who will make the payments to beneficiaries on behalf of the Minister for Social Welfare on an agency basis.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects of our labour problems is presented by the increase in the number and the scale of operations of State boards and companies which employ large staffs and provide either essential public services or conduct manufacturing operations. The legislation which was enacted by the Oireachtas setting up those boards and companies gives them autonomy in day-to-day administration and particularly in respect of the recruitment and remuneration of their staffs.  There was an idea at one time that they could remain outside the normal process of wage adjustments by negotiation by automatically applying to their staff wage changes brought about in private employment and by the operation of internal tribunals dealing exclusively with their staffs.  This idea has proved illusory.</P>
    <P>In these days when wage claims are based more on comparisons with other workers than on actual needs and when the force of circumstances has on occasion tended to push those State <Col N="1468" /> boards into a position of lead giving in those matters, however undesirable that may be, the arrangements they make with their staffs often have widespread impact, while the authority of their internal tribunals has been progressively weakened by not infrequent rejection of their findings by some groups of the workers concerned.  It is inevitable, therefore, that the Minister for Labour will have to be concerned with the labour affairs of the boards to the extent, but only to the extent, that they can have repercussions outside their own staffs, either by setting up standards for other groups and trades to imitate, or by reason of the danger of the stoppage of work which might threaten the public welfare or employment of other workers.</P>
    <P>It is not intended that the autonomy of those boards should be invaded or that the Minister for Labour will in any sense be a court of appeal from their internal tribunals.  In the development of a labour policy, however, and a new climate of relations in labour affairs it would be altogether unrealistic to have those State boards, which are very large employers&mdash;some of them are the largest in the State&mdash; outside the ambit of the Minister for Labour.  It is recognised that while he will have to deal with those boards on labour issues he must keep informed the Ministers who are directly responsible for their supervision, particularly whenever there are situations arising that relate to their capacity to fulfil the purposes for which the boards were set up and the development and extension of their activities, which are directly a ministerial responsibility.  In accord with the policy of the Government, State enterprise has been extended to many important public services and into some fields of manufacture. It would be our intention to go further and if possible extend them to meet new requirements and new situations, if they arise, but the feasibility and indeed the desirability of so doing will depend to a very great degree on it being possible to evolve a labour policy that will give safeguards against their monopoly character being exploited to the <Col N="1469" /> detriment of national development generally.</P>
    <P>In the early days of the industrial revolution in other countries protection against the improper exploitation of the workers became a matter of consequence for Government and a body of legislation was built up in every country to protect their health, their safety and their conditions of employment, especially of women and young people.  We consider these are still the proper responsibility of Government although there has been a considerable and significant shift in economic power and there is, perhaps, likely to be more difficulty experienced nowadays by the improper use of economic power by the trade unions than by management.</P>
    <P>We envisage, however, a situation in which protection against arbitrary dismissal from work, against excessive hours, unhealthy conditions, unsafe practices and so forth, will not only continue to be the responsibility of Government but will be based where proper on legally enforceable rights defined by law and applied uniformly throughout each occupation.</P>
    <P>I think everybody hopes we are entering on a new era in this matter and understands also the importance of developing a rational and intelligent procedure for dealing with it if the nation's economic welfare is to be protected and its future economic growth ensured.  These areas of Government policy will be the special responsibility of the new Minister for Labour.  I do not wish to underestimate the magnitude or difficulty of the task being allotted to him.</P>
    <P>It would be far too much to expect that he will be able to clear away all the difficulties but there will be little doubt that he will be able to minimise some of them and start the process of working out a new deal in labour relations which everybody desires.</P>

      <P>It is not very often we have the benefit of the presence of the Taoiseach in this House, and for that reason, and this is the first occasion on which he has come into this House during the life of this Seanad, I should like to say to him he is very welcome here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that he <Col N="1470" /> has not been in this House very often since he became Taoiseach, and I also think I am correct in saying that the last occasion upon which he was in this House was to deal with some labour troubles.  That was the ESB Bill of unhappy memory and timely decease in September 1961 and I suppose it is significant that it is upon another matter in relation to industrial unrest that the Taoiseach is here this evening.  I think that probably the infrequency of the Taoiseach's visits to this House and the fact that he is here this evening on a Labour Bill emphasises the importance and the magnitude of the problem upon which we are engaged.  I think this is to a large extent a non-controversial Bill though the circumstances in which it is introduced are highly controversial.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House&mdash;I speak for myself and my Fine Gael colleagues&mdash;advocated here last March, when we were discussing the White Paper on manpower policy, the establishment of a Ministry of Labour and the appointment of a Minister for Labour.  We feel that at this time, when we are about to come in for very severe competition from industry outside, and for a variety of other reasons, it is necessary to have in Government not merely a Parliamentary Secretary dealing with manpower and having special responsibility for problems relating to it but that there should be at the Government table a Minister with all the authority a Minister of the Cabinet has and the influence he can carry with his colleagues.  I suppose it comes as no surprise to the Taoiseach to learn that we actively support the appointment of a Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has dwelt at some length on the kind of duties the Minister for Labour will have and the problems that will confront him, and, indeed, the problems are extremely complex, very difficult to unravel and difficult to find solutions that will be acceptable to all.  I think perhaps the Taoiseach should bear in mind that while he maintained in the Dáil that his Government had a great record&mdash; and they have a good record in relation to the introduction of the Conditions of Employment Act and the Shops Act, <Col N="1471" /> and things of that kind&mdash;there are still many older trade unions with the scar of the iron rod that was used on them in the days of the wages standstill and that has remained with a lot of middle aged people and trade unions and probably will remain with them until the end of their days.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's Government again in the field of relations with public employees have not a good history. I say this not for the purpose of provoking controversy but I think it is well that the new Minister for Labour and the Taoiseach should realise that there is that kind of attitude abroad.  It must be remembered that for many years the public servants in this country fought a long, hard and unsuccessful battle against the Taoiseach and his colleagues in the Government in trying to establish a system of arbitration for the Civil Service. Indeed, there was a general election held upon this issue.</P>
    <P>I remember as a young boy in the town of Castlebar listening to the politicians of that day proclaiming that we were going to be governed by the Civil Service.  Indeed, all too unhappily we are nowadays governed invisibly too much by the Civil Service and too little by the politicians.  That is the thought that is in the minds of a lot of people in the public service. Happily, I suppose, a lot of those who would be interested or actively engaged in the day to day trade union activities of the Civil Service are now promoted to the higher ranks where they no longer come under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <P>That old tradition, and tradition dies hard in the Civil Service as we all know, is there and it is something that has to be reckoned with by a new Minister for Labour.  Indeed, at the present time there is a great deal of tension and anxiety, as far as I can gather from the public pronouncements of Civil Service officials and officials of other public bodies that their internal scheme of conciliation and arbitration will be annihilated in a newly constructed Labour Court.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. Lynch, who is now Minister for Finance, hinted at that, I think, <Col N="1472" /> in an election broadcast during the last election and I think there has been some reference to it since but to judge by the statements made in the newspapers by a spokesman of the Civil Service associations and trade unions that is a step which will not be welcome. I think that in that field the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour will require to move with what I might call Civil Service caution.  If they do they will not make a mistake very rapidly. One of the causes that have given rise to the kind of problem we have in State and semi-State bodies, responsible to a large extent for the establishment of the pay tribunal, was the absolute failure of the Government, whether it was the Department of Finance, Local Government, Industry and Commerce or Transport and Power, to take any active part in the development of a pattern of pay scales.  Time was when the Department of Finance absolutely refused to consider any offer of an increase in Civil Service remuneration. Consequently, the remuneration of all public employees and very often the ESB and others was controlled by this until such time as&mdash;to use a glorious, time-honoured and oft repeated phrase &mdash;the outside pattern had emerged.  In time, when the outside pattern did emerge the public sector took their cue from it and then, when that operated to the benefit of the people in the public sector, they were told that this kind of leap-frogging, this maintenance of the differentials, could not continue. The rules of the game were changed and this new pay tribunal was established.</P>
    <P>What I feel is the proper thing to do now is for the public sector and the private sector in industry and the services to deal with these problems as they arise.  In time these wage levels will be settled upon different conditions and circumstances and they will not be entirely related to one another. I think the new pay tribunal, for that reason, will create a whole lot many more problems than it will solve.  That is another day's work but there never has been, in my view, a desire on the part of public departments to get in there with their own employees and <Col N="1473" /> deal with their pay claims here and now.  There has been far too much waiting for Godot and when Godot did emerge and was beneficial to the public sector, he was overthrown and displaced.  There is that kind of an attitude which I hope has, to some extent, been got away from in modern times, for the simple reason that conciliation and arbitration which has been in operation in this country for most of the public sector&mdash;it began in 1950&mdash;to some extent got away from the outside comparisons.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Labour is going to be an effective Minister it seems to me he will have to set a good example. He is not an employer but he can, I think, and ought to influence the pattern of behaviour between management and employees in the various semi-State bodies and, indeed, in the Civil Service, local authorities and elsewhere.  My experience has been&mdash; purely as a member of the public I say this&mdash;that in many of the cases in which employees feel they have a wages claim, want to get shorter hours, or want to deal with promotion&mdash; which is always a very important matter to persons in the public service &mdash;their claims are properly dealt with in the first place, by an establishment officer or personnel officer, but all too infrequently, the trade union officials see the heads of these bodies.  How frequently does the Chairman of CIE, the ESB or any of these other large bodies meet the trade unions to discuss a particular claim with them?  If labour relations are all that important, and I believe them to be extremely important, I do not think it is outside the functions or dignity of any board of directors or board of any statutory authority to depute some of their members to meet those people and to have negotiations at top level.</P>
    <P>I have always had the experience, as a one-time official of a Civil Service association, that when you could get absolutely nowhere with the establishment officer, with the assistant secretary in charge of establishment, and nowhere with the secretary, eventually, after a lot of knocking, you got to the Minister, whether it was the Minister for Finance, Social Welfare, Agriculture, <Col N="1474" /> Industry and Commerce or whoever he was, and then you got a hearing and, more often than not, a good deal was conceded.  Ministers, by that kind of a discussion, I think, oftentimes learned quite a lot of what was going on in their Departments.  Equally so, the chairman of semi-State boards could learn quite a deal of the outlook, hopes and aspirations, fears and misgivings of their own employees by meeting them on the more important kind of trade union matters which are of concern to their employees.  That goes on all too infrequently.  If there was more contact at board level, we might have a great deal less friction.  I recollect, indeed, that that was the position in the case of the bank strikes a long time ago.  I do not know whether they only met the office boy from the Banks Standing Committee.  I do not know whether they have changed that and whether or not at this time the bank directors are negotiating with their opposite numbers in the trade unions.  Perhaps they are too grand for that.  If they are not, that might be some solution to this particular problem in which they are involved.</P>
    <P>The time of the establishment of a Ministry of Labour or a Department of Labour is somewhat unfortunate, in that it is linked with a very serious problem for which the Government provided a very unpleasant remedy.  Of course, the Taoiseach, I am sure, must be extremely pleased that this useful diversion has distracted public attention from what went on that time.  I would have been a great deal more happy myself, if six months ago, a year ago, or two years ago, when there was no great crisis looming up, a Bill of this kind was brought in.  So be it, it is none the less welcome.  But what has always struck me as extraordinary&mdash; and for a long time I did not understand it until I saw the explanation given in reply to a Parliamentary question&mdash;was the fact that when you had strikes in CIE or in the ESB it was not the Minister for Transport and Power but the Minister for Industry and Commerce who intervened.  The explanation was that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had responsibility for industrial relations, the functioning <Col N="1475" /> of the Labour Court and things of that kind.  I am almost afraid to refer to the good Minister for Industry and Commerce because any reference to him nowadays seems to be regarded as an attack upon him.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to make any reference to or cast any slight of character on the Minister for Transport and Power.  The Minister for Transport and Power is responsible for the semi-State bodies, and having responsibility for them I think that it is up to him by persuasion, using his influence through discussion with the boards of these various authorities, to get them to put their house in order, and in this the Minister for Labour should join.  Unless the State through these various bodies gives some kind of a lead to the private sector in this country all the exhortations from the Minister for Labour or the Minister for Industry and Commerce will fall upon deaf ears as far as the private employers are concerned.  Very often innovations are introduced in these public companies with no consultation whatever with trade unions in advance, not even information that they are coming in.  That is taking place to a lesser extent than once upon a time, but it seems that if we want to make a real effort to promote good relations in a body like the ESB or CIE we must bring in that other vital part of the industry, the workers.  I can see no objection to consulting regularly with workers and having regular consultations upon a variety of topics which should be agreed between the boards of management and the trade unions.</P>
    <P>I know that the Taoiseach may say that under the schemes of consultation or whatever kind of staff relations CIE had there was provision for that kind of thing.  I am aware of that, but to what extent was it in fact used?  Was it just something put in piously at the time when the scheme was being drafted in the hope that everybody would forget about it?  There should be real and genuine consultation to let the workers know the reasons why things are being done, what the aim is, hear what their fears are, and, in so far as <Col N="1476" /> it is possible to do so, to allay them. If that is not done those fears are going to be there anyway and something will have to be done at some stage in order to meet what may be the legitimate objections of trade unions to certain innovations.  It would be a good thing if the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Transport and Power in relation to semi-State bodies could inaugurate some kind of scheme of regular consultation with the workers in those industries so as to at least keep the workers informed on what is being done.  It is important if that were being done that the people who would be consulted should not be the persons who will afterwards have to do the negotiation of wage claims and other matters relating to conditions of service of the employees.  To have the same people consulted who do the negotiations would be to some extent to draw the teeth of the fighting members of the trade unions, who must always be left there to deal with the particular matter in the way they think best.</P>
    <P>Having done something along these lines, it seems to me also that when the Electricity Supply Board or Córas Iompair Éireann or other bodies are floating loans&mdash;I do not know whether they do it nowadays&mdash;there should be some kind of scheme whereby workers in those industries would be able to take shares or stock in the various loans and to acquire some kind of stake in the industry.  That could quite readily be done by appropriate arrangements for deduction from pay where people want that facility.  If the facility is provided one may well find that it will be availed of, and availed of to an increasing extent.  It would give some sense of belonging to the workers in the particular employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour will have a great deal of work to do.  I think that he will want to have the wisdom of a Solomon, the patience of Job, the hide of a rhinoceros, and after all that he will get very little thanks from anybody and a great deal of blame from everybody.  He is faced with an extremely difficult job in trying to bring peace among what may not be a great number of industries but maintaining general peace in the various <Col N="1477" /> industries and services which operate within the State.  He will have to do a good deal of education of employers. I want to stress this, that that education cannot be carried out at the dinner-dances we were talking about here this evening.  That is not the time at which people are in the mood to digest the weighty words of a Minister for Labour.  He will have to inaugurate some kind of course or scheme or system of distribution of booklets upon management and upon how to co-operate with trade unions as a vital element in the industrial and commercial life of this country.</P>
    <P>To my mind employers fall into three categories.  There are those who do not like trade unions and are opposed to them.  That is not a great number, but there are some of them who have a settled dislike of trade unions and everything appertaining to them.  One meets them from time to time.  There are, then, a great number of employers, I do not know how many, who merely tolerate trade unions as a kind of necessary evil, and who try to get on with them because they are there and because it makes life that bit easier to try to co-operate with them.  Then there are the small number of employers who get on very well with trade unions and who value them as a useful adjunct in the running of their business.  The Minister for Labour will have a great deal of cultivation of employers in order to get them to accept that trade unions exist because there is a need for them and that trade unions have a right to make their case and that they have reasons for most of the things that they seek most of the time even if what they claim cannot be met.  I have known employers&mdash;and indeed, employers engaged in very lucrative export business&mdash;who have steadfastly watched the shop steward, shifting him around from this employment to that and to the other and eventually putting him in the position where every movement of his could be watched.  That is the kind of thing that is done for the purpose of making him feel so unstable that he just leaves the firm or that he will find it so difficult <Col N="1478" /> that he will resign his position as shop-steward. There is another employer who has as little time for trade unions and shop stewards as he has for the seconds that are produced by his factory.  They are really for the scrap heap as far as he is concerned.  When it comes to the interpretation of their terms and the fulfilment of the bargains made with him there is no lawyer who would find more loopholes through which he can escape from his obligations better than he can or who would be as good in doing it as this particular employer.  I must say, strangely enough, that this is a thing about which he has been very successful.  I suppose that there are certain things you can do through fear.  I do not say that people like this represent any appreciable size of the body of employers, but the fact that that kind of outlook and mentality exists is quite deplorable, and that is the kind of thing which the Minister for Labour will have to deal with.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the trade unions will have to realise, as I think a great many of them do, that there is need for a certain code of principles and rules which should guide their activities. What I should like to see is the unions by agreement amongst themselves agreeing to certain kinds of things they will voluntarily undertake to do.  One of the things it is necessary for them to do is, where there is an unofficial strike in circumstances in which there is no justification for the strike to occur, not to make it official afterwards. One often hears from workers in industry that if some of the local shop stewards do not get their way immediately upon something from the employer&mdash;if there is a refusal on the first occasion&mdash;instead of approaching it in a different way, or leaving it altogether for the time being, their first course is to think: &ldquo;We will strike and teach him.&rdquo;  All too readily that is the first approach and, even though those strikes do not materialise, that is not a good outlook.  People in the responsible position of shop stewards will have to get a greater understanding of their own responsibilities, and <Col N="1479" /> papers to look at this matter and see if they can be more helpful in promoting good industrial relations in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in introducing this Bill to the House, is asking us to sanction the appointment of a new Minister for Labour. Significantly, like many other Bills which have been introduced in this House this term, it has the general approval of the House, if one can judge, particularly from the speeches which have been made already by the Opposition members.  One might say, in passing, that though these objections have not been raised here, the main objections to this new appointment have not been directed against the Ministry itself but against some other Ministries, as if they were inherently involved in this new appointment to cover these modern circumstances.  I think it merely warrants a passing reference here that the criterion must surely be, in relation to the functions of every Ministry and of the man in charge of that Ministry, as to the responsibility and direction which he biars, and not necessarily as to the amount of work or the amount of drudgery which he puts in in any one day.  Certainly, it cannot be related in any sensible way and I think the Taoiseach has very effectively given the lie to this; it certainly cannot be related to the population, as if one should have one Minister for 200,000 people or for 400,000 people or, as was pointed out in more populous countries of Europe, per 2½ million people.  I mean one of the more populous countries of Europe.  Each nation in the conduct of its own affairs must naturally legislate for its own affairs and make provision in such legislation, in such conduct, for the suitable offices, and I am satisfied, and indeed, all reasonable observers of the present scene in Ireland, I think, are satisfied that the time has come for the appointment of such a new Ministry.  I feel that though it may have been activated immediately by some of the recent problems we have seen in industrial relations, in many ways it is rather a <Col N="1480" /> happy sign of the development we have seen in this nation.</P>
      <P>When one thinks that approximately 30 years ago a limit was set to the number of Ministers under the Constitution which we should have in this country, and at present some people are expressing fears that possibly now we are about to reach the quota set down as the maximum by the Constitution of 30 years ago, in all reason and with all objective criticism of the development of this nation in the past 30 years we have developed and become a more complex society than could have been envisaged at the time of the framing of that Constitution. So far from needing an excuse to justify the appointment of a new Ministry, in fact, if anything I would agree with those who might say that the appointment has been, if anything, somewhat retarded because thanks to the economic development and growth of this nation over the past few years particularly this, with other problems, has followed in its trail, problems which are, as I said on the last occasion, characteristic of the very success we have created.</P>
      <P>We have become a more highly urbanised and more industrialised society, and this brings in its turn a more impersonal relationship than one normally experiences in the rural relations that Ireland has been somewhat noted for up to recent years.  One thinks in terms of a comparison with the almost father-son relationship that existed between farmers and their faithful labourers for many years.  That was very much a characteristic of Irish life. Such a labourer was very largely a part of the farmer's family, but you find that now in the rural community in Ireland that is fading from the scene.  Surely if such relationships are fading from the scene in our rural community certainly even more significant changes are taking place in the industrial and urbanised communities. As I say, without going into any great detail, there is obviously every justification and need there for this new appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many aspects of this new Ministry which the Taoiseach has referred to here this evening and in his introductory speech in the Dáil. <Col N="1481" /> these matters and bringing his mind to bear on the rights and wrongs, and make a decision, or else he will not do it properly.  If Ministers have to spend all that time on that kind of administrative detail, it is because they have taken more and more upon themselves in the various pieces of legislation which have passed through Oireachtas Éireann in the past number of years.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach might bear this in mind in relation to other Bills that will come before the Houses in his time: the time must come when these matters will have to be taken away from Ministers and handed to some quasi-judicial body.  In my opinion Ministers cannot concern themselves with these things when they are attending to their constituencies, attending the Dáil and, at the same time, give the kind of thorough examination and deep thought to the problems with which they should properly be concerned.  Of course, they have their officials dealing with these matters but in my opinion there is no substitute for the proper understanding of any problem other than getting down to it in all its details and ramifications, having a good look at it and giving a great deal of thought to it.  When you have done that, there can be consultation on the advice of your officials and solutions can be propounded.</P>
    <P>I agree that Ministers cannot busy themselves on these problems if they have to concern themselves with too much detail.  I hope the Taoiseach will give that tilt to legislation in the future which will prevent the various matters in legislation being brought within the ambit of ministerial decision so that some of the existing institutions will be used to a greater extent.  There is one piece of advice I proffer to the unknown Minister for Labour.  If he wants to get a proper understanding of active trade unions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator is giving the Taoiseach cause to be proud of one of his nominations.  I was about to say that the new Minister for Labour must acquaint himself with what the executives of unions have to deal with.  The only way the new Minister can get to understand that is to attend not the dinners or the openings of new trade union buildings but to procure for himself some trade union invitations to attend branch meetings and executive meetings just to see what is going on.  If he does that he will have a real insight into the kind of problems&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that people in responsible positions in trade unions have to deal with and the kind of reaction they are likely to be up against when they fail their members. When the national wage agreement was being negotiated I thought it would be a disastrous failure because it was against all experience that people in trade unions would sit back for two and a half years and make no move for the improvement of the conditions of their members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody with the slightest idea of how trade unions work would not propound such a thing.  What happens is that Brother So-and-So proposes and Brother So-and-So seconds that certain action should be taken.  It is passed on acclamation after debate on what the amount should be.  There is never any dispute as to what the members are entitled to.  It goes to the executive and maybe the timing of the claim is decided by them.  To suggest that trade unions should go into cold storage for two and a half years was almost tantamount to asking them to commit suicide.  It showed lack of understanding of the purpose, the functions and the functioning of trade unions to suggest that they should mark time for two and a half years.  I say sincerely that if the new Minister for Labour has not got that kind of experience he should acquire it during a period.  If he does, I believe <Col N="1483" /> he will find it easy enough to understand the mentality of the employers and that he will make a good Minister for Labour.  There is very little else I wish to say on the Bill.  I hope when the Taoiseach announces his appointment and when the new Department is established the great expectations we have for the new Minister will be fructified in time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the welcome to the Taoiseach.  I was particularly struck by his speech in introducing the Bill.  There might be temptation for Senators to say a few formal words and leave it to the Seanad to approve of this Bill because we are all in agreement that the Bill should pass.  What I say, I hope will be directed towards the Bill but I cannot promise to avoid disturbing some of my friends on the other side.</P>
      <P>I said I welcomed the Taoiseach. I should say also, of course, that I welcome the Bill.  In the Labour Party, particularly, we welcome the decision to set up a Ministry of Labour. On behalf of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions I have also to say that the decision to set it up is welcomed. It could not be otherwise because Congress have been pressing for this for some years and the affiliated trade unions will be glad to co-operate with the new Minister and his Department. I think this is probably one of the few countries among western democracies that has not got a Ministry of Labour, and that brings me to the point of regretting that we have to wait until now to see this Ministry set up.  There was, I think, a Minister for Labour in the Cabinet of the First Dáil.  It is a pity that Ministry was dropped subsequently.  I do not know the history of it but I submit that if we had such a Ministry in close contact with labour relations, certainly in the last year or two, things might have been a little better than they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say this knowing that I possibly will disturb Senators across the way. Things have not been determined at national level in the past twelve months or so.  I had hopes, and so had many others, that there was being built up some understanding between employers <Col N="1484" /> and trade unions at top level&mdash;that they had begun to realise one another's difficulties, that they were, perhaps, not prepared to agree, but were prepared to examine the cases made by the other side and have some appreciation and understanding of them.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that in the past year or so the leadership in the employers' side has gone over to backwoodsmen. I say this deliberately: some of them are very stupid people.  I know it hurt some of my colleagues on the other side during the debate on the Finance Bill.  I am not saying they are all stupid or that they are all backwoodsmen but the tendency has gone in that direction and it is deplorable.  I hope they will mend their ways and that the general atmosphere will improve.  I am not saying that all trade union members are responsible, far-seeing people.  That is not the case but among the leadership in trade unions a sense of responsibility has developed, always appreciating what trade unions are there for.  I shall come back to that in a moment.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise sharply the position of semi-State undertakings in the context of employers' organisations. We had the right to hope that in the semi-State undertakings labour relations could be good.  I admit, of course, that there are two sides to the story.  I had hoped that with semi-State undertakings there could be more progress towards co-determination, more linking of workers with the organisations concerned rather than have the boss and the higher ten.  I am afraid that has been happening in recent years. I know that the Taoiseach, when Minister for Industry and Commerce, had responsibility for most of the semi-State undertakings.  I am prepared to acknowledge, from dealings I had with him, that he was progressive in his approach to those matters and that his view always seemed to be that the semi-State bodies should meet and talk with the trade union movement and discuss their problems.  The situation in recent years has been completely contrary to that.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was responsible for promoting legislation in 1950 and 1958 to deal with CIE.  He has also experience of the long history of the negotiating <Col N="1485" /> machinery with regard to the railways since the Railways Act, 1924. There existed a scheme for dealing with disputes between the unions and the various railways companies.  CIE inherited that.  That existed for nearly 40 years and not one strike arose out of a recommendation of that internal machinery of negotiation.  There was an agreed machinery of negotiation which was far ahead of its time in 1924.  That machinery was built up and played an important factor in respect of negotiations with regard to the railways.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we should try to build up that type of machinery to deal with disputes rather than give strike notice and hope the Labour Court will intervene.  I am speaking personally in this matter when I say that there is need for some sort of joint industrial council to deal with matters of this sort.  Some of those disputes affect not only those in the particular board but they also affect workers outside it.  I accept that and I accept that the time had probably arrived when there was need to take a look at the internal machinery which existed.</P>
    <P>What happened in CIE?  There was no question of waiting for a new industrial relations Act.  There was no question of consultation with the trade unions.  CIE simply said: &ldquo;This machinery provides for six months notice.  We are now giving you notice. At the end of the six months notice the machinery goes.&rdquo;  That machinery has gone since last December.  This was an industry in which there was a long tradition of respect for the machinery of negotiation.</P>
    <P>There was also machinery for dealing with the more minor disputes. &ldquo;Disputes&rdquo; is probably not the right word.  The Taoiseach may remember that where there was a question of the grading of a job for a particular individual this could be discussed by elected representatives of the group or grade concerned and the management.  If agreement could be reached that settled it and if agreement could not be reached that was the end of it.  The management had the last word.  This built up a tradition of discussing the implementation of an agreement which <Col N="1486" /> was signed and which set down the terms and conditions of employment. This sort of thing happened.  It was very necessary and desirable.  Again, CIE said that that provision was subject to six months notice.  They said they would give six months.  That machinery has gone from the 1st July. Again, as I said, there has been a long tradition of trying to deal with those things by agreement and discussion.</P>
    <P>I said this before and I say it again. I blame the Minister for Transport and Power for breaking this tradition. I am quite certain from various discussions we had that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not aware, and has not been aware, of what the Minister for Transport and Power has been up to.  I had a case last week in which a claim for some grades in CIE was awaiting a hearing in the Labour Court.  CIE instructed the local management to sack the people and employ others.  I am not going into the details.  I am just giving an instance of the kind of dictatorial attitude adopted by the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>

      <P>I will have him in tonight and I will say certain things to his face.  The Taoiseach is here now. It is a strange thing when the Minister for Transport and Power is in trouble he always says that he is speaking on behalf of the Government.  The Taoiseach is chief of the Government.  We can reasonably argue, as we did in the case of the ESB, when we had the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who.  God help him, came in here with the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know he is but we all need God's help, including the Senator.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce came in here on that occasion regarding the situation in the ESB.  A tribunal was appointed for the ESB some years ago.  In fact, there <Col N="1487" /> were two tribunals.  Both those tribunals were to be merged but nothing has been done with regard to that. Earlier I referred to the position of the semi-State undertakings and the whole set up of labour-employer relations. I said that we would expect the development of good relations in those employments.  I accept, as I said earlier, that there are two sides to the story.  I am not speaking objectively in this matter.  I am speaking as a trade union and labour representative and I am speaking from where my heart is, namely, on that particular side.  As I said, we have had a situation where relations have got worse in recent years.  I wonder, in fact, if we had the Minister for Labour prior to this whether the position would be better.  I think it would because the Minister for Labour should know what is happening in the semi-State undertakings where difficulties have occurred and where difficulties are continuing to occur.  I hope that the new Minister will know exactly what is going on in regard to labour relations in those semi-State undertakings and that it will not be the function of the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
      <P>If relations have been bad that has been due, as I said, to the very conscious decision of the employers who declared war against the trade unions. People resented that remark when I said it last, but let me underline the fact that for about six months last year Congress, in a situation in which the value of the tenth round had been worn away by price increases, was trying to negotiate some stop-gap arrangement, some increase to alleviate the hardship of the workers, and the employers were not prepared to co-operate. They were simply continuing the negotiations, playing for time and eventually, as the Taoiseach knows, in January the Congress had to make a decision one way or the other.  What they did was a very sensible and responsible thing.  They recommended to their affiliated unions that in the present circumstances of the economy the unions should proceed to try to secure increases of not more than £1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employers still had the opportunity <Col N="1488" /> of trying to come to some understanding at national level in that situation and they knew very well, and the semi-State undertakings particularly must have known, that that round of increases would be secured. The case was there 100 per cent for the £1 increase and that it would be secured but apparently some backwoodsman within the employers' organisation did not want an agreement and had been acting on the theory that you must make the trade unions fight for everything.  You must try and exhaust the workers, have strikes, try to exhaust the funds of the trade unions.  That is a bad situation but it is no harm to say what we on our side feel is the true situation.</P>
    <P>We are not saying it in any vindictive or incriminatory way.  We realise that the employers have a right to fight if they want.  We have that right and we reserve it.  Let us face the fact that that has been happening and we are now prepared to co-operate not alone with the new Minister but with employers' organisations to try to improve the general atmosphere.  I am sure I am as much at fault as everybody else but in this matter one is inclined to over-sympathise.  We are dealing with human relations and human relations are always difficult.</P>
    <P>Let me go back to the point I made a short while ago about the function of trade unions.  What are they for? This was best summed up by Jim Larkin when he spoke at the Irish Management Institute at Easter in Killarney.  He was making the point that too many managements and employers had wrong ideas with regard to trade unions.  They thought the trade union's job was that of management, to help management to discipline workers and to help in increasing productivity, and that the attitude of management was that there was a joint partnership between trade unions and management, but the same people are never prepared, of course, to have any sort of joint co-determination. Certainly they run in horror of the idea of joint ownership.  They imagine that the job and the responsibility of trade unions is to be an aid to management and industry.  That is <Col N="1489" /> not so.  Let us always appreciate that the job of the trade union is to protect the members of the trade union.  That is our job.  If we have to hurt people in doing it it is too bad, and we would regret it, but it is our job to protect the interests of the trade union members.</P>
    <P>Let us also remember, and be blunt about it, that we largely represent the underprivileged.  The House have seen the report on the financing of education in Ireland.  Senators know the percentage of people who do not go beyond the sixth standard in school. They know that these tend to be from the same social structure, the same sector of the social structure at all times, father and son and son again. That is the sort of situation we have and these are largely the people the trade unions are there to protect and who in turn determine the policy and the attitudes of the trade union.  Trade union leaders are not there to dictate policy to the individual members of the trade unions.  We can attempt to guide, to influence, in ways to lead, but policy in democratic trade unions is determined by the individual members of the trade unions and let us always realise, and I repeat it, that we largely represent the underprivileged. I know the Taoiseach may say: &ldquo;Look, Murphy, you represent salaried workers and you cannot claim they are underprivileged&rdquo;.  I accept that. I am saying that largely the trade unions represent the underprivilged.</P>
    <P>We must have regard to our responsibilities to those people, and fight continuously to improve their standard of living.  We make no apology whatever for that but we are prepared to do it in a situation in which we want a steadily increasing standard of living for our people.  We do not want strikes.  They are the last resort. We do not engage in strikes for the purpose of kicking somebody.  The people who suffer most are the workers out on strike.  We want steadily increasing standards of living.  We want steady and expanding employment. We want all these things and we are prepared to co-operate.</P>
    <P>Again, let me be blunt about this. The trade unions and the people they <Col N="1490" /> represent have no vested interests in maintaining the present industrial and social structure.  That does not mean, and do not misunderstand me here, that there is an attitude amongst trade unions towards a tearing down of our social structure, a tearing down of our economy.  That is not so.  The point I make is that they are largely the underprivileged.  They will continue to be the underprivileged no matter what improvement is made but they have no vested interests in maintaining the present organisation of industry as it is.  If industry is to be made a success the responsibility lies with management and with the employers. It is they who have the vested interests in making a go of it.  It is they who must give the leadership.</P>
    <P>The more I become involved in trade union affairs, in trade union experiences, if that is the appropriate expression, the more convinced I am that it is largely a question of leadership. I meet workers and members of other trade unions and I know their difficulties.  I generally find that where people are properly led they are happier in their work.  There are fewer complaints and things are going relatively smoothly.  Possibly in management they tend to overlook their responsibilities in this matter.  Management is seated behind a desk making decisions and it is a tough job and I am not critical on that matter.  One of the greatest responsibilities and challenges of management is to lead the workers, have contact with them, know them, so that there will be a mutual exchange between them and confidence between the two sides.  There must continue to be the two sides to industry. Where leadership exists the position is generally better and you will find less stress.  I am sure that the Taoiseach must be thinking of some cases in which leadership has been very good and where strikes have been practically unknown.  I can think of some of them right away.  You are aware that there is good management who are consciously leading the industry, where the workers have confidence in it and where the relationship is good.</P>
    <P>There are two points I want to make in conclusion and I will be brief <Col N="1491" /> because I think we are going to allow speeches from the other side tonight. The first point is in regard to the staffing of this new Ministry.  This will take over a good deal of the functions of the Department of Industry and Commerce and we have already from that Department hived off the Department of Transport and Power.  Earlier than that, I think, we had the Industrial Development Authority.  This has been a good Ministry, a good Department and it had a good Minister for many years and it still has.  The approach to this should not simply be one of taking people from Industry and Commerce and, so far as is necessary, Social Welfare but rather should we look to the Civil Service as a whole&mdash;not just the general grades but the other grades within the Civil Service structure for people who have aptitudes and qualities of mind suitable to the work in this Department.  I think that the work of this Department and the work of the new Minister will be of fundamental importance to us.  The degree of industrial progress, the degree to which we will develop our society in the next decade or so will largely depend upon the success or failure of the Minister in this new Department.  Instead of simply hiving people off from their jobs that, in the long term interest, we should look around the people in the Civil Service as a whole, in all sorts of grades and try to get people who have special qualities and skills for the type of work which will be involved in this Department.</P>
    <P>The second concluding point I want to make is in regard to newspaper publicity in regard to industrial disputes.  I shall be very brief on this.  I suppose the Taoiseach will rightly say: &ldquo;Well, look I cannot do anything about this&rdquo;. I am drawing attention to the difficulties often created for both sides involved in industrial relations by our newspapers.  Now I accept it is the job of the newspapers to report news, but surely we should not have had a situation such as we had last Saturday when there was some offer made by electrical contractors, including the ESB, which was objected to by one union, that that should have been front page news with the newspapers already putting them <Col N="1492" /> into their corners for a set-back, with no regard to the possibilities of negotiations and compromise in the meantime. The newspapers immediately got wind of this and put the ETU into one corner, the ESB into another and the Minister for Industry and Commerce into yet another.  It is terribly difficult for trade unions and trade union leaders to do the best for their members with this sort of newspaper coverage. My reaction I must say, after some experience, is to try to keep the newspapers out of these things altogether. You may say I am hiding the truth; sometimes yes, by preventing this sort of publicity, because you find that, by this sort of thing, disputes are built up.</P>
    <P>I had another experience of this&mdash; one of our bus disputes, not possibly the last one but one some two years ago when the dispute was largely made by the evening newspapers who started off about six months beforehand warning of the danger of a bus dispute or of a Dublin bus stoppage until eventually the employees, who did not know what it was all about, were conditioned to a frame of mind that there would be a strike anyway. This is not malicious on the part of the newspaper people.  I do not know how it can be rectified unless, maybe, the Taoiseach, from his position of influence, would try to persuade the newspapers to report in as responsible a way as possible.  Perhaps &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; is not the appropriate word but bad judgment on many occasions has led to the situation I have already mentioned. Anyway, we should try to prevent this because, as I say, I am satisfied that many of these disputes could have been prevented had we not had the sort of newspaper publicity we did have earlier on in the matter. If a strike takes place, it is O.K.; it is a matter for news and one to be covered by the newspapers, but I am talking about the ordinary industrial negotiations that go on time and time again&mdash;an offer made, an offer rejected and, when we reject an offer, we do not necessarily take off our coats and say: &ldquo;That is that, boys&rdquo;; it is a part of negotiation.  I am sorry for talking so long on this but perhaps the Taoiseach could bring his influence to bear on the matter and try to persuade the news <Col N="1493" /> be less ready to show the mailed fist upon every occasion the employer does not meet their demands.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil the Taoiseach referred to some of the intractable disputes that take place from time to time.  It was suggested that he was thinking aloud in making the suggestion that it might be necessary to impose a solution in the case of an intractable dispute for which there did not appear to be any negotiable solution.  Rather than thinking aloud I think he was probably throwing out this idea in the hope that it would not be challenged too strongly.  It was a feeler more than thinking aloud.  There are certain types of strikes and one wonders will they ever end but, with the exception of the famous strike in the Dún Laoghaire public house, most strikes come to an end sooner rather than later.  There nearly always is a solution, and one wonders why it was not thought of in the beginning.</P>
    <P>I would rather hope that in the re-organisation of the Labour Court, the way in which it will be manned, and the kind of principle upon which it will act, will be such that either side to a dispute will be in a position to dare the other side to go to the Labour Court where the Labour Court will determine the matter for them impartially. This is like the situation that very often arises in regard to law cases where someone has a claim against another for one thing or another and litigation is the end result.  It is always a test of the strength of the other person's case as to whether or not he will go the whole hog and go to court. Eventually they must put up with the decision.</P>
    <P>I do not say the Labour Court should be like that but I hope it will develop in such a way that both management and the trade unions will feel that if they resort to the Labour Court a decision will be arrived at which it would be very difficult for either side to criticise.  That is the kind of situation we hope to achieve.  If the Labour Court acts upon principle and not upon expediency, if it builds up its own code of principles in dealing with the labour disputes which come before it, in time people will probably resort <Col N="1494" /> to it in the belief that the Labour Court will produce the type of award which it will be very difficult for either side to reject.  If we could get that kind of court&mdash;and I am not at all without hope that we will get it&mdash;that would be far better than making inroads upon the liberty of trade unions which would produce more industrial unrest than it would quell.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred in the Dáil also to the amount of work Ministers have to do.  He advocated an extension rather than a contraction in the number of Ministers in the Government.  I rather took from him, when he was dealing with that aspect, that he urges his Ministers from time to time to go around the country, to go to these various functions and so on, to keep in touch with public opinion and that he felt they did not do that sufficiently because they had so many decisions involving them personally and requiring them to spend so much time in their offices.</P>
    <P>I do not at all agree that that is the way in which Ministers of State will acquire a knowledge of what is going on in the country.  In some respects in recent times, as I said on a Bill the other evening, some Ministers of the Government have shown themselves not to be in touch with the requirements of the public and with public opinion.  To illustrate that I referred to the disastrous provisions in the Succession Bill which was first introduced, then withdrawn and then re-introduced. There are other illustrations with which I will not delay the House at this time.</P>
    <P>I believe Ministers have too much to do, but if they have it is because in Bill after Bill coming before Oireachtas Éireann they are taking more and more decisions upon themselves. In the Town Planning Act there are perhaps 50 different matters concerning the local authorities all over the country which have to be personally decided on appeal by the Minister for Local Government.  One of two things will happen.  Either the Minister will spend his time reading the recommendations of his officials, studying One could be excused for picking out <Col N="1495" /> some aspects of them which would help to develop comparisons with other countries, other constitutions and problems faced elsewhere, because it will be recognised immediately that even to attempt at this stage to cover the whole range of problems and administration that this new Ministry will deal with would be foolhardy, and possibly even those who are now setting the limits and the guidelines for the work which is to be undertaken by this Ministry&mdash;the Taoiseach and the Government&mdash;will be prepared to modify and change or increase the scope of that influence in time.</P>
    <P>I could be pardoned for referring to two aspects of it which I think bear some examination.  The first is that, as the Taoiseach said in his introductory speech, one of the functions of the new Ministry will be to implement improvements in institutional facilities to assist free collective bargaining, and, in other words, subsequently to give more active Government encouragement to free collective bargaining.  There is no suggestion, and there has been no suggestion, that this is in any way an interference with free collective bargaining between employers and trade unionists.  If there were, indeed, any such suggestion I think that we all would both from experience of other nations which have in some way infringed on them and from our own direct inhibitions also be very slow to give our wholehearted support to this measure.</P>
    <P>If one might quote from the President of the Swedish Trade Union Congress as reported in some of the week-end papers in this connection, he said that in so far as their employers' organisations and trade unions are concerned they are mutually anxious to avoid Government intervention, and that this influences their efforts to reach a compromise even in situations in which there seems to be no hope whatever of agreement being reached. They are so mutually anxious to be left in charge of their own affairs to reach a family agreement without Government intervention that this influences them towards a conclusion. <Col N="1496" /> This is, in fact, as I think, what we would hope to accomplish here, because it has never been fully accepted that this situation is, in fact, because of a lack of a Minister for Labour either directly interested in a dispute as such apart from its national consequences or of a direct influence or authority in such disputes.  It is to be hoped that this very power of intervention towards drawing the parties together, towards, if necessary, laying down guidelines towards solving disputes, which will presumably be vested in the new Minister, may have the same encouraging effect on our employer-employee relations as it has had obviously in other nations in Europe.  That is one aspect of it.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of it is that it has been suggested that one of the functions or one department of this new Ministry would be concerned with research into labour relations and the problems and solutions of such relations in other countries.  In this, again, I think we can take a great step forward because, granted that the Irish temperament may be very different from that of others and that the temperament of every nation is different from that of another, we may have special problems, but what has proved to be by and large successful in other countries more highly developed industrially than ours and with a longer history of industrial relations than ours &mdash; the solutions that have been reached in most cases may be found to apply in one way or another to our nation also.  Here I would like to say that it appears to me from maybe not a very detailed study of the attitudes of trade unions in European countries that they welcome liberty, liberty to negotiate their own affairs.  They welcome a further very important thing&mdash; they welcome responsibility, and they look for liberty with responsibility.  I can recall here in this House in the debate on the Electricity Supply Bill the suggestion that it was unfortunate that a small number of men involved in that dispute were unfortunate in not having an opportunity of exercising their right to withdraw their labour.  I suggested then and I suggest now that <Col N="1497" /> far from being unfortunate in not having an opportunity to withdraw their labour they were fortunate in having an opportunity of exercising such great responsibility, that by their very smallness, so to speak, in their numbers a greater responsibility was being put on them than on many other workers, and by the very importance of the job they do a further responsibility was being laid on their shoulders.</P>
    <P>This is not just a factor of industrial relations.  It is a factor of life.  The greater the responsibility, in many ways the greater the restriction, at least, the greater restriction on personal freedom to indulge in the ordinary things one wants to indulge in.  It has been the hope and the purpose in many of those countries to which I have referred to have liberty with responsibility.  Our new Minister and this new Department should encourage the same approach between employers and trade unions.  If one can judge from a very short trip to the European community office in Belgium, and from a passing and cursory address on the social programme of the European Community, one is definitely left with the impression that the purpose of the annual meetings of employers and trade unions is to reach voluntary guidelines or voluntary agreements which will bind them mutually in their relations for the coming year, or two years, as the case may be.  This they do under the auspices of the Ministry of Labour in each country.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy has indicated that most of the European countries with the possible exception of the Netherlands have a Minister for Labour, and the Netherlands have probably the equivalent in a Minister for Social Affairs.  They are encouraged in their efforts to reach voluntary agreements by the knowledge that if they do not they will in some way be subject to direction from the Minister responsible, that is the Minister for Labour.  That is the kind of responsibility and partnership&mdash;if I may use that word, because Senator Murphy appears to be afraid of any suggestion of partnership&mdash;that this new Ministry will encourage.</P>
    <P>When he was introducing this Bill in the Dáil the Taoiseach said that the <Col N="1498" /> present problem has largely arisen because of the failure of the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress to reach a voluntary national agreement at the beginning of this year.  In many ways this is simply the logical conclusion to that step.  This is purely to assist the parties on both sides to reach a conclusion in the ultimate.  I think the best work of this Ministry will be done in the context of industrial relations.  I have confined myself to that aspect although there are many other aspects.</P>
    <P>It is rather regrettable, too, that for one reason or another it was suggested that this Bill&mdash;and, indeed, any Bill which is now mooted in connection with trade relations&mdash;is being introduced to penalise the workers.  That was suggested in the Dáil by some of the Members and I think it was a very unfortunate suggestion.  The Taoiseach said the purpose of the Bill is to protect the workers.  It is not intended to penalise the workers any more than the employers.  In fact, it is to protect the interests of both, and the interests of all of us.  We are a little thin-skinned in this matter, if we are a little thick-skinned in others, as soon as there is any suggestion of legislation in connection with trade disputes.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that as Senator Murphy has said they have many problems to deal with, and that they have to deal with vast numbers of people pressing their various claims.  This is an attempt to assist them, not an attempt to take from their authority or penalise them. Time will tell that this is an attempt to look after the welfare of all, and particularly those who are most closely involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy has seen fit to repeat some of things he said last week in connection with&mdash;I have forgotten what legislation we were dealing with last week.</P>

      <P>As Senator O'Reilly has pointed out there was a slight change in the words, but there was certainly a very definite change in the tone.  He did not appear to be quite so vehement today as he was then.  After this personal attack on the last occasion, the newspapers of the following two or three days were full of such personal attacks.  I am not saying Senator Murphy should take credit for promoting those personal attacks, but it is rather a sad reflection on the attitude of men engaged in negotiations with each other, who should be working towards the benefit of each other and not thinking in terms of the benefit of one to the exclusion of the other.</P>
      <P>Significantly after Senator Murphy's attack on members of the Federated Union of Employers we had sharp criticism, to say the least of it, by a member of the Federated Union of Employers on the Trade Union Congress. I do not know whether he was aware of Senator Murphy's comment. The words used were a &ldquo;libellous attack&rdquo; by the NFA on the ICMSA and by the ICMSA on the NFA.  We also had &ldquo;libellous attacks&rdquo; between the Bacon Curers' Society and the NFA.  I am not suggesting that any of these organisations have a monopoly on this pastime.  These people are not being asked to plan Government policy.  There are many things they are not being asked to do.  They are being asked to negotiate with each other and I know of no quicker way to spoil that job than the launching of personal attacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy feels that he represents the workers and the workers are near to his heart, we should realise that but there is no use in having the worker near to your heart unless there is room for the employer beside him.  I should like to think that employers and workers are beginning to think in those terms.  I am not criticising Senator Murphy when I say that he appears to expect that we will continue with a <Col N="1500" /> class division between the underprivileged whom he thinks he represents, and the overprivileged.  I do not know if there is any room for that nowadays. I think it is totally unjustified in the context of modern Ireland.  I know many people who are happy to claim that they have passed from what Senator Murphy regards as being underprivileged to being overprivileged in a very short time.  I do not think the distinction is valid.  We have the NIEC recommendation on education and the availability of higher education for all. If there is any hope that this can be implemented in our time, then, of course, the distinction between underprivileged and overprivileged will become obsolete and everybody will have an opportunity to exploit any talents he has&mdash;it will be largely the measure of his own talents and his own individual effort.</P>
    <P>In this, I sympathise with what Deputy Dillon said in the Dáil last week.  It may be rather a Utopia, but in such a small community we can get association which does not think of class divisions.  We are so mutually dependent and have such close mutual interchange that one cannot organise the interests of one without the other. I deplore the term &ldquo;warfare&rdquo; in industrial relations.  It was suggested in the Dáil that there was a declaration of war, that the struggle between employer and worker would exist as long as the relationship between employer and worker lasted.  I suppose that is true but could not one say also of the association between employers and workers, that the mutual benefits that spring from such association will also last for as long as the relationship lasts?  There are many other spheres of industrial relations which I do not think are relevant to this Bill.  I feel everybody in the House will agree that this new Department will see the beginning of the end of our present troubles in industrial relations.</P>

      <P>Not being on any side of the House, I have come in on this with some thoughts and reflections on the Bill and its problems, as so well outlined for us by the Taoiseach and during the subsequent debate.  The subject of industrial relations is an exceedingly wide one, one of the most important, if not the most important topic that holds our society together.  Up to this, it has been performed in a part-time capacity by the Department of Industry and Commerce but now the Taoiseach quite rightly proposes that a new Ministry should be set up to deal with this.</P>
      <P>Of course, this is very proper at the present time, with the great many problems caused on the one hand by free trade prospects and the dislocations that may follow in industry under the impact of free trade&mdash;the necessity for retraining the workers displaced and the rapidly quickening pace of technological advance by which many workers in industry may find themselves redundant simply because electronic control can take over.  We are in a time of rapid change and, therefore, it is right and proper this matter should be the responsibility of an individual in the Government.</P>
      <P>It is in many ways the most important Ministry in the Government, though I should hate to think the Department of Education should rank second in importance to it.  I am frightened by the tremendous range of the tasks set out by the Taoiseach for this new Ministry.  I should like to break them down under three main headings.  Firstly, there is the regular type of manpower policy.  It is mainly concerned with adaptation of workers through retraining, rejuvenation or re-organisation of means of putting employers and workers into contact in an enlargement of the scope of the present labour exchange system.  All this comes under the heading of a manpower policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, to my way of thinking, is most vital work, a type of work in which the Civil Service is in its natural habitat &mdash;the interdepartmental relationships that will be involved.  Two other fields flow from that.  Into one of them I might put the very complex problem <Col N="1502" /> of semi-State bodies and, if I interpreted the Taoiseach correctly, the new Minister will be responsible for the coordinating and the keeping of the semi-State bodies in phase.  He will represent the State on those bodies to a much greater extent than the present arrangement between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Department of Transport and Power in other facets of industry.</P>
    <P>I interpret this as a move to bring those two together and try to coordinate them.  To my mind, the new Ministry should not attempt this.  It is surely a place where the responsibility should be placed fairly and squarely on an Oireachtas Committee under the new Minister.  If there is anywhere in which the pooled wisdom and diverse backgrounds of the Members of both Houses could contribute it is surely in this matter and I appeal to the Taoiseach to give this very serious consideration and not to get the new Ministry off on the wrong foot.</P>
    <P>The new Ministry will be largely pragmatic, concerned largely with the day-to-day affairs of a Department, but it is not the body to speak for the people as a whole.  That, after all, is surely the function of Parliament of the people as a whole.  The people are the shareholders, and they alone are the shareholders in our semi-State bodies.  Therefore, every strike, every dispute, every wrong act of management and labour is directed not against the board of the semi-State body but against the people as a whole who have put up the money.  Surely we, as representatives of the people, have a function in that.  I believe such a committee could discharge the duties of the shareholders in the best possible way and could be comparable with committees in America, England, the Netherlands, where Parliament regularly faces up to such duties and responsibilities.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to see to that.</P>
    <P>The third facet, which disturbs me even more, is the suggestion that the new Department will engage in basic research activities.  That sounds very good but, speaking as one who has had very close and intimate contact with research in my own line and that <Col N="1503" /> of my colleagues, I appeal to the Taoiseach to keep the Ministry of Labour out of this.  It is not their function.  Research, by its very nature, must have an independence and a right of decision that a Ministry cannot have.  This is the way to balance fairly and equally between all sections involved in our industrial disputes.  A Department of Labour represents the Government which has to say time and time again: &ldquo;So far and no further. The economy can take so much in expansion at this stage.  The economy can take so much in increased wages and no more.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Other countries have such research departments.  They investigate problems and make an impartial research into industrial matters.  You cannot have such research within the framework of a Civil Service Department because research, by its very nature, cannot be directed in that way.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to look at the matter of research in this way and recognise this third facet of harnessing all our energies to our manpower policy and that it requires this research arm.  This research arm should not be within the confines of the Department of Labour.  It should be attached to some of our university institutions.</P>
    <P>I am not making any special pleading in this regard.  It does not concern me in the slightest but as a member of the university I want to make this special plea to the Taoiseach.  Most countries in Western Europe have such research departments as I have referred to.  We are conspicuous by its absence here.  Apart from part-time work, which is very often extra-mural work, engaged in by some members of the university, nothing has been done on a planned basis.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to see that this is remedied. In all walks of life, in any endeavour, whether it is in this new Ministry, or whether it is appointing a Chairman for CIE or appointing a Chairman for the Broadcasting Corporation, or any other group, if you are looking for an individual, a man who can be relied on, the people I have suggested to the Taoiseach are the people to get. Better still, you could get men&mdash;I always prefer the plural approach in <Col N="1504" /> this if we can have it&mdash;who have shown their good thinking in industrial relations and management studies and who are very interested in their job.  You could ask them to do something better than they are doing at the moment.</P>
    <P>We should be very careful to examine the very special conditions here.  I want to ask the Taoiseach to look at this matter.  I do not want in any way to speak for my own college in particular.  I am giving him an example and perhaps he can make comparisons.  I want to refer to the work done in a department of applied psychology.  This department consists of one professor and an assistant so it is really the work of one man. Colossal work has been done by this one man and it has had a tremendous impact on management in the south. It may stretch up as far as Dublin but this would be well worth expanding and cultivating.  That comes out of a tradition of good industrial relations and responsibility between employers and employees.  This stems from the work of three very great men who were for many years in the city of Cork. I refer to Monsignor Alfred O'Rahilly and two very wonderful trade union leaders, Mr. P.J. O'Brien, RIP, and Mr. Jim Hickey, RIP.  Those three men did very wonderful work in educational and industrial relations which went as far back as 1916, appropriately.  The framework is there by reason of the work of those three great men.  The number of disputes settled by those three men, individually and collectively, is legion.  In fact, I do not think there has been any really serious dispute in Cork in the past 20 years.  A lot of that is due to the work of those three men.  They had the confidence of both sides.</P>
    <P>That is the type of foundation on which we should build.  Recently we had some young men from Holland who have a wide background and training in industrial relations.  They continued their studies here on some Irish problems.  There is need for much more of that type of work.  There may be similar cases in other parts of the country.  I am just mentioning this one. I am not suggesting it should be confined to one.  We have also had excellent <Col N="1505" /> work done by the Reverend Professor Newman of Maynooth College.  He almost had to struggle with a quill pen.</P>

      <P>He continues to write the type of article and give the leadership which contribute so much to our society.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that for a very small investigation he could get a tremendous return by having such a person.  I am sure there are many more like him.  There may be some in the universities in Dublin.  I suggest very seriously, and with all the emphasis I can command, to the Taoiseach, not to make the mistake of giving this function to the Department of Labour.  No country would do it.  Any Department of Labour in any one of the countries mentioned where they are being so successful could not function without the tremendous help it is getting from the independent research work carried out by the universities in these countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked for leave to raise on the Adjournment the action of the Minister for Transport and Power in allowing Northern Ireland lorries to operate for reward in the Republic of Ireland.  I am alleging, Sir, that what the Minister is doing has no legislative authority, that he is, therefore, acting in contempt of the Oireachtas, that he is encouraging and condoning illegal haulage by operators from Northern Ireland, that his action is completely contrary to public transport policy as laid down in legislation adopted by the Oireachtas which the Minister is charged to administer. Furthermore, and very important, his action will lead to loss of employment by workers in CIE, County Donegal Railways, Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway, and damage to the business of many legal hauliers in the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is necessary, Sir, that I <Col N="1506" /> give the Seanad some background information so that they will understand what I am talking about.  In Northern Ireland up to quite recently you had an integrated public transport organisation such as we have here with CIE.  The Ulster Transport Authority was an organisation which operated rail services, bus services, lorry services and also owned hotels and workshops.  In recent years the Unionist Party finally gave way to pressure to allow every owner of a lorry in Northern Ireland to carry not only his own goods but to operate for reward throughout the Six Counties. It followed from this that the railways had no future in regard to the carriage of goods.  They have ceased completely to carry goods by rail; they are no longer the public carriers and the rail lines have been reduced to 200 miles. The Seanad will know that the Portadown/Derry line was closed and this created exceptional difficulties in this State in maintaining a link with County Donegal.</P>
    <P>Special arrangements had to be made by CIE to run liner trains to Belfast and to Derry via Antrim.  These arrangements are rather difficult, awkward and costly but nobody in the circumstances expected charity from the Northern Ireland Government. I am intimately concerned with this.  About one half of my members in Northern Ireland have lost employment and now they are scattered to Rhodesia, Canada, Australia and all around Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Lenehan Mr. Lenehan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>And about £4 million has already been paid in compensation. That is not the end of compensation. This comparatively large amount has apparently not created any difficulty in the peculiar and complicated circumstances of financing the Imperial contribution in respect of Northern Ireland.  I do not agree with that policy of the Northern Ireland Government but this is not the place to debate that or express my views about it.  I expressed them strongly in the appropriate quarter.  I am simply giving the necessary <Col N="1507" /> background information so that the Seanad will understand why this problem has come to the fore.</P>
      <P>The trade unions representing employees in CIE first became aware of the problem when we were told at a consultative meeting with CIE last October at inter-Departmental level that the Northern Ireland Ministry were pressing for the entry of 50 operators from Northern Ireland into the Republic.  These would be allowed to carry traffic into the Republic or to pick up traffic in the Republic but there would be no back carriage except with the permission of CIE in respect of County Donegal, by the two undertakings there, County Donegal Railway and Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway.  The pressure was on by the Northern Ireland Ministry to allow 50 operators to carry for reward.  I am not talking about lorries carrying their own owner's goods.  I am talking about carrying for reward.  Fifty will be allowed to come in carrying for reward but could not pick up goods here except with the permission of the transport authority here.</P>
      <P>CIE were opposed to that.  They said that 50 would be unmanageable, that it would give rise to illegal haulage and would further create financial difficulty for CIE with inevitable damage to the Exchequer.  The unions then saw officials of the Department of Transport and Power and we were told that 50 were going to be allowed in and we were further assured that the system of control would, in fact, make this number manageable.  It was argued that the arrangements to be made would benefit CIE and County Donegal and the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway, because they in turn would have the sole right to operate into Northern Ireland for reward and that the new arrangements would effectively bar certain people who were at present operating illegally across the Border&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the Minister was determined to resist pressure from them.  This was confirmed <Col N="1508" /> by a recent publication from the licensed hauliers under an article &ldquo;Irish Hauliers Are up in Arms&rdquo; which quotes a letter received from the Department:</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that in recent years the relevant provisions of the transport law in Northern Ireland were effectively&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>that possibly should be &ldquo;ineffectively&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;enforced and that a small number of hauliers licensed under the Road Traffic Act have engaged in cross-Border transport to a limited extent.  ...The Minister cannot accept that unauthorised operations in Northern Ireland in recent years by a few hauliers on a limited scale create a lawful interest either for them or for other members of your Association which would warrant a modification of the settled transport policy of the Government...</P>
      <P>That letter was dated 1st April, this year.</P>
      <P>The trade unions heard no more about the problem of the difficulty until they were asked to see the Minister last Thursday when he proceeded to read to us the answer given at Question Time by the Minister in Dáil Éireann that day.  This indicated that instead of the maximum of 50 operators we had been talking about earlier, which had been pressed for by the Northern Ireland Ministry, our Minister has now decided to allow every Northern Ireland lorry operator who cared to apply for a permit to operate for reward into the Republic&mdash;every one of them.  Now in return for this freedom to the Republic for Northern Ireland hauliers, the Northern Ireland Minister would allow into his territory a very limited number of licensed hauliers of the Republic whose areas of operation were contiguous to the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a Parliamentary Question as to what legislative authority the Minister had for allowing Northern Ireland lorries generally to operate for reward in the Republic, the Minister was unable to refer to any legislation but appeared to indicate that Parliamentary authority was not necessary because this was an experiment and <Col N="1509" /> after 12 months' experience, he might consider promoting legislation.  Fortunately, this is still a Parliamentary democracy and not a country in which government is exercised by Ministerial decree.  I suspect that the Minister was put under political pressure by some licensed hauliers to have made legal what some of them were already doing illegally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and on which his Department had previously informed us that the Minister was going to stand up against this pressure.  I do not know whether the Northern Ireland Ministry extracted a heavy price for this trifling concession or whether our Minister decided to make a typical flamboyant gesture to get some press mention by throwing open to all Six County operators the whole Twenty-six Counties. I am inclined to suspect the latter.  In either case, he did not bother to check whether or not he was empowered to do this under existing legislation.  That was the position last Thursday and this morning Congress had delivered by hand a letter, including a document which purports to be a record of the discussion which took place with representatives of Congress and the Minister last Thursday.  The letter, dated 5th July, was delivered by hand this morning, and says, in paragraph 8:</P>
      <P>The Minister's Statutory Powers for the granting of the necessary licences are contained in section 7 of the Road Transport Act, 1935, as amended&mdash;vehicle entry licences&mdash; and section 115 of the Transport Act, 1944&mdash;merchandise licences. Every Northern Ireland operator who wishes to engage in the cross-Border traffic will require, initially, a vehicle entry licence in respect of each vehicle and subsequently a merchandise licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the result of a week-end research to try to line up, within the existing legislation, what the Minister had already decided to do without any reference to the legislation.  Let us look at these particular measures.  I want to suggest that this is very shaky ground indeed.  The Minister says&mdash;&ldquo;Section 7 <Col N="1510" /> of the Road Transport Act, 1935, as amended&rdquo;.  The Minister appears to be depending upon subsection (2) of section 7 which says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, if he so thinks fit, issue to any person who applies therefor a licence expressed to authorise such person to import into Saorstát Éireann lorries and tractors which at the time of importation comply with the statutory conditions.</P>
    <P>Section 7 has usually been utilised to allow in a vehicle or perhaps a peculiar length of goods which could not be easily taken by public transport here and usually after consultation with the public transport organisation. But anyway it does say:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, if he so thinks fit,</P>
    <P>give a licence for the importation of a vehicle.  That is fair enough.  That is the importation of a vehicle.</P>
    <P>We now go to the second part of it&mdash;the granting to these vehicles the right to carry for reward and the Minister, in the document given to Congress, refers to section 115 of the Transport Act, 1944, which reads:</P>
    <P>If&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  it appears to the Minister (either as the result of representations made to him by any persons, representative of trade or a locality, or otherwise) that the existing merchandise road transport facilities in any area are inadequate, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the Minister is of opinion that the required additional merchandise road transport facilities can be provided more effectively and conveniently by a person other than an authorised (merchandise carrying) company,</P>
    <P>then, instead of making an order under ...grant a merchandise licence to any person.</P>

      <P>The Chair would like to remind the Senator that it is usual to allow the Minister ten minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, I did not think I had spoken for so long.  The <Col N="1511" /> whole point is this.  I want to ask why does it appear to the Minister that in any and in what area the transport services are inadequate?  What steps has he taken to satisfy himself that the services are inadequate and cannot be met by the existing public transport organisation and the licensed hauliers?  If so, why does he attempt to deal with it by allowing in unlimited numbers of operators from outside our State.  I say this is something thought up over the week-end to try to verify the decision already taken by the Minister and which does not, in fact, fit.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Seanad that the views of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in regard to promoting trade and contact at all levels between the two parts of the country are well known.  What the Taoiseach, Captain O'Neill and their respective Ministers have been doing in recent times was advocated by Congress for many years. This, then, is not being raised in any injudicious fashion, or in opposition to citizens in the Northern part of our country.  The Minister may say a lot about the promotion of the Northern Ireland operators when they come in but the fact is that they will find it quite easy to engage in wholesale illegal haulage once they come into the Republic.  This will lead to loss of employment for workers in CIE and will make more expensive the railway to Derry and will also lead to loss of business within the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said that the Minister has no right to be generous to Six County operators at the expense of the livelihood of quite a number of workers here.  His responsibility is primarily to transport and power in the Republic and the workers in the Republic.  I contrast what he said with what his colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce said when asked in the Dáil last week to comment on the disappointment of the Northern Minister of Commerce in regard to the recent talks on freeing trade between the two parts of Ireland.  Deputy Dr. Hillery said that the position of the Government was that they would put Six <Col N="1512" /> County industrialists at an advantage <i>vis-a-vis</i> the British industrialists&mdash;and I quote&mdash;&ldquo;our first consideration is our own industrialists.&rdquo;  We are not talking here about industrialists, we are talking primarily about the workers.  The first responsibility of the Minister for Transport and Power and his Government here must be to the people who are employed and have business in this territory.  I condemn the action of the Minister.  It is not in accordance with legislation, and in spite of the research made over the weekend it is quite illegal, and what he has been doing is in contempt of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to clarify a statement made by Senator Murphy.  He said that this haulage which is at present proceeding and which was to be restricted under the agreement which was privately made between the unions, CIE and the Minister for Transport and Power, was illegal.  My information is that it is perfectly legal, that these hauliers were licensed to operate for a temporary period legally in this country, and that the Northern Government in their discretion decided to permit them to operate in Northern Ireland whatever technical illegality operated in that area.  They have been operating for years.  The proposal to take away their rights to operate and to give a new monopoly to CIE, which was fortunately frustrated at the last moment, was one which would have dealt a serious blow to our export trade, and indeed one of the reasons why this agreement was subsequently frustrated and changed was that one particular firm was about to lose £100,000 export business because it was not going to be allowed to employ existing facilities in Northern Ireland. It is most fortunate that this private conspiracy was, in fact, frustrated at the last moment and that under this arrangement as it now stands it will <Col N="1513" /> be possible to have a continuation of this cheaper form of transport than that which would have existed under the arrangement contemplated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided in the light of the Free Trade Area Agreement and the growing liberalisation of our relationships with the North to ensure that the cost of transporting goods from and to the North should be at the lowest possible level, and they deliberately decided to liberalise this traffic by permitting Northern Ireland hauliers to come down here and back haul into the North, and to permit some 281 licensed hauliers whose areas are contiguous to the Border to carry traffic to the North and to back haul.  In addition CIE, the Donegal Railways, and the Derry and Lough Swilly Railway will continue their traffic, but they will have to continue it in a highly competitive spirit.  That is the position, and it is a firm decision of the Government that has been made in connection with the whole of our arrangements to expand trade between North and South.</P>
      <P>As far as the law is concerned I am quite satisfied, having consulted the legal authorities, that I am entitled under section 7 of the 1935 Transport Act to permit the entry of Northern Ireland hauliers to apply for such a permit, and that under the Transport Act, 1944, section 115, I am permitted to grant merchandise licences to Northern Ireland hauliers who have received an entry permit under the 1935 Act, and that the matter lies in my sole discretion as Minister for Transport and Power, and that it is a matter for me to decide whether transport arrangements are adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may have been up to now an arrangement between CIE and the Ulster Transport Authority which confined the carriage of goods in certain areas.  It is up to me to decide whether having regard to the existing arrangements we are making for expanding trade the transport arrangements are still adequate.  There is nothing in the Act which involves me in having to <Col N="1514" /> give any kind of explanation in relation to statistics or the cost of vehicles operating or the conditions under which vehicles operate in relation to the issue of these licences.  That is the position, to put it in brief.</P>
    <P>It is not intended to liberalise transport for reward in the State itself. That could be a matter for long time policy.  That will be considered when transport legislation comes up for review in 1970.  There may, before that time, be a minor Bill to change the present regulations in regard to the operation of licensed hauliers, simply because a great many of those regulations date back to the conditions of 1933 and 1944.  There have been changes since in the character of the roads, the character of vehicles and in the character of trade.  But that would be a minor measure.</P>
    <P>The only reason which would compel the Government to reconsider more speedily the whole question of the protection of CIE and its general position would be a very major and continuous disruption of services or any other kind of emergency that might arise.  Apart from an emergency I want to make it clear that the question of what we would do then, as I said, is naturally a matter for long-term consideration.  In that connection I have an examination being undertaken in connection with the Economic Research Institute into long-term trends in transport.  This is a very difficult matter.  A great many countries have attempted such surveys.  The difficulty is that so many <i>a priori</i> assumptions have to be made for ten years ahead regarding the changes in the economy, if one is to calculate the number of vehicles which will be operated, how private investment will continue to expand over the period, and it is very difficult to make any definite decisions. As I indicated some months ago, CIE will have to compete with private competition on an extending basis.  I made it clear that the Government is not a socialist Government.  It has permitted many State companies to operate here because private enterprise could not do the job or would not do the job.</P>
    <P>I want CIE to continue as an <Col N="1515" /> efficient transport organisation, but every year about £30 million are being invested in private transport.  There is no big Irish company trying to compete with Aer Lingus.  There is no private company trying to produce machine won turf on a large scale on the bogs.  There is no Irish private company wanting to compete with Irish Shipping.  But in the case of CIE there is this private competition emerging. CIE has actually increased its traffic since 1958 in spite of this <Col N="1516" /> tremendous private enterprise investment being carried out year after year and CIE will, I hope, be able to compete with the licensed hauliers and to continue its traffic on the railway to Belfast and beyond.  I said that they may suffer some loss of trade, and if so it will be in order to ensure that we have the very best means of transport at the very lowest possible cost between ourselves and the people of the North.</P>
