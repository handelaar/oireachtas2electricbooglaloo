      <P>Before we take up consideration of the amendments tabled for this Bill, it would be well if I indicated that amendments Nos. 5, 8 and 16 are out of order.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 5 and 16 are out of order because the subject matters were not raised in a substantial manner in Committee and amendment No. 8 is out of order because it was negatived in Committee.</P>
      <P>The Senators have been notified accordingly.</P>
      <P>The Chair suggests that amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 19 be taken together.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, section 1, between lines 43 and 44 to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(9) For the purposes of this Act&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  for every reference to an &lsquo;appeals officer&rsquo; in sections 44, 45 and 46 of the Principal Act there shall be substituted a reference to an &lsquo;appeals tribunal&rsquo; which shall consist of an appeals officer and at least two assessors appointed under section 44 (11) of the Principal Act.</P>
      <P>(b)  The Chief Appeals Officer shall be a barrister or advocate of not less than 10 years standing or a judge of the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" /> (c)  the following paragraph is hereby added to section 45 of the Principal Act&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(c) the appeal tribunal may refer the question for the decision of the High Court.&rdquo;&rsquo;</P>
    <P>This follows on the amendment which we had on Committee Stage.  We still feel that it would be much more just to the workmen if there were an appeals tribunal.  The Minister did not seem very inclined to fit in with what we sought in our last amendment but I think he might consider this one as it fits in more with the standing legislation and would, in all ways, give us what we sought to get in our previous amendment.  I hope that the Minister will think carefully on the views we put forward in regard to the justice of an appeals tribunal in cases of this kind and consent to meet us in this matter in some way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 19 arises out of my undertaking to consider, between the Committee Stage and Report Stage, the introduction of an amendment which would allow questions of law arising out of whether or not an accident arose out of and in the course of employment to be appealed to the High Court.  That is what I am doing here now.  Under this arrangement, where an appeal is made against the decision of a Deciding Officer involving this question, I can, on the request of the Chief Appeals Officer, refer the question for decision by the High Court.  If the question is decided by an Appeals Officer, any other person affected can appeal therefrom to the High Court on any question of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the amendment submitted by Senator Miss Davidson and Senator Murphy, as I explained, I already have power to appoint assessors to sit with Appeals Officers and this is, in fact, done already in connection with unemployment benefit.  If <Col N="1029" /> it appears necessary, from experience of this scheme in operation, to do it under this code, it can be done also but I do not think it is either necessary or desirable that I should be tied to having assessors sitting in all cases, as this amendment would require me to do.</P>
    <P>With regard to paragraph (b) of the amendment, this provision would be in conflict with section 43 of the Principal Act which provides that the Minister may appoint, from his officers, such and so many persons as he thinks proper to be Appeals Officers and that one of the Appeals Officers shall be designated by the Minister to be the Chief Appeals Officer.  Therefore, I am already required, by the Principal Act, to appoint a Chief Appeals Officer from among the Appeals Officers designated by me.  Apart from that, if this was accepted, we would have the anomalous position of two Chief Appeals Officers, one for occupational injuries and the other for other social welfare purposes.  Therefore, this amendment is not acceptable and, as I have said, I have, in fact, got power to appoint assessors to sit with Appeals Officers, if it appears necessary after we have experience of the operation of this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not very much mind whether Senator Miss Davidson's amendment or the amendment put down by Senator FitzGerald and myself is accepted by the House.  I would prefer the amendment we put down for the simple reason that it brings the right of appeal to a court within reasonable travelling distance of any person who wants to avail of the appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the fundamental guiding line of legislation over the years to reduce law costs by making the law more readily available to the people. It was for that reason that circuit courts were established.  Indeed, at a later date we will have the Minister for Justice bringing into this House a Bill to extend, as he has already told us, the jurisdiction of the circuit courts to enable people to avail themselves of the courts more readily.  What the <Col N="1030" /> Minister is providing for in his amendments is a right of appeal to the High Court.  Straight away that in effect and in practice will mean that there will be very few appeals.  That may be the way the Minister wants a particular social welfare code to operate; his Department will not be concerned with many appeals.  But, the idea of a man who has a claim for workmen's compensation, or occupational injuries, who lives in Mayo, Donegal or Kerry embarking on High Court proceedings to have his case determined is altogether impractical and it may be confidently anticipated, as the Minister hopes, that the appeals to the High Court will be few and far between.</P>
    <P>This is what I am trying to achieve in my amendment.  If a person feels that there has been a wrong determination of his case he should have a right of appeal to the circuit court and that appeal should be to the judge of the circuit court, for the time being assigned to the circuit wherein the accident happened, or where the appellant resides at the option of the claimant workman.  If we are going to give a right it should be given in such a way that it will be practical to avail of it by those whom it is intended to benefit.  That is the kind of legislation we ought to frame.</P>
    <P>Giving a right of appeal to the High Court to my mind will achieve very little.  Though it will concede the principle, it will achieve very little under this Bill.  The Minister, I am sure, has the figures for the number of appeals under sections 41 and 42 of the Social Welfare Act of 1952.  I do not believe that there were 20 appeals since that Act was enacted in 1952.  If that is all the Minister intends to afford the workmen of this country, it certainly is a very poor substitute for the right of resort to the courts to determine their claim, which workmen had up to now.  I would urge on the House that this appeal should be allowed to the circuit court.  In urging that, I want to call the attention of the House to this very salient fact.  The Minister earlier said that Appeals Officers and Deciding Officers were people who were trained in social legislation and, therefore, <Col N="1031" /> were specialists and knew all about this kind of thing.  I have before me a copy of the reply given by the Minister to a question on the 8th March, 1966.  He had this to say about Appeals Officers and Deciding Officers which to my mind strengthens the case for a right of appeal on the part of the workman.  The Minister said, as reported in volume 221, column 1100, of the Official Report of 8th March, 1966:</P>
    <P>Only officers who have experience of Social Welfare legislation are appointed deciding officers or appeals officers.  Before appointment, therefore, these officers have familiarised themselves with the duties required of them as deciding officers or appeals officers.  On appointment they are given such further on-the-job training as may be found necessary. Duties as deciding officers form only part and sometimes only a very small part of the duties of deciding officers; many of these officers are occupied for the most part in aspects of day to day administration of the social services which do not involve the deciding of cases.</P>
    <P>What I want to put to the House is this.  The right of appeal would be practically from the Deciding Officer to the court and the Deciding Officers of the Minister: &ldquo;form only part and are persons whose duties in the words sometimes only a very small part of the duties of deciding officers ...&rdquo; so that, in effect, a deciding officer who will determine a workman's right under this new Bill will be a person who is not very frequently engaged in these kinds of decisions.  Then the Minister says: &ldquo;I will provide an appeal where an accident arises out of and in the course of employment to the courts&rdquo; but the form of appeal he will provide is to the High Court.</P>
    <P>What it means then is that a workman's rights will be determined by an inexperienced Deciding Officer.  For that reason it seems to me to be absolutely essential that we should provide a more accessible right of appeal for the workman than the Minister is providing and that readily accessible appeal <Col N="1032" /> will be found in an application to the circuit court and the circuit court will be sitting in the man's county.  He could get a lift there and that is quite a different day's work from travelling up to and down from Dublin to have his case heard in the High Court.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that the amendment I suggest is one which provides a real right of appeal for the workman</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to point out that this is not the only appeal that is being allowed to the worker.  Appeal to the court on this aspect of the matter is additional to the right of appeal that already exists.  In regard to the point that Deciding Officers are not solely engaged on the giving of decisions, that that is only part of their work, it is a fact, of course, that all their other work is in the field of social welfare.  This helps them to increase their experience of social welfare matters generally.  No person is appointed as a Deciding Officer until he has, in fact, gained considerable experience of the whole social welfare code.</P>
      <P>The principal Act already has provision for reference, and when appeals to the High Court on questions of law in regard to insurability arise, I can see no reason for making a different form of appeal to a different court in this matter.  It is desirable that provision for appeal to the courts should be uniform both in relation to insurability and accident questions.</P>
      <P>It is possible that both matters could conceivably arise on the one case.  There could be a refusal of benefit on the grounds that the accident did not arise out of and in the course of the employment, or if it did so arise that the employment was not insurable employment under the Occupational Injuries Bill.  It is possible that the two forms of appeal could conceivably arise in the same case.  I think it is desirable that the appeal in both cases should be to the same court.</P>

      <P>Of course, it can. We had long discussions here about a lot of theoretical cases, as to whether those cases would be insurable employment or not.  It is obvious that there could be disputes as to whether a particular employment was insurable.</P>
      <P>As I said, it is not likely that many cases will be appealed to the courts on this matter because, having regard to the provisions of section 4 which provides that certain accidents will be deemed to arise out of and in the course of the employment, these disputes will not be as frequent now as they have been in the past&mdash;and they have not been very frequent in the past &mdash;and also due to the fact that the appeal to the court will follow the appeal to the appeals officer.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 56 and 57.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to <Col N="1035" /> define what is insurable occupational injuries employment.  For that purpose resort is had to the First Schedule of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  In the First Schedule of that Act there are two types of employment mentioned, those which are insurable under the Social Welfare Act and those which are excepted from insurance under the Social Welfare Act.  In subsection (3) of section 3 of the present Bill certain employments are excluded from entitlement to occupational injuries benefit. One of those is &ldquo;employment under any local or other public authority in the execution of any contract for services.&rdquo;  On the last occasion I asked the Minister what was meant by &ldquo;any contract for services.&rdquo; I shall be glad to hear what the Minister has to say about that.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that a contract for services arises in those cases where the person is employed but they have such a type of skill that the employer does not have the direction of the manner in which the services are to be discharged.  He really employs the person because of the skill he has.  That can apply in the case of a radiographer in a public authority working in a hospital, radiologist or a medical doctor who is employed in the first year after he has qualified.  It seems to me that if a nurse in a hospital slips on the floor and injures her back and is entitled to occupational injuries a medical doctor who is within the income limits under this Bill, who similarly slips and receives the same kind of injury should be equally entitled, because he is within the income limit, to occupational injuries.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that under paragraph 3 that we are excluding the medical doctor, the radiographer or the radiologist because the contract with the public authority is a contract for services.  There is no justification for this legalistic distinction between the two kinds of employees and the amendment is designed to remove paragraph (d) of subsection (3).</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition I have of contract of service is that employment under contract of service <Col N="1036" /> implies the existence of a master and servant relationship between the employer and employee.  The employee is obliged to render personal services and is subject to the right, on behalf of the employer, to control and direct him in the natural performance of his duties.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, a contract for services implies a person engaged as an independent contractor, who undertakes to do certain work for another person without subjecting himself to that person's control as to the method of performance of the work.  He may, in certain circumstances, contract to do the necessary work personally without the right of control by his client on his method of working.  These lines which it is sought to delete from the Bill&mdash;paragraph (d)&mdash;exclude from the scope of the Act employment under any local or other public authority in the execution of any contract for services.</P>
      <P>It would not be necessary to provide for the exclusion of these people were it not for the fact that special provision was made to bring a certain class of persons within the scope of the Principal Act.  Other people employed under a contract for services are not insurable under the Social Welfare Acts, but a departure from this general principle of employer-employee relationship was made in the Principal Act in order to allow people such as carters who may be in employment on a contract for services basis&mdash;a contract for the supply of a horse, cart and driver to a local authority in connection with the upkeep of roads&mdash; to be insurable when the employment is of one person only and is by way of manual labour and service is given only by the employed person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is felt that in such circumstances such a person should be insured for the different insurance schemes, unemployment benefit, disability benefit and contributory old age and widows' pensions.  The work that these people do, however, need not be carried out under direct supervision, so that while it is appropriate for insurance for other purposes it is not appropriate for insurance for occupational injuries purposes <Col N="1037" /> because it is a matter for the man himself how he carries out the work and if he does it in such a way as to cause him to suffer injuries he is in no different position than any other self-employed person.  Certainly, the employer could not be held responsible. It would be inappropriate to extend this provision to the Occupational Injuries Code, particularly when such independent contractors are only insurable when employed by a local or a public authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This highlights the defects and the deficiencies of the Bill. If I understand the Minister correctly, we now have this further anomaly in the matter of employment and disability benefit.  The person with the horse and cart employed by a county council comes under the Social Welfare Acts and is entitled to disability benefit if he suffers sickness while so employed. That was the purpose of bringing him in.  Now, under this Bill, if he is injured arising out of or in the course of his employment with his horse and cart with the county council, he will not be entitled to occupational injuries benefit. I am stating what appears to me to be the law as stated by the Minister.</P>
      <P>That is an anomaly which will be extremely difficult to justify to the small farmer with his horse and cart employed by the local authority.  The second anomaly that arises, apparently, is that such a person, if he were employed by a private person, may well be within the scope of the Bill.  I have knowledge of a case of a man who to all intents and purposes was an independent contractor.  He went around building haysheds for various farmers.  While building a hayshed for an employer&mdash;putting rope on one of these RSJs, these reinforced steel joists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There you are.  Here is an expert.  Ring up Brooks Thomas. However, this man fell and injured his back and the circuit court, which has been so maligned by the Minister, found that while to all intents and purposes he was an independent contractor, he was a workman employed by the farmer because the farmer could point out to him where to do the work.  He was duly paid his workmen's compensation.  Now, if I understand the Minister correctly, that man being an independent contractor, will be excluded from benefit under this Bill.  It makes me again wonder whether we really know the extent to which we are stripping various types of workmen of benefits which they have hitherto enjoyed under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not deal with the situation which seems to me to be a clear case where you have a contract for services.  A physiotherapist or a radiologist may be employed and may be injured&mdash;may suffer an electrical shock or may slip in the theatre.  That person, though he comes within the income limit, simply because he happens to have a particular skill and happens to be the kind of person who cannot be directed by the employer who has no competence to do the work, does not come within the scope of the Bill.  It is anomalous that though he is within the income limit he will not be entitled to a halfpenny.  Therefore, paragraph (d) will militate against people at both ends of the scale&mdash;the carter with his horse and the person with the academic qualifications.</P>

    <P>This is a small point which I raised <Col N="1039" /> in another form on Committee Stage when the Minister was good enough to point out that the effect of the amendment would be one which, while it would confer marginal benefits in the matter of longer periods of disablement, would have the opposite effect and would reduce benefits in the case of disablement for periods of 12 days or less.  I have, therefore, reworded the amendment to leave its application to a period for which it will confer some marginal benefit on the worker.  I accept the Minister's point which he made on the Committee Stage that the benefit involved is fairly small, but it could be significant and it seems right that we should recognise that the five-day week does exist very widely and that where it does exist a workman should not be put at a disadvantage by getting only one-sixth of a week's benefit in respect of one of every five working days on which he is prevented from working owing to disablement.</P>
    <P>While it is not a major matter, it seems to be the thing on which I should take the Minister at his word by putting down an amendment which would confer this marginal benefit, which would not cost very much and which does give rights that a workman should have if he is a five-day worker and if his disablement lasts longer than a fortnight.  The rewording of the amendment eliminates the danger of which the Minister spoke, of the worker being at a disadvantage because of the old amendment, and I would ask the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>This new amendment has given me an opportunity of examining the possible effects more closely, and while I stated on the Committee Stage that it was only in longer term cases that the amendment would be of any benefit at all and that this would only be a marginal benefit in those cases but that it would work the other way in short term absences from work, when you look at it more closely it will be seen that even in the case of longer absences this proposal to change from a six-day basis to a five-day basis could work to the disadvantage of the workman. <Col N="1040" /> Where a workman is incapable for a period of a number of complete weeks plus a number of odd days, if those odd days include his day off, his rest day, this could work to his disadvantage. If he is absent for five full weeks plus his rest day he would on the five-day basis receive five weeks payment only.  If he were absent for five weeks plus three days, those three days including a rest day, he would receive five weeks plus two days benefit, that is, two-fifths of the weekly rate, on the proposed five-day basis; but if he was on the six-day basis he would receive five weeks plus three days benefit, that is half the weekly rate.  There seems to be on balance more to be lost than gained by this amendment, and I think that it would be better to wait and see whether there arises need at some future time to make any general alteration in the provisions in order to cater for five-day week workers, but I do not think that there is any such need. In any case, if this amendment were to be accepted it would be necessary also to modify the injury benefit period for five-day workers.  There is no proposal here to do that.  I do not think that this is necessary, and it could conceivably work to the disadvantage of the workman, though it would be a very small disadvantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 11, lines 56 and 57, to delete &ldquo;the period taken into account&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;a period of less than seven years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These amendments arise out of the quite long and useful debate we had on this issue on Committee Stage.  I pointed out that the Dáil, in introducing the new subsection&mdash;subsection (9)&mdash;seemed not to have adverted to the relationship between that new sub-section and subsection (7) in which there is a limit of £380 for the lump sum, thereby creating a situation in which, in any case where the basis of assessment of this benefit is a period of more than seven years, the worker will be given a choice between weekly pension and a gratuity which will be less than and could, in fact, be substantially less than, or a mere fraction of the commuted value of his weekly pension, tempting him to take the lump sum which is worth far less than the value of the pension.  This, I think, is a fortuitous and unintended consequence of the improvement the Dáil tried to effect by introducing subsection (9).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having probed the matter on Committee Stage on the basis of an amendment I put down, I discovered more about the meaning of this section and its operation from the Minister, in his reply, and it seemed to me&mdash;as I said in that debate&mdash;that the right answer here is to limit this lump sum option to those cases in which, in fact, the amount involved would be small, because it involves both disablement of less than 20 per cent and also the assessment of a period of less than seven years disablement; the combination of the two yielding a situation in which a man would, therefore, be getting a small sum of money weekly for a limited period, the commuted amount of which would not be great <Col N="1045" /> and would, in fact, be less than £380. It is entirely wrong that in such a case a man should be given a lump sum rather than this small pension for a limited period.  It is undesirable that the man would be put in a position in which he would be tempted to accept a lump sum of £380 when the true value of the pension over a period of life, 20 years or something like that, could possibly be £1,000 or more.  I would prefer not to give him a dangerous option to take an inadequate lump sum which does not represent the commuted value of the pension.</P>
    <P>Therefore, what I have tried to give effect to is a straight alternative that in the 20 per cent or less case either the position is that the disablement will last seven years or more and the lump sum should not be limited to £380 which may be only a fraction of the true value of the weekly pension, or the pension and the period which is assessed for is less than seven years when he should get the lump sum and be finished with it.  There would be no option here but a straight choice depending upon whether it is above or below seven years.  From the discussion we had on Committee Stage it appeared that this measure was the best solution to a slightly tricky problem and in this way cope with the unfortunate by-product of an improvement which the Dáil introduced in this particular section, but introduced without considering the implications of sub-section (7) in this new sub-section (9) as inserted.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, suggest that these amendments provide a more clear-cut and satisfactory basis and avoid the danger of a workman being tempted to take a lump sum which would be only a fraction of the true commuted value of his pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When we talk about the danger of tempting a workman to take a lump sum which would be only a fraction of the true commuted value of his pension, we should consider the level of pensions at this low rate of disability.  Senator FitzGerald is thinking of the man who is just barely below 20 per cent and would, therefore, <Col N="1046" /> qualify for one of the higher lump sums and one of the higher rates of pension. But this is a provision which applies to rates of disability ranging from 20 per cent down to nil.  In the case of the really low percentage rates of disability, the appropriate amount of pension would be quite ridiculous.  If Senator FitzGerald's amendment was accepted, those people would have no option but to accept a ridiculously low rate of pension, rather than a lump sum which would also be low but would, I think, be accepted by most people in preference to a rate of pension which could go as low at 1/2d per week for one per cent disability.  It would be hard to convince any man that it would be more in his interests to get a pension of 1/2d per week rather than a lump sum, even though that would, I think, be only something over £21.  Therefore, when we are dealing with such small sums, it is desirable to give people, in that position, the option of the lump sum rather than the pension, because the pension will be of such an amount that it would not, in fact, do a great deal to improve the man's weekly standard of living, whereas he might see some advantage in accepting a lump sum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister has a point there which I would be more than prepared to meet in the amendment.  It would be partly met if one added to amendment No. 7 the words &ldquo;and the commuted value of the pension would be more than £380.&rdquo;  I am not sure whether a similar change would be necessary in amendment No. 6 but I would be quite prepared to meet the Minister on that point.  I am only concerned with cases where the pension and the scale of injury and period of disability are such that the commuted value would be more than £380 and where, therefore, the lump sum would represent less than the value of the pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite happy that, in any other case, the procedure the Minister has in mind would prevail but I do think we should not, in any legislation, introduce a system where we would give the option of a lump sum to a man, <Col N="1047" /> which would be only a fraction of the true commuted value of his pension. As I have said, it would be at least partly met by adding the words &ldquo;and the commuted value of the pension would be more than £380.&rdquo;  I would ask the Minister whether he would be prepared to accept something of that kind which, while meeting his point also, is a valid one.  We do not wish to force pensioners to take pensions of 1/2d for a long number of years when the Minister could commute them into a lump sum which would be more reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are quibbling over a small point and I do not see any reasonable way, at present at any rate, to do what Senator FitzGerald has in mind, without doing something in the process that neither of us would like to do.  I think the position is reasonable.  The original proposal, which is in accordance with the minority recommendation and which, as has been admitted here, follows the lines of legislation in Britain, was at these low rates of disablement to have a lump sum provision only and in order to meet this point which was raised in the Dáil I agreed to give the option to the workman to accept a pension instead.</P>
      <P>I think we have gone as far as it is necessary to go.  The maximum amount of lump sum under this section is £380 and the maximum rate of pension. I think, is something around 23/-, so that nobody will suffer any great misfortune if he makes the wrong choice.  I do not see any way in which we could provide for all possible circumstances and I think that at this low level of pension it is desirable to give the injured workman the option of accepting a lump sum rather than a pension.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider, nevertheless, some amendment because while he says nobody could be at a disadvantage, and I am referring to his statement that £380 is the maximum amount of lump sum, obviously the amount could exceed £1,000 if the disablement were for a period of 20 years or more?  It seems to me that we should delete this limit which should not be in at all when the disablement could exceed the period of seven years.  It could be 20 years or life.  If he is not prepared to do that he should accept amendment No. 7 in the way I said and also I think it would be necessary to amend amendment No. 6 by leaving &ldquo;the period taken into account,&rdquo; and adding in &ldquo;its commuted value would be less than £380.&rdquo;  I think this amendment, notwithstanding the one I have mentioned already, would meet the Minister's objection.

    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was dealing with this section on Committee Stage I expressed regret that workmen's compensation which would continue to be payable to those who are at present in receipt of a weekly sum under the Workmen's Compensation Acts of 1934-1955 would not be increased directly with effect from a current date.  I have since had a look at the 1953 Workmen's Compensation Act and the 1955 Workmen's Compensation Act.  Notwithstanding all the calculations that insurance companies may have made and notwithstanding the fact that in some cases it might prove a burden to employers, the Oireachtas in 1953 and 1955 increased the amount payable to persons in receipt of weekly sums from the coming into operation of the 1953 Act and the 1955 Act.  That was all that was to it and the insurance companies, who were in the main <Col N="1050" /> affected by this, had to lump it if they did not like it.</P>
    <P>It seems to me from calculations I make that there are certain categories of workmen who will not even benefit as much as they should having regard to the increasing cost of living since 1955 by the addition they will get under this Bill.  What I am seeking to do under this amendment is to make some compensation to people who for over more than 10 years have got no increase of any kind in the workmen's compensation paid to them since 1955. There are a number of these people who are totally and permanently incapacitated, some of whom may be receiving £3 10s and some of whom may be receiving the maximum of £4 10s under the 1955 Act.  Notwithstanding one round of wage increases after another, these unfortunate people have been awaiting legislation to give them an increase such as was provided under the 1953 and the 1955 Acts.</P>
    <P>The Bill to give effect to the Minority Report under the Commission was introduced in Dáil Éireann on 8th July, 1965.  It is fair and reasonable to say that that Bill should have been through long since if the Minister had been as vigorous in getting time for an important measure of this kind as he should have been, or as he might have been at any rate, from the point of view of the workmen who are awaiting increases.  In all classes of salary adjustment and increases there is always an element of retrospection.  If we were to go back to the date on which this Bill was introduced and say that these additions would become payable on that date, that would be offending no principle but would be giving effect to what is one of the commonest things in any kind of wage or salary increase, that is, an element of retrospection. Therefore, that is the minimum which the Oireachtas should provide for people who got no increase whatsoever in their compensation since 1955.  I urge upon the House that these additions which will be payable under section 24 should be made payable back to 8th July, 1965.</P>

      <P>I think what I am doing in the case of existing recipients <Col N="1051" /> of workmen's compensation is reasonable. It is all right to say that when the Workmen's Compensation Acts were amended on previous occasions, insurance companies just had to provide the increased amounts.  They were, of course, continuing to operate that scheme, and no doubt they were able to recoup themselves for the extra expenditure involved, in the premiums charged.  As I said, what I am doing in respect of people who are in receipt of workmen's compensation is reasonable, I think.  The maximum weekly payment of workmen's compensation was fixed at £4 10s from 1st September, 1955.  At that time the consumer price index at mid-August was 128 and at mid-May of this year it was 185.  On that basis the appropriate increase on 90/- would be 40/-, but, in fact, we are providing for a single man an increase of 52/6d and for a married man an increase of 90/-.</P>
      <P>The contributions to the Fund from which these benefits will be paid will commence only as from the appointed date which I have not been able to fix yet because I have not got the Bill yet.  Accordingly, there will be no fund to meet any payments before the appointed date.  I cannot undertake the retrospective payments which seem to be involved in this amendment.  I think I am doing what I can reasonably be expected to do for existing recipients of workmen's compensation.</P>

      <P>Earlier in this debate I had to say the Minister spoke like a lawyer when he wanted to get out of certain things.  Now he talks like an employer.  I never knew of any employer who was disposed to refuse legitimate demands made upon him by his employees, who did not advance the excuse: &ldquo;I have no money.&rdquo;  Of course, we know there is no money in the Fund but surely there is no suggestion that the calculation is so tightly made that the Fund could not withstand the few extra shillings which would be required in one payment out of it when it begins to accumulate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth of the matter is that workmen have been very badly treated by Ministers for Social Welfare from <Col N="1052" /> about 1958-59 on, as the cost of living began to rise very steeply. They have been very badly treated as compared with employees in trade unions who have been able to enforce their demands by strike and other action.  It would be very small compensation to these people to pay them some kind of lump sum.  Under previous legislation if a workman at a particular time was on £3 10s which was related to his pre-accident average weekly earnings, and those pre-accident weekly earnings were related to the rate that was then current in the employment, he was always entitled to go to court in later years and say: &ldquo;Since I was awarded workmen's compensation in 19-blank the rate of earnings have increased, and if I were working today and met with an accident the amount of compensation I would get would be so much.&rdquo;  He would thereby get an increase in his compensation.  That is the kind of thing that should be taken care of</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it would be very small recompense to the unfortunate worker who at best is on the maximum of £4 10s if he were to get an element of retrospection in respect of his benefit but the Minister, like every employer who has a legitimate demand made upon him, says he has no money.  I am quite sure the workers would be prepared to wait until next Christmas, until such time as the money would be in the Fund, and they would be prepared to take whatever lump sum would be payable out of the Fund next Christmas.  The Minister could certainly do that if he wanted to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 21, in lines 9, 13, 21 and 36, to insert &ldquo;casual&rdquo; before &ldquo;overtime.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This also arises out of the Committee Stage debate when the question of overtime came up and it was clear to me, after hearing what was said in that debate, that only casual overtime should be disregarded and that where overtime is an integral part of the <Col N="1053" /> payment it should not be disregarded. Senator Murphy gave the excellent example of a bus driver on a regular schedule year in and year out involving overtime as an integral part of his remuneration.  That type of overtime which is a normal part of his remuneration should be provided for. It is quite wrong that a man who perhaps spent decades of his working life as a bus driver in receipt of this remuneration&mdash;and who took the job knowing that overtime would be part of his remuneration&mdash;should be put in a position where his compensation will be reduced because part of his remuneration is technically overtime.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I propose that the word &ldquo;overtime&rdquo; where it is used in the section should be preceded by the word &ldquo;casual&rdquo;.  The Minister's Deciding Officer can interpret what is and what is not &ldquo;casual&rdquo;.  That is something which they would be able to do.  This would give them discretion. The Minister tried to make out&mdash;quite unsuccessfully I think&mdash;that they have such a discretion because he said they could decide whether something was overtime.  He emphasised the words &ldquo;for a full normal working week&rdquo; and said it would be a matter for the Deciding Officers.  It is now evident that in his own Bill the Minister will preclude Deciding Officers from including in what a man would earn for a full normal working week anything that is described as overtime.  What I want to do is leave to the Deciding Officers the discretion which the Minister claims they have, but which self-evidently they have not got, to decide whether overtime is an integral part of a man's work because it is done regularly, or whether on the contrary it is simply casual overtime.  I ask the Minister to agree to the insertion of the word &ldquo;casual&rdquo;.</P>

It is clear that the Deciding Officer will have to decide each case on its merits and the interpretation of the word &ldquo;casual&rdquo; would give rise to excessive difficulty. If it was introduced it would be bound to create anomalies.  For instance, a man who happened to be working overtime at the time of his accident would qualify for the overtime to be included in his pay, whereas another man who had been working a considerable amount of overtime up to a short period before his accident would be excluded.  I would not be prepared to accept this at all.</P>

He has disregarded the basic fact that this instructs the Deciding Officer to disregard all overtime. The Minister said that the Deciding Officer will have to decide each case on its merits.  I do not think it should be left to the Deciding Officer to do this.  In the Social Welfare Act, 1952, the Deciding Officer has to decide whether employment is of a casual nature.  If he decides that, he should be able to decide whether overtime is casual or not.  The Minister has made no case whatever and, therefore, I have no hesitation in pressing the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 23, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;disqualification&rdquo; in line 44 to the end of the subsection and substitute: &ldquo;Temporary disqualification for receipt of occupational injuries benefit or any amount under section 26 of this Act, provided that when notice is given of the accident the disqualification shall be lifted and all payments due since the accident shall then be made&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This matter was discussed on Committee Stage when we made the case in regard to disqualification that the Minister and his Deciding Officers should not have the right to disqualify a man permanently or, indeed, for any prolonged period simply because he failed to give the prescribed notice to his employer referred to in subsection (1).  The penalty of disqualification from receiving benefit until such notice is given is a perfectly ample penalty and will encourage any sensible worker to give the required notice.  I can foresee no circumstances where it should be necessary to go beyond that and penalise him beyond the point at which he gives the required notice, to penalise him thereafter or indefinitely simply because he has failed to fulfil this condition.</P>
      <P>We discussed this on Committee Stage and at no time was a case made by the Minister for a penalty of this order.  It seems quite wrong that the Minister or his Deciding Officers should have the power to penalise a workman even after he has given the required notice.  I press the Minister to see the merit of the amendment.  It would allow sufficient power to penalise the person until he has given the notice.  This is not a matter for a penalty.  It is a matter for some pressure on the man to ensure that he does give notice to his employer.  There is no pressure greater than providing that a person will be deprived of benefit until he gives the notice.  There is also the incentive that when he gives the notice he will get back money.  If he fails to give notice he is deprived of benefit and he does not know whether he will get benefit until he has given notice.</P>
      <P>It is wrong of the Minister to attempt here as in other cases to take powers to penalise workmen when there is no requirement to do so, when it is not necessary for the efficient and satisfactory administration of the Act. Accordingly, I ask the Minister to agree to the amendment which will give him the necessary power to enable him to ensure that people who do not give notice will not get their money. We wish to ensure that no bureaucratic penalties will be imposed for errors of judgment or forgetfulness on the part of workmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get in before the Minister, otherwise I would not have an opportunity of saying anything on this amendment.  These questions of notice and the time limit within which proceedings could begin were two of the things under the Workmen's Compensation Acts which were most unsatisfactory and which gave rise perhaps to more appeals to the <Col N="1057" /> Supreme Court than any other aspect of the legislation.  That was for the reason that there were so many difficulties and different circumstances in which workmen could be deprived of their rights because of this time limit of six months before the commencement of proceedings and the requirement under section 28 to give notice within a reasonable time.  Whatever was to be said for having under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, a stipulation as to the giving of notice of the occurrence of an accident, there is no case to be made for it under this legislation.</P>
      <P>The purpose of giving notice under the 1934 Act was to enable an employer to inquire into the circumstances of the accident, to get the various witnesses, to enable him to gather all the evidence which would help him to make up his mind whether or not an accident had occurred to the employee and whether it had occurred during the workman's employment. Even at that is was laid down clearly in the Act that the notice should be given as soon as practicable.  Everybody is presumed to know the law. That is a kind of working rule that has been evolved over the years by the common law lawyers, and at times it is not a very satisfactory rule and works great hardship and injustice.  At least if a worker or his trade union wanted to find out what the position was in respect to the giving of notice under the 1934 Act he could look up the Act and there he could see in section 28 that he was to give notice in writing of the accident &ldquo;as soon as practicable after the happening thereof or before the workman has voluntarily left the employment in which he was injured&rdquo;.  That was in black and white in the Statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But when we come to this new gem of modern legislation, what do we find? We find that &ldquo;Regulations may provide for requiring the prescribed notice of any accident in respect of which occupational injuries benefit or any amount under section 26 of this Act may be payable to be given within the prescribed time by the insured person, or, where within that time his death <Col N="1058" /> results from the accident, by such other person as may be prescribed, to the insured person's employer or other prescribed person&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Might I have recourse to my own experience as a lawyer and say this, that it is utterly impossible at any time to ascertain what the law is made under regulations by the various Departments of State?  It is impossible to any man even in the Law Library with all the resources available to lawyers and with all their knowledge. You cannot at any time be certain as to what the law is under the existing statutory regulations.  The reason is that today you find the Minister for Health or the Minister for Industry and Commerce makes a regulation and it is only six days in operation perhaps when there is another amending regulation out.  There is no place where you can find all these statutory regulations at any time.  When it comes to looking up the index of statutory regulations you find that the index is compiled every so often, sometimes at intervals of 10 or 12 years, sometimes at shorter intervals. It is not possible even for practising lawyers to be certain at any time as to what the law is which has been made under statutory instruments.  In my own experience I have had to have inquiries instituted with the appropriate Department to know whether, in fact, any further regulation under a particular section has been made, or whether a particular regulation has been amended, to be certain before advising a client as to what the state of the law as far as it has been affected by the statutory instruments.</P>
    <P>This is a fundamental objection to this Bill, that so much of it will be implemented by regulations.  The Minister will say, of course, that his officers in his Department will know the regulations.  Of course, they will, because they made them and the Minister put his name to them, but ordinary members of the public outside the Department will not know what the position is, and there may well be different kinds or different forms of accidents and regulations made prescribing the people who are to give notice where death results.  In <Col N="1059" /> these circumstances it seems to me that it would be most unjust to disqualify any workman from receiving compensation in respect of any period because he has not given notice, not in accordance with the Act but in accordance with regulations which he will never have an opportunity of knowing, copies of which he will find it difficult to find even in a solicitor's office in his local town.  I think, therefore, that if it does happen, as we can be certain it will happen, that workers for the reasons I have indicated have not given notice or their dependants have not given notice, within the prescribed time, they should be entitled, after ascertaining what the position is and finding out that they should have given notice within a particular time, to the benefit of the Acts, which, of course, they are entitled to by law in any event, and they should not be deprived of them because of ignorance, I, therefore, hope that this at least is one amendment that the Minister will accept from the Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I made it as clear as it is possible to make it on the Committee Stage that there is no intention except in very exceptional circumstances of depriving any workman of any arrears of benefit due to his failure to give notice, but it is necessary to have this notice given even if it is at a late stage.  Normally nothing more would be done than what Senator FitzGerald suggested would be necessary, that is, that payments of benefit would be withheld until notice is given, and it is only in very exceptional circumstances, such as when a workman unreasonably just refuses to give notice, that this power would be used.  I think that it is obviously necessary to have the power even though it may only very occasionally be necessary to use it.  There is certainly no intention of permanently depriving any workman of any benefit for which he would otherwise qualify merely because of the fact that he did not give notice in time, but still the intention is to have this power in order to ensure that notice will be given when that is required.</P>

      <P>The Minister in dealing with matters of this kind always starts off with a most unexceptionable statement that there is no intention&mdash;I wrote it down&mdash;of depriving a workman of his benefit for not giving notice.  Then the next sentence, of course, is persuasive&mdash;&ldquo;normally nothing more would be done&rdquo;&mdash;but the third sentence goes on to explain why it is necessary to have a penal power including penalties on workmen. This just does not arise.  There is no requirement for this.  The Minister has made no case for it.  If a workman does not give notice he does not get benefit.  That is quite sufficient penalty.</P>
      <P>Under the Social Welfare code a man can be told to stay in his house and not go out without leaving information as to where he is going.  That is because he is being brought within this code. There is no reason, in a case like this, where no issue arises to introduce the power to impose a severe penalty on a man simply because he did not give notice of his injury.  He should get the whole amount of the benefit when he gives notice and nothing until he gives notice, and not seek power in these remote and probable cases which civil servants always want power for&mdash;that they must have power to penalise everybody, anywhere, at any time if they do not like how they behave.  This is no way to legislate.  I must say that if I were ever in the position the Minister is in, I would have a review of the whole code to take out of it all the bureaucratic powers which have been put into it to cover all remote contingencies and to keep people under proper control of the bureaucracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have a case where these powers are being introduced.  We are opposed to it.  Where these unnecessary powers are taken to penalise people, here as elsewhere, we should be opposed to it.  Here, as elsewhere, we on this side of the House, if the opportunity arises, would change it from this impersonal bureaucratic system into a human system where this constant emphasis on penalties and pressures of various kinds on people will be replaced by a system under <Col N="1061" /> which there will be the minimum amount of pressure and not all the possible powers to deal with every possible contingency not required for the efficient administration of the Acts and to prevent large scale evasion or fraud.</P>
    <P>The whole approach of the Minister, throughout this, is a bureaucratic approach and is not the approach appropriate to a political Minister whose job it is to stand his ground.  He should insist that civil servants justify their claims to have all these powers, instead of which it seems to me, in this Bill, in any power looked for, he is not fulfilling the function of a political Minister, which is to stand between the civil servants with their natural desire to protect the public purse&mdash;which they let get out of hand &mdash;and the ordinary people of the country who can be caught up in this machine which is still so much of the old Poor Law machine.  I do not think the Minister is doing his job in that respect.  He is not justified in seeking all those powers.  Whatever the difficulties the old system had, this is an impersonal bureaucratic system and the Minister tells us he is justifying this because the existing Social Welfare code has this and therefore, we must have it here.  It is in the existing Poor Law code but the Minister is strengthening it by introducing this new power to require a man to undergo a surgical operation which even the existing Social Welfare code does not admit.</P>
    <P>We have a duty in this House to stop this type of approach and attitude and merely seek the powers necessary for the efficient administration of the Acts.  But when we see something which is not necessary being introduced, it is our job to check the Executive in this matter and we should stand firm on a point of this kind.</P>

      <P>In page 25, to delete lines 18 to 20 inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we intend in this amendment is to delete from section 31 the obligation, under penalty of being disqualified from receiving any benefit under this Act, to submit to medical treatment&mdash;to exclude the requirement that a man should submit himself to a surgical operation.  This is, indeed, the most obnoxious section in the whole Bill.  It is I think the first time in the history of this State that the Legislature is seeking power to make a man submit himself to a surgical operation under a penalty.  It may well be that the Minister, with all the vast resources at his disposal, is able to find some precedent but, if he does, all I am saying is that here and now, in this somewhat more enlightened age, we ought not to agree that the Legislature should enact any piece of legislation which requires a man, against his will, to undergo a surgical operation. The Minister made the case upon the last occasion&mdash;and not very correctly&mdash;that this kind of provision was to be found in the Social Welfare <Col N="1063" /> Act of 1952.  What was to be found in the Social Welfare Act of 1952 is provided for in paragraphs (a) and (c) of subsection (1) of section 31 of this Bill.  That is to say&mdash;the Minister takes power to require a man to submit himself to a medical or other examination for the purpose of determining the extent of his disablement.  If a man says: &ldquo;I am disabled and I cannot lift my arm,&rdquo; the Minister is entitled to say: &ldquo;Very well, I will get my medical doctor to see whether or not you can lift your arm&rdquo; That is reasonable enough.</P>
    <P>Then, in paragraph (c) it is provided that the Minister may make regulations requiring a man:</P>
    <P>to attend at such places and times as may be required for the purposes of the said medical examination or treatment.</P>
    <P>It is going far enough to say you will require a man to submit himself to medical treatment, even if he may be the kind of person who does not believe conscientiously in medical treatment and there are people around this country who do not believe in taking antibiotics and the various pills and so on prescribed for them from time to time.  As medical research goes on, we find that people, who may have objected to taking, say, phenacetin some years ago and might have said: &ldquo;Oh, doctor, that does not agree with my kidneys&rdquo;, were proved right because it does cause renal failure.  I do not know if that is the correct medical term but here we are going further than that.  We are saying that a man must hand himself over, body and soul, to a surgeon.  The anaesthetist can knock him out and thereafter the Minister for Social Welfare, the Deciding Officer or Appeals Officer has so ordained that man can be ripped open by the mere &ldquo;say-so&rdquo; of the Appeals Officer in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Now let the people on the Government side of the House, who are constantly talking about the great service performed for this country by President de Valera when he introduced the Constitution in 1937, know that the Constitution itself has something to <Col N="1064" /> say about safeguarding personal liberties and the freedom of the people and if it does not the Constitution means nothing.  Mind you, I have the greatest doubts as to whether the content in paragraph (b) is constitutional.  I doubt if there is anybody, a legislator, a judge, an Appeals Officer or a Deciding Officer, who has a right to say to any man: &ldquo;You must submit yourself to surgical treatment and if you do not we shall impose a penalty on you and the penalty we shall impose is to starve you and your wife and children up to a period of six weeks and see how you like it.  If you do not submit by that time and you have survived you are well worth having and we will pay you compensation.&rdquo; All the Minister wants is to starve a man for six weeks.  The Minister will say that will not be done; that he will not subscribe to enacting legislation which enables a clerical officer or a staff officer in the Department of Social Welfare to say to any citizen in this country: &ldquo;If you do not submit yourself to a surgical operation, even if it is only the removal of an ingrown toe nail, I will stop your pension&rdquo;.  If this is not a police State and if this is not the kind of thing we would object to if we heard it went on in Rumania and Soviet Russia, I do not know what goes on in the police State we object to.  That is the kind of thing we expect to find in the police State.  That is part of the disrespect for the liberty of human beings.  The Minister will say this is all subject to the proviso that a man merely refused without good cause.</P>
    <P>I pose this question as I have done before.  A man may be told by his doctor: &ldquo;There is no reason why you should not have a surgical operation. Your blood pressure is all right, your heart is sound, your chest is all right and these are the only things that give rise to any cause for apprehension.&rdquo; The man may ask the doctor &ldquo;Tell me is it necessary for me to undergo a surgical operation?&rdquo;  The doctor may say: &ldquo;No, you can live with it&rdquo;.  The man may say: &ldquo;All right: I will live with it.&rdquo;  That man may be unreasonable.  It may be that a <Col N="1065" /> surgical operation extending over half an hour to three-quarters of an hour would make a dramatic change in his physical condition.  I believe it is the right of free people in a democracy to say that they will not submit themselves to a surgical operation if they do not want to.  That to me is freedom, as it is not freedom that we should say that people will be put in jail if they do not undergo a medical operation.</P>
    <P>I believe this House should reject this particular section.  If the Minister comes in in five or ten years time and lays before the Houses of the Oireachtas a list of the people who would not undergo these medical operations and shows us then the kind of depredations this has caused to his Occupational Injuries Fund, at that stage and with that experience we shall consider what kind of powers we will give him.  We shall never go the distance of giving him, or his successor in title, the right to say to any man that he must undergo a surgical operation.</P>
    <P>We had down an amendment to provide that people should not undergo treatment which was contrary to their religious susceptibilities.  That has been ruled out of order.  It was only when I was considering this at greater length that it occurred to me that part of the treatment people might have to undergo would be hypnosis.  Some people might say that hypnosis would be the real cure for one's neurasthenic condition. People will say: &ldquo;That may be so but I will not have myself hypnotised even if you tell me it will cure me.&rdquo;  I think it is a defect in this particular legislation that we have not&mdash;I say &ldquo;<i>mea culpa</i>&rdquo;&mdash;provided against that kind of medical treatment.  If somebody does not wish to undergo hypnotic treatment, I do not see why we should oblige them to surrender themselves body and soul into the hands of a hypnotist or to a person who practises that kind of thing.  For that reason I regret that on the question of medical treatment we have not provided against that, but the resources <Col N="1066" /> of Parliament are not exhausted and there are such things as amending bills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to understand what the real basis for all this sound and fury is.  Reading this section of this Bill, it seems to me that essentially it is merely re-enacting the position that exists at the moment. Indeed, it is not going so far as the present law does.  As I understand the present situation which has existed for many years, without any objection from Senator O'Quigley that I know of, an injured workman is expected to undergo the necessary medical treatment to remedy his injuries and the present position is that if he refuses to do so it is a matter for the court to decide whether his refusal is reasonable or not.  The Minister has modified this to the advantage of the workman.  At present if the court decides he is not reasonable, his compensation is altogether terminated; the Minister is only asking the power to be used in exceptional cases.  The only power he is asking is to withdraw the compensation for six weeks, which is considerably less drastic than the legislation at the moment.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley is trying to maintain that under this Bill a workman can be forced to undergo a surgical operation and suggests that is not the position at the moment.  It is the position at the moment.  There is no doubt at all that if a workman is required to have a finger set and refuses to have it done and ends his chance of recovery, then the court can take his compensation away from him. As Senator O'Quigley put it, he can be starved into agreeing.  That is the present position.  There is nothing new in this at all.  I think Senator O'Quigley is fascinated by the notion of the workman lying on his back about to undergo a serious internal operation and being forced by some official of the Minister's Department into doing this. This is not the position at all; this relates to simple things such as setting fingers and so forth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to speak too.  Senator O'Quigley has been attempting to perpetrate the notion <Col N="1068" /> that for the first time this Bill brings surgery into it, that formerly it was a matter of medical treatment&mdash;giving pills and so on &mdash; and that now surgery is being brought in.  It was quite clear to the majority of the commission at paragraph 411 that surgery was involved when they said &ldquo;treatment which might endanger his life&rdquo;. Senator O'Quigley attempted to say that in the past medical treatment did not include surgery, but it is perfectly clear from the practice of the courts in regard to workmen's compensation over the years, and from paragraph 411 of the Majority Report, that medical treatment did, in fact, include surgery.  There is nothing new about that at all.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald said, in effect, that workmen were protected by the judges, whereas under this Bill they would be at the mercy of officers of the Minister's Department who might behave in an utterly unreasonable way. I do not believe that.  It is perfectly obvious that no one will be forced to undergo surgery which might endanger his life.  That is covered by the words &ldquo;if the person fails without good cause&rdquo;.  Even if some utterly unreasonable and dictatorial officers of the Minister's Department did endeavour to force a workman to undergo that kind of surgery, it is quite clear that he could appeal to the courts.  He could take an action maintaining that the Act was not being observed.  I should imagine that it would be quite impracticable to try to insist on a man undergoing a surgical operation which might endanger his life if he maintained he had good cause.</P>
      <P>In any event, what is happening here is that the law as it stands is being re-enacted with the difference that whereas at the moment if a workman refuses to undergo a surgical operation he can be deprived of his compensation permanently, and in the Bill he can be deprived of it for six weeks. Otherwise, it is exactly the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanAlton" hpid="Dr. Alton Dr. Alton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that Senator O'Quigley's approach to this problem is the more correct one.  I do not think two wrongs will make a right.  I have <Col N="1069" /> always felt that anything which interferes with a person's decision concerning his own health is wrong.  When we had regulations affecting the treatment of TB patients whereby they were compelled to undergo treatment unless they were to lose their compensation or their benefit, the only justification that existed in that case was that we were dealing with an infectious disease and those people could be a danger to the community.  In such circumstances I felt the State had a right to insist either on treatment of the condition or segregation of such persons.  I also feel that where a person is insane or deemed to be incapable of making a decision for himself the State might have the right to dictate therapy. Where a minor is concerned I also feel the State could overrule the rights of parents and insist upon the minor having treatment.</P>
      <P>Apart from those three conditions, I do not feel the State has the right to insist on persons undergoing any form of therapy against their will.  By tradition we assume that medical treatment and physiotherapy if they do not do good will at least do no harm, but with modern drugs and modern treatment that may not be so in the future. In all cases of surgery I feel there is always an element of risk.  We have seen cases in the past in which even the pulling of a tooth has resulted in the loss of life of the patient.  Therefore, no one should have to submit to surgery against his will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We see many private patients with ample means who may be in severe pain for something like a disc lesion and they are so terrified and mentally disturbed at the idea of any treatment involving needles or knives that they go home with the pain rather than have a simple injection which would relieve it.  If people in such circumstances are entitled to refuse treatment, I do not see why workmen who might be equally terrified and frightened should not also be entitled to refuse it.  It is not a matter of how serious the operation is.  It is a matter of the person's approach to it.  That is the key point.  A person can be just as <Col N="1070" /> terrified of being put to sleep to have a finger set, as of being put to sleep to have a spinal operation which might relieve a paralysis or leave him totally paralysed for the rest of his life.</P>
    <P>Over and above that, I feel that if the State is going to order a person to have treatment, then the State must guarantee that the treatment will leave him better off than when he started. If the State is going to persist in this approach, the State must be liable to an action if such treatment fails, or if it leaves a person worse off than he was before.  The State must be prepared to stand over that risk to a person's life and health.  Consequently, while there are many parts of the Bill which I do not really like but which I am prepared to go along with, this is one part of the Bill with which I cannot agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professsor Jessop Professsor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professsor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with Senator Alton in many respects but I think we have left one factor out of consideration which should be given a bit more weight.  You cannot have medical treatment or surgical treatment without the doctor's co-operation.  We have to consider the integrity of the medical profession in this regard.  I do not think any surgeon will operate on a patient just because the person who decides the patient's claim for compensation or benefit suggests that it will be adjusted unless something is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An injured person can submit only to the medical treatment which a doctor is proposing to give him.  The officials who administer this subsection will not suggest the treatment.  They will not prescribe it.  It will be on the advice of the doctor.  I personally would rely on the ethical standards of my colleagues in this regard.  If a patient were unreasonably to refuse the help which he could get from his doctor, whether medical or surgical, I do not think it is unreasonable for some pressure to be brought to bear on him when there is a question of prolonged payment of compensation.  In such cases the usual procedure of consultation between doctors would decide exactly what should be done, and would probably get over the difficulties <Col N="1071" /> which I can quite see and which Senator O'Quigley has mentioned in his very persuasive argument in favour of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reply to Senator Jessop with regard to something he said with which I am not in agreement.  I think there is some confusion here in regard to what doctor we are talking about. As I understand the administrative procedure, the Deciding Officer&mdash;I am open to correction on this&mdash;will be advised by a doctor who will say: &ldquo;This man's condition is curable if a certain operation is undertaken.&rdquo;  The Deciding Officer, on the advice of his doctor, will then say to the man: &ldquo;Unless that operation is undertaken you will not get your compensation for the prescribed period.&rdquo;  The man may then go to his own doctor and say to him: &ldquo;I have been told that I must undergo an operation.  Is there any risk?&rdquo;  His doctor may say that there is a risk.  The man may then decide that he will not go ahead with the operation but that he will be penalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>There is good cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in this which advises that the matter is a good cause.  If the Minister will write that in it will go a long way towards meeting us.  Good cause is whatever the Deciding Officer decides is good cause.  There is no appeal to the courts in this respect.  I think there is some confusion by Senator Jessop. It would be perfectly correct in medical ethics if the Deciding Officer said that the operation would involve no risk but the man's own doctor may say there is a risk.  There will be a conflict of advice.  Not only that but two different questions are being asked of two different doctors.  There are, therefore, two different points of view in regard to this.  The doctor in the first instance may advise the Deciding Officer that the man's condition is curable if he undergoes the operation. The man's own doctor is asked if there is a risk involved and he may say there <Col N="1072" /> is.  The man's own doctor may say that the operation would be a good thing but that it would involve risk. The man asks his own doctor if there is risk involved because it is his own health which is at stake.  The Deciding Officer does not have to take that into consideration when he gets advice from his doctor.</P>
      <P>I do not think this matter can be met on the basis of Senator Jessop's argument.  It is more complicated than that.  There are two different questions involved here but even if the question were exactly the same, with respect to both our doctor Senators here, and it was put to two different doctors you would not necessarily get identical replies from them.  I think the views expressed by Senator Alton and Senator O'Quigley are correct.  I am sure their interpretation of the matter is correct.</P>
      <P>This principle does not exist in the existing code and there is no use telling us that it exists.  If it exists there is no reason to insert the word &ldquo;surgical&rdquo;. The Minister is changing the code by inserting the word &ldquo;surgical&rdquo; to apply to workmen's compensation cases when no such word applies in the case of the social welfare disability cases.  If, in fact, medical treatment now includes surgical treatment the insertion the Minister is proposing is superfluous.  If it does not include it, then its insertion is confusing.  The Minister is stuck on either horn of the dilemma and he has not succeeded in anything he has said up to this in getting off it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is introducing a new principle because he is asking a man to undertake something which would be risky.  I suspect this matter is unconstitutional.  It has been an odd characteristic of this Government in the years they have been in office since 1957 that when they refer to matters, they say they are not unconstitutional. I consider that the Constitution is in many ways an excellent document, whatever was said about it at the time. It is puzzling that this Government have ignored something which could be unconstitutional, particularly when they introduced the document and defended it very ably in the Dáil.  If <Col N="1073" /> the Minister gets up and says that this is not unconstitutional, as so many Ministers have said about many other things, I would not accept that. The Minister should bear in mind that the Constitution is the Government's own document.  It gives certain rights to people.  It gives them the right to life and liberty and the right of protection against undue interference from the State.</P>
    <P>I regard the proposal of the Minister to insert the word &ldquo;surgical&rdquo; in this Bill as unconstitutional.  I would ask the Minister to amend this.  I am sure this principle has been put in possibly by civil servants and the Minister might not have realised its implication and that this was a new principle. Now that the position has been made clear to him, the Minister should agree to our amendment.  He should not insert something which is unconstitutional and objectionable in this legislation.</P>

Medical treatment was wide enough to include any kind of medical treatment, including surgery and it was provided in the old Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the viewpoint put forward by Senator Alton.  His contribution was the best we have heard on this matter. This matter affects the integrity of the individual.  In that regard we all remember when the question arose, for instance, on tests for alcohol where <Col N="1074" /> there was a question of drunken driving involved.  A great deal of thought was given to the interference with the individual as to whether he should submit to a blood test or another type of test where the question of dangerous driving was involved.  Before action was taken&mdash;I understand it is not in operation yet&mdash;the Government had to give serious consideration to what was described as an infringement of the rights of the individual.  These rights no longer obtain in a number of European countries but I know of no country whose Government have gone so far as to suggest that the integrity of the individual can be interfered with to such an extent that under any compensation code he must submit himself to a surgical operation which could involve, perhaps, results opposite to those intended by the surgeon, which could endanger the individual's life.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that such a provision has been in operation in our legislation, in spite of Senator E. Ryan's intervention. Without in any way casting a reflection on our medical profession, doctors differ.  George Bernard Shaw in <i>Doctor's Dilemma</i> illustrates this obsession of the medical profession.  Some favour a surgical operation as the be all and end all of treatment.  Others shy away from the idea of operations. There are different approaches to treatment. It could be that a particular doctor was very keen on the use of the knife.  He might make a decision which the Department official would like.  On that basis we must take into consideration immediately the type of individual Senator Alton referred to&mdash;the man or woman who was fearful of either the knife or the needle.  Such persons exist in the middle and upper income groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we had a statement from a very responsible and well-known medical man that many people refuse treatment or hesitate to have treatment involving a surgical operation.  Because such people have that right, which nobody wishes to take away from them, why is it that the State, because there is a certain amount of money involved, insists that the workman must submit to an operation which his nature and his instinct revolt against?  On that <Col N="1075" /> basis, the Minister should reconsider this matter and, whatever about the deletion of the two lines suggested, should remove the word &ldquo;surgical&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

      <P>This section provides power to make regulations in certain circumstances.  I made it clear that it has not been decided it will be necessary to make these regulations. We have not found it necessary to make them in the case of disability benefit.  I made it clear that if these regulations are made they will be reasonable regulations operated in a reasonable way, that there will be no attempt to exert undue pressure on anybody to undergo a major operation. Under similar provisions in the British scheme, regulations have been made and these include, and I quote:</P>
      <P>No person shall forfeit any benefit for refusing to undergo a surgical operation not being one of a minor character.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that if regulations are made here they will contain a similar provision which, in effect, restricts surgical treatment for the purpose of this section to minor surgery.  If this provision is not included in any regulations that may be made, then these regulations may be annulled.  In so far as the question of the existing workmen's compensation code is concerned, I have here a volume entitled <i>Employers' Liability and Workmen's Compensation in Ireland,</i> by Bernard Shillman.  At page 119, where the author is dealing with the question of whether a workman who has met with an accident has by refusal to undergo an operation forfeited his right to receive further compensation, it is stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As between himself and his employer an injured workman must at all times act reasonably.  It is his duty to aid recovery by all reasonable means.  If by his neglect or misconduct he aggravates his injury and incapacity for work, or if its continuance results from such subsequent unreasonable conduct, it cannot be regarded in law as a consequence <Col N="1076" /> of the accident: it is due to his unreasonableness.</P>
    <P>It is this test of reasonableness which determines whether an injured workman who insists upon the payment of compensation should submit to a surgical operation.  If in all the circumstances of the case his refusal to undergo such operation is unreasonable he disentitles himself to further compensation, for his incapacity ceases any longer to be the result of the accident.</P>
    <P>That, I take it, is the law at present. Here, as I have said, if these regulations are made at all they will include a provision limiting this to a surgical operation of a minor character so that, in effect, the position in this regard will favour the workman who prefers not to take what other people would consider reasonable steps to improve his condition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What should be remembered is that payment of benefit is due only when disablement arises from an accident. If without good cause a workman refuses to take reasonable steps to overcome his disability, then the disability no longer arises from the accident but from his own desire to retain the disability.  Another point on the proposal to delete the word &ldquo;surgical&rdquo; from section 33 is that this definition of &ldquo;medical treatment&rdquo; relates not only to section 31 but also to section 14 which provides for an increase of disablement benefit during approved hospital treatment.  This treatment is defined in section 33 as <Col N="1077" /> being medical treatment received as an in-patient in a hospital.</P>

Medical treatment is defined in subsection (1) of section 33. I think that most people here realise that the case that has been put up by Opposition Senators is a ridiculous one.  Everybody here knows that there is no intention whatever to compel any person to undergo any major surgical operation if he does not feel inclined to do so.</P>

      <P>Here we are dealing with a piece of legislation and the Minister should only seek and be granted such powers as are necessary to implement the legislation.  The Minister and, indeed, other speakers have referred to the fact that this power to compel a man to undergo a surgical operation is contained in the 1934 workmen's compensation code, but to say that is utterly dishonest, and dishonest to the knowledge of the Minister, because when the Minister was reading from Mr. Bernard Shillman's book, a copy of which happily and fortunately I have here, he did not read &mdash;I certainly did not hear him read&mdash;<Col N="1078" /> paragraph 1.  He is content to base his case on Steele v. Robert George and Co. Ltd. (1941), Northern Ireland, but he has omitted paragraph 1 which says &ldquo;There is nothing in the Workmen's Compensation code which imposes on a workman an absolute obligation to submit to a surgical operation or even to undergo any special form of treatment.&rdquo;</P>

The Minister, when he got up and was unable to read what was before him, did not have the grace to admit that he was wrong or apologise.  I certainly would be on my feet at once to apologise if I misread anything or misled the House, because that is not my form.  I do not think that anything we have to say in this House <Col N="1079" /> will be constructive if it is by way of misreading what others have said. Senator E. Ryan said, and so did Senator Yeats, that this was in the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934. It is not in the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934.  The Minister reads then from Mr. Bernard Shillman's book in relation to a case not decided under this jurisdiction but decided in an entirely different jurisdiction, that is to say, in the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal.  I would have thought that if the Minister wants to tell us what the law is in this country he would give us the law as interpreted by our courts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am very glad that I have this book here with me this evening so that we will not all be wondering what the Minister is talking about and be thwarted and frustrated by the knowledge that it was not correct, in having the book here. Senator Yeats made bold to refer to the report, this time the Majority Report, of the Commission on Workmen's Compensation.  I am beginning to wonder are Senators on that side of the House or the Minister literate, because they are not able to read what is clearly set out in the different reports. The Minister could not read what is <Col N="1080" /> set out in bluff capitals in relation to the right of appeal in the Minority Report.  The Majority Report, paragraph 411, said &ldquo;We recommend that there should be no change in the existing arrangements in regard to requiring a workman to submit for medical treatment, nor should a workman be required to undergo a course of rehabilitation as a condition for continuing to receive workmen's compensation&rdquo;. As we lawyers would then say, <i>a fortiori</i> there should be no change in the arrangements in regard to requiring a workman to receive surgical treatment when the Commission say that he should not even be required to receive rehabilitation treatment as a condition for continuing to receive workmen's compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard the Senator read a lot, but either the Senator or the Commission must not be literate.  In any event, the Report shows that the majority subscribed to the view that a workman should not be required to undergo a course of rehabilitation as a condition for continuing to receive workmen's compensation. If this is the view of the Commission, surely the Commission did not then say that he should be required to undergo surgical treatment. That is as plain as can be.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to know that, because that disposes of a charge that I was about to make that the Senator did not even understand the Bill, a charge that I do not make at this time.  I want to say that Mr. Shillman in his book referred to three cases&mdash;one which was decided in this country, another which was decided by the House of Lords in England, and I thought that we had got rid of the House of Lords and reference to the Privy Council quite some time ago, and the third was to the Court of Appeal of Northern Ireland.  The one case that was decided in this country dealt with a slight operation.</P>
      <P>Now the Minister says this will relate only to minor operations and he refers to the British code.  There is so much reference to what goes on in Britain and Northern Ireland that I often wonder why it was necessary at all to break the connection with England.  As I understand it, and as I am advised, there is no such thing as a distinction between major and minor operations; that where a person has to undergo an anaesthetic that is regarded, in medical circles, as involving a risk.  Where you have any risk and where that involves a person's health and wellbeing that is to my mind a matter of major concern to the individual concerned.  But, of course, that would not be a matter of major concern to that Department which will operate this system in that flexible and impersonal way described in the Minority Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> I am not prepared to say to the workmen of this country that they are to submit themselves to the adjudication of the impersonal system which will operate in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada. I am not prepared to do that; other Senators may be, but I am not prepared, in a matter which relates to the health and wellbeing of a person, to submit the final arbitrament of that matter to the impersonal decision of a Deciding Officer or of an Appeals Officer in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Now I put down an amendment dealing with the objections on grounds of religion.  I have already indicated that there are some people who would not submit to the kind of rehabilitative or medical treatment which might be involved in hypnosis.  Some people might say: &ldquo;Oh, that is only a laugh, there are lots of people who submit to Paul Goldin in the Olympia Theatre.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I repeat what a judge decided but there is no precedent in the legislation of this country &mdash;and I invited the Minister earlier to show if there was and even if there were I should deplore that it existed&mdash; to require a man to undergo a surgical operation for the purposes of qualifying, or continuing to qualify, for a particular benefit.</P>
      <P>I oftentimes in this House referred to, and I shall continue, so long as the 1937 Constitution is in operation, to refer to the obligation of the Oireachtas to have regard to the provisions of this Constitution and not to enact anything which is invalid or repugnant to any part of it or to the Constitution in general.</P>
      <P>I want to read Article 40, paragraph 3 for the edification of Senators opposite who evidently do not know what the Constitution means in this regard.  It deals with fundamental rights and it says:</P>
      <P>1º The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have thought it clear that one of the personal rights of the citizen was to decide whether or not he would submit himself to a surgical operation, that he could say: &ldquo;I will <Col N="1084" /> not undergo that operation.&rdquo;  That is what the Constitution says.  The State shall defend, but it goes further than that in clear language.  It says:</P>
    <P>and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are not defending these rights; we are assailing and attacking them.  We are saying to the workman who will not undergo the operation &ldquo;If you do not undergo it we will starve you into submission for a period of six weeks.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about what the courts decide.  It is the first time in the history of this country that the Legislature decided under a specific enactment that &ldquo;You will undergo a surgical operation and if you do not we will deprive you, your wife and children of workmen's compensation for a period of six weeks.&rdquo;  That is what is involved in this legislation, and that is the principle which this House is being asked to decide upon tonight.</P>
      <P>Our Constitution not only recognises personal rights and guarantees to respect them, but it goes the further distance of assuming an obligation to vindicate them.  I do not think anyone for one moment can say that in paragraph (b) of this subsection, where we are requiring a man to submit himself to a surgical operation as a condition precedent to continuing to get workmen's compensation, we are defending or respecting or vindicating the personal rights of the injured workman.  That is what is involved in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say that this will operate only in respect of minor operations.  That is not the point.  The principle we are establishing here is an obligation upon any citizen who happens to be entitled to workmen's compensation or occupational injury <Col N="1085" /> benefit to submit himself to a surgical operation.  The Minister loves precedents, and so does Senator Yeats. Senator Yeats referred to a decision of our courts.  I cannot tell the House when it was arrived at.  The Minister referred to the precedent created in Northern Ireland.  There was another precedent created by the House of Lords which we got rid of long ago when we abolished appeals to the Privy Council.</P>

I am quite satisfied that is not defending, respecting or vindicating the personal rights of the workers of this country. The Minister has tried to get out of the difficulty in which he now finds himself by saying this will apply only to minor operations but I am told that in medical circles there is no special medical distinction between minor and major operations.  For instance, I wonder would Senators opposite like to say whether an operation for the stiffening of an ankle or a knee joint which is causing pain because of arthritis is a major or a minor operation.  I should love to be a schoolmaster and ask: &ldquo;Hands up all who think it is a minor operation.&rdquo;  I do not think anybody here would say that it is a minor operation but the courts in Northern Ireland thought that an operation for the stiffening of an ankle joint was a minor operation and that it was unreasonable for a man not to undergo such an operation. You then decide it is necessary <Col N="1087" /> for him to do so in order to relieve pain and prevent the onset of serious arthritis.  That would be regarded as a minor operation.  That is the kind of minor operation for which the Minister is prepared to make regulations as a condition in relation to payment out of the occupational injuries fund.</P>
    <P>Earlier this evening I referred to the amendment, which was ruled out of order, in relation to the requirements of people to undergo medical treatment. I thought there were certain kinds of people who do not want to undergo certain types of medical treatment on religious grounds.  I am told that Christian Scientists, who are a sect in this community and who are citizens of our country and have the same rights as we have, do not believe in either medical or surgical treatment, yet they can be required to undergo a minor operation according to the Minister or else they will be deprived of workmen's compensation.  There are other people who, I think, fall into the category of homeopaths, who do not believe in the kind of treatment we believe in.  They believe in herbs. If one of those people is asked by his doctor to undergo a course of cortisone, which it may be perfectly reasonable for him to undergo, and if that person does not undergo that treatment he will be disentitled to workmen's compensation.  I can find nothing here based on rational grounds for having the medical or surgical treatment.  If it is a matter of emotional or religious reasons then no difficulty will arise with regard to the Christian Scientist.  If it is an emotional reason and the doctor says that he should have the operation and the Minister's doctor says that he should have the operation he could say: &ldquo;I will not undergo the operation because I do not like it.&rdquo;  The Minister has not in mind &ldquo;good cause based on rational grounds having regard to medical science and medical evidence.&rdquo; That is the kind of evidence which has been produced to date in the cases that have been cited.  There is, to my mind, a gross invasion of personal rights involved in this particular section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> The Minister and Senator Yeats referred to the Majority Report. Supposing we concede that Senator Yeats was right in his interpretation of what is contained in the Report, and that that was a correct interpretation of the recommendation made in the context of a determination by a court, which is quite a different thing from determination by an officer of the Minister, I would be quite prepared to consider the circumstances in which such matters might have been left to people who are trained and able to assess individual qualities.  I very much doubt whether ultimately I would agree that a judge can say to a man: &ldquo;If you do not have a surgical operation, I will cut off your workmen's compensation.&rdquo; If we were to allow that Senator Yeats was right, which of course he is not, and if his interpretation were correct as to what he says is in the context of a decision by a judicial person&mdash;this is always difficult to my mind and I am sure Senator Yeats will agree with me on this&mdash;a judge in the circuit court and ultimately a judge in the Supreme Court and a person appointed by the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is quite a different thing for the Legislature to put something in their legislation so that the law can say that that is what is in the law as they found it.  The Minister may take his present interpretation of the law because the existing law may have been badly drafted when it was open to that interpretation.  We are making <Col N="1089" /> law here and deciding that a man shall submit himself to a surgical operation.

      <P>In page 25, line 21, before &ldquo;to attend&rdquo; to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;provided that his medical condition permits him to do so&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill as drafted states that the person can lose his benefit if he fails without good cause to attend at such places and times as may be required for the purpose of medical examination or treatment.  There is no provision here to cover the case of somebody whose medical condition does not permit him to attend at such places and times.  The answer given to this on Committee Stage was not satisfactory.  We were told the Deciding Officer would interpret.  I do not think we should ask anybody whose medical condition does not permit him to travel as required to submit himself to medical examination and treatment and to show good cause.</P>
      <P>The requirement should be made only in respect of people whose medical condition permits them and we should not leave it to the Deciding Officer to decide whether any degree of medical condition is sufficient to be regarded in his view as good cause.  We should state specifically what good cause is for a man not being able to attend at such time and place.  The reply on Committee Stage was not satisfactory and I wish to raise the matter again now.</P>

      <P>This amendment is an example of how far the Senators on the opposite side are pushing this and of the ridiculous lengths to which they are pushing it.  This is a quite ridiculous amendment.  It merely substitutes one decision on the part of the Deciding Officer for another.  If the Deciding Officer is not prepared to be reasonable and say there is good cause that a man's medical condition does not permit him to attend, he is just a likely to say he does not agree that the medical condition is such that the person <Col N="1091" /> could not attend.  If he is going to be unreasonable about one thing he is going to be unreasonable about the other.  It seems that this amendment adds nothing to the situation.  Assuming that there were really any grounds for worry about this or for thinking that the Deciding Officer was going to act in an unreasonable way, then this does not help the matter at all.</P>

      <P>I am more impressed with Senator E. Ryan's contribution than with the Minister's.  It may be that I am wrong in my interpretation of what the effect of the amendment would be.  What I had in mind was that as it stands, as I read it, the onus is on the injured workman to prove good cause, whereas my intention&mdash;perhaps not given effect to by the amendment&mdash;was to put the onus on the Deciding Officer to show that, in fact, the workman's medical condition permitted him to come.  I was anxious to shift the onus, though maybe I have not succeeded in doing that.  I am importing into this situation a judicial concept which Deciding Officers in their bureaucratic way will ignore, but it may be that the onus of proof does not arise here because it will be considered bureaucratically. I intended by this amendment to shift the onus of proof, and if, in fact, I have not done so, then I have not achieved anything, I admit.  This is a case where Senator E. Ryan is a greater legal expert than I am, but that is what I was trying to do, possibly unsuccessfully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 25, line 24 to add at the end:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;relating to the answering of reasonable enquiries from the Department of Social Welfare about <Col N="1092" /> his claim, the provision at his home of details of his present location when he departs from his home for periods of twenty-four hours or more, obedience to his doctor's instructions, and other matters likely to affect his recovery&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This brings us back to the prescribed rules of behaviour.  The Minister was good enough to indicate on the Committee Stage what he had in mind with regard to the prescribed rules of behaviour.  What I was anxious to do was to spell these out and not leave it to the civil servants to decide what suits them.  In this respect I am anxious in particular to reverse the present position as I understand it from the Minister under the Social Welfare Acts under which a man is forbidden to leave his home unless he does something.  I want to reverse that and to put in a more reasonable requirement that he should leave details of his location at home if he departs from his home for periods of 24 hours or more.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that any legislation should be so worded as to tell a man that he may not leave his house unless ...; that is a completely inappropriate way to legislate about our people.  We should reverse that point and put it in the reasonable form in which I think it is now, that I have covered the various contingencies the Minister referred to, except that the Minister wants to be in a position to harry a man so that he would not be in a position to leave his house day or night to go to a shop, a publichouse or anywhere else, without leaving a message.  I do not think that that idea is reasonable.  I think that the requirement should be limited to cases of leaving his home for 24 hours or more.  If he leaves overnight there is no reason why he cannot be contacted.</P>
    <P>The idea that a man must stay in his house throughout the civil servants' working day, 9 to 5, or whatever it may be and be, at the beck and call of the official, unable to leave for a few minutes without leaving a message, is a bureaucratic approach which is quite unacceptable. I have covered all the contingencies <Col N="1093" /> mentioned by the Minister except for the modification in this instance of his requirement that a man should on his departure leave a message or should not leave his house at any time for any period without leaving a message.  I have changed it around into the form that he must provide at his home details of his present location when he departs from it for 24 hours or more. The other cases are identical with what the Minister said he wanted to provide for.  I think that the amendment covers all reasonable requirements and can only be resisted on unreasonable bureaucratic lines.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to seeing if it is possible to change the wording in the rules of behaviour which will be prescribed to the wording that would appear to please Senator FitzGerald, though I do not see any necessity to do so.  I think that I have made it clear that the rules which will be prescribed will be the minimum necessary to ensure that a claimant satisfies the conditions for benefit and that he does not impede his recovery to health.  There is no question of harrying anybody.  These rules will only operate when there appears to be an attempt made to evade the social welfare officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that the limitation that would be imposed by this amendment could. for instance, preclude a regulation in regard to certain work which a claimant might, as in the case of disability benefit, be permitted to do without incurring a penalty, for example, work as an outworker under a scheme charitable in character where his earnings do not exceed £3 a week. This is allowed in regard to disability benefit, and if it was not possible to do this in regard to injury benefit, then there would be a hardship on a claimant for injury benefit as compared with a claimant for disability benefit.  It is also not deemed to be feasible to have this requirement in respect of periods of absence of 24 hours or more.  Anybody will quite see that if the limitation of 24 hours or more was there it could be made very difficult for the social welfare officer to ensure that <Col N="1094" /> benefit was not being paid when it was not due.</P>

      <P>This, I am afraid, has not got us any further at all.  The Minister does not seem to have even an ounce of flexibility left in him. I am not sure that he ever had it in him.  It is a pity that he has adopted in regard to the whole of this Bill, right up to this last thing, a completely inflexible attitude.  Only one thing has been changed, and that when there was pressure from the other side of the House as well as this.  His extraordinary ability to reflect the bureaucratic mind seems to me to be a very real failure in a Minister, and frankly we are not used to it to that degree.  We have had in this House Ministers who come in and are prepared to take open flexible action and are not prepared to be ruled by bureaucracy.  It is a pity that the Minister has not in this instance adopted a more flexible attitude. I cannot under any circumstances agree that it is reasonable to require of a man that if he leaves his house for any period of time he must leave notice of where he has gone simply because he is unfortunate enough to have fallen into the grip of the Minister's poor law scheme.</P>

      <P>In page 26, line 29, before &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and farmers owning land the rateable valuation of which does not exceed £50.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the merits of this amendment is that it makes it all too clear what <Col N="1095" /> I meant by &ldquo;small farmer&rdquo; in view of the ambiguity that this phrase was felt on the other side of the House to convey when we last met.  I was also accused of having widened the whole issue too much by saying that anybody should be allowed to become a voluntary subscriber.  This amendment is simply to show that I am quite prepared to have it limited to farmers with a valuation of under £50 who should be permitted to opt into the scheme.  I am not sure actually, as I am on my feet, that the amendment is worded or is performing quite the role I intended for it; as to whether, in fact, it operates to allow them to become voluntary subscribers. I might have left out a couple of words in the actual amendment. In any event, the intention is to permit farmers of a valuation of less than £50 to opt into the scheme.  I might have been widening the issue too much by leaving it open to anybody to opt in.  The arguments in favour of allowing these farmers, with small holdings, the right to opt into the scheme are self-evident.  The Minister did accept that there was a strong case for it.  I would hope that by narrowing it down I am making it possible for the Minister to accept this proposition without waiting for the overall reform of the social welfare code, for which we have waited nine years now since this Government came into office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I was in favour, in principle, of permitting self-employed people to become voluntary contributors to the social insurance schemes wherever feasible.  I appreciate that Senator FitzGerald intended by this amendment to make it possible for farmers of under £50 valuation to become voluntary contributors but, in fact, his amendment does not do that.  The effect of the amendment is to make them compulsorily insurable and I am certainly not so sure that I am in favour of making self employed people compulsorily insurable. I am even more certainly convinced that a considerable number of farmers <Col N="1096" /> under £50 valuation would resent that quite bitterly.  The effect of this amendment would be to make those people compulsorily insurable.  While I said I was in favour of the principle of admitting them as voluntary contributors to as many of the social insurance schemes as possible, I also said this was quite a difficult question and one which could not possibly be dealt with during the passage of this Bill.  That has to be my attitude on it.</P>

        <i>(Longford):</i> Apparently the Minister is getting a bit flexible towards Senator FitzGerald, probably because of his castigations of a few moments ago.

      <P>
        <i>(Longford):</i>&mdash;&mdash;in regard to insurance, is a bit alien to farming and self-employed people.  I think that any effect it had in the past on self-employed people in rural areas was not a good one.  As far as the merit of the amendment is concerned, there is nothing&mdash;as things are&mdash;to prevent the farmer with a poor law valuation of less than £50 insuring against one type of risk or another with any commercial insurance company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not able to give any information as to the premium costs or actuarial value.  I shall leave that sort of calculation to Senator FitzGerald and people who understand the matter well.  But, as things are, I should prefer to see the people I refer to remaining self-reliant. If you have systems such as this Bill provides for, you are bound to need more power&mdash;in other words, more dedication and more infringement of human rights in the interest of a system, of the establishment of a centre. That is the only justification I could see for voting against the amendment.  If we are to have systems like this, we must have more authority.  I am one of those people who like to give only as <Col N="1097" /> much authority to an Executive as is necessary to do a good job of work.</P>
    <P>Ministers seem to take the short term view.  None of us knows what sort of Government we will have in 50 or 100 years from now.  That is why we should have a pattern in legislation. Having said that, I think it is not a good thing to go on the road which might ultimately lead towards compulsory insurance for small self-employed people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to this discussion and I am a bit puzzled as to where we are going.  I think Senator FitzGerald's approach to this matter was that he preferred to let the insurance companies take care of workmen's compensation.  Here in this amendment he is suggesting that the farmers be brought in under this.  The farmers are self-employed; they can cover this risk of injury in the course of their self-employment with commercial insurance companies.  Now Senator FitzGerald is saying: &ldquo;Well, the State should intervene in this and should provide this form of insurance&rdquo;. It would be a very good thing if the State did provide this form of insurance, particularly if there were some positive measures to induce self-employed farmers and such people to cover themselves because, if they are injured in the course of their employment, they are in great difficulty and it would be a very good thing that they should be covered in regard to this risk.</P>
      <P>Whether or not this is the appropriate measure in which to do that I am not at all clear.  I am a bit nonplussed about Senator FitzGerald's approach to the Bill and to this particular amendment.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry to &ldquo;nonplus&rdquo; Senator Murphy but I think, perhaps, Senator Murphy was not here when I was talking on this debate in the beginning and when I explained my position in relation to this matter.  The reason why, with great qualms, I supported the Majority Report was that I felt the case had not quite been made for a change and that, <Col N="1098" /> in particular, the merits of the social welfare scheme proposed were such that as between the two I would prefer the <i>status quo.</i>  I wrote an addendum to the Report to make that clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no inhibitions about talking when this seems to be in the public interest and I hold no brief whatever with insurance companies in this matter.  What I am concerned about here is that, in fact, it would benefit farmers if they could have access to this scheme.  The premiums to be paid to insurance companies are correspondingly high and, if they could join in this scheme&mdash;I think some of them would do so&mdash;it would be to their benefit.  I was interested in what Senator O'Reilly had to say and I respect his concern to minimise bureaucratic interference.  I feel that during the debate today and the last day he might have been happier on this side of the House as we fought the battle against bureaucratic interference.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I did not make my amendment clear.  There is a drafting error on my part.  I have the feeling that I inadvertently turned it into compulsory inclusion for farmers of £50 valuation.  That was not my intention. I would say though that there is a strong case for doing so ultimately. Many of these farmers do not protect themselves against the risks involved in their occupation.  There are cases in which the State must, however reluctant one must feel at having State intervention, step in to protect people when they fail to protect themselves. A case can be made for this. We could test out the ground in this area by leaving it open to farmers to come in voluntarily as a first step and see how many of them did so.  It might be desirable, however, to include them compulsorily.  I did not intend to include that compulsorily at this stage; it is an error on my part.  As the amendment is not expressed to my thinking on this point I am prepared to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 30, to delete lines 13 to 19 inclusive and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Where an order is proposed to be made under this section a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 40 which this amendment is designed to improve gives power to the Minister to make certain adaptations in the Act when bringing it into operation. I can quite see the necessity when you are welding a piece of legislation of this kind into another complicated and complex code to have powers of the kind sought.  But, when it comes to changing the provisions of an Act of Parliament, I think that something more than a mere regulation to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas is required.  We have had that kind of situation in previous enactments and, indeed, since the Minister is so fond of precedents it is no harm to refer to what was done in the <Col N="1100" /> Social Welfare Act, 1952, in relation to which this Act will be read and construed.  In that Act it is to be found in a number of cases that where regulations of a far-reaching character are made these regulations, before coming into operation, must be laid in draft form before each House of the Oireachtas and a resolution passed approving of them.  Until that is done the regulations do not have effect.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that the Minister in that way that he has, because he is so fond of precedents, will probably refer to a similar provision under the Social Welfare Acts in the bringing into operation of the Widows and Orphans and the Old Age Pensions Act where regulations of this kind could be made merely by laying them before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  What I want to insist on here is that we must be on our guard against bad precedents and, indeed, where bad precedents have been established in the past we ought, when we have the opportunity to do so, correct them.</P>
    <P>Under this Act it seems to me that there will be no difficulty whatever where the Minister wants to make such adaptations as are necessary for bringing the Act into operation in coming into each House of the Oireachtas with a draft of the order.  That is the kind of thing which has to be done under the Social Welfare Acts.  It is done under other Acts, and I think it is a derogation of the authority of Parliament to say that the making of an Order and the mere laying of it before each House shall be effective to change an Act of Parliament.  I can quite see that there might not be a necessity for coming in and having a full debate but I think since it has been found proper on previous occasions to seek the approval of Parliament in respect of draft orders of an important character we ought to regard as sufficiently important to warrant the same kind of procedure where we are making changes in the legislation even though for the very good purpose of bringing the Act into operation.  For that reason, I suggest the House should accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>As Senators know, any such order that may be made may be annulled by a motion of either House and I think it is agreed that with a Bill of this nature it is not possible to foresee at this stage all the contingencies that may arise when it comes into operation and it is desirable to have an expeditious remedy, for instance, in the case of a workman who it is clearly intended would be entitled to benefit but who, because of the wording in the Bill, may be disqualified.  It would not be possible to remedy a situation such as this if it were to occur if the order had to be laid before the House for approval before being made.</P>
      <P>I agree that there would be no real difficulty in doing what is suggested but there would be unnecessary delay. There is this safeguard at any rate and if any such order is made and if it appears to be objectionable to any Senator this move to have the order annulled can be made.</P>

      <P>I detect a note of flexibility in the Minister's approach to the Bill at the conclusion of the debate on the last amendment.  It is a pity that we did not have more of this and that the Minister, having to stay in this environment, should have sustained that flexibility which I said was noted on the Report Stage.  At least the Minister does credit to the authority of the House and when that is the Minister's approach I have less hesitation in withdrawing this amendment than I had in withdrawing some of the others.</P>

      <P>We debated this Bill on Second Stage, on Committee Stage and on Report Stage at considerable length and one can only regret that the Bill leaves this House in a much less better shape than it might have been if the Minister's capacity for flexibility, which overtook him on the last amendment, had manifested itself earlier in <Col N="1102" /> the course of our deliberations.  The truth of the matter is that the Opposition are not always wrong and the Government are not always right.  The only substantial amendment made on this side of the House, that was made at all from this side of the House, is one to which some of the Minister's Party subscribed.  That is amendment No. 19 which gives some form of appeal to the courts.  It is very regrettable that these are the only kind of amendments that are acceptable to the Minister.  I have very little doubt that a number of other amendments suggested by people on this side of the House were equally deserving of more favourable consideration by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Be that as it may, we have here now a new system of compensation for people who are incapacitated through injury arising out of and in the course of their employment.  To the extent that the Bill first of all improves the conditions under which the benefit will be more readily available, and increases the amount of benefit, the Bill is worthwhile, but all of that could be achieved by a different system.  The Bill is filled with conditions, and with regulations that will have to be made and implemented, some by the Minister and some by the Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated, we have no great faith in that kind of system. It can only remain for the likes of me to hope that some of the things which have been said in the course of this debate, if they are drawn to the attention of these various functionaries constituted under the Social Welfare Acts, will bear fruit, and that the approach of the Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers will not be the impersonal one referred to in the Minority Report, but a personal and humane approach.  That is the kind of approach which I hope will be adopted by these people.  I hope that is the approach which the Minister will ecourage them to adopt in the implementation of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things I dread when legislation of this kind is being enacted, is the amount of to-ing and fro-ing which it will give rise to between the people entitled to benefit and Deputies and <Col N="1103" /> public representatives and the Minister. Of course, there will be an increase in the number of letters flowing into the Department of Social Welfare immediately someone is deprived of what he considers to be his rights under this Bill.  In effect, one can expect that the Deciding Officers and the Appeals Officers will be affected by the standing of the person who makes the representation on behalf of the claimant workman or workwoman.  That is regrettable, and I would be much happier if, in the exercise of the discretion vested in them under this Bill, and in the decisions they are called upon to make, the Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers exercised that discretion without regard to the political pressures, the Party political pressures which will undoubtedly be exerted upon them from time to time to make them change their minds.</P>
    <P>There are provisions in the Bill which entitle Deciding Officers to review cases.  Of course, the power to review will be resorted to by people exercising Party political pressure.  That is one of the great objections I see to legislation of this kind.  I hope that so far as he can the Minister will give a direction to people who are vested with discretionary power, by statute, to see to it that they are not subjected to pressures, or that they do not yield if they are subjected to pressures of that kind.</P>
    <P>This Bill is like a tree in the winter time.  It is stark, but in the fullness of time, it will be festooned with regulations which will envelop it like the leaves on the trees outside.  We will not be able to see this stark measure for all the regulations which will encrust it by the time the Minister has ceased to make them.  Because of that, it is urgently necessary that in conjunction with this Bill the Minister should provide some kind of service for workmen who will have need to resort to this.  I cannot for the life of me see how, with all the regulations that will be made under this Bill, the workers will know what their rights are.</P>
    <P>It may well be that it will be necessary for the Minister to introduce <Col N="1104" /> legislation&mdash;I do not think it will be; I think it could be done in the ordinary implementation of the Bill&mdash;to provide the necessary legal services or legal aids or advisory aids&mdash;call them what you will; I do not mind&mdash;in the Department of Social Welfare to enable the workmen to know the benefits to which they are entitled. These aids should be such that any worker who thinks he is being deprived of his rights can go to the particular functionary and ask to be advised on what his rights are.  It is very important that the functionary should be clothed in powers and given status that will enable a workman to rely upon the advice given to him.  If that is not done, I have a very great fear that a great deal more will be involved in the administration of this Bill than is necessary.</P>
    <P>I cannot but again advert to the serious inroads which I believe have been made upon personal liberty by the Legislature in this piece of legislation. It has been pitiable to watch a Minister of State in a free Parliament in a prison of precedent and officials.  The Minister has the power to decide what his Party will accept, and it seemed to me on numerous occasions that any Minister acting reasonably and having regard to the wishes expressed by his own side of the House, the wishes expressed by the Trade Union Congress, and the wishes expressed on this side of the House, would have accepted a number of the amendments that were suggested. That that has not been done is a matter of great regret.  I hope that if in the working out of this piece of legislation the Minister finds that he was wrong and we were right, he will not hesitate to introduce the necessary amending legislation at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to ascertain from the Minister when it is intended to bring this Bill into operation.  As we have already said, a great many people have received no increase in their weekly payments since 1955. While everyone else has got increases in wages, workmen paid workmen's compensation on the basis laid down in <Col N="1105" /> 1955 have received no increase, and I am quite certain this Bill cannot be brought into operation too soon for those people so that they will get the fairly valuable increases which are provided for them under section 24.  I hope that the Minister, not withstanding his fears when he replied to me this evening that he had no money in the Fund, will be able to find some way of anticipating the inflow of revenue and give these unfortunate workers the increase which everyone must agree they should long since have got.</P>

      <P>As I welcomed the introduction of this Bill to the House, so I should also like to welcome its passing in the form in which it is being passed.  As it was introduced to the House I expressed one reservation, and I am glad to say at this stage that I no longer have cause to express that reservation because the Minister has introduced an amendment which allows a right of appeal to the courts to determine whether or not the injury has arisen out of or in the course of the employment.  In common with Senator O'Quigley, one of the reasons that I welcomed this on the Second Stage was that I felt it was more appropriate that a proper tribunal, which could act independently, would decide, by way of appeal rather than that public representatives would have the increased burden of making representations to the Department and, accordingly, that the Department would also have the increased burden of dealing with those representations.  The more regulations of this kind we introduce in our legislation the more we will leave the public representatives free to do the work which they are primarily selected to do.</P>
      <P>We welcome, first of all, extending the scope of the existing, if I might call it so, workmen's compensation to include the type of worker who was never included.  Secondly, we welcome the increased amounts which will be payable to such workers.  We must all agree that those are highly desirable and very welcome measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the debate <Col N="1106" /> on this Bill as it passed through the House many amendments were moved from all sides of the House. Some of them were moved by the Fine Gael Party and some by the Labour Party.  Many views were expressed on the propriety of various sections in the Bill.  This is in accordance with the spirit which has characterised debate in the House since I came here.  Members from this side of the House, from the very earliest stages, particularly Senator Eóin Ryan and myself have indicated to the Minister that we were very apprehensive about the system of appeals that the Bill, as introduced, contained.</P>
    <P>We expressed our strongest reservations. Indeed, I said specifically on the Second Stage that this was the matter in this Bill which gave me the most cause for anxiety.  I could not have spelled the matter out more effectively. I repeated those reservations on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  Although Senator Eóin Ryan was not here on that occasion, due to illness, I know that the reservations which I repeated were also the ones he still retained. For that reason I find it regrettable that the Fine Gael Party have claimed in a statement which they published that the amendment to this Bill which allows for an appeal, as they said in their statement, to the circuit court, quite incorrectly, was introduced due to the pressure from the Fine Gael Party.  That is completely untrue.</P>
    <P>First of all, in fairness to Senator Miss Davidson, I should say at all Stages of this Bill, that she has indicated anxiety on her own behalf and on behalf of the Labour Party to have an appeals tribunal allowed in this Bill.  Senator Eóin Ryan and myself have not been silent with regard to this matter.  In fact, I can assure the House that before any amendment was put down we used all the powers of persuasion that are open to us to request the Minister to introduce the amendment that has been introduced.  For that reason, it is a grave breach of the independence of the House.  I am very happy to speak with the Members of any side of this House on any subject or any amendment <Col N="1107" /> but if in doing so I am included as a member of the Fine Gael Party who has pressurised the Minister, I consider this is a matter which requires some explanation and more likely an apology.  If that kind of statement can be published incorrectly as to the pressure which was exercised on the Minister&mdash;I do not accept that any pressure was exercised on the Minister&mdash;with regard to appeals to the circuit court, then in the interests of reasoned and objective debate in this House we certainly require some explanation from the Fine Gael Party who have claimed to have done so much in this Bill by exercising pressure on the Minister.</P>

Apparently, his belief was that having first of all established me as a transgressor in this regard, that is as a non-conformist with Senator FitzGerald's standard of behaviour, it would then be easier for him to demolish the Bill. Apparently it is a crime for me to reply in Irish to a question addressed to me in Irish.  Senator FitzGerald does not like it.  I did not have to wait until I came here yesterday to learn Senator FitzGerald's feelings with regard to the Irish language.  I am well aware of them but Senator FitzGerald assumes tacitly that because he does not like the Irish language, therefore it must be universally accepted that it is wrong to use it.</P>

      <P>I defer to your ruling and I shall deal with the Minister's untruths some other time. This is a Bill on which from the outset I expressed fears.  Bringing the workmen's compensation code into the social welfare code did not seem to me to be the most appropriate way of dealing with the matter.  The fears I had have been reinforced throughout the debate by the rigidity of the Minister on so many matters and his contention that the maximum <Col N="1109" /> amount of power should be given to him concerning legislation by regulation with regard to the life and interests of injured workmen&mdash;a power of a kind which in many cases went far beyond the reasonable requirements of any such legislation.  It is unfortunate that if this Bill had to be brought within the social welfare code it was done before that code was reformed or made more reasonable in these respects.</P>
      <P>Also unfortunate is the fact that the Minister should have, no doubt through inadvertence, possibly excusable, misinterpreted the Minority and the Majority Reports of the Commission. Some good things have come out of the debate.  We have had the Minister indicating that he is interested in the idea of wage related benefits and while he insisted on eliminating the wage relationship principle in existing legislation, he indicated that he is willing to reintroduce it if and when some general reform of social welfare legislation takes place.  He also indicated his willingness to consider the extension of certain aspects of the social welfare code, including workmen's compensation, to self-employed people.</P>
      <P>We have had the question of the appeal.  As to what Senator O'Kennedy has said, I respect his views and if he expresses concern about something that has been said I know his concern is likely to be reasonably founded.  The credit for achieving this change can certainly not be claimed solely by Fine Gael and I am not aware of any statement seeking to claim that sole credit.  If that interpretation was put on any statement it was certainly not the intention.</P>

    <P>A statement issued by the Senator's <Col N="1110" /> Party was published in a national newspaper last week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement, in so far as it does not mention the pressure from the Government Front Bench, is a cause for the Senator's concern and I accept it. Unless we had support from the Government Front Bench it is unlikely that a Minister as rigid and inflexible as the Minister for Social Welfare would have given ground in any area of this legislation.  I must point out, however, that we helped, particularly when we drew the attention of the Minister to the fact that he had totally misrepresented the Minority Report, going so far as to fail to read the statement set out in capital letters.  I doubt, however, if our efforts would have made him give in, without pressure from his own front bench.  This House has in the past worked together for a good cause and I regret it if any statement made did not give credit to the Government Front Bench in this matter as in other Bills which they have helped to improve when the other House had failed.</P>
      <P>Our joint efforts here have not yielded the important results we should all like to have seen.  I accept some blame because it may be that in attacking so vigorously the concept of the Bill and its presentation, we may have stiffened the Minister's back. Possibly a more diplomatic approach might have achieved more.  In attacking it the way I did, I was consciously doing so because I thought it important to draw to the attention of this House and of wider circles to the fact that in the period since this Government came into office, while progress has been made in many spheres and while members of the Government have contributed to that progress, we have not made the progress we should have in the social welfare sphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Department and the Ministers responsible for that Department have not pulled their weight fully and I thought it proper that, even at the expense of alienating the Minister slightly, the attention of the House and the country should be drawn to these deficiencies.  I pointed out the <Col N="1111" /> little regard this Bill and the Department responsible for it have to the desirability of harmonising our social welfare code with European standards instead of concentrating their efforts on following in the footsteps of Britain. If I said this harshly I thought that, while it might lead to some rigidity, the criticisms might also lead in the future to a more alert, progressive attitude on the part of the Minister and the Department.  I, therefore, deliberately took a course of action which led to fewer of our amendments being accepted but which, I hope, will lead to a better Department of Social Welfare and a more intelligent approach to social welfare in the future.</P>
    <P>That has been my approach to this Bill.  Perhaps I was wrong.  I am sorry we have not secured more progress. Perhaps some of the amendments turned out to be misguided but some of them were very well founded and I regret they have not been accepted by the Minister.  However, this is not the last Bill dealing with workmen's compensation we shall see in this House and certainly some of the bureaucratic elements of this Bill and of our social welfare legislation generally, if not removed in the lifetime of the present Government, long or short that may be, will be removed by another Government which will be concerned with the improvement of the code and the elimination of bureaucratic rigidity, which will make the legislation more acceptable to our people and more in line with their traditions.</P>

      <P>An uncommitted person who read the Bill and then listened to the Fine Gael speeches in this House would wonder if Fine Gael were discussing the Bill we have before us.  It is very difficult to find any real basis for the vast majority of the attacks made on this Bill.  I think the main cause for these Fine Gael attacks is that they have not really been able to grasp the basic change that is now taking place. The main point about the Bill is that from now every worker will be entitled as an automatic right to compensation for injury suffered arising from his work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>No longer shall we have the position that an injury suffered at work inevitably involves a dispute with the employer.  The employer is now out of it.  He no longer has any interest in whether the worker does not get compensation at all or whether it is kept as low as possible.  That is a very important step forward.  No longer will the worker have to take his rights to court or threaten to do so.  No longer will barristers and solicitors be hired especially and specifically for the purpose of seeing if possible that the worker does not get his compensation or that the compensation is as low as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These highly undesirable factors which have existed until now under the workmen's compensation system are all going.  We have had many complaints about these being taken away from the courts.  Fine Gael have not yet realised the basic proposition that the courts are there to deal with litigation on disputes between citizens, that is, the civil courts.  This is not a matter now involving disputes.  The worker who is injured while at work is entitled to compensation, and no longer are the insurance companies there to try to see that his claim is kept as low as possible.  There is no <Col N="1113" /> longer any element of fault involved with regard to a dispute with employers. That is the main change that has taken place now, and to my mind the most important single advance made by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another important advance related to the same factor is that this matter has been taken away from the insurance companies.  It is quite clear that over the years the worker did not get good value from the old system where the majority of employers were insured by private insurance companies.  Senator FitzGerald said that all insurance companies come under suspicion.  I am not going as far as that, but I do think they were inefficient.  We had the position, though the exact amount is slightly in dispute, that not more than 9/3d out of every £ of insurance premiums paid actually reached the worker in claims paid.  The Minister says, and experience suggests that in this he will be right, that from now on approximately 18/- in each £ of premiums will reach the worker by way of claims paid.</P>
    <P>Apart from this basic misunderstanding which I think Fine Gael have with regard to the purpose of the Bill and the basis of it, and particularly the reason for no longer needing to have these matters settled by the courts, they come into this House, Senator FitzGerald in particular, with theoretical notions of what should have been in the Bill.  For example, we had many complaints on this question of flat rates of injury benefit.  Senator FitzGerald told us that these should be related to wages, and that the higher wage earner should get a higher rate of benefit than the people on a lower income level.  The view of the Government in this Bill, and it is a view, I think, that any reasonable person will support, is that the important thing is that the amount of wages earned depend not on the need of the worker.  I find it almost impossible to understand how anyone can seriously support the proposition that a man with perhaps a wife and six children should be on the same level of benefit as a single man living at home with his parents.  I find it impossible to see how that can be supported, yet that is the dismal proposition that Senator <Col N="1114" /> FitzGerald and other Fine Gael Senators have been supporting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, with reservations. He wrote an addendum.  I do not want to misquote anyone, but I have read the addendum several times with great care and as far as I can understand it all it does is to explain in greater detail why he agrees with the Majority Report.  It does nothing, and advances nothing, which is not already in the Majority Report.  It merely says why and how Senator FitzGerald was able to resolve some doubts and bring himself to sign the Majority Report. There is nothing in it to suggest that at any time he was in favour of allowances to dependants.  If it is a case of deciding between varying rates according to wages and allowances for dependants, I am in no doubt whatever as to which is the correct thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald talked at some length about people with £18 and £20 a week working in manufacturing industry. I do not know why he should be so concerned about them in the first instance, since only about 24 per cent of the insured workers work in manufacturing industries and only a minority of them would be on that level.  I am more interested, and so is the Government, in the lower paid workers, for example, a county council road worker with perhaps £9 a week, with a wife and perhaps a couple of children or a larger family. Under this Bill he will get his full wage while he is injured.  The proposition put forward by Senator FitzGerald amongst others in this Majority Report was that that man would get 60 per cent of £9.  He might have a wife and six children but no matter how long he was injured all he would ever get would be <Col N="1115" /> £5 8s.  That is not good enough.  We are not backward and reactionary people advocating that kind of thing. The lower paid worker should get wherever possible, and certainly with family commitments, his full wage while he is unable to work.  One cannot say why one side is right and the other wrong, but we happen to believe in that proposition on this side and I believe that we are right.  If anybody is being backward in a matter of that kind it is not we who are supporting this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald also&mdash;I am sorry that he is not here in the House, for I seem to be saying so much about him&mdash;was at pains&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>He told us on many occasions about the number of countries which do this, that and the other.  The Minister should apparently have counted heads and followed the majority.  On this question of dependants' allowances he did not mention that there are only 11 countries that have these and 64 which have not.  I do not care how many countries have not.  We are dealing with Irish conditions and the Minister brings in a Bill which he thinks will suit our conditions here.  What happens in Peru or Bolivia or Czechoslovakia we do not mind.  It is Ireland we are concerned with.  These dependants' allowances were rejected by the Majority Report and I think that the Minister is right in bringing them in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Disablement benefit, the additional benefit for those who have lost a faculty, is an important advance also Here, again the Minister rightly rejected the advice of the Majority Report of the Commission.  Then, I think, there is a very big advance the unemployability supplement the extra amount given to a man unable to work for a very long period.  That is a great advance also, and it is a <Col N="1116" /> thing which is not recommended and which is not dealt with even, as far as I know, by the majority.  There are many other things&mdash;easier conditions for benefits, liberalising very considerably the provisions under which a man can come under this Bill.  There were a number of cases that we had at various times in the courts that a man was not entitled to workmen's compensation, and a number of these are being reversed in this Bill and brought into the scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to providing medical care, the Bill also marks a considerable advance.  This is an interesting example also of extending the service and being accused of being backward and reactionary compared with the majority.  It is perhaps worth considering what was said by the Majority Report and by Senator FitzGerald.  He and the majority said in relation to the private practitioners that they advocated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr Yeats Mr Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I will just say that no doubt some of the provisions in this Bill for medical care were recommended by the Majority Report, but it was to be paid for by the worker by another 2d a week on the worker's stamp.  That is what is called progressive. I think it is backward.  Other good features in the Bill are constant attendance allowances, which is a new thing for workers unable to look after themselves, and that grants may be made for rehabilitation services, and a thing which I mentioned on the Second Reading as a considerable advance, though I agree that on this matter there might be differences of opinion&mdash;the ending of lump sums.  In every single respect this Bill is an enormous advance on anything we had previously in this country not merely from the point of view of the benefits given, the provision for medical attention and all these things but also from the point of view that in the <Col N="1117" /> Bill these things are completely taken away from litigation and controversy of that kind.  The worker now knows he is entitled to benefit if he is injured in his work and has no longer any connection with litigation in the courts which, I think, is a very good thing.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister.  He was considerably attacked in this debate.  The Minister for Social Welfare has done a great deal during his period of office to improve the social welfare code in this country.  This Bill will go down as a monument to the work he has done in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to some of the speakers in this debate, one would imagine that the State was contributing towards these benefits.  In fact, they are making no contribution whatsoever towards the benefits which will be available to injured workmen under this Bill.  The arrangement is that the extra cost of paying compensation to the injured workmen will be paid on the employers' social welfare cards and the employers will be required to contribute approximately £3 million per year towards the running of this scheme, depending on the number of persons in employment at any particular time and relating to the ceiling so far as eligibility for payment of benefit is concerned.  It is the employers who will be required to pay the cost of this scheme.  There is no point in the Government claiming credit for giving these extra benefits to the injured workmen.  It is the employers who will pay for it, and pay heavily.  While the State is imposing this burden on the employers and taking this away from the discretion of the employers, they are leaving the burden of common law liability on the shoulders of the employers as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the employees are concerned in this Bill, they will be deprived of the right to obtain lump sum compensation resulting from injuries where a permanent or partial disability results from those injuries, whereas, previously, an injured man was able to go to court, prove that he had a disability resulting from the accident and was paid a lump sum in the form of compensation.  This Bill <Col N="1118" /> will not pay any lump sum whatsoever to the injured workman.  Whatever the benefits payable to the injured man and whatever the scale of benefits to which he may be entitled, they will be financed by the employers.</P>
    <P>In addition to paying this £3 million a year extra&mdash;and indeed it might be more according to experience when it is found exactly the number of weeks an injured man will be out of work&mdash;if the number of weeks away from work increases compared with the number of weeks at the present time, of course, this scheme will become more expensive.  At the present time&mdash;and I do not approve of it &mdash;the weekly compensation to an injured man is much less than his weekly wages.  Consequently, when he receives an injury his one desire is to recover as quickly as possible in order to earn his full week's wages again. In this case, an injured man can obtain weekly compensation equal to, or almost equal to, his weekly wages, at the lowest level, of course, not the highest.  But, naturally, if he is receiving weekly compensation equal to, or almost equal to, the amount he receives for working hard all the week, he will not be so anxious to get well quickly and get back to work.  In that case, there is no doubt that the cost of paying workmen's compensation will increase; it is bound to increase.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, while this imposition on the employers is being provided in this Bill, no attempt has been made to relieve the employer of his common law liability.  This means, of course, that, in addition to paying a substantial weekly contribution in respect of each employee, he will be required to insure himself and cover his liability at common law.  It is most important that he should be covered on this side of his liability because, in the weekly compensation section at least, there was some kind of foreseeable limit to the amount of compensation which would be payable but, in the common law section the amount for which the employer would be liable would depend on the degree of disability and the decision of the courts.  Therefore, in addition to imposing an extra cost on the <Col N="1119" /> employers social welfare stamp, employers will still be required, in their own interest, to cover themselves against the liabilities which are not provided for under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I heard a point made here that it will cost only 2/- in the pound to administer this scheme.  I am amazed at that figure and I shall be interested to see if, in fact, the percentage cost will be so low in relation to the weekly benefit paid, taking into consideration that it would involve a considerable amount of work, first of all, in the Department of Social Welfare and the extensive network of Department officials which must be spread throughout the length and breadth of this country, in every town and parish in order to administer this scheme.  With all their wages and salaries added up, I shall be amazed if it is found that, in fact, it will cost only 2/- in the pound to administer this new scheme, even though it is at the expense of the employers.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill is certainly a great improvement on the system of compensation which operated up to the present.  Although it widens the scope of social administration, it tends towards bureaucracy, cuts out the human factor and imposes impersonal hardships on people who cannot fight back, it is an improvement, so far as the payment of weekly compensation is concerned.  But, in all fairness, the Government should not take credit for whatever increased benefits become available now because the employers will be compelled to contribute every penny of the benefits, and more, towards the cost of operating this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Longford):</i> I realise one must confine oneself to the Bill as it now stands and I propose to do that by saying that it is not as good as it is said to be or not as bad as it is said to be, depending on one's viewpoint.  What I am concerned with at this stage is the difficulty that will arise in getting a knowledge of the terms of this measure down to the people concerned, to the employers and to workers, particularly, who will benefit under it.  I am wondering what <Col N="1120" /> could be done to improve the method of dissemination of information in that regard by the Department of Social Welfare.  It has been indicated by other speakers that there have been some changes in this question of compensation. By and large, it is for the better but, like all changes, it has some good points and some bad ones.  I am inclined to agree with someone who says that the last measure of this sort will have to be dealt with lá eile.  Beidh lá eile.  The usual practice on the part of injured workmen is to go to the local solicitor who brings in counsel and legislation or threatened legislation will ensue.</P>
      <P>That was the pattern and that is why the lawyers and people associated with the law took an abnormally keen interest in this matter.  I wonder if that is not to be the pattern in future. What the Department of Social Welfare could do is to set up a service, particularly in rural areas, but which I suppose could also be set up in cities. I am speaking of the difficulties that can arise in rural areas.  It has been the pattern of local solicitors to get counsel's opinion on all that sort of thing.  I am wondering could some sort of service be set up by the Department, not necessarily consisting of officers of the Department as such but liaison officers acting for the public whose loyalty would be to the individual person rather than to the Department. I wonder how far something like that could be set up, together with the publication of a fairly simple and comprehensive document explaining this complicated measure to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A document such as this would have the good effect that it would perhaps, together with some liaison officers, prevent the practice of people, who feel they have that right, from going to public representatives, and that continuous to and fro that has been referred to by the Leader of the Opposition here between Ministers and public representatives.  That is not a good thing in public life and it is not good in legislation.  Perhaps it would be possible to have men with legal training, not so much acting officers of the Department of Social Welfare, and even if they were officials of the <Col N="1121" /> Department of Social Welfare their terms of appointment should be such that their loyalty would be to the individual person rather than to the Department.  Their function would be to give advice and that would be so scattered that they would be able to give service in regard to the operation of this as well as other Social Welfare regulations.</P>
    <P>Social welfare is a complex matter and only a person with legal training would dare to start going deeply into it. I think the day is coming when it will be necessary to set up such advisory or liaison officers to act for the public in the administration of legislation of this sort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pleasure for me to have this legislation, which makes radical and revolutionary improvements in our methods of dealing with employment injury, at last through this House.  The Bill has been the subject of prolonged debate with numerous amendments moved in both Houses and, as a result, almost a year has already elapsed since it was first introduced in Dáil Éireann, on the 8th July, 1965.  It was rather ironic to hear Senator O'Quigley ascribe this delay to my dilatoriness in view of the postponements in the Dáil to facilitate the Opposition and the protracted debates in both Houses.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that an important Bill of this nature must receive adequate examination but, at the same time, in view of the fact that the commencement of the scheme and the payment of the vastly improved benefits to injured workmen and their dependants must await the conclusion of such examination, I think it is a pity that this examination was, as it appeared to me at any rate, somewhat unnecessarily prolonged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be immediately obvious from a comparison of the Bill with the recommendations of the Majority of the Commission, which would cost roughly the same amount, that from the point of view of the workmen the proposals in this Bill are immensely superior to anything that could conceivably be provided <Col N="1122" /> under a continuation of the present system.</P>
    <P>Having heard the debate in both Houses then, I can repeat with even greater conviction, what I said on Second Reading, that this Bill represents a major advance in our social services and that it places us, for the first time, in the forefront of those countries which have highly developed systems of insurance against occupational injury or disease.  In so far as this important aspect of social security is concerned, we can feel proud that our system can stand comparison with that in any other country.</P>
    <P>I know there are people who prefer to continue in the belief that social welfare generally here is substandard but this is becoming less and less true every year.  This major development, combined with the introduction in 1960 of the contributory old age pension, the continuous gain in the case of all other services over the cost-of-living and the many extensions of, and improvements in, these schemes in recent years &mdash; all these things have resulted in a very different position in regard to social welfare to that which existed when the present Government took over from the Coalition in 1957.  That is not to say we have reached the end of improvements in social welfare.  Senators will see many further improvements brought in by this Government but we have been improving our position continuously since 1957 even in difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>I must say it seems to me that during the debate some Opposition members, while they were not prepared to go on record as voting against the Bill, were mainly concerned, by prolonged and exaggerated criticism of minor details, with trying to create the impression that this Bill would bring about a position not as favourable to the workman as would be provided in a modification retaining the fundamentals of the present system and that it would bring about a position greatly inferior to that obtaining elsewhere, particularly in Britain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> This contention will not stand up to examination.  We will, when this measure comes into operation, be considerably in advance of a great many countries which would be looked upon as better developed economically than us and our scheme will compare not unfavourably with the British ones.  I mentioned during the Committee Stage that in October, 1965, the average earnings of Irish male industrial workers was 70 per cent of those in Britain.  Taking the British standard rate of injury benefit as base, and having regard to the earnings ratio of 70 per cent, the appropriate rate of injury benefit for this country would be 94/6, whereas we have provided 115/-.  It cannot be denied then, that the provision we are making in this Bill is reasonable, taking account of all our circumstances.</P>
    <P>There are, in fact, a number of instances in which this Bill is more favourable to the workman than the British Act, although every effort was made to make it appear that the contrary was true.  It is obvious that Senators were quite familiar with provisions of the British Act.  One thing that was not adverted to is that here there are no contributions paid by the workmen whereas 5/12ths of the cost of the British scheme is met by workmen's contributions.</P>
    <P>In the case of the smaller percentage disablements we provided by way of amendment in the Dáil an option of disablement pension for the full duration of disablement in lieu of the disablement gratuity which, as we have discussed at great length here, would be equivalent to seven years' pension at most.  We made special provision in this Bill for accidents to apprentices attending technical courses.  The rate of benefit for workers between the ages of 16 and 17 under this Bill is 77/6d as against 67/6d in Britain.</P>
    <P>In regard to the increases given for child dependants and the different rates of benefit provided here, the general age limit is 16 as against the school leaving age which is 15 in Britain.  Exceptions are possible in both schemes. In Britain an invalid child is covered up to the age of 16 as against the age <Col N="1124" /> of 18 in this Bill.  In regard to death benefits the provisions here in general are better than in Britain.</P>
    <P>In regard to widows the rate of benefit is 95/- here for the full period of widowhood and irrespective of the age or physical capacity of the widow.  In Britain after 13 weeks the rate of benefit falls to 90/- and if the widow is young and capable of working it can fall to as low as 20/-.  Similarly in regard to widowers who were dependent on their wives because of physical incapacity, there is provision here for a benefit rate of 95/- as against 90/- in Britain.</P>
    <P>In regard to provision for parents, we provide for the dependant parents of an unmarried working man a pension of 95/- for one such parent and if there are two parents an additional pension for the second parent of 24/-, making a maximum for two dependant parents of an unmarried worker of 119/-.  Against that the British scheme provides 20/- per week pension for one such dependant parent, and if there are two dependant parents of a deceased workman a pension of 15/- per week for each of the two.  In other words, a maximum of 30/- per week is provided. That is in respect of the parents of an unmarried workman.</P>
    <P>In respect of the dependant parents of a married workman where there is also a widow's pension payable, we provide, in addition to the widow's pension, a pension of 24/- each for both parents as against 30/- for the two, or 15/- each, in the British scheme.  In regard to orphans, the provisions here are considerably better.   We provide 47/6d pension for every orphan as against in Britain 22/6d for the first child and 14/6d for the others, with 20/- paid to a woman looking after the children.  In regard to the funeral grant the provision in this Bill is for £50 and in Britain it is £25.</P>
    <P>In addition, our Bill provides for medical care over and above what is provided under the Health Acts.  That is not provided in the British Acts.  Of course, it would be provided to some extent at least under the British National Health Service.</P>
    <P>Despite the Opposition's song and <Col N="1125" /> dance, the disparity in favour of this Bill in the benefits provided under the Bill and those recommended in the Majority Report is so great and so obvious that it hardly seems necessary to mention them.  However, I think that in concluding this fairly protracted debate I should give one or two examples. Take, for instance, a married man with two children who suffers 100 per cent disablement and is unable to resume work, he will receive by way of disablement benefit, plus disability benefit, or unemployability supplement, 233/6d with increases of 8/- for each other child as against a maximum of 140/-, irrespective of the number of children, under the scheme that was recommended to me by Senator FitzGerald.</P>

This special attendance may be given free by a member of the family.  This is against the 170/- under Senator FitzGerald's scheme, and this only for regular paid attendance with a possible further 30/- in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>The widow's pension provisions are also more favourable as they provide increases in respect of children and the benefit to dependent parents of deceased workmen is greatly superior to Senator FitzGerald's proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that aspect of the matter also.  In the case of a dependant parent of an unmarried worker the position under the <Col N="1126" /> Bill is that if there are two parents one gets a pension of 95/- per week and the other 24/- per week, as I have already stated, as against the recommendation in the Majority Report which was signed by Senator FitzGerald of a lump sum of £500 for each.</P>
      <P>In the case of a married workman under the Bill each dependant parent will get a pension of 24/- a week as against the £50 lump sum recommended in the Majority Report.  The provision for orphans, as I have already said when comparing the Bill with the British scheme, is that there is a pension of 47/6 for each orphan as against the recommendation in the Majority Report of 35/- each with a maximum of three.  Those are just some examples of the advantages in the scheme which is now passing through the House as compared with the scheme recommended to me by the majority of the Commission.</P>
      <P>It has been quite clear both here and in the Dáil that the Fine Gael Party have been trying to have it both ways in regard to this Bill.  In both Houses they argued vehemently against the fundamental principles of the Bill, but they refrained from voting against it on Second Stage, while on Committee Stage every effort was made to frustrate the intention in the Bill to make as much as possible of the contribution income available in the form of benefits to injured workmen, and to make the proposal as a whole appear as unfavourable as possible. I do not think Senator FitzGerald will disagree with me when I say that his Second Reading speech was in violent opposition to the Bill.  Later his colleague, Senator O'Quigley, disowned this approach and made the astonishing announcement, in view of Senator FitzGerald's attack, that they would not oppose the Bill on Second Stage.</P>

      <P>I can understand the reluctance to have the attitude that was adopted both here and in the Dáil referred to.  Surely I am entitled to refer to the fact that we have had the main attack directed at the proposals in the Bill to administer this scheme.  It is obvious both here and in the Dáil, particularly on the Committee Stage, that the attitude was to seize on small points in the necessary scheme to administer the Bill and by the most outlandish exaggerations and the assumption of extremely improbable and fanciful cases as the normal ones every effort was made to misrepresent the whole tenor of the Bill, which is to make this occupational injuries' compensation a scheme in the sole interests of the workman.  There is one thing to which, I think, I am entitled to refer.  Their reckless and absurd allegations, such as the protracted attempt to create the impression that people would be required to undergo major surgery and endanger their lives in order to save <Col N="1128" /> money and the silly attempt to equate this Bill to the Poor Law system, could only have been in order to cover up for the fact that they had not the moral courage or the unity of purpose to oppose the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>This Bill is one which provides, because of the administrative arrangements that are made, and because of the fact that there is no element of profit associated with it, that the greatest possible amount of premium income is returned in the form of benefits to injured workmen. In view of that fact which I would think everybody would look on as desirable, it seems very difficult to me to understand why there should be such a tenacious attempt to hold on to a system which is weighted so heavily against the best interests of the workman, a scheme in which only 9/3d out of every £1 of premium income is returned in the form of benefits to injured workmen.</P>
      <P>I think that practically every arrangement for the administration of the scheme which was made in this Bill was the subject of long and prolonged attack here.  Those administrative measures which are contained in this Bill, and are necessarily contained in it, are in effect, the same as those now operating quite satisfactorily in relation to other social welfare services. They are, as I believe all Senators realise, the minimum required to get the scheme launched successfully.  The operation of the scheme will, like all other services, be subject to continual review and any difficulties which cannot be foreseen at this stage&mdash;I certainly would not attempt to forecast that such difficulties may not arise&mdash;will, of course, be corrected in the light of experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides benefit rates which are the maximum that could be provided by the rate of contribution that has been fixed.  We had a number of amendments which would have increased those benefit rates but without <Col N="1129" /> any indication as to where the money for those increases was to come from. As I pointed out, while we would all like to see even better benefit rates than those which it has been possible to provide in this Bill, this type of approach of asking for greater benefits without taking any steps to provide greater income is hardly realistic.</P>

      <P>I have, in fact, increased them to take account of increases in the cost of living since the Commission reported to me four years ago.  During the debates there have been numerous references to the recommendations of the Commission on Workmen's Compensation from both sides of the House both on this Stage and on other Stages.  Although I have not accepted the recommendations of the Majority of the Commission and although I have not completely accepted the recommendations of the Minority the tribute which I paid to the members of the Commission and the opinion I expressed as to the value of their work was sincerely intended.  I have, in fact, endeavoured, within the context of the main principles of the <Col N="1130" /> scheme to follow their recommendations as far as possible.</P>
      <P>I must say, however, that when dealing with a matter on which I accepted the recommendation of both the Majority and the Minority of the Commission&mdash;that is in the reckoning of earnings at the time of accident but excluding overtime and short-time&mdash;is was rather disconcerting to find that a member of the Commission who signed the Majority Report was opposing this unanimous recommendation.  When Senator O'Quigley demanded to know where this amazing proposal as he described it, to exclude overtime and short-time had come from, I pointed out to him that his colleague, Senator FitzGerald had, in fact, recommended it to me.  Senator FitzGerald's reaction to this was to say that this matter must have arisen before he became a member of the Commission, which was in January, 1959.  When this refusal to accept responsibility for anything in the Majority Report, which he signed but which was discussed prior to 1959, is taken in conjunction with the fact that Senator FitzGerald asks me to accept that a report submitted to me in 1962 should be treated as having been submitted in 1960, his attitude to the formal act of appending his signature to the Report of such an important Commission becomes, to say the least of it, more and more peculiar.</P>

      <P>Reference has several times been made to the point I am discussing&mdash;the provision in the Bill which was the subject of prolonged attack by Senator FitzGerald who signed a Report recommending this provision on the question of earnings at the time of the accident but excluding overtime and short-time. This was debated at length earlier and was referred to again on this Stage.  Surely you will agree this provision is, in fact, in the Bill.  In dealing with this new limitation as to what was recommended by Senator FitzGerald and what was not, there is of course no indication in the <Col N="1131" /> Report of the chronological order of decisions taken or recommendations made.  The Commission sat from 1955 until 1962 and this disclaiming of responsibility for anything that happened prior to 1959 or after 1960 appears to place Senator FitzGerald in the position of accepting responsibility only for, at most, an unspecified one-third of the Report which he signed.  This leaves him in a position to disclaim responsibility for everything which appears over his signature. I think this is the limit in irresponsibility.</P>
      <P>We have had a lot of discussion as to international practice in regard to this matter of occupational injury and we were told that we are out of step with the EEC countries and that it would be difficult to harmonise our system with theirs as we would be required to do immediately on joining. The fact is, of course, that the EEC countries have not yet harmonised their own social welfare systems.  This question of harmonisation is still an unachieved objective and there is, in fact, nothing there at present with which we could conceivably be required to harmonise our system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot know what standard, if any, may eventually be decided on but one thing is certain: it will not be the system which was recommended to me by Senator FitzGerald and which was defended so tenaciously here.  In fact, the basis of all EEC countries' employment injury schemes, with the exception of one, is some form of social insurance and not individual employer's liability, to which Senator FitzGerald committed himself so definitely.  It is on this foundation of social insurance, which is introduced here for the first time by this Bill, that we shall find it easier to accommodate ourselves to EEC membership.  I and the Labour Party have been criticised for making comparisons with our nearest neighbouring country instead of with what <Col N="1132" /> was described without any substantiation as the far superior systems in the EEC.</P>
      <P>It is a fact, however, that the British Government have found it necessary to assure an apprehensive public there that when this question of harmonising arises there will, on no account, be a scaling down of their provisions to the lower standards of any other country.  As I have said earlier, we have had regard to most modern concepts of international practice in devising this scheme and, particularly, to the recent International Labour Organisation Convention in this field.  By meeting the standards laid down by that Convention we have put ourselves into the most progressive category in this respect.  If the scheme differs from those in certain countries abroad, it is perhaps because these other countries have not yet reached the stage at which an integrated social insurance provision for employment injury is possible.</P>
      <P>As I said before, I am happy to have this Bill reach this Stage.  When it is finally enacted I shall have to make arrangements for the making of the many regulations and procedures required to bring it into effect so that it will be available to injured workers and their dependants as soon as possible. I cannot forecast what that date will be but it will be as soon as feasible. New reciprocal arrangements with Britain and Northern Ireland are contemplated as part of this operation. When the new scheme is functioning and we have some experience of the benefit claims arising, I shall consider how I can best discharge my other functions under the Bill in relation to employment injury.  I am referring here to such things as the prevention of employment accidents and rehabilitation of injured workmen, two things in respect of which the Minister has been given powers in the Bill but in respect of which no definite decisions have been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, I am satisfied, marks a further important step in the development of social welfare, every step of which development, including this, has been under a Fianna Fáil Government and I am happy to have been <Col N="1133" /> associated with this particular development, a major one which does much to improve our standing in regard to social welfare generally.  The fact that it does that, I can understand, is not very palatable to the Opposition.</P>

      <P>This amendment is put down following our discussion last week when it was represented to me that the provisions of the Bill would operate to affect in particular the Community Development Movement adversely, and I undertook to have discussions with representatives of both the Community Development Movement and the Credit Union League with regard to the proposals of Senator FitzGerald.  I am glad to say that on Monday last we achieved complete agreement whereby the 12 existing units of this particular movement and the five which it is proposed to register before 31st August next will be exempted for the purposes of the Bill. The amendment as I have put it down covers these 12 existing and five proposed branches of the Community Development Movement's activities and are acceptable to the representatives both of the movement and of the Credit Union League.

On the last day he said that he would come back here in a week's time and in the meantime see both sides and draft any necessary amendment.  I was not at all sure that he realised what he was taking on, but I can assure him that the House is grateful for what he has done in being able to come back having approached both sides and satisfied the Community Development Movement on terms satisfactory to the other group.  Great credit is due to him for the speed that he has shown and for the fact that he was willing to take action on the rather belated representations in this matter, which left him in a rather unfair position when the Bill was going through the Dáil before he had a chance to clear matters with this particular group.  That he should have been so willing to meet them and that he has done so and reached an agreement is something on which he is to be congratulated.</P>

      <P>I am not sufficiently familiar with the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, but it did strike me that in later sections there is reference to an appeal to the district court.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary indicate where in the Principal Act referred to, which applies to credit unions, there is provision for these societies suing and being sued in their name?  It does not seem to me from reading the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893, that they have power to hold property unless perhaps it is given to them by the rules.  After that it seems to me that that is the only power they have resembling the powers one normally vests in a corporate body.  They are unincorporated. I wonder whether as these societies are going to proliferate, as we hope, we should not give them more of the attributes of a corporate body which one would expect to find in this legislation.  It may be that this is contained in the 1893 Act.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment which one of these unions interested in this suggested to me ought to be done.  It seems to me that where a person ceases to have a common bond of either location or employment and so on he can retain his rights in the union, continue to be a member, but under this section is not given power to retain his voting rights.  It struck me as somewhat odd that that was so.  I suggest that at the end of subsection (2) we should add that he should be entitled to retain his voting rights in addition to his shares and deposits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position here is that we originally provided that the person who loses the common bond continues to be a member but ceases to have rights of voting.  In discussion in <Col N="1136" /> the Dáil it was put to me that this was rather unfair, and that the person should retain his full rights, that once having had a common bond the fact of having lost it should not deprive him of the rights of membership.  I acceded to that in the Dáil, and the section as drafted does cover that.</P>
      <P>I would draw Senator O'Quigley's attention to the provisions of section 20, which provides that at an annual general meeting of a credit union each member shall have only one vote on each question irrespective of his share-holding in the credit union.  The next subsection mentions that he may not vote by proxy.  What this means is that under section 4 his membership is preserved, and his voting privileges are <i>ipso facto</i> preserved by virtue of section 20, so that I do not think it is necessary to add into section 4 the extra words suggested by Senator O'Quigley.  I think that the combination of sections 20 and 4 makes it quite clear that a person in the position mentioned has, in fact, got his voting rights.  They are preserved by the mere fact of membership being preserved, and I would suggest that this amendment be withdrawn.  On the other hand, I am quite easy on this, and if the House feels that it would make it clear or be of any help to add these extra words for clarification or otherwise, then I can do that.  I would be agreeable to delete the word &ldquo;membership&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;membership and voting rights&rdquo; but I suggest that this is not, in fact, necessary.</P>

One begins to wonder what is the necessity at all for the whole of section 4.  Either you are a member or you are not.

    <P>These amendments were discussed in the Dáil and the Minister did not accept them.  The Parliamentary Secretary has already said he will not move on the point.  I feel very strongly on the points raised in the amendments and I must have another try to see if I can get the Parliamentary Secretary to approve them.</P>
    <P>As I said on the Second Stage, the credit union movement is a friendly, neighbourly movement; it is also an entirely voluntary body.  It is an extremely valuable organisation, in that it encourages thrift, wise spending and wise borrowing.  It is, I am convinced, a great mistake to try to introduce the law and the law courts into this very welcome legislation.  The annual general meeting of the Credit Union will understand the background and the reasons for refusing membership to any particular person.  They will understand far more clearly than the law courts ever could.  It would be far better to leave such a decision within the credit union movement.  The Parliamentary Secretary, I am afraid, would not agree with me in regard to suspicion where the law courts are concerned but I really think the average simple person does not like any shadow of the law courts and it is particularly out of place in a friendly movement. Should the law courts decide that an unwelcome person must be accepted into the credit union, it could introduce a very unhappy atmosphere; it could result in a falling off of the membership. I could not see that the happy atmosphere would continue and I think passing such power to the law courts would have a very bad effect on the credit union.  This also applies, of course, to the other amendment which deals with the expulsion of a member, where the same argument applies.</P>

God knows when we get such little support on this side of the House from other people we must support one another from time to time.  When one has a Parliamentary Secretary with a reasonable approach, one adopts a reasonable approach with him.  However, that is quite beside the point.  I do not understand Senator Miss Davidson's unreasoned prejudice against the law courts.  I appreciate her point of view but I do not understand why she should have such a terrible fear of them.</P>
      <P>I would have agreed with Senator Miss Davidson had she gone the whole hog and said that this section should not be in at all because it seems to me that if a number of people get together to form a credit union or a society they are exercising their right of freedom of association and if somebody else wants to muscle in on that and the other people do not want to allow him in, I do not know that he has any right to get into it.  It would be much more logical to say we should not have section 5 at all.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may have good reasons for insisting upon section 5 but if 30 of us here decide &mdash;because we do not disagree with one another&mdash;to form a credit union or any society and then some other people say: &ldquo;we want to get into it&rdquo;, the 30 of us who are banded together can say: &ldquo;that is it, we have banded ourselves into this society, we are agreeable with one another and we are not going to have anybody else&rdquo;. That, to me, is freedom of association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other amendment is concerned with expulsion.  There, I certainly shall demur because, being in, one has taken on certain obligations and acquired certain contractual rights under the rules.  If you are a member of a society, perhaps you are critical of the way in which affairs are being conducted and somebody wants to expel you, you are entitled to state: &ldquo;You are not entitled to do that under the rules&rdquo;.  I think a person is quite entitled to say: &ldquo;Right, we will get the district court, the circuit court or the High Court to decide that issue&rdquo;. <Col N="1140" /> That is a different thing; once you are in you have acquired contractual rights and contractual relations with other people.  It is a different thing being in. I should prefer section 5 not be in at all.  I should like to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say on this.</P>

      <P>While I dislike doing so, I must resist this amendment from Senator Miss Davidson.  This discussion took place in the Dáil and was fairly full.  Deputy Donegan on behalf of the Fine Gael Party very strongly opposed amendments tabled by the Labour Party in roughly the same terms as those tabled by Senators Miss Davidson and Crowley.  I agree that the credit union movement idea involves friendly and voluntary cooperation but the basis of the Credit Union is the common bond and I am appalled at the suggestion by Senator O'Quigley that a group of people should get together and having done so decide that they will omit everybody else if they feel like doing so.  I think you either hold to the idea of the common bond or you do not.  If it is accepted that the basis on which we operate is that the common bond is the <i>sine qua non</i>, then there can be no question of a small group getting together and deciding among themselves who they will have and who they will not have.</P>
      <P>Now, let us turn to the individual who believes he has the necessary common bond which entitles him to membership.  I am sure I do not have to tell Senator Miss Davidson that especially small credit unions could adopt the very procedure that Senator O'Quigley has mentioned and that is that having got together the little coterie that satisfies themselves they say they are satisfied and will exclude all other people even though to all outward appearances those people have exactly the same right of membership as those who are chosen to form the union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think what Senator O'Quigley has said points out the very reason why I have to insist on this simple right of appeal to the district court.  It could well happen that people would try to <Col N="1141" /> exclude from membership those who were equally entitled with them and if there were no appeal from their decision, then that was the end of it.  It is because I want to have that appeal preserved that I am suggesting that these amendments should be withdrawn. It is because the person who is excluded by such a decision should have the right of an independent and neutral tribunal deciding on the merits of his case and because the district court is independent and neutral that I think the individual should have a right to which clearly he should be entitled of having an independent person or tribunal arbitrate on his case.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the Committee on Cooperative Societies whose report gave rise to this Bill specifically recommended that this right of appeal to the courts should be there and presumably this Committee made that recommendation because they foresaw that the very circumstances which Senator O'Quigley has outlined could, especially in small communities, quite easily arise and cause serious injustice. Because of that I must continue to oppose these amendments.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Davidson said that the credit union movement encourages thrift, wise borrowing and spending in a friendly voluntary atmosphere. How would Senator Miss Davidson feel as an individual excluded from the rights of enjoying wise borrowing and wise spending through a local credit union and having no appeal anywhere except at the annual general meeting which already had a closed mind on her application? Just how friendly would she feel towards the annual general meeting and how voluntary would she feel the entire local union was if that sort of situation obtained?</P>
    <P>As I said on Second Reading here, I do not think the right of appeal to the district court which is in the Bill will, in fact, be used very often.  I do accept that in the main members of the union will be only too glad to admit others who have the common bond into membership to expand their <Col N="1142" /> unit whether it is already small, medium or large.  I think that in practice, and I believe this is experienced elsewhere, the need for an actual appeal to be decided by the district court will seldom arise.  I do think it is essential that the simple and cheap procedure whereby a demonstrably neutral and impartial person can adjudicate on a matter like this should be preserved so that the credit union movement or any unit of it will not ever become the personal property of a small number of people excluding those they feel like excluding and admitting those they feel like taking in.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 7 which envisages the Credit Union Advisory Committee as being a sort of court of final decision, I do not think it was ever intended that the Advisory Committee should be anything other than what it says, namely, a committee which gives advice to the Minister in relation to matters arising out of the operation of the credit union movement.  It was never envisaged that they would exercise any judicial or semi-judicial function and for that reason I regret that I cannot see my way to accept as reasonable the arguments advanced in favour of any of these three amendments.</P>

      <P>I should like to say to the Parliamentary Secretary that the credit union in which I am particularly interested felt that the machinery of the law force as visualised in the Bill was far too fearsome and far too heavy for the purposes of the credit union and difficulties might arise. The Parliamentary Secretary asked how I would feel if I were the person concerned.  Well, I think if I were stupid enough to put myself in the position of being a person who would not be accepted by a credit union or being a member of a credit union to have proved myself such an unsuitable person that I would have to be expelled, I think I would take what was coming to me.</P>

      <P>I did realise that what the Parliamentary Secretary said is true, that these points will not be likely to arise often but they still could arise.  Surely it would only be a very unsuitable person who would be refused, and likewise a very unsuitable person who would be expelled.</P>
      <P>I still feel the advisory committee of the Credit Union or the annual general meeting would know the background of the case better than the law courts. What would the atmosphere in a credit union be if they were forced to take in someone they felt was unsuitable, or to retain someone they felt was unsuitable &mdash;untrustworthy, for example.</P>

      <P>I said I could see a valid reason for not having the subsection in unless the Parliamentary Secretary gave some reason to the contrary.  Having heard him, I quite agree that since the right to exist is founded upon the existence of the common bond everyone who is within the ambit of the common bond should be entitled to become a member of this entity which is authorised to exist by this Bill.  I quite agree, therefore, that it is necessary that there should be a right of appeal.  Persons who can then qualify in the common bond should be entitled to join the union and should be denied for good reasons only.  In all these matters the only place where one can get satisfaction is in the courts of law.</P>
      <P>The courts of law, I should like to tell Senator Miss Davidson, if I may be permitted to make the observation, are not perfect.  They cannot give satisfaction to all the people all the time.  That is reserved for democracy. The courts of law are the best system we have been able to devise yet.  They are a far better system for doing right in the case of an individual than a general meeting.  We all know what takes place at general meetings.  We have all joined various societies from time to time.  General meetings do not operate in a judicial fashion.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that if the board of directors are able to determine all the matters which will fall to be determined by them within the rules, they should be able to determine the remuneration of the treasurer.  Therefore, I think it would be better to leave it to the board of directors. Again, at general meetings people are in a very flaithiúl kind of mood and canvassing goes on.  Subsequently there is treating by people who are appointed to office.  If we had a sober-minded set of people such as a board of directors we might get a better or a more appropriate rate of remuneration for the treasurer than if it were determined by the members at a general meeting.</P>

      <P>I was rather surprised that this amendment was put down because in the course of the discussion which we had for a long time on detailed minutiae it was suggested on one occasion by only one very <Col N="1145" /> small credit union that this alteration should be made but it was not suggested by any of the other unions or bodies or by the Credit Union League. There is a basic objection to the arrangement that the treasurer's pay should be fixed by his own cronies.  As a matter of practice, it is usual in clubs and bodies of this kind that the members themselves have the last say so far as anything to do with the financial affairs of the club or body is concerned. I was anxious to preserve that position in regard to the treasurer. This does not cover the assistant treasurer or other workers, but only the treasurer himself.  All others would be within the power of the board of directors to deal with exclusively.</P>
      <P>I suppose I would not have any basic objection to this alteration if the House felt no damage was being done to the general principle that the main body of members should have the final say in financial matters.  That principle is pretty well enshrined in the Bill itself. I had some misgivings about it but Senator FitzGerald has suggested a compromise, namely, that in the first instance the board of directors should have power to fix the rate but that it should be subject to the approval of the annual general meeting.  That seems reasonable.</P>

If the intention is that the annual general meeting should continue to have the final power in the matter of remuneration, I do not think <Col N="1146" /> that would be possible with this amendment.  There is a great difference between the annual general meeting fixing the rate of remuneration from the start and fixing it upon the recommendation of the board of directors.  It might be very difficult for the annual general meeting not to agree to a proposition of this kind.  If you want the annual general meeting to have this power, I do not think they would retain it under this amendment.</P>

      <P>Yes, they are dependent on each other.  I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (3) to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  Where a regulation is proposed to be made under paragraphs (i), (j) or (k) of subsection (1) of this <Col N="1148" /> section a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulation shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to retain the supremacy of Parliament over the legislation which is enacted and to ensure that legislation enacted by the Oireachtas can only be changed by a further Act of the Oireachtas.  Section 35 prescribes that the Minister may by regulations alter a variety of things. We find that he can also amend the Schedule to this Act and that Schedule already contains amendments to the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister is seeking power to do by regulation what is necessary to do by Act under the 1893 measure, which this Bill is amending.  We ought to pause and check at what stage we should permit legislation by regulation. It is one thing to make regulations which are within the purview of a particular statute but it is quite a different matter to say that by regulation you can amend an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may say: &ldquo;I am only going to amend financial limitations and matters of that kind.&rdquo;  Those are financial limitations which we specify in an Act of Parliament.  They are laid down by the Oireachtas.  It is quite wrong to say that what is passed by the people's Parliament can subsequently be amended by Ministerial regulations. I do not for a moment subscribe to that theory.  Now that the matter has been brought to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary, a man who is the personification of reasonableness, I do not believe he will subscribe to it either.</P>
    <P>What I am seeking in the amendment is a recognition that here is a situation in which it is necessary to accommodate the discharge of public business by providing that such amendments to the Act can be effected by the Minister bringing in draft orders which are first approved by resolutions of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I regard this as a fair and <Col N="1149" /> reasonable compromise and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that the authority of Parliament ought not to be frittered away as it is sought to be frittered away by the application of regulations under paragraphs (i), (j) and (k).</P>

      <P>I wish to support this very strongly.  This seems to be the only blot on an otherwise excellent Bill.  There are, of course, some minor defects which we can sort out between us.  This involves the principle of amending legislation by regulation.  What we are seeking is a provision that an order would be brought positively before both Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.  These regulations will not arise very often and the Parliamentary Secretary will not spend much time in producing regulations of this type, but there is an important principle here.  I am not 100 per cent convinced in regard to paragraph (k): I am not quite sure I understand what is involved, but I am concerned about paragraphs (i) and (j) which specifically give the power to change the law, I am not sure how to fit paragraph (k) into the picture.</P>

I have been in this House longer than any other Member and it is news to me that alteration of legislation can under this system be performed without the decision of the Oireachtas. As an official of Dublin Corporation, down through the years I have been implementing orders but never to an extent greater than the substance of the Act concerned.

      <P>When the Bill was being debated in the Dáil this matter was raised and I said I agreed with what was expressed&mdash;that the functions of the Houses of the Oireachtas must be jealously preserved. I do not think that anybody in this or the other House is more anxious than I to see that objective is achieved at all times.  The regulations are, of course, subject to subsection (3), which obliges the Minister to lay each order before both Houses as soon as possible. There is a further provision in the Schedule which obliges the Registrar of Friendly Societies to keep the public informed in his annual report of all orders that have been made&mdash;this was an amendment which I introduced in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree in principle that any regulation which is expressed to change the law should not be made without the procedure of laying the draft before the Houses of the Oireachtas and obtaining their approval in the first instance. I do not go as far as Senator E. Ryan in this.  Obviously, there will be certain minor regulations which, for the sake of convenience, the Minister should have power to make without having in the first instance to consult <Col N="1151" /> either House of the Oireachtas, but, of course, he would have to lay all regulations on the Table of the House afterwards.  Our aim in the Bill is to achieve the maximum flexibility, to enable the Minister to act when abuses arise or when it may be expedient to extend time limits or make other regulations which do not substantially affect the law.  I should like to preserve the position of the Minister in regard to these matters, but I agree that where it is a question of changing the law, in principle it is wrong that such power should lie with the Minister without in the first instance obtaining the approval of the Oireachtas.  If the House is agreeable, I intend to accept the amendments, though I have some misgivings in regard to mechanical matters such as time limits.  I should like the House to consider this in the light of our general desire to preserve and guard the functions of the Oireachtas while at the same time achieving the maximum flexibility possible in the operation of the legislation.</P>

      <P>The original section prohibited advertising and it was represented to me that it was not fair. I accepted that, but we felt, at the same time, that the Minister should have some powers in regard to the matter of advertising.  There were obviously reasons for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was argued that any money-dealing institution might take umbrage if statutory prohibitions on advertising by <Col N="1152" /> it were of a nature which would unfairly affect its business.  For that reason it was felt that section 32 should be withdrawn but that the Minister should retain some power in regard to this matter of advertising, and the exercise of that power is regulated by the requirement that not fewer than six members of the Credit Union Advisory Committee must be of the opinion that the practice to be restricted is contrary to the aims of the credit union movement. I am not sure to what extent the movement uses advertising in other countries, but I think it is not large and that in the normal way it would be confined to local advertising in the shape of handouts, possibly advertisements in local papers circulating in the area of the credit union, and that there would not be any advertising through national newspapers or national media of communication.

      <P>Might I again say something about the type of Bill coming before us?  I can well see that if this had been brought in under the title of Industrial and Provident Societies (Credit Unions) Bill, 1966, it would have been objected to.  It is refreshing at this late hour of the night to be able to comment upon the fact that it is possible to describe this Bill as simply &ldquo;The Credit Union Bill, 1966.&rdquo;  I hope that other Departments will adopt that kind of approach in the naming of Bills in the future.</P>

      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary has not a brief on it I do not mind, but the only question I am interested in is how the Insurance Act, 1936, comes into this particular piece of legislation, which seems to be a good distance removed from insurance society Acts.  If the Parliamentary Secretary has not got the answer I do not want to press it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are limitations in the Insurance Act, 1936, on the extent of children's insurance and there have been representations from the insurance companies and the insurance representatives' organisation over a long period of years asking that these limitations should be adjusted to take account of the changes in the value of money.  It seemed only reasonable that if changes were being made in respect of the Friendly Societies Acts corresponding changes should be made in the Insurance Act, 1936.  The limitations at present in the Insurance Act are £6 for a child who dies under the age of three, £10 for a child who dies under the age of six, and £15 for a child dying under the age of ten.  Here we are amending sections 62 and 65 of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, as set out in Part III of the Schedule, and so we are amending the relevant sections of the 1936 Insurance Act in regard to payments that can be made regarding children who die under certain ages, to bring it into line with the changes in the Friendly Societies Act.</P>

      <P>That half explains it, but what puzzles me is why in a Credit Union Bill you are amending limitations on insurance and friendly societies in the first instance. If you are going to do it for friendly societies, it is only fair that you should <Col N="1154" /> do it for insurance societies, but why do it in a Credit Union Bill in any event?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary for the purposes of registration of credit unions under the Principal Act to make any changes in the Friendly Societies Act, but for the reasons I gave it is desirable even so that certain amendments be made to a limited number of provisions which contain unnecessary limitations that are now out of date.  It appears that there has been pressure for some time past to have these limitations in the Friendly Societies Act brought up to date.  The Committee of Co-Operative Societies recommended that appropriate adjustments should be made in this respect. There are financial limitations under the Friendly Societies Acts which are very much the same as those in the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, and it was considered unreasonable to rectify these as far as the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts are concerned as we are doing in Part I of the Schedule and to leave the Friendly Societies Acts in the lurch.  The object of Part II of the Schedule is to avoid criticism on this point from those concerned with the management of friendly societies.</P>
      <P>There are a number of other matters here regarding changes in money which I could go into, but they do not concern Part III, which is the one about which Senator O'Quigley raised the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to be clear about this thing.  This is to all intents and purposes quite clearly a Credit Union Bill dealing with the whole organisation of the credit unions in this country.  I am somewhat puzzled, and regret that I find myself in this position, to see that here we have quite extensive amendments of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893, of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896 and even of the Insurance Act, 1936 about which I do not know whether we have heard anything up to now.  I am not at all sure that this is the way that legislation to amend these various Acts should be carried out, by means of a Schedule. <Col N="1155" /> If we are going to amend the Friendly Societies Act, 1896 and the Insurance Act, 1936, I should think that we ought to put it fairly and clearly on the face of the Bill, and I demur to including these things in the Schedule to this Bill.  But for the fact that the 1936 Insurance Act was mentioned here I would probably not have noticed this at all.  The Friendly Societies Act of 1896 would probably have tied in with the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, and one would readily accept amendment of the Principal Act.</P>
      <P>I do not think there was an explanatory memorandum issued with this Bill.  What I am concerned about is, if amendment of legislation is necessary, that at least we ought to be alerted to it and it ought not to be tucked away into the Schedule of a Bill.  This is the kind of vogue which has come into the parliamentary draftsmen's office.  I would think when people are trying to ascertain what the law is in the Insurance Act of 1936, they would be a long time searching through the law books, reading section after section, before they would find there was an amendment of the Insurance Act of 1936 contained in the Schedule of a Credit Union Bill.</P>

      <P>I reiterate everything I said earlier about the Parliamentary Secretary but I do demur at that kind of method of effecting changes in the law.  Nobody concerned with the Insurance Acts would for a moment suspect there would be an amendment of the Insurance Act of 1936 tucked away neatly&mdash;under the stairs you might say&mdash;in Part III of the Credit Union Bill.  I am demurring at the whole procedure and reserving whatever rights are necessary for so demurring for the purposes of the Report Stage.  I do not want to make any further point about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If these things had been taken out and put into sections 37, 38 and 39, so that people could see quite clearly what is being done on the face of the <Col N="1156" /> Bill, it would have been something, but we are not inclined to look at Schedules to Acts; we are inclined to take them as read.  I do not want to touch the title.  I am concerned that legislation of this kind in, perhaps, a more important Bill may very well escape the attention of Parliament at a future date.  That is a very wrong procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senator O'Quigley says is quite correct.  Somebody looking at the Insurance Act and looking for amendments to it is not likely to look at this Act, but this is something which does happen very frequently.  You have consequential amendments of other Acts and sometimes they are in Acts which have no apparent connections with the Principal Act, or the Act which is amended. Although it is unfortunate that this happens, it does happen fairly often and I do not see what one can do about it, except bring in a special Bill merely amending the Insurance Act.</P>
      <P>As regards the second point made by Senator O'Quigley that the amendment, if it is to be made at all, should be made in the body of the Bill, I am not against that because I am very much of the opinion that where you do have repeals or amendments in a Bill they should be all grouped together at the end of the Bill, so that one can refer to them immediately and see them all together; you should not have to wade your way through the Bill to see if there are amendments.</P>

      <P>I should point out that in section 37 there is specific reference to the Insurance Act, 1936. But I must say, as a mere solicitor, that these sort of practices of having changes tucked away became so confusing I often gave up and simply wrote to learned counsel for advice as to what, in fact, was the law.  This is, at the same time, very difficult to avoid when we were strongly urged to make this amendment to the Insurance Act, especially by Senator Crowley and we made reference to it in section 37.  It is not specifically but generally covered by the long Title.  I do share misgivings about this method <Col N="1157" /> of changing law more or less under the stairs, as suggested by Senator O'Quigley, but I do not know how we can avoid it.</P>
