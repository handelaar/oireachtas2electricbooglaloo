      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 29, section 39, between lines 51 and 52 to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(&nbsp;)  Repayment of a loan under this section in respect of a house may be secured by:</P>
      <P>(a)  an instrument vesting the ownership of the house in the housing authority subject to the right of redemption by the borrower,</P>
      <P>(b)  by charging the house under the Registration of Title Acts, 1891 and 1942, with the repayment of the loan (together with interest payable thereon),</P>
      <P>(c)  by deposit with the housing authority of the land certificate issued under the said Acts, in relation to the house, or</P>
      <P>(d)  where such ownership is already vested in a person other than the borrower subject to the right of redemption of the borrower, an instrument of further charge charging the repayment of the loan (together with the interest payable thereon) under this section on the house and making the said right of redemption subject also to the repayment of the loan (together with the interest payable thereon) under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is being retabled.  We feel that it should be written into the Bill so that no ambiguity will exist where local authorities are concerned and that loans will be made available <Col N="631" /> where vested council cottages are sold. Many of us who live in rural areas see that quite a number of vested cottages are in lists of sales that appear in the local papers.  It seems a pity to me that that type of house which was built to house the working classes is in many cases passing out of the hands of the working classes.  It can be said, and perhaps rightly so, that section 98 covers this but according to section 98 it appears necessary to have the consent of the local authority.  It should be written into the Bill that loans can be made available for vested cottages the same as for any other type of house and that that type of house can be mortgaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Those points have already been made and dealt with, at least I thought they were dealt with, very fully on the Committee Stage. There is really not anything I can add to what I have already said other than to repeat that the amendments are unnecessary because of the actual power contained in the section mentioned by Senator Fitzgerald, namely section 98.  I really cannot add to what I have already said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am really concerned about is that under section 98 it appears to be essential to have the consent of the local authority.  The local authority may feel that having regard to the number of vested cottages coming on the market it would not be economic to give money to people who might be looking for a loan to buy this type of house.  Most of those houses might be sold and the local authorities would not be in a position to provide loans to enable those houses to be bought.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 29, section 39, between lines 51 and 52 to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(&nbsp;) Notwithstanding regulations made by the Minister under the Act of 1962 (namely, S.I. No 130 of <Col N="632" /> 1964 and S.I. No. 137 of 1965) or regulations to be made under this section, any person who is qualified to receive a supplementary grant from a housing authority under section 26 of this Act shall not be disqualified from receiving a loan under section 39 (or by reason of any departmental or administrative decision) where the applicant's income enables a housing authority to make a supplementary grant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In many cases a person might be regarded as being, if you like, too poor to get a loan.  Very often at the moment when a person builds a house and he applies for a loan it is usual to have an investigation made as to his means, income, and so on.  While that person might qualify for a grant of £900 by reason of the fact that he is a person who would normally be housed by a local authority, he might be debarred from getting a loan by reason of the fact that his income is too low.</P>
    <P>You have a situation in which a person is, if you like to put it that way, so poor that he would qualify for housing by a local authority if houses were available but because houses are not available he wants to build his own house.  He knows he will get £900 of a grant but that he will require another £1,300 or £1,400 to build the house.  But the local authority officials might say his income is insufficient and that, therefore, they could not give him a loan.  In spite of the fact that a grant of £900 is available that person is precluded from getting a loan because his income is insufficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point being made by Senator Fitzgerald is somewhat away from what I expected he would say on this particular amendment.  If I understand him correctly, the amendment would not do what the Senator is asking the House now to do.  He is dealing, as I understand it, with a matter which is not really covered by the amendment.  He is dealing with a situation in which the SDA loan might be paid in circumstances where the income was too low.  This, I think, is the point the Senator has been making.  I <Col N="633" /> would say that this amendment would not cure that at all.</P>
      <P>On the amendment itself, the situation really is that in dealing with this matter of loans and grants it is wrong to have it understood that these things are inseparable in all respects.  Indeed, the past situation has been that had the amendment been in operation as a law the limit for SDA loans would have been reduced to the level of the grant limit.  Until this new order of things came along we had a limit of £832 for the grants and £840 for loans.  If the amendment were accepted we would have to bring back the limit which was higher for SDA loans than it was for grants to the lower limits of the grants.</P>
      <P>What I am trying to get across is that we had the experience of the SDA income limit being higher than that which was allowable in the case of grants.  At present, in certain circumstances, the income limit, where there is a number of dependants, may exceed the limit which will allow a person to get a SDA loan.  My point is that these are not inseparable.  Because we have a standard by which we judge whether or not a loan should be paid and having arrived at a conclusion as to whatever the amount should be, we should not then say that the same limit should apply in respect of grants, or <i>vice versa.</i>  They are two separate things and we should not confuse the issue by over-simplifying them in the belief that they are the same.  They are not.  I again repeat that the case made by Senator Fitzgerald has not dealt with the intent of the amendment. Even if it did, the amendment would not, I submit, have the effect the Senator has been advocating.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 29, section 39, between lines 51 and 52 to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(&nbsp;) the fixing of the rate or rates of interest to be charged by a local authority in respect of a loan advanced under this section shall be a reserved function.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> Again, this is an amendment we had on Committee Stage.  We feel it is a pity that it is not written into the Bill that local authorities can make loans available at a rate of interest applicants can pay.  I mentioned on Committee Stage that the Meath County Council have since 1963 been operating a loan for people who would be normally housed by the local authority and who are providing their own houses under the SDA grants and qualifying for a four per cent loan.</P>
    <P>The scheme has been very successful and has been a very progressive step in so far as we are concerned.  Quite a number of people have availed of it.  In many ways it would be a good thing if we had the amendment written into the Bill&mdash;that local authorities could make loans available to applicants, at a rate of interest that would enable more people to avail of the SDA loans and grants in order to build their own houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Fitzgerald in his plea to allow the elected representatives to have a say in the fixing of the loan interest rates.  It has been the general experience that the manager fixes the maximum rate of interest even when the elected representatives advise that he should apply a lower rate.  Lower interest rates, as Senator Fitzgerald has told us, would be an added incentive to many people to buy their own houses and this would mean relief to the local authority and to the community at large.  The idea behind the amendment is to enable local authorities to introduce schemes even where managers might oppose this.  Has the Minister the power to make regulations to give effect to what we seek in the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter of rates of interest, as the House knows, has been decided at local level and not centrally. By and large, during the years the situation has developed that the rates of interest chargeable on SDA transactions have been related to the actual cost of borrowing and ultimately lending by the central authority with a small fractional percentage added to cover administrative costs.  It has <Col N="635" /> operated at as low as one-eighth per cent, sometimes without any cost to the rates.  The suggestion that this system should now be tackled in such a way that we would be putting it to the local authorities to reduce interest rates on top of all their other commitments has not, I submit, been made at the proper time.  If we had intended to embark on this suggested method of aiding and assisting house-building during the years it would be a different matter.  Even if at this stage we should decide in our wisdom to have this reorganisation of house-building financial aids and have another look at supplementary and State grants, it might well be we would so reduce the rate of interest that we would have this system rather than capital grants payments which have now become the accepted thing.</P>
      <P>It is against that background we should look at this question of directing, as it were, members of local authorities by inserting this type of provision in the Bill.  This would be an invitation, to put it mildly, to local authority members to reduce interest rates for the purpose of SDA transactions. The situation, as everybody here knows, is that local authorities have operated reduced interest SDA schemes in a number of cases.  That a number of local authorities have done it clearly indicates it is possible for them to do it. It has been demonstrated and I assert it is possible to do it in all cases.  I am not aware that it may rest with the manager.  I am not aware of any majority view in any council in the country at present or during the years that had in mind a subsidising of interest rates and was aborted by a manager failing to act.  If there was such a manager who stood in the way of a council he would be a very foolish manager because the provisions of section 4 could be used to a degree that would make life intolerable for him until he came to live and work with the council instead of against them.  I do not see the necessity for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the pattern has been built up during the years and if we were completely to review the aids to housing we might come up with something <Col N="636" /> more positive in the matter of reduced interest rates contributed to by the Government and the local authorities.  At the present time, this on top of what we have already done in this measure would be without doubt an invitation if not an exhortation to local authorities.  If it is possible, local authorities will do it.  That has been demonstrated by practice and by actions in the past.  It is possible to do it, and I am inclined to leave it to councils to operate such a scheme if they think fit, even to the extent of dropping part of their supplementary grants if they cannot afford both.  If they feel they can afford to do it we in the Department will not stand in their way and the manager, unless he is really not interested in the views of his council or, indeed, in the work of the council, will fall in with the council. I do not think the amendment is necessary. It could work as an attempt to stampede councils into doing this on top of the other contributions they make to housing at the moment.  That is the picture I have of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>A point in favour of the amendment may be the Minister's reference to practice in the past.  In view of recent happenings relative to access to various loans for the purchase of houses and the erection of houses and the fall-back or complete stoppage in local authority housing, the category of people who would have recourse to these loans is now of very serious proportions and it will increase as a result of the curtailment in local authority housing. The efforts of people to build their own houses in face of increased costs are laudable but the increased building costs put the possibility of building their own houses beyond the reach of many people unless they get the credit they require to make up the balance between local authority aids and the actual cost of the houses.  Many of these people were met half way by the availability of loans in the past for the purchase of existing dwellings.  The Minister now, by order, has directed councils and various housing authorities to cease this practice which means more and more people must erect their <Col N="637" /> own houses if they are to have new homes.  On top of that, we have the dreadful situation in relation to the financing of local authority housing. Many people have been added to the list of those who up to now have had recourse to loans.  The conditions imposed on these people have worsened considerably in recent months.  Therefore, the cost of loans available to these people has become far more important than it was and consequently I appeal to the Minister to meet this situation in some measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pleasing to know that while the Minister is not prepared to accept this amendment, he advises the allocation of loans at a little below what is required at the moment.  I was glad to hear him mention that this situation may be reviewed in the future, whereby it might be possible that the Department would help the local authority to subsidise a lower rate of interest to enable people to house themselves.  My concern with this particular amendment is that I feel quite a number of local authority representatives might be rather hesitant to ask their local authority to introduce a scheme of this kind.  It is a pity that many more local authorities do not operate a lower rate of interest loan because, if they did, many more people could house themselves rather than be waiting to be housed by the local authorities. Furthermore, since the 1962 Housing Act, which made it obligatory that all houses erected must contain water and sewerage services, local authorities have not built what we in rural areas know as rural cottages.</P>
      <P>There have been cottages with services built in towns and in villages but, in the rural areas, the old isolated cottage, as we knew it, has not been built since 1962.  It was only in 1965, when an attempt was made to resume the building of isolated cottages, with the sanitary services provided by the local authorities, that any of those people could hold out any hope of being housed by a local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do hope the Minister will keep in mind what he has just mentioned&mdash;that at some stage the Government and the <Col N="638" /> Department may come to the aid of local authorities who are prepared to make loans available at a lower rate of interest.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 37, between lines 13 and 14 to insert new paragraphs as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(&nbsp;) to what extent provision has (or has not) been made for the objectives in sections 55, 56 and 57;</P>
      <P>(&nbsp;) to what extent persons eligible to be housed by the housing authority are obliged to acquire houses or accommodation beyond their means with or without the loan facilities under section 39.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This we had before.  We put it down again because we still feel that the scope of section 53 subsection (1), paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) is not wide enough.  We propose the addition of these two paragraphs.  This amendment is quite clear and does not require long discussion.  Everyone knows that many people who are entitled to be housed by local authorities and who have got sick of waiting for such houses, made moves for themselves and now find themselves in the position that they have tied millstones around their necks and cannot meet their obligations except, in some cases, by cutting down on food and other essentials, with disastrous health results.  We feel these other people should be listed in the report to which this section refers on future housing requirements.</P>

      <P>As to the relevance of the amendment to sections 56 and 57, I do not see where it arises because these two sections really relate to the provision of sites or of houses.

      <P>As I have said sections 56 and 57 deal with the provision of sites or the houses.  What I am saying there is that the amendment does not, to me at any rate, appear to be of any real relevance to the provisions of those two sections.  In am inclined to reply to what has been said in relation to this amendment as it refers to section 55 and the content of section 55.  In that regard, I feel the amendment is similar to that tabled on Committee Stage, which we had at some length.  I should say also that the adoption of this amendment here, to my mind at any rate, would tend to do little of any value and would tend also, by elaborating on the section as it stands, to obscure the real purpose of the section, thereby defeating the very purpose which, no doubt, the Senators putting down the amendment intended.  Again, on Committee Stage, we had this thing out to a considerable degree and, indeed, earlier in the other House.  I can add nothing to what I have already said on the matter.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister would he not think it would be a wise provision that, in any assessment of housing needs in the future, to include:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(&nbsp;) to what extent persons eligible to be housed by the housing authority are obliged to acquire houses or accommodation beyond <Col N="640" /> their means with or without the loan facilities under section 39.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>making sure we shall not be forcing people to take on obligations we know they are unable to meet; merely making provision in the future for any class of person who appears to have been overlooked and, because of being overlooked, has been forced into a very bad position from their own point of view and from the point of view of the community.</P>
    <P>The Minister might just have another look at that.  It really does not ask for an awful lot except that he would make a fair assessment of the local authorities' needs in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the features of this matter put forward by Senator Miss Davidson is that if we were to have this provision inserted there would be, without doubt, an outcry by all of the people whose means would be perused and searched out and who, in fact, did not have anything to gain from it in the long run.  They are the people who would scream about it.  We have had that experience before when it came to a far more definite point which is, for instance, the ascertaining of means when renting of houses is about to take place and after it has taken place.  In addition to that, in this case, the fact that a person may be in a house which could be regarded, from a structural point of view, as suitable but is costing the world in so far as that person's income is concerned, there is no barrier to that person being rehoused.  The imposition of this inquiry into the incomes of the persons in the areas and in all areas said to be in need of housing would be an unnecessary exercise, an exercise which would be resented, an exercise which would not have any great bearing on 99 per cent of the cases, and as to the other one per cent they may get housing in the future even though their own accommodation may not be structurally unsound.  I feel this, in itself, is a very good reason why we should not add this scrutiny of means <Col N="641" /> to the other scrutinies that already have to be exercised.  For that reason, among the other things I mentioned, I feel we should not insert this into the Bill.</P>

      <P>(b)  It may also in the same connection provide, if it thinks fit, sites for places of worship, factories, shops, schools, offices and other buildings or land and such other works or services, as will, in the opinion of the authority, serve a beneficial purpose either in connection with the requirements of the persons for whom the dwellings are provided or in connection with the requirements of those persons and of other persons.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is a little difficult to understand and a little more difficult to explain.  Under the subsection as it stands at the moment, a housing authority may, in connection with dwellings provided, to be provided or which in the opinion of the authority will in the future require to be provided, provide and, if they think fit, maintain in good order and repair roads, shops, playgrounds, places of recreation, parks, allotments, open spaces, sites for places of worship, factories, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to split this in two and say that in respect of certain of these things the housing authority shall, unless they opt out by resolution specifically determining that issue, provide and maintain in good <Col N="642" /> repair roads, playgrounds, places of recreation, including swimming pools&mdash; and that is an addition&mdash;parks, allotments and open spaces.  Under the section a housing authority may provide these things if they think fit, and the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that they shall provide them unless by resolution they specifically decide otherwise.</P>
    <P>In relation to the other matters the position is left as it was.  They may provide, if they think fit, sites for places of worship, factories, shops, schools, offices and other buildings or land and such other works or services, as will, in the opinion of the authority, serve a beneficial purpose either in connection with the requirement for persons for whom the dwellings are provided or in connection with the requirements of those persons and other persons.</P>
    <P>I hope I have said enough to explain the purpose of the amendment.  It is to divide these into two, and say that in respect of certain things a housing authority shall provide them unless they specifically decide otherwise.  We also add the provision of swimming pools.  It may be that the Minister and the local authorities may not regard swimming pools as amenities.  However, many people think otherwise.  One purpose of the amendment is to underline the need for the provision of swimming pools with other amenities like parks, allotments and open spaces.  I do not think the amendment affects the Bill in any fundamental way and I hope the Minister will find it possible to accept it.</P>

      <P>I oppose this amendment for two reasons.  The first is that in our present financial circumstances, if I read the amendment correctly, this would put an unreasonable burden on the authorities.  If I read the amendment correctly&mdash;and I am subject to correction&mdash;this would mean that a swimming pool would have to be provided with each of these groups of houses.  Swimming pools are desirable, but I think it would be better to provide them on a municipal or a regional basis in connection with new developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second reason deals with a <Col N="643" /> matter of deeper principle.  It is wrong to make it mandatory to provide swimming pools and permissive to provide sites for places of worship.  If I were choosing between the two I think the places of worship should be mandatory and the swimming pools permissive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Stanford has dealt very succinctly with at least one aspect.  I should like to add that consideration should be given to the situation as it has been obtaining.  Under the present law all these things may be done.  Not only may they be done, but so far as roads, playgrounds, places of recreation, parks, allotments, and so on, where appropriate, are concerned, these things are not only capable of being done under the present law, but time and again they are being advocated by me, and were advocated by other Ministers down through the years.  Putting an obligation of this nature on the local authorities to opt statutorily out of doing these things would make little sense surely, because if a sufficient number of them take this view&mdash;which I doubt&mdash;the chances are that they would be sufficiently strong in their views not to deal with the essential which is the housing estate.</P>
      <P>This is all against my very definite view that all these things, within reason, in their proper concept, and within reasonable cost, should be in every new housing estate.  At every opportunity I have advocated that we should at least plan properly in this direction and try to provide these things as soon as we may.  The elementary amenities should certainly be provided at the outset, and there should be an integrated planned development which would entail the provision of all the amenities necessary for community life, community existence and community centres. Those are the trends today.  I do not think it would serve any purpose to put this in the Bill.  To put it in baldly as in the amendment would serve the reverse purpose, in my estimation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is in regard to paragraph (a) of the amendment and in so far as paragraph (b) is concerned&mdash;this would give the housing authorities enabling <Col N="644" /> power to provide schools etc.&mdash;I do not think it is necessary because section 56 already takes care of that aspect of the matter.  They may do these things as the amendment proposes they should be allowed to do. On Part (a) of the amendment I agree with the spirit and intention but I do not agree that it would be useful or a good thing that we should add this amendment because I believe that instead of adding to the amenities that may be provided at present and in the future it could have the effect of preventing or slowing down the provision of housing.  This is something which we must avoid.  I am not sure whether the amendment would have any effect, but if it had it might have the effect of slowing down the building of houses on the estate itself rather than adding anything by way of amenity. For that reason I am not at all in favour of the amendment, though the first part is the only part I take exception to, because the second part is already covered by section 56.  Local authorities may avail of it as they wish.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that the other Senator from Trinity College is not here to reply to Senator Stanford. He was a bit unfair to get up and put swimming pools and sites for churches in the same bracket, because we are dealing with two separate things.  I did not say that local authorities should build churches.  That is not advocated, and nobody here says that it is the duty of a local authority to build a church, though we say that it is the duty of the local authority to build and maintain swimming pools.  This does not mean that we regard swimming pools as more important than churches.  We are talking about the responsibilities of local authorities in this matter, and any comparison linking them together like this is a bit unfair.</P>

      <P>It provides here that the local authority may provide sites for offices, schools, factories, and places of worship.  It does not say whether a school or a place of worship should be built.  It simply provides a site, and that has been done for Ballymun in which the Minister is most interested. That brings me back to the swimming pool again.  The Minister is very involved in the development of Ballymun, and I wonder whether he is so involved as to provide for a swimming pool.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington spent some time talking about this section on the Second Stage of the Bill and again on Committee. The objection here is to the idea of segregation at all and, secondly, to the specific reference to tuberculosis. The objection is being partly met in amendment No. 12, but that still leaves references to tuberculosis, and I think amendment No. 11 is better. I hope that the Minister will agree, unless he has some specific reason for not doing so, that we should not mention tuberculosis in dealing with this problem, but that rather we should deal with it as in amendment No. 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  I do not see why&mdash;perhaps the Minister can enlighten me&mdash;tuberculosis should be specifically mentioned like this.  Why not leprosy or any other diseases? Leprosy, I understand, is on the increase in these islands, certainly in the neighbouring island, and it might be well not to specify tuberculosis but <Col N="647" /> leave it open by reference to any dangerous disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes one wonders whether an attempt to meet a situation as represented is worthwhile, when, having done the best one can to meet what was probably somewhat difficult to determine at the time, it was finally boiled down to the objection expressed to the words &ldquo;segregation of&rdquo;, and we were getting rid of that by amendment No. 12 which substitutes other words, which are &ldquo;adequate and suitable housing accommodation for.&rdquo;  As to the real value of amendment No. 11, I would say to the House what I said earlier, though it is not my domain, that tuberculosis is not beaten in this country yet.  The evidence and the figures would indicate that it is still quite a problem in our community, and that unless it is pursued with the same vigour as it has been in the past we could easily revert to the conditions in which we were 20 years ago, and that special consideration should be given in these cases, which is something which has been carried right up the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 is one which does not commend itself to me particularly as in framing my amendment I was given to understand that if I could meet all the words objected to the principle involved was quite acceptable.  This apparently is not generally acceptable and this amendment is the result.  I feel that amendment No. 12 is the one which on the earlier consideration was regarded as adequate to meet the situation as we then discussed it.  Any departure from the emphasis, by way of special or additional consideration being given to a person suffering from this disease, on this disease in the past, is something which would not commend itself to me.  It would not be wise to agree <Col N="648" /> to this at this particular juncture.  I would commend the official amendment, if you like to call it that, No. 12, to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather puzzled by the Minister's attitude in regard to amendment No. 11.  There are diseases other than tuberculosis which it would possibly be desirable that the housing authority would have special regard to.  It is unnecessary to have this specific pointing of the finger to tuberculosis.  I quite agree with the Minister that we still have tuberculosis in this country and we will always have it here.  Of course, it is not anything like the problem it was 15 or 20 years ago.  We should be particularly thankful to the people who gave leadership in bringing about the present happy position in that respect. I refer to Dr. Noel Browne, for example.  The Minister could agree that amendment No. 11 is the better amendment.  I am still satisfied it is the better amendment.  It satisfies both the needs of the Minister and the housing authorities.  The Bill would be a better one with amendment No. 11 than with amendment No. 12.  Therefore, I press the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 40, between lines 16 and 17, to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e)  the establishment as far as practicable of a demographically balanced community.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to add this new subsection (e) to the factors to which housing authorities should have regard.  This is the establishment, as far as practicable, of a demographically balanced community. The Minister will have sympathy with us, whether he thinks it is necessary to write it in or not. We have all seen the situation in which you have big housing estates and large numbers of people moving into them, particularly young married couples. Then you have a few years with the streets full of young children who later on start going to school.  There is a general build-up of the school-going age group for the next ten to 15 years.  The school-leavers leave before the school is built and we hope we might have a school before the children reach the school-leaving age. There is a population usually of the same age group&mdash;young married couples coming in and young children of from ten to 15 years of age.  At this stage the school accommodation provided in that area is largely redundant because it will be another ten to 15 years before more children will grow up in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable in determining priorities in this matter that the housing authorities should have regard as far as practicable to a demographically balanced community.  There are other factors beside the question of schools. A community composed of different age-groups is a happier community.  It is bad to have a situation in which you have all old people living in the same area.  They should be mixed <Col N="651" /> and balanced with people of different ages&mdash;young people especially.</P>
    <P>The purpose of putting down the amendment is to draw the attention of the Minister to the desirability of having regard to this in dealing with the question of house priorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment does not commend itself to me.  The amendment would put local authorities in a pretty impossible position in trying to decide priorities.  Indeed, I would go so far as to say that they would find it difficult enough to get things straight when they have cleared their accounts as to what they must have regard to, without adding this amendment with this phraseology.  Quite honestly, what does it mean in relation to the placing of tenants?  I know from what Senator Murphy has said what the intention is but, taking it on its face value which is how it would be interpreted if it became law, it does not appear to me as something we could insert here with any useful purpose whatsoever.  It would make it pretty impossible for local authorities to decide priorities which, God knows, are difficult enough already in relation to house allocation.</P>
      <P>While on this matter, I agree that the age groups, the newlyweds, going into new houses create a problem but I do not think it is such as to cause the whole pattern of the community to change in a couple of generations to the extent that we started off with all young people in an estate and would end with all old people.  This could happen if we had estates entirely devoted to newlyweds but the unfortunate situation, if you like, is that we have many people in larger centres where next-door neighbours are not of the same age group, where, side by side, there are young families and families ten years older.  If the amendment were to mean anything more than a gesture it could well be that well-off people would be brought into estates to the exclusion of badly-off people who could not be housed because they were not of a certain age group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that the suggestion of a balance is an ideal thing to aim at <Col N="652" /> but I do not think it is possible to achieve in an area like Dublin where there is such great need for housing and a great waiting list of families of all ages ranging over a wide field.  This could be very confusing and I do not think it is advisable in any sense other than to make a gesture that this sort of balance is something we should like to see, even if it is impossible of attainment. Otherwise, the amendment could not be said to have any merit.</P>

      <P>I really thought it meant the Minister had decided to accept the amendment as his and I was very happy for a while.  This is a slightly changed form from the amendment I pressed on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister will agree to apply the requirements of the Second Schedule to all housing.  If the Minister did that, we would be reasonably satisfied that our demands for good sanitary conditions would be met.  As the Bill stands, the Second Schedule requirements seem to apply to private houses but not to local authority houses.  We would wish it to apply to all housing.</P>
      <P>On this matter I am still very curious as to the Minister's desire to get rid of the words &ldquo;and sanitary condition&rdquo;. The Parliamentary Secretary seemed to imply that the description applied to finicky repairs and that this should be removed from the responsibility of the local authorities, which we could agree with.  But in the report of the Dublin County Council Housing Authority of 28th February, 1964 under prescribed repairs, under existing requirements of good sanitary conditions, I find the Minister sanctioned an item reading&mdash;&ldquo;provide a septic tank £90&rdquo;.  This could scarcely be described as a finicky repair.  It is also something which was evidently necessary for good sanitary condition. The date of the Minister's determination of the provision of this septic tank was 25th July, 1963.</P>

      <P>By taking this subsection out we would, I suggest, take the emphasis off the question of &ldquo;structural stability&rdquo;, and that the matters mentioned earlier in the section would not then be laid down as they are in subsection (4) but that the &ldquo;condition&rdquo; of the house would then be determined by the local authority in question, without being tied absolutely as they might be regarded as being tied by subsection (4).  It would give them that bit of further flexibility without, at the same time, re-introducing the situation wherein necessary repair work&mdash;as has happened on many occasions&mdash;has probably been neglected in one set of houses because of the necessity, under the present law, to carry out many little finicky repairs which were eating up money which could more usefully have been spent in a more comprehensive or definite way on more houses.  In other words, we might have more houses repaired to a reasonable standard rather than a few repaired to what might be regarded as a rather high standard with disadvantage to the many which still remained to be repaired.  The deletion of subsection (4)  of section 106 would reduce the danger feared by the Senators who put down the amendment.  By taking the subsection away we are taking away what they fear most, in the sense that we are not reiterating that local authorities must have regard to it.</P>

      <P>This amendment applies to the voting of councillor tenants.  I need not repeat the case I made on Committee Stage for this amendment.  We still consider it is unjust to deprive a tenant councillor from voting on general housing matters, such as rents. When I spoke on Committee Stage we suggested that he might reasonably be excluded from voting when the matter included his own dwelling.  If the Minister cannot accept the amendment, would he consider the proposal I made on Second Stage that he would take powers in certain cases to remove disability to vote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to that request, the only matter not already covered by existing law and practice we are <Col N="658" /> talking about in essence here in this section and in this amendment would be the question of the fixing of rents, for instance, by virtue of a section 4 resolution.  In the circumstances there, I do not see why we should not ensure that a member may not, by his vote, influence the result of a section 4 resolution from which he himself, as a tenant of the house of the council of which he is a member, would benefit, because under Parts I and II of the 1890 Act councillors are already in a position where they may not vote on matters dealing with lands or houses in a manner which would be beneficial to themselves.</P>
      <P>While the provision here would seem to be all-embracing, the fact is that the only thing of real importance is that a member may not vote in a specific section 4 resolution affecting rent where he would be beneficially affected.  That is the essence of what is intended.  These things are already covered in the 1890 Act and members may not vote beneficially to themselves in relation to many other things related to their functions as local councillors.</P>

      <P>I spoke about this on Committee Stage and I felt very strongly against this because, while I agree with the Minister's fears, I think the dangers contained in it are so negligible that they are unworthy of having a section of this kind in any Bill.  As we all know, the fixing of rents is practically a managerial function, and the instances where section 4 would be invoked to prevent him fixing what he might fed was an economic rent as against what the council might feel was an economic rent would be very negligible.  I do not think we should stigmatise this Bill with a section which prevents a certain section of the community who might be elected as members of a county council, a borough council, or any other local authority, from exercising their rights, merely because one might happen to be appointed a tenant of one of a terrace of 20 or 120 houses.  He could benefit also if his brother or his sister were being appointed a tenant of one of those houses.  In this year we should get <Col N="659" /> away from the type of legislation which appertains to an Act passed in 1890.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 74, section 115, between lines 19 and 20 to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(&nbsp;)  A person voting as a member of a housing authority (or any committee mentioned in section 110)  upon any resolution or question which is proposed or arises under sections 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 39, 40, 53, 55, 56, 57, 58, 60, 70, 90 and 97 shall not be deemed to be beneficially interested therein.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to balance the case of the tenant councillor who is being refused the right to vote because of a beneficial interest against the case of a mill owner, a publican, or a wealthy landowner, who will vote on the tenant councillor's rent, but will not be looked upon as being beneficially interested when, in fact, he is greatly beneficially interested because when the rent of the house goes up his rates go down.  He can be very beneficially interested in a reduction of rates rather than in the raising of the tenant councillor's rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that analogy is a true one because in that case the mill owner or the factory owner would not be entitled to vote on the matter.  I think the analogy should be between the mill owner who may be a member of the council and another person who may be a tenant, whatever else he might be.  Those two situations should be set against each other rather than the broad principle that every person who is a ratepayer could be said to have an interest that could be regarded as beneficial if by putting up rents he could get down the rates.  The fact of the matter is, as we know to our regret, that we have never seen&mdash;and I do not suppose we ever will see&mdash;rates being reduced as rents are being increased.  I do not think it <Col N="660" /> will ever happen that we will get a decrease in rates as a direct result of an increase in rents.</P>
      <P>The real point here is that all down the years the general principle has been that a councillor may not vote if he has a direct personal interest.  This is an extension of that principle to this related matter of an increase in rent by way of a section 4 resolution.  The principle is already applicable to all and sundry whether tenant or otherwise in relation to matters in which they would have a beneficial interest. They are already precluded from voting on it.  This is merely bringing it into line, and it is unlikely to happen very often&mdash;in fact, quite seldom.</P>

In this respect we can now only hope that the Minister will be in a position in a very short time to implement many of the admirable inclusions in this legislation. We cannot let the occasion pass without referring to the fact that the situation since this debate began here in the Seanad has worsened, with the information that has been brought to light relative to the current housing situation.</P>

We would wish that it was passed in different circumstances relative to the financing of housing in face of the drastic curtailments that all local authorities have suffered at the hands of the Minister this year.</P>

      <P>We have here a Bill which extends over 84 pages, with numerous sections.  By any standard this Bill was not very easy, even for people who are skilled in the reading of Bills, to comprehend even after a good deal of study.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister for Local Government will, in so far as he can do so, <Col N="662" /> make the provisions of this Bill known widely among those sections of the community to whom particular parts of it would apply, in some more intelligible language than necessarily can be contained in a measure of this kind.  I hope that he will give full publicity to the improvements in grants and loans and so on and the facilities which are available under it to the public at large and to those authorities concerned with its implementation and application.</P>
      <P>Necessarily, I suppose, in a measure of this kind it will be found inevitably that when the best design has been worked out and incorporated in the Bill there will be defects.  Up to now housing legislation was something in the nature of a jungle, and one has only to look at the First Schedule to see the myriad enactments over which the legislation regarding housing was spread.  It may well be that there are some <i>lacunae</i> and defects which will arise in its application.  I hope that if these arise during the Minister's term of office as Minister for Local Government he will not hesitate to rectify them by bringing in Bills at fairly frequent intervals to deal with them if they arise, and that the standard practice of waiting for two years in which to introduce a housing Bill will be departed from if any defect arises which the Minister finds cannot be dealt with, and that he will not hesitate to bring it in.  I am quite certain that so far from being criticised for bringing in an amendment of that kind the House will have nothing but commendation for speedy action in bringing in the necessary amending legislation.</P>
      <P>Like Senator D.J. O'Sullivan I hope that this Bill having been prepared and pushed through, the necessary wherewithal will be speedily made available to achieve the objects for which the Bill is designed.</P>

I am sure that it will see a big advancement in our housing programme. <Col N="663" /> During the discussion, and especially in the Minister's introductory speech, it became apparent that a great task devolved upon every local authority and everybody connected with housing to ensure that adequate housing is provided.  In this Bill the Minister has gone as far as he possibly can to provide legislation to enable that task to be tackled.  I sincerely hope that the credit restrictions and lack of finance which seem to be apparent at the moment will ease, and that this Bill will be put into operation by all local authorities to enable us to clear up the great backlog of housing that remains to be cleared up. There are many useful sections in the Bill, making it one of the best pieces of housing legislation passed in this State.  I hope, as I say, that money will soon become available to enable us to put all these useful sections in it into operation.</P>

      <P>It is, as Members of the House are fully aware, almost a year since this Bill was first introduced, and since then it certainly has had its fair quota of debate in Dáil and Seanad, but despite this fact I would like to express my appreciation to all concerned both here and in the other House for the manner in which those discussions took place in that despite the size of the Bill containing 120 sections and four Schedules and all that goes with all those things only five divisions took place on the Bill in its entirety.  I feel that even those five might have been avoided if we each really understood what was the intention of others.  I should like to say that this was mutual, to be charitable. However, continuing in the same charitable strain might I very genuinely say thanks to all in both Houses for the manner of approach to this Bill. In reply to Senator O'Quigley's request that if, as might well happen, when he and some of his colleagues have had time to peruse it in a more leisurely manner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;either by my <Col N="664" /> officials or by Senator O'Quigley and his colleagues, there might be found as in the case of any measure of this kind that in its administration certain mistakes would be found to have been made which can only emerge as we meet the particular circumstances and bring them into the floodlight, in so far as the correction of any of those are concerned and in so far as I am permitted to amend them in any way, I certainly will correct, as quickly as it is possible to do so, any shortcomings that may emerge.  I shall certainly not be slow to come to the Dáil and the Seanad to make those corrections or additions if experience dictates that they are necessary in connection with housing as a whole.</P>
      <P>The length of time we had this Bill before the Oireachtas is naturally a good reason why I am particularly anxious it should be put into operation as quickly as possible.  Indeed, I might say, before we got to this point at all, that some of the provisions of the Bill, as agreed by both Houses, are already in operation to quite a considerable degree.  The time taken by all those who spoke on this Bill, for and against particular aspects of it, is to my mind indicative of the widespread interest that the Members of both Houses have in this very important matter of housing.  Indeed, it emphasises the important place that the building of houses for our people must continue to have if we are to make any real impression on the bad housing which undoubtedly exists in far too many places at this moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of all this has been mentioned. When tackling housing, financing plays a very important role.  Lately it has seemed impossible to finance housing to the degree necessary.  We should not over-emphasise this aspect and we should not forget, in doing so, the great results achieved and the fantastic amount of money which the various governments and the Irish people have put into housing in a relatively short time.  We should not be too taken up with comparisons abroad.  Many of them can be misleading. While we should make note of them we should not be too ready to <Col N="665" /> accept them.  We should realise in this matter of housing that over the years we have made a very great effort.  We should have regard to comparisons with other countries without being too dogmatic about their application to our own efforts here.</P>
    <P>We should continue with the job of housing and do our utmost in the years ahead.  The magnitude of the job which has yet to be done cannot be over-emphasised.  For too long too many of us had the idea that the housing survey carried out some years ago, as a result of which the White Paper of 1948 was published, was the cause&mdash;although it was not intended to be&mdash;of misreading of the projections then made.  The projections were made for that particular time without any regard to projections for the years ahead.  This feeling undoubtedly still exists.  Unfortunately, there are many thousands of bad houses and there are many thousands of people who are still in very poor housing conditions.</P>
    <P>The projections of the more recent White Paper again are naturally subject to greater error than the White Paper of 1948 because in our more recent White Paper we have dealt not only with the needs as calculated at the time the calculations were made but also, which is much more difficult, with future needs from the point of view of the additional houses which will fall to be built, either as renewal of houses which had become obsolescent or as the result of growth in population and so forth.  We have tried to do this in our recent White Paper but as I say it is a much more difficult task to undertake and there can be a greater margin of error.  However, we feel it is a fair guide to the magnitude of the task before us and, if anything, it has probably clarified the situation in regard to house-building in a thriving community as opposed to a dying community.</P>
    <P>Housing in a thriving community can never be solved to the point where you can say: &ldquo;That is all we have to do.  We have everything done now.&rdquo; That can never happen unless you are dealing with a community which is dying.  We are not dealing with a dying community and, therefore, our <Col N="666" /> housing problem can never be said to be solved.  We can never look forward to the day when any Minister or any Government will be able to say: &ldquo;We have finished our housing programme. Our housing problem is now over and that chapter can be closed.&rdquo;  This can never be done.  It is a continuing problem and a continuing job.  It will require the combined efforts of the Dáil, the Seanad, the local county councils, the urban councils and so forth.  Everybody will be required to co-operate and to continue to cooperate. They will have to work to the utmost of their capacity to build houses for the people of Ireland whilst there remains one family who is badly housed.</P>
    <P>During the past four or five years, despite what has been said about the shortage of capital and despite what has been said about the credit squeeze, we have made great strides compared with the position we were in about eight or ten years ago.  The amount of money given has continually climbed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose if I were to say they have declined in the last few years the Senator would disagree with me.  We are trying to outline the situation that we have a lot to do.  We have done a lot but we should not be satisfied with what we have done.  We should not criticise too severely the manner in which the job has been done over recent years.  With regard to the proposals in this Bill, it is quite obvious that costs have increased in recent years.  The amount of capital provided by the Government and local authorities has risen in the past five years by as much as 80 per cent. House building has not risen by that percentage in the same period though there is a true upsurge in the input of capital during recent times.  This applies to this year despite the difficulties we have encountered, and it applied last year despite the difficulties we encountered then and will, so far as we can forecast at this stage, apply at least in like measure next year with always the hope that we <Col N="667" /> can increase the amount being put in.</P>
      <P>Some people now say, with the truly amazing clarity of mind which undoubtedly hindsight gives, that we should not have put in so much of our capital in these years because it has an upsetting effect particularly on the building industry.</P>
      <P>I am the first to admit that ups and downs in the building industry are to be avoided.  The urgency of building houses, particularly local authority and State financed houses, is of such importance that we must admit that whatever may be the repercussions we must at no time slacken but do our utmost in so far as our physical and financial resources will allow us to provide houses.  For that reason, I do not agree that we were unwise to put too much in too soon because we must continue to put in more money in the progressive way we did put it in in the five years up to the present year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing I think should be said at this stage is that while we have people living, as they are, four, five, six or eight in one house, and some more appalling cases we hear of people living in one room and of 15 to 20 people living in one small house, we must push on with building with the utmost urgency our circumstances will allow.  We have been doing that over the last five years, and if during the past year our expansion in the earlier years had an unsettling effect on the building industry I am extremely sorry because it does no good to the building industry that this should happen.  But the circumstances are such that I think priorities must be got right and all the families I spoke about must be housed, and there are far too many of them &mdash; they run into thousands&mdash;and we have got to go for what in my estimation is the more urgent matter and put all we have into it. Even though this may mean a slowing down, a levelling off, and a rather abrupt levelling off of an upward progression that was very evident for some time, this is the situation we have experienced in these recent months and it is one which, I say, we are justified in having happen because of the urgency of housing needs.  Nevertheless, <Col N="668" /> it is one which I deplore and regret and I shall, so far as it is within my power and the power of the Government, get on with the job of input in the upward direction again.  This I feel I can assure the House will be done so soon as it is possible for us financially to do it and it may not be all that long delayed.  It will not be so long delayed as some people think but possibly it may be a little longer than others have projected.  The time should not be too far removed when we can hope for a further injection of a greater amount of capital than we had available within the last 12 months into housing.</P>

      <P>The imput of capital by the Government and local authorities into public housing and local authority housing might occur to some people to have been restricted somewhat in order that we should not create or add to the boom in industry that grew up in recent years.  I should say that this would not have had all that effect on it for a great deal of the boom conditions were created by the local authorities unfortunate though it is to say it.</P>

      <P>Much more so by the private sector and they in turn were to some degree financed from taxation, and the Exchequer to quite a considerable degree, and to a much higher degree they were financed by other lending agencies.  Even if we had it then we could not have had that much effect on the conditions then in the building industry so far as <Col N="669" /> house building is concerned merely by rationing out the cash available.  We were pushing it out.</P>

It is an explanation to those who do not agree of the situation which has been criticised in that we put too much in in circumstances when we were not sure we could continue to do it at an accelerated rate. I feel we have to do it because of the urgency of the situation.  Even if we did control it was only to a small degree; the rest of it could have come from outside.  If we had curbed the local authorities by keeping back the finances we did make available in those years we would not have had the effect of having a balanced rational non-boom condition in the industry&mdash; not letting them go up too far and having a slow bump down.</P>

I am on record on many occasions as advocating and exhorting that more could come through because of the known need for houses.  I do not need to go further than to say we now have schemes and no money.  It is not that we have not any money.  It is not that we have no money but that we have not as much money as the schemes would absorb if we were to build them all at once.  There is a difference of £11 million between Senator Fitzgerald and myself.  It is a fair figure and we understand each other.  There is £11 million going into housing this year as distinct from nothing.</P>

      <P>If there is money it will work.  Money makes most things work.  Another matter about which there has been a lot of talk is covered in this Bill.  It is the question of rents. I have been blackguarded in a blunt way by a number of those who have contributed to the debate on the question of the intention of the Bill on the question of rents policy in the future. I have been misrepresented very much and very deliberately to the effect that the Minister for Local Government is putting up rents.  That is not the intention of the Bill.  It is not what has been stated by me at any time.  It is not what I have conveyed to the Dáil or Seanad. My anxiety in this respect is to rationalise the rents structure so that there will be more money more readily available <Col N="671" /> to build more houses more rapidly for more of our people who are so badly in need of them.</P>
      <P>There is no future for those who say that the intention of the Minister and the Bill is to put up rents.  What the Minister is trying to do is to get local authorities to look at their rents pattern to find out if there are in that pattern people paying too little rent who could afford to pay a proper rent and if, as a result of their paying too little, they do not help to provide local authorities with the additional wherewithal to build more houses for those who need them.  There should be no question about my outlook in regard to rents.  I should like to illustrate that further.  I have already done so but it did not get across.</P>
      <P>My outlook is that where a person can afford to pay it he should be asked for the full economic rent but that where a person cannot afford any rent he should not have to pay a rent.  This is the background in which I am asking local authorities to look at their rents policy.  If that policy is fair, I am satisfied but we are entitled to expect from local authorities an examination of the position in their respective areas as regards all houses now rented.  We all have an interest in those houses.  We all have contributed to them and we shall all continue in the future to contribute to the estates of local authorities.</P>
      <P>We are not asking from local authorities anything we are not entitled to ask.  We are doing this in the interests of those who have not yet got houses partly because of the inability of the local authorities to add to their rates burden.  All of us who are members of local authorities have a part to play here.  We must look on the rents policy as a possible source from which money additional to that being put up by the taxpayer and ratepayer will become available to build a few additional houses each year.  If this is done I do not mind being blamed for it.  What I resent is the outspoken condemnation on more than one occasion that the Minister for Local Government is putting up rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>They blame the <Col N="672" /> Custom House for everything.  It is a bit unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the Custom House that is being blamed and the Senator well knows it.  I should be allowed to finish.  I am not carping about criticism.  What I dislike is that from these charges an inference is to be drawn that nothing worthwhile will come of a rationalisation of the rents policy for the benefit of the community. I think there is something worthwhile in such a rationalisation and that is why I ask for it.  If I were merely to seek to be popular with rentpayers I should do what some of my colleagues do and vote for a reduction of rents, disregarding at the same time that rents will have to go up and disregarding the prospect that as rents go up the amounts made available from those rents which go up will go to the benefit of those who have not yet got houses. I do not fear misrepresentation except in so far as its effect on the progress of local authority housing is concerned.</P>
      <P>My concern is that each local authority should make a true appraisal of their rents position.  If there is nothing to be got out of such an appraisal, in fairness and justice to those already housed and to those not yet housed, then let the local authorities leave the rents alone.  On the other hand, if they find people paying low rents who could afford to pay more, the charging of the full economic rent in such cases would benefit those not yet housed.  If there are people paying too much, they should have their rents reduced.  It is the aim that those who can pay should pay in full and that those who can pay nothing should not be asked to pay anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of sales is another important item in the Bill.  Speaking earlier of the advantages of owner-occupation, my intention was to try to encourage it.  It may have a sort of selfish aspect from the local government point of view.  The efforts of individuals to own their own houses contribute to some degree to lessen the demand ultimately falling to be met by housing authorities.  Therefore, in a selfish sort of local government way, <Col N="673" /> owner-occupation is something we should all agree with.</P>
    <P>However, it has more far-reaching consequences and we cannot at any time be anything but helpful and as liberal as financial conditions allow us to those who undertake the building of houses, particularly by those who, if they were to sit back, could truly claim to be the responsibility of the local authorities.  Many thousands of such people have built their own houses.  It is true, at the same time, that many people who should have built their own houses have not, probably will not and are sitting waiting for the local authorities.  But those who have not and who could have sat and waited for the ratepayer and the taxpayer to do the job deserve commendation from all of us.  Any encouragement we can give them in whatever way possible, through the provisions of this Bill or otherwise, is something which is most desirable and commendable indeed.</P>
    <P>The selling of houses is one matter which we are dealing with in this Bill.  We are dealing with the sale of local authority houses and the methods by which they may be sold in the future.  One of the things we should keep quite clear in our minds is that, in the future, if local authority houses, the building of which was commenced after the 1st January last &mdash;and let nobody quip that they have not because they have&mdash;come up for sale which have in the meantime been vested, there is the arrangement that the value of the houses will be the price on vesting.  If there is a subsequent sale by the vested owner, a proportion of the price received for the house, in direct relationship to the number of years of annuity already paid off, must be paid back to the council.</P>
    <P>Even though there may have been much more favourable schemes in the past this is one in fairness and in justice to the public taxpayer and ratepayer and is something we must stand over, even though it may not prove as popular as the almost &ldquo;give away&rdquo; terms which we had in operation quite recently&mdash;indeed, are still in operation and will continue in operation at the option and demand <Col N="674" /> of the occupiers.  For, I think, six months after this Bill becomes law anybody who is living in a labourer's cottage, who has not opted to purchase up to now, may in the six months after the Bill becomes law, demand that he be given this right and whether it takes six months, a year or 18 months to get the sales scheme and the vesting scheme into operation, this is no loss to that particular person. He will have protected the rights which he at present enjoys under the old scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably what we will do.  The intention, of course, is that this option will be undoubtedly made known to those who have a right to opt.  In what way this will be done, it is not clear at the moment. To write to the manager to inform all those on his books is probably the way we will do it.  I do not know but we will try to do it.  In fact, it is in the Bill.  We have forgotten nearly what is in it, it is so long since we have been dealing with some of the matters.  However, that is covered in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without wearying the House any further talking on a number of these matters, all of which we have discussed in such detail that really to hear oneself talking about them is as boring as it must be to the listener, let me finish by expressing the hope that the Bill will be the vehicle whereby we can from now on deal more quickly with some of those who are in need of housing. If it requires amendment, if we have made mistakes in it, whether inadvertently or otherwise, I certainly shall try to amend it in double quick time if this seems desirable and, overall, to say again I have great belief in the worth of this Bill.  It may be big but, at the same time, it wipes out so <Col N="675" /> many of the old enactments we had to the benefit of the legal people who can understand it and I think most of them will understand it, although there are doubts.  Nevertheless, this is a Bill which does away with the many obstacles which existed by way of knowing what all the housing legislation was about spread over a number of years, amendments and so forth. Big though it is, it is an advantage I think, from the legal point of view and from the point of view of the public and what it, in fact, means in as near ordinary language as is possible.  This is something I have been giving thought to.  I think Senator O'Quigley, who mentioned this particular point, will agree and probably already appreciates that to do this is not at all simple because we cannot, obviously, hope to put in easily understood language the intentions which it took many of our legal people many, many long hours to understand in legal language.  We cannot hope to untangle all that again in a form which would probably be three or four times the length of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if there are any suggestions about how we might simplify this; to whom we might refer particular parts of the Bill and thereby reduce the size of circular that we might need to get across what is contained in it, I would be glad to hear of them.  It is terribly easy to say that it is hoped we will do this.  To get it done is not a simple matter at all but we will try and it is something I have been quite conscious of all along in regard to this legislation and, indeed, other sizeable legislation we have tried to have understood by as many of the people concerned in housing and related matters as is possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>One suggestion I might make there is that where any member of the public or a member of a local authority wants to ascertain what the position is that if he writes to the Department of Local Government or to the appropriate local authority that the local authority will inform him of his position on the information then available.</P>

When I asked for suggestions here I really meant that if there are any suggestions about simplification of the difficulties with regard to circularisation from any part of the House, I will be very glad to have them after we have concluded this, in your own time and in your own way.</P>
      <P>With that, again, I think the enactment of this Bill is a tribute to all in this House and in the other House as much as it might be a tribute to a Minister for Local Government and his Department.  I thank both Houses for their co-operation in getting it this far.</P>

      <P>We were discussing the question of an appeals tribunal or an appeals mechanism of some kind when we adjourned the last day.  Now, the Minister has been at pains in both Houses to put forward the contention that the absence of an appeals tribunal or an appeals mechanism, outside the Department of Social Welfare, is something which is innocuous and does no harm, and moreover had the support of the minority report of the Commission and the trade union representatives in particular. For example, in the Dáil, as <Col N="678" /> reported at column 1080, volume 220 of the Official Report he said:</P>
      <P>Under the existing Acts, decisions are made by deciding officers and appeals go to appeals officers.  We are proposing to extend those provisions to occupational injuries.</P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
      <P>I think it is relevant to say here that the minority of the commission were in favour of this type of machinery. After all, among those who signed the minority report were three members of the commission who could reasonably be regarded as representing the workers' viewpoints specifically.  In paragraph 17 of the minority report of the commission, it is stated that administration would be by the same machinery as in the case of other social welfare benefits &mdash;by deciding officers and appeals officers.  This system is flexible, the report says, and has worked to the complete satisfaction of the injured population&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I am not quite sure what is meant by &ldquo;the injured population&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;since it was introduced in 1952.</P>
      <P>When the Minister came into the Seanad he told us something similar. As reported in volume 61, at column 611 of the Official Report, he said:</P>
      <P>I am entitled to refer to the view expressed in the Minority Report of the Commission which studied this matter and which consisted to a large extent of workers' representatives. They were of the opinion, as they said in paragraph 17 of the Report, that the administration of the social insurance scheme recommended by them would be by the same machinery as in the case of other social welfare benefits by way of deciding officers and appeals officers.</P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While, as I said, the minority of the Commission stated in their report that this system had worked quite satisfactorily, they did in the <Col N="679" /> scheme which they eventually submitted make provision for local appeals tribunals.  However, in view of what they have said, it appears to me that what they had in mind was that assessors such as are connected with unemployment benefit appeals might be appointed to assist appeals officers and there is already provision whereby that can be done.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from this, and indeed from the debate we had here on Committee Stage on the last day, that the Minister was purporting to convince both Houses of the Oireachtas that the Minority Report of the commission was against any appeal outside the Department of Social Welfare, except for the possibility of a provision for local appeals tribunals.</P>
    <P>I had occasion in this debate to take the Minister up on an equally misleading statement which he made about the Majority Report.  As reported at column 292, volume 219, of the Official Report he said:</P>
    <P>I should say that the difficulties in arriving at an equitable determination of earnings under the existing workmen's compensation scheme led the majority of the commission to recommend flat rate benefits instead.</P>
    <P>That was precisely the opposite to the truth, as the Minister himself admitted later in this House when he said, as reported at volume 61, column 339 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>What I intended to say was that there was this difficulty in arriving at pre-accident earnings which led the Commission to seriously consider it but they did, in fact, recommend wage relationship.</P>
    <P>The Minister, therefore, did not read the Majority Report&mdash;at least, he told us he read it twice and I do not doubt his word, but he did not take it in, any more than he took in the Minority Report, if he tells the Dáil and the Seanad that the Minority Report recommended in favour of limiting appeals to the Department of Social Welfare or to local appeals tribunals, and that the Minority Report was against appeals to a judge of the Circuit <Col N="680" /> Court, or whatever the appropriate court might be.  This, of course, is simply not true despite the Minister's repeated statements in the Dáil and Seanad.  It is the precise opposite to the truth.  He told us he read the report twice but he did not take it in, because he attributed to the Minority Report precisely the opposite view to the view they expressed which they went to the trouble to print in capital letters in the middle of the page to make sure that the Minister and people like him would see it.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 20 of the Minority Report states:</P>
    <P>We recommend, therefore, that the existing system of workmen's compensation be abolished and replaced by the Social Insurance Occupational Injuries Scheme set out in Annexe 1 to Appendix XIII of this report....</P>
    <P>That is the recommendation of the Minority Report, not an <i>obiter dictum</i> taken out of context by the Minister and attributed to the Minority Report when, in fact, their view is the exact opposite.  When we turn to Annexe 1 to Appendix XIII of the report we find that it is stated in paragraph 15:</P>
    <P>Determination of Claims.&mdash;All claims to benefit will in the first instance be dealt with by an Insurance Officer of the Department of Social Welfare on an application by or on behalf of a workman, or, in fatal cases, by or on behalf of the workman's dependant(s).  Should the Insurance Officer decide against the claim, the claimant will have a right of appeal to the Local Appeal Tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Minister implied in his speech that that was the only appeal which the trade union members of the Minority Report sought.  The paragraph continues:</P>
    <P>This Tribunal will consist of one or more members chosen to represent employers with an equal number of members chosen to represent insured persons and a Chairman appointed by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>So far, so good.  Apparently the Minister did not read on to the next <Col N="681" /> sentence or perhaps the capital letters were too big for him to take them in. It is stated in capital letters:</P>
    <P>APPEALS WILL LIE FROM THE DECISION OF THE LOCAL TRIBUNAL TO A JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT SITTING AS A COMMISSIONER.</P>
    <P>It is completely unsatisfactory for a Minister to come to both Houses and make misleading statements.  He says that he wants to reject the Majority Report and to take the Minority Report.  Fair enough.  But in fact he wants to reject both reports. He should tell the Dáil and Seanad truthfully and openly what he thinks about any commission, any trade union, or anything else.  He said that the minority of the commission were in favour of this type of machinery, that the system was flexible and had worked to the complete satisfaction of the insured population.</P>
    <P>For the Minister to quote this remark out of context without reading on and telling the Houses what was recommended, and to give the Houses a misleading impression&mdash;because all Deputies and Senators might not read through the 357 pages of the report &mdash;is below the minimum standard of ministerial integrity which we expect in this House and in the other House.</P>
    <P>The members of the commission, both the majority and the minority, are entitled to better treatment than this, together with perfunctory thanks which the Minister gave them.  His assurance that he read the report twice rings hollow when he says the Majority Report recommended in favour of flat rate benefits when they specifically recommended the opposite, and when he says that the minority rejected an appeal to a Circuit Court judge when they specifically made that recommendation.</P>
    <P>How can we rely on anything the Minister tells us when he will misquote for his own purpose what the Minority and the Majority reports have stated? I think that the House must seriously consider its position in this matter.  We have here this question of an appeal which is supported by the majority of the Commission, who want the existing <Col N="682" /> system retained.  It is supported by the minority who want it abolished, it is supported by an official of the Minister's own Department who signed the Minority Report, by the Trade Union Congress which supported the Minority Report, and it is supported by two members of his own front bench.  On the Second Stage Senator E. Ryan and Senator O'Kennedy both told the Minister that he ought to have an appeal to the courts.  The Minister has accused me of arrogance.  Fair enough, but now the Minister in his arrogance believes that he knows better than the Minority or the Majority, the Trade Union Congress, his own official and his own front bench, and will go against the lot of them to prevent a workman having an appeal to the court.  The Minister ought at this stage to realise that in all that he has said in this House he has failed to make any case for such an attempt to take away the elementary rights of the workman.  We are entitled to require from him that he should give further consideration to this matter.</P>
    <P>In the light of what has been said, the Minister ought to tell us at this stage that he admits he is in error, perhaps a genuine error&mdash;he may not have read the scheme attached to the report, or having read it may have forgotten it or somebody may not have been competent to interpret it.  He may have some excuse of that kind, but whatever the reason the Minister should at this stage withdraw from the position he has got himself into and admit that this matter should be further considered.</P>
    <P>I ask him to give further consideration to this and to tell us at least that he will consider it further and having read the reports of the Commission more fully and considered the recommendations, he will come back to us on the Report Stage and give a considered view that he does not appear to have had so far, giving it the deep consideration it should have got.  It has never been considered adequately because both Houses were misled, inadvertently or otherwise, about the recommendations of the Commission.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will tell us <Col N="683" /> that he has made a genuine mistake, which could happen to anyone, and that he is prepared to reconsider the position and come back on the Report Stage with a reasonable amendment to meet the wishes of both the Majority and the Minority reports, of the Trade Union Congress, of his own Department as expressed by the Departmental official, of every official and of members of his own front bench who spoke in the Second Reading debate.</P>

      <P>The least persuasive thing might be that the Fine Gael Party should support it, but he might even take that into consideration, too.  I hope that he will consider it seriously in the light of this possibly genuine mistake, review his position and come back on the Report Stage with an amendment that will meet the case that has been so well made from both sides of the House. This is very much a case of having second thoughts and is an instance of where the Seanad can fulfil a useful function in drawing the attention of the Minister to something which has been overlooked in the other House and which needs further consideration. If this House has a function, it is in a case like this where both sides appeal to the Minister to reconsider something which, whether through a misunderstanding or possibly an error, has led the Minister to fall into the position of giving an assurance to both Houses not in accordance with the facts, perhaps through inadequately reading the Minority Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be appropriate for me to inquire into what happened at meetings of the Fianna Fáil Party when this was considered, but I think this is a matter which members of that Party would want to consider as to whether they were told what the Minority Report said or whether once again a misunderstanding occurred there and they were misinformed and may perhaps have taken a decision contrary to the facts.  If so, this is a further <Col N="684" /> reason for the Minister reconsidering the matter even for the benefit of his own supporters.  I appeal to him to do so and to admit that there is an error which requires further consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald has referred to my attitude on the Second Stage of this Bill.  He has quoted authorities to support his own viewpoint.  I must say that I was never under the impression that we were being misled by what the Minister said.  Senator FitzGerald may have gone far beyond the bounds of what he was entitled to say, but on the evidence the Minister put before us here certainly I was not misled in the House or at any meeting of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>Having said so much, I feel obliged to say that I still feel that the opinions I expressed on the Second Stage of this Bill are ones I would still readily commend to the House.  I say this with some reluctance.  I have heard the Minister repeat here on occasions that he cannot find himself in a position to accept any of the amendments that have been put down by the Labour Party or by the Fine Gael Party. To be quite brief, I do feel quite sincerely that it is in the interests of workmen that there should be an appeal from the decision of a deciding officer or an appeals officer to the court.  I feel that this particularly applies in cases where one might be asked to consider whether or not the accident arose out of or in the course of the employment.  The Minister has made the point here&mdash;I think it is a reasonably valid one&mdash;that this is an extension of the social welfare code and that to that extent the machinery already in use under this code should cover this extension.  I would agree with him except in so far as the consideration of a workman's claim is going to involve an issue which I feel could never have arisen under the existing social welfare code, that is, whether or not the accident arose out of or in the course of the employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as that new element is introduced in the Bill, while I would accept with some reluctance that the existing machinery can deal with every other aspect of this both as to medical <Col N="685" /> considerations and other matters, I feel that when the question arises of considering whether or not the workman is entitled to benefit because the accident arose in the course of his employment, that is something that if it is decided in the first instance by an appeals officer or a deciding officer I would press the Minister to consider strongly that an appeal should lie to a tribunal or to the court.  In this case the court would appear to be the more appropriate body.</P>
    <P>I have looked up the amendments of both Senator Miss Davidson and Senator Murphy and of the Fine Gael Party.  Taking the amendment in the names of Senator FitzGerald and O'Quigley first, their amendment would appear to go more or less along the same lines as I suggest with this exception, that their amendment says that &ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or the Principal Act, an appeal shall lie to an Appeal Tribunal in respect of entitlement to, and the amount of, benefit payable under this Act.&rdquo;  I would go with them in the first instance, that an appeal should lie in respect of entitlement to, in so far as the question that would be considered there is whether or not there was an accident arising out of or in the course of the employment, but I do not think it is quite necessary that an Appeal Tribunal or a judge as the case might be would have to consider the amount.  This is a matter that the deciding officer or Appeals Officer in the first instance could readily decide on.  I would imagine that any dispute that would arise would not arise as to the amount.  This would be determined at an early stage, but the other matter could arise.</P>
    <P>I do not quite follow the procedure which Senator Miss Davidson and Senator Murphy would suggest, but I think again that they suggest that there should be an appeal from an Appeals Officer or a deciding officer.  To that extent I would suggest that the original basis would meet the needs of the case.  I would urge the Minister to reconsider that aspect of the matter.</P>

      <P>I had just concluded on this matter.  As I say, I hope the suggestion I made might find itself commendable to the Minister. If he were prepared to consider it it might meet in a large measure the major content of the amendments put down by Senators Garret FitzGerald and O'Quigley and Senators Murphy and Miss Davidson.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping the Minister might give some indication as to what his mind is with regard to the matters raised by Senator Garret FitzGerald and Senator O'Kennedy on those particular amendments.  I must say on the occasion on which we were last debating those particular amendments in the Seanad I was somewhat taken aback to find that the Appeals Officer sat with assessors who are also appointed from time to time by the Minister.  When Senator Honan was speaking I thought that he was talking about the old age pensions committees and that in fact he had never sat on the appeals tribunal as an assessor under section 44 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.</P>
      <P>I find it somewhat alarming to think that we have really got to the position in which you have persons adjudicating on things who are not civil servants but who may, in fact, be politicians.  I say this, with all respect to Senator Honan, for whom I have the liveliest feelings of respect but I think it is undesirable that the entitlement of a citizen of this State should be decided by a tribunal which can be composed of the politicians of one party.  I do not say that has happened but certainly it can happen. We all know in small towns in rural Ireland the way party political organisations work, that the political views of most people are known.  We also know that if people make representations to their party politicians that those eventually find their way to the appropriate quarter, whether Ministers, Deputies or Senators.  I say this without any regard to what Senator Honan has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am merely talking about principle here.  It is a very bad principle that the entitlement of a workman to compensation under this Bill should be <Col N="687" /> determined by a tribunal presided over by a civil servant who is a servant of the Minister, who acts under the Minister, who depends for his future promotion on the Minister and on the impression he creates on the Minister.  In fact, he is a person who has no real independence.  The authority of the Appeals Officer is further reduced by having the assessors appointed by the Minister.  Those people can be solely members of a political party.  That, to my mind, is not an independent tribunal.  I thought it was a bad enough situation that the appeal should be to an Appeals Officer who was the anonymous, faceless civil servant nominated by the Minister for Social Welfare to be an Appeals Officer but when you add to that that an Appeals Officer may be watched over by the unscrupulous politician who is on the board as an assessor.  I think we have got to the stage where we are open to all classes of political corruption.  That is a hopeless substitute for the sturdy independence of the Circuit Court judges, who up to now have tried the small number of cases, let it be said again, where employers have not paid their employees the workmen's compensation they were entitled to.  It is a very shoddy substitute to offer in the form of an Appeals Officer with assessors.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to compensate and no substitute provided in this Bill for the right of appeal which a workman has under the present workmen's compensation code to the Supreme Court. Let there be no mistake whatever about it and let the Members of this House enact this Bill in the full knowledge of what they are doing. They are removing the right of appeal, the right of a workman who has been injured and who may appear to some people to be a malingerer, who may seem to have workmen's compensationitis but who has often turned out in the passage of time to have had a very genuine complaint.  We have all seen that kind of thing.  A workman's right will be determined by an Appeals Officer appointed by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> That is what we are substituting for the Circuit Court and for the ultimate appeal to the Supreme Court.  The Minister for Social Welfare obviously does not think very highly of the right of appeal, the particular right of appeal provided under the present social welfare legislation.</P>
    <P>I have here two documents, one &ldquo;A Guide to the Social Services&rdquo;, published in 1963, 12th edition.  The second is a genuine Department of Social Welfare publication, 1966, bang up to date, entitled &ldquo;A Summary of Social Insurance and Assistance Services.&rdquo;  I have looked through the index in the first document&mdash;&ldquo;A Guide to the Social Services&rdquo;.  You will not find any right of appeal provided in that or any mention in it that under the social welfare code a person is entitled to sickness benefit, or widows' and orphans' pensions, or that he has the right of appeal to an Appeals Officer. That is not provided in this document. The Minister for Social Welfare may well say that that document is not published under the aegis of his Department. It is one of those anonymous productions dated November 1963 and is published by the Stationery Office, but who prepared it is not disclosed in the publication.  The Minister may say that he has no responsibility for that.</P>
    <P>We turn to the other document produced, evidently, by the Department of Social Welfare.  There is nothing in this document indicating that a person who disputes the decision of a deciding officer under the social welfare code has a right of appeal.</P>
    <P>I am bound to ask why is it that in those two publications these legal rights are not set out for the intended beneficiaries under the social welfare code.  Why is that?  I have come to the conclusion, and I infer from all that has been said here in the Minister's statement in regard to the recommendations of the persons who signed the minority report, that the Minister for Social Welfare is not fully alive to the serious implications involved for workmen and others who are using the right of appeal under this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> A right of appeal, to my mind, is extremely important and I do not think any citizen should have to go through the rigmorole of going to Deputies and Senators and getting them to make representations on a matter which he, setting out the full facts, is entitled to have argued directly to an appeals tribunal.  They will not find in these documents that they have that statutory right under the social welfare code.  The fact is that it is not highlighted.  It is the ultimate thing that matters to the people who are refused a particular benefit under the social welfare code and the fact that that is not highlighted fills me with alarm.  It is absolutely essential that there should be a right of appeal under this Bill and that that appeal should be to a person who is completely independent of the Minister for Social Welfare, or the Department of Social Welfare and Deputies and Senators of all Parties, and who will decide on the facts as presented to him sitting on a tribunal.</P>
    <P>I should like to refresh Senators' memories, without repetition, on the point I made earlier that this Bill creates no problems for lawyers&mdash;that it will increase their incomes.  I do not argue from the standpoint of a representative of a body who will lose money by the enactment of the Bill and for that reason I wish to make it perfectly clear that Senator FitzGerald and myself in the amendment have suggested that this form of appeal will be the least possible expensive type of appeal.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will recollect that in the Succession Bill, which we debated at considerable length, we made provision for appeals to the courts and we had the assurance of the Minister for Justice that appeals in chambers were the most expeditious and least costly.  In paragraph (c) of the amendment we provide that appeals shall be held in chambers and shall not be subject to further appeal or to any other tribunal, court or person. We are transferring to this section a provision of the Succession Bill involving the kind of appeal the Minister for Justice described as the least expensive and the most expeditious.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why, in the light of the <Col N="690" /> complicated provisions to which I have referred and to which Senator O'Kennedy referred, it can be argued that the workman, whose well-being and welfare should be the dominant consideration in a matter of this kind, the amendment cannot be accepted. From my experience, I have no doubt that it is essential in the interest of workmen that there should be an appeal to an independent appeals tribunal presided over by some judicial person.  The Minister can take his choice&mdash;district justice or Supreme Court judge.  We must have the independence with which these members of the Judiciary are endowed and with which they can act.</P>
    <P>That is the important thing from the point of view of the workman.  The Minister for Local Government made a general confession here this afternoon and I make not a general confession but a confession that at the time I drafted and submitted this amendment with Senator FitzGerald I was not aware there was a provision in the Minority Report containing a recommendation of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that there should be an appeal from the decision of a local tribunal to a judge of the Circuit Court sitting as a commissioner.  On the Second Stage I said that eminent Fianna Fáil solicitors in the country had asked: &ldquo;How in God's name did the trade unions allow the Bill to go through&rdquo;?  The Trade Union Congress emphasised that the interests of workmen would be best served by a final appeal to a judge of the Circuit Court, sitting as a commissioner.  That, in substance&mdash;it is a coincidence because I was not aware of that recommendation at the time&mdash;has been translated into our amendment.  We cannot all be wrong.  The Minister's front bench cannot be wrong, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions cannot be wrong, the minority report cannot be wrong and all the Senators on this side cannot be wrong and only the Minister right.</P>

      <P>On Senator O'Quigley's comments on these appeals boards, I should like to make it clear that I was not appointed by the Minister.  The <Col N="691" /> Minister and his Department asked the Ennis Chamber of Commerce to suggest three names of people who would be prepared to act on the boards.  I understand the Minister made a similar request to the labour bodies in Ennis.  I was called in infrequently, other members being called in turn.  The Minister accepted my name as one of the three sent in by the Ennis Chamber of Commerce.  We do not sit as assessors.  We act to hold a watching brief on behalf of persons whose appeals are being considered. It is expected of us that we see the Appeals Officer goes about his business in an impartial way so that justice is done to the appellants.  I should like to be clear on that point&mdash;I was not appointed by the Minister.  My name was suggested by the Ennis Chamber of Commerce and I do not consider myself as being on the board as an assessor.</P>

The interpretation I place on what has been said is that because these people will not have legal qualifications they will not be able to view the matter properly.  It was unworthily suggested that because they are civil servants they will be subject to some pressure from the Minister.  That suggestion is contemptible.  The Minister will not have any interest in trying to ensure that workers will not get the compensation to which they are entitled. If that were my approach, if my <Col N="692" /> interest were not in trying to ensure that the maximum amount possible was provided for injured workmen out of employers' contributions, I would have taken the easy way out and accepted the figure submitted by the majority report&mdash;a maximum of £7 a week compensation.</P>

      <P>It was submitted to me in 1962.  I could have accepted that but because I was anxious that the maximum possible compensation would be obtainable by injured workmen I opted for the scheme which would enable the much more substantial benefits being provided in the Bill to be paid.  Senator Miss Davidson pointed out that under the present social welfare Acts Appeals Officers far from being antagonistic to workmen, are helpful to them.  A number of other Senators agreed with that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I am entitled to say, therefore, that there is every reason to believe that the approach of the Appeals Officers will be to try to see that a just decision is arrived at.  I completely reject these allegations that they will be actuated by a desire to save the fund at all costs, just as I reject the allegation that the Minister will have any such interest in doing that and that his interest in protecting the fund will be so strong as to make him exert this pressure by way of withholding promotion from Appeals Officers who behave in a just way.  The fact of the matter is these Appeals Officers will be experts on this subject, with a comprehensive and specialist knowledge of social welfare matters generally and, unlike judges, who are quite likely to have only a cursory personal knowledge of social welfare matters and whose decisions will depend, to a large extent, on the manner in which the case is presented to them, the approach of the Appeals Officer will be to try to get at the facts <Col N="693" /> and not to sit in judgment on a contest between two sides.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise also that, unlike the present system of which some Senators are so enamoured, under the system I propose, there will be nobody there for the specific purpose of trying to break the claimant's case down. Compensation will no longer be a question of the liability of the employer, against which he will normally insure with a private insurance company, so there will be nobody then with a vested interest in trying to deprive the injured workman of compensation. There will be nobody there who will be paid to use his skill and legal training to try to see that compensation will not, in fact, be paid.  The aim of Appeals Officers and, indeed, of Deciding Officers also will be purely and simply to ascertain the facts.  They will be as much concerned to see that the benefit is paid if it is due as they will be to see that it is not paid if it is not due.  There will be no question of taking advantage of any weakness in the pleading of the case on behalf of the appellant, but the Appeals Officers and Deciding Officers will seek after facts which may appear not to be adequately presented to them.</P>
    <P>It is justifiable for me to say also that disputes will hinge mainly on the question of incapacity or degree of incapacity. The Accident Offices Association on page 34 of the Report, paragraph 100, informs the Commission that the cases involving dispute, under the existing Acts, almost invariably rested on the question of incapacity. Under the existing system these matters have to be decided by judges who themselves are not qualified to decide these matters but who have to decide on the evidence of experts acting for the two parties in the dispute.  While Senators argue that an appeal from one civil servant to another is in fact, no appeal, the same thing can be said in regard to an appeal from one court to another.  Despite the infallibility which Senators are attempting to attach to decisions made by judges, we have the fact that there are many cases of reversals of decisions given in a lower court, so I cannot see how it can be argued that a workman is more likely to get a favourable decision from the <Col N="694" /> courts than from these Appeals Officers and Deciding Officers which I propose, who will be experts on the subject with which they are dealing and will not have any personal interest in ensuring that compensation will not be paid.  It should be accepted then that they will be at least equally competent to deal with these matters, particularly since they will be specialists in these matters.</P>
    <P>I want to make a reference to something in the Majority Report and, in case there should be a further misunderstanding about it, I might as well emphasise at the start that this is something which is stated in the Majority Report not as the definite opinion of the Majority.  Where arguments were being given about systems of adjudication it said:</P>
    <P>....it can be argued that the ordinary courts are already overburdened with work, that there are normally no legal costs in administrative proceedings where the litigant is usually represented by a trade union official, and that matters which involve a public service are best administered by specialists in that service.</P>
    <P>It is true that, having adverted to that argument, the majority did not, in fact, accept it.  They went on to recommend the continuance of the present system but the minority, which as I said included the workers' representatives, did opt for such a system and it is admitted that that argument is there.  Unlike the majority of the Commission, I believe that is the more correct view to take of the matter.</P>

      <P>It is my opinion that it is preferable from the workers point of view that these matters should be decided by people who are specialists in the particular field, particularly <Col N="695" /> when, as I have shown and as I think should be obvious to anybody, they will not, in fact, have any interest in seeing that compensation is not paid and when their only approach will be to see that justice is done.</P>
      <P>There is an assumption by some Senators here that the reference of a dispute to a court will automatically ensure that the person obtains his rights.  I do not think that is automatic at all.  Senators who are members of the legal profession appear to have this genuine belief that anybody who has been to the courts to obtain what he believes to be his rights is satisfied with whatever verdict he receives.</P>

      <P>But most Members of this House who are not members of the legal profession will have the opinion that adverse decisions are not made any more acceptable to the people who receive them merely because of the fact that they were obtained in court, and probably at some cost to the person concerned.  It is true to say that the obtaining of one's rights through court procedure depends to a large degree on the skill, knowledge and degree of zealousness on the part of the legal team which is appearing for the person concerned.</P>
      <P>I could quote a decision where a claim to workmen's compensation was dismissed because neither the court nor counsel acting for the claimant was aware of the law applying to the particular case in question.  It was the case of an Irish seaman on a British ship, and it was only when the claimant's solicitor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was only when the claimant's solicitor was unofficially informed by my Department&mdash;after these Dáil questions by Deputy Kyne and arising out of these Dáil questions &mdash;as to the errors which were made by the court that he was able to initiate an appeal to the Supreme Court.  If it were not for the fact that the employer had not completed the formalities which were required by the Circuit Court ruling, the time for an appeal would have expired and he would have had no redress whatsoever. It was purely and simply because of the fact that the existence of a reciprocal agreement in this matter was not brought to the notice of the court. I have said it was because the court was not aware of it.  I do not know. Perhaps the judge was aware of this fact but did not feel entitled to advert to it because his attention was not drawn to it in court.  I do not know, but I do know it was because it was not adverted to in the court that this seaman was deprived of his compensation for a considerable time.  He eventually succeeded in obtaining it, after appeal to the Supreme Court, only because of the fact that my Department brought the matter to the notice of the solicitor and because the formalities had not been completed by the employer.  That type of case would not arise under the system I propose, because the Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers will have expert knowledge of the subject with which they are dealing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Miss Davidson felt that notwithstanding the responsible attitude of the Appeals Officers they would not be capable of taking a wide view of the case of a workman who had been injured.  She said it could happen that an injury suffered might not in itself be serious but the Appeals Officer would not be in a position to realise what the ensuing years might bring to the injured party.  In circumstances such as this a decision on appeal, whether decided by an Appeals Officer or anyone else, must largely depend on the medical evidence. This medical evidence will be <Col N="697" /> available in the fullest measure to the Appeals Officers.  I do not think it can be reasonably argued that Appeals Officers, who may be assisted by assessors if the need arises, are any less qualified to decide on the medical evidence than a person with legal qualifications assisted by representatives of the employer and the worker as envisaged in this amendment which is before us at present.  These Appeals Officers have considerable experience of this type of thing.</P>
    <P>A further important matter to remember in this connection is that under this scheme, unlike the present workmen's compensation system where liability may be terminated once and for all by a lump sum, a case, in so far as the degree of incapacity is concerned, is never finally closed.  The workman can reopen his claim, or seek an increase in the rate of payment awarded to him, if his health deteriorates as a result of the accident.</P>
    <P>References which I made to the views expressed by the Minority of the Commission were first of all brushed aside as of no value by Fine Gael Senators, and later it was claimed that they did not, in fact, express these views at all.</P>

      <P>I have not got the exact quotation, but if Senator FitzGerald likes to look it up, in their dealing with the administration of a different type of scheme, a social insurance scheme of flat or graduated benefits administered by a State sponsored body, the majority considered whether the initial handling of claims should be carried out by the Department of Social Welfare, leaving to the body itself the function of dealing with appeals against decisions on claims made to the Department.  They concluded with this statement:</P>
      <P>In this connection it is suggested that the existing machinery of the Department of Social Welfare for handling disputes and appeals works smoothly and that it could undertake work of the kind mentioned in an equally satisfactory manner without the intervention of a State-sponsored body.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that the majority recommended this system, but I do suggest that they have not got the low opinion of it which Senators here suggest that they have.</P>
      <P>We had, of course, the statement that whatever about the workers' representatives on this Commission the practising politicians did not have the same view of the appeals machinery of the Department of Social Welfare.  I quite appreciate, as a politician myself, that there are a number of politicians to whom the only satisfactory type of appeals machinery would be machinery which would uphold appeals recommended by the particular politician himself. I find that in many cases politicians are quite satisfied with appeals which are decided in favour of people on whose behalf they made representations while they are dissatisfied with those cases in which adverse decisions are given, but I do not believe that they would be any more satisfied if these adverse decisions were to be made by a judge, either in open court or in chambers, as has been suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have pointed out already, we <Col N="701" /> are entitled to assume that the vast majority of disputes arising in this connection hinge on the question of incapacity or degrees of incapacity.  I feel sure that the number of cases arising from the interpretation of the clause &ldquo;arising out of or in the course of the employment&rdquo; will be even less in future than at present because of the widening of this definition in this Bill.  However I think that it is this type of disagreement which is mainly worrying Senators, and that is, the question of the interpretation of whether or not the injury comes within the scope of that clause. While I think that these cases will be infrequent I cannot, of course, say that no such cases will arise, so I am prepared to consider between now and the Report Stage of the Bill an amendment permitting recourse to the courts on a question of law which may arise in determining whether the accident arose out of and in the course of the employment.  But I remain convinced that the system proposed is adequate for the normal type of appeal and that it will be as satisfactory as any system of appeals could be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to see that we are not always wrong all the way all the time and that the Minister has now as a result of the discussion and the debate made some concession to what has been said in the course of the debate on this amendment.  Anybody who looks at section 4 straight away and who looks at section 3 as to what are employments and what are accepted employments and so on must immediately see that there will be clear cases within the code and clear cases outside it, but then there will be the borderline cases where it would take quite a deal of legal knowledge, which I think the Minister would concede is necessary, to determine these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remain unconvinced by anything that the Minister has said that even this measure that he proposes to concede is sufficient, because what we are talking about here is not the capacity of trained officials of the Department of Social Welfare to assess various things.  What we are talking about is <Col N="702" /> their independence, their absolute and utter independence of whether they take a series of decisions which may result in a particular type of situation which might or might not be displeasing to the Minister.  The person who decides these things finally and creates the precedent should be entitled to do that without having any regard whatever to what the departmental or Ministerial repercussions to those decisions are going to be.  This kind of independence you get from a judge or an independent tribunal, but this kind of independence you cannot be sure of getting from an Appeals Officer who may say &ldquo;Well, the Minister said so and so in the course of the debate and I feel that perhaps it might not be the right thing to do.  This was not what was intended&rdquo;, though he might come to the conclusion that that was what the law says.</P>
    <P>I have a recollection, and I am sure the Minister will know the case, of a matter that went to the Supreme Court where one of the Minister's Appeals Officers, when he was dealing with the case before him, instead of deciding on the evidence before him produced a letter from the Department of Finance and said &ldquo;I have a letter here which says that you are insurable and I am bound by the letter of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;  Of course, the Supreme Court had a lot of things to say about that.  That was an application by an Appeals Officer of his statutory responsibilities and duties, and that is the kind of thing that one is always likely to find where you have a civil servant who has not got that breadth of view and wide experience of members of the Judiciary, who are one day dealing with criminals and the next day with people on the Chancery side, and the next with people who are disputing a right of way, and with all the knowledge of human nature in all its varieties coming before them, upon oath. They are well able to decide who is genuine and who is not.  That is the great advantage of the judge of the Supreme Court or the Circuit Court, and, indeed, of our juries where you have 12 men in the ordinary course making up their minds on what is the likelihood of the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> The Minister thinks that one swallow makes a summer and tells us of the court case&mdash;I am very glad he did&mdash;where Deputy Kyne brought to his attention that perhaps one junior Minister and inexperienced judge &mdash; I would love to know the names&mdash;overlooked a particular convention.  That is uncommon, let it be said straight away, and the fact that that kind of thing happens does not invalidate in the slightest degree all the arguments made here in favour of an independent tribunal.  Equally I could say that some of the Minister's Appeals Officers are rogues and knaves, because I know of a case where an Appeals Officer decided two cases in Mayo &mdash; the solicitor who told me this was not a member of the Fine Gael Party&mdash; against two appellants on medical evidence that he had never heard.  He heard neither of the two doctors on behalf of the fellows who were making the appeal.  It was the same solicitor who asked me why we and the trade unions were letting this Act through. That was wrong.  I say that the Appeals Officers in the Department of Social Welfare are unfit for the purpose. That does not mean that the Appeals Officers are in dereliction of their duty as the Minister tries to suggest the courts have been incompetent and unqualified because he portrays one case out of thousands.</P>
    <P>The truth of the matter is that many workmen's compensation cases were decided, I am glad to say, in favour of the workmen because judges took the broader view from their knowledge not alone of workmen's compensation cases but of a wide variety of cases which come before them from time to time. I know the Department of Social Welfare have people with different kinds of complaints and they are treated in that impersonal way.  It has been said that the system is inflexible and impersonal and has worked to the complete satisfaction of the injured population since it was introduced.  They will get that all right.  They will just be a name on the top of a form with a specified injury and that will be all.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to entrust the <Col N="704" /> wellbeing and the livelihood of any workman in this country finally to the determination of a person in that category. Indeed, in a publication of the Minister, of 1960, with regard to social welfare injuries, it says, on page 28, that the Circuit Court is the sole authority for determining disputes.  That is not the fact.  The Supreme Court is the authority for finally determining them and the Circuit Court could not, therefore, be said to be the sole authority. Although the Minister says he will introduce an amendment to enable determination as to whether a man was injured arising out of, or in the course of his employment, I do not feel the slightest bit happier for the half loaf he is giving.  There are some people who are neurosthenic and some people will say that they should work.  There are those who feel that those people should not get compensation but the courts have come to the aid of those people and said that neurosthenia is as much a disease as a stiff knee.  They are given compensation.  I am quite sure that such people who have to appeal to an appeals officer appointed by the Minister will not fare as well under this code as they did under the workmen's compensation code which we are repealing under this Bill.</P>
    <P>We all accept that judges in any court, even the Supreme Court, are not infallible but at least the workman has always a good hearing in regard to this.  He goes into the Circuit Court and his case is presented under a judge. If it is thrown out he goes off to the Supreme Court.  If it is thrown out there at least he has the feeling that he has got a good hearing and that those people have been perfectly independent in the exercise of their functions.  He can never feel the same way as long as his injury, imaginary or otherwise, comes before an Appeals Officer appointed by the Minister, with or without assessors.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the debate on this amendment.  I have listened very carefully to the Minister. I am afraid we are rapidly getting into an argument or conflict between the officials of the Department, the Appeals Officers, the lawyers and the <Col N="705" /> judges.  We should not judge it on this basis at all.  I am quite prepared to accept the good faith and integrity of the people dealing with this in the Department.  I said so when speaking on the Second Reading.  Our difficulty here is that this is a scheme which will be administered by the Department. The first judgment will be made by the Department.  If the person is not satisfied with that he goes to another person in the Department.  We in the trade union movement and the Labour Party do not think that is quite good enough.  We look at the position and see that here is a drastic change in this part of our social welfare system.  We are bringing our principle into line with that which obtains in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The system in operation in Great Britain and Northern Ireland is in agreement and co-operation with the trade unions.  The situation there is largely as laid down in our amendment. That is the purpose of our amendment.  We cannot quite see the reason for the Minister's objection to this amendment.  We are bringing the law generally into line with the position in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and I would, therefore, appeal to the Minister to look again at this matter. I could not withdraw the amendment on the basis of the very limited promise the Minister has made up to now, that is simply to allow an appeal to a court of law on the interpretation, if I understand the Minister rightly, of whether an accident arises out of, or in the course of the employment.  That is rather too narrow a course for this problem.  I do not want to start another debate.  I hope the Minister will tell us that he will look again at this and that he will go a little further, between now and Report Stage.</P>

I am afraid that particular point would hardly be met under the system envisaged by the Minister.  A civil servant is <i>persona non grata</i> in this matter.  We may as well be straight about this.  I have no quarrel at all with the Department of Social Welfare or with the Minister.  I find all of them most reasonable but I very often have great difficulty in proving to the public that these officials happen to be right, and it is there I should like to take up the matter.</P>
      <P>Workers have a legal right to go into the courts and I wonder whether it would be judicious or proper at all to take these rights away from them. That is what is being done.  We cannot deny the fact that no matter what type of deciding machinery the Minister will set up these people will still have a right in Common Law to go to the courts.  If there is great conflict of opinion in connection with the two decisions in this matter then the Minister's decision begins to fall down.</P>
      <P>The only reason I intervened in this debate at all is that I meet so many social welfare cases that I should like personally to be in a position when a decision is given to stand up and give a clear indication as to the rectitude of that decision.  If a decision is not given and brought out in the open, it is difficult to get the public to accept it.  I do not believe for one moment that any civil servant would be biased one way or the other against an injured workman.  I have no reason in the world to believe that any civil servant would be so biased and that goes from the Deciding Officer upwards.  The unfortunate thing is that these decisions are given in extraordinarily strange language and the public have to have it interpreted for them.  They are given this but we often find from the type of Civil Service jargon in which these decisions are couched that ten different hob lawyers can find that ten different decisions have been given.  That is a very important point and a very important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am nine-tenths of the way, probably a little bit more, with the Minister it is just to get that matter <Col N="707" /> cleared that I speak at all.  No matter whether a decision in the open court is right or wrong the public have to accept it and the Minister cannot be blamed for it.  Unfortunately, when a decision is given by an official of the Minister, who is a completely free agent and in 99 cases out of 100 the more competent because he is an expert in this field, his decision will be questioned and the court's decision will not.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that there should be some extra latitude given in connection with this matter and I would ask the Minister to have a second look at it.  I do not believe that it will have any real practical effect but it will have an effect on the public mind. People often believe that proper medical evidence is not given in these cases, that a lot of it is heresay or is by way of certificates and there is no sworn evidence in these cases.  It may be that a doctor would have to come along who did not know anything about the case except just what he got from a cursory examination of the individual.  I think the Minister should go further on the road and if he just goes far enough to make his decision acceptable to the public I am prepared to accept the type of tribunal he wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reply to one point the Minister made.  He endeavoured to justify the extent to which he misled the Dáil and the Seanad in this matter rather than to apologise for it.  That is a pity. His justification was extraordinarily unconvincing.  He repeated quotations of a highly selective character, an <i>obiter dictum</i> as the Minority Report and purported to put forward the thesis that these remarks, taken out of context and quoted selectively, overrode the clear specific conditions of the Minority Report.  The Minority Report of any commission contains arguments and discussion, points made for and against and then it comes down to recommend something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never before heard anyone, Minister or otherwise, suggest that the recommendations of a commission are <Col N="708" /> overridden by remarks of a casual character made elsewhere and carefully selected by the person quoting them, that they take precedence and that you could completely ignore what the commission recommended.  The fact is that the commission clearly recommended this appeal.  They state specifically &ldquo;We recommend, therefore&rdquo;. It is in italics.  When they come to finish a discussion they give their recommendations in italics.  They have discussed the matter and they state what it is they recommend should be done:</P>
    <P>We recommend, therefore, that the existing system of workmen's compensation be abolished and replaced by the Social Insurance Occupational Injuries Scheme set out in Annexe 1 to Appendix XIII of this Report,...</P>
    <P>There is no qualification about that. There is a qualification on the question of finance:</P>
    <P>but financed by contributions fixed quinquennially and sufficient only to meet estimated out-goings during the following five years and create a reserve to meet casual or unexpected fluctuations from the normal during that period.</P>
    <P>Other than that, there is no qualification and the scheme put forward is one which was devised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and which the majority of the Minority Report signatories modelled on the British scheme devised by the Irish trade unions but modified by the deliberate insertion in capital letters of the words:</P>
    <P>APPEALS WILL LIE FROM THE DECISION OF THE LOCAL TRIBUNAL TO A JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT SITTING AS A COMMISSIONER.</P>
    <P>They went to enormous trouble about this.  They changed the British scheme and put it in capital letters and made sure there was no mistake made.  Then they said they recommend that this scheme be adopted with one qualification only about finance.  They could not have made their position clearer. <Col N="709" /> That any Minister can pretend that he believes the scheme they drew up is nothing and that all that matters are selected remarks of the Minority Report as taken out of context is less than honest.  I think the Minister made a mistake in this respect.</P>

      <P>It is possible for all of us to make mistakes but when we do we apologise for them.  But, making the mistake and trying to cover it up with a dishonest statement, ignoring the Commission's recommendations completely and taking odd phrases out of the Report, is a tactic which brings no credit on the Minister or on the Government he represents.</P>
      <P>I feel the Minister must consider the matter further.  So far, nobody has had a word to say about the Minister's proposal with the single exception of Senator Honan.  I do not recall anybody else on any side of the House saying anything in favour of it.  The Minister has against him the majority of the Commission, the minority of the Commission and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  He has against him the International Labour Office, Convention No. 23 of which sets out the form of administration that is desirable where you have representatives of employers and workers, possibly with a judge.  He rejects the practice in six out of seven non-Communist countries.  He rejects the opinion of Fine Gael, of the Labour Party, of his own front bench and of other speakers and writers.  He resists all pressure to take out a feature of the scheme which nobody seems to be in favour of but himself and, possibly, Senator Honan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose other Senators will have to vote in favour of it when the time comes but if any of them are in favour of it it would be interesting to hear them.  I cannot remember any case in which there was such unanimity of opinion or practice.  The Minister goes against the opinions of employers, of employees, of members of his own <Col N="710" /> Party and I cannot understand why he persists in this.  While he has made an apparent concession, I think he should go further and make a full concession. He did not justify why he should agree to go half way but not to go the full way.  He did not give any good reason for acting in this way.  The fact that a decision of a Deciding Officer should be subject to appeal in one respect but not in the other has not been justified. If a Deciding Officer can make a mistake in one part of his decision surely he can make a mistake in the other half, in the matter of the amount of compensation.  To say that a mistake can be made in one part and not in the other is amazing.  It is the practice of virtually all other countries, it is the opinion of anybody who has written or spoken on it, that an appeal should lie without qualification.  The Minister, having gone some distance, should have gone the whole way and not stand on dignity.  The case has been made overwhelmingly.  The Minister has no support in the stand he is taking. He should accept the fact that an honest mistake has been made&mdash;perhaps the Minority Report has been misinterpreted&mdash;as to what the Irish Congress of Trade Unions wanted.  He should admit that and agree with what everybody who has spoken on it has suggested should be done&mdash;with what is being done in six out of seven non-Communist countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if there is any point in saying more.  I have made my position clear.  This thing referred to as the legal right of workmen under the present system to go into the courts could more accurately be described as the legal necessity either to engage in or threaten litigation to establish their rights.  Up to now, compensation has been a direct right of the injured workman and disputes that have arisen have been between two individuals, employer and worker.  That has been settled by court adjudication.  The position in future will be entirely different.  Persons will be paid as of right and the payments will come from a fund built up by contributions from employers. Functions of Deciding Officers and <Col N="711" /> Appeals Officers will be to see that workmen get what is due to them from this fund and not to keep it from them.</P>
      <P>Unlike employers and insurance companies under the existing system, these officers will have no personal interest in the result of claims and there is every reason to assume that they will be completely just and impartial in arriving at their decisions.  I am, therefore, convinced that the system of Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers which has served us well in the past in regard to social welfare matters will be quite adequate to deal with this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The concession the Minister has made with regard to allowing an appeal to the court on the point of law as to whether an accident arose out of a workman's employment goes as far as is necessary to meet the case made by Senators.  I spoke in favour of this Bill on the Second Reading and I cannot say that anything I have heard today has changed my mind on the general principle.  The strict question of whether the injury arose out of employment could raise questions undoubtedly that could usefully be decided in a court and I am glad the Minister has agreed to consider that question again.  Once that has been dealt with, with the best will in the world I am unable to see the point made by Senators today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of what used to be in our workmen's compensation code is being put into this social welfare system.  For years past this system of Deciding Officers has dealt with blind pensions and disability pensions which raise the same issues that will come into question in the matter of compensating injured workers.  The same questions&mdash;the degree of disability, the degree of blindness&mdash;have been decided for years and apparently during the years these matters have been dealt with to the general satisfaction of workers and their representatives. Under this legislation, these issues will be dealt with by the same people <Col N="712" /> and once the basic question of law as to whether an accident arose out of a man's work has been taken away and where necessary dealt with by a court, it seems to me the other matters&mdash;the degree of disability and the amount of compensation&mdash;come within the same general questions of principle as are already dealt with under the system. There may be technical difficulties and I could understand if Senators were to say the whole social welfare code is wrong, that it is immoral, that it is contrary to civil liberty, but I cannot see any point in saying it is wrong in this case and not wrong in matters of disability or blindness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposition is that a worker may be treated unjustly, that he will never feel he has been properly treated because he has been dealt with by civil servants.  People who suffer from blindness or from other disabilities or their trade unions do not feel so aggrieved.  The system has worked well until now in a similar field and I cannot see that either in principle or in any way anything wrong is being done.  Once the question of law that appears to have been involved has been taken away, we are back in a purely social welfare field.  With the best will in the world, therefore, I think Senators are making a mountain out of a molehill.  They are objecting to it in this case; they are saying that the workers are being badly treated in this case and the entire social welfare code should be changed.  There is no reason at all for changing one section of it and not another.</P>

      <P>Here we are enacting a new code of legislation which, I grant, is to be welded into and become part of the present social welfare code.  There is one matter to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister, and perhaps he might be able to consider it between now and Report Stage.  This is a kind of legislation by reference.  Subsection (8)  provides:</P>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;increase&rdquo; contained in subsection (1) of section 2 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after &ldquo;or section 27&rdquo; of &ldquo;of this Act or under section 10...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;and so on.  I wonder whether it would be possible to take the amendments affected by this subsection and reconstitute the lot and put it in as a separate section.  The same applies to paragraph (b) of subsection (8).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are dealing with the whole code related to occupational injuries and I think it is desirable, whether it is the Minister for Social Welfare, or the Appeals Officers, or the Deciding Officers, that they should have in one Act all that relates to the particular case with which they are dealing.  I urge the Minister to consider doing this before Report Stage in any of <Col N="715" /> these cases occurring in the Bill.  It would make for easier administration of the Act, and a better understanding by all concerned.</P>

This definition is being extended to include increases in occupational injuries benefits in respect of adult and child dependents, in respect of unemployability, constant attendance and approved hospital treatment.  The existing definition refers to increases under sections 26 and 27 of the 1952 Act. Including this amendment the definition will now read: &ldquo;increase&rdquo; means, in relation to any benefit, an increase under section 26 or section 27 of this Act or under section 10, section 11, section 12, section 13, section 14 or section 19 of the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1966.

      <P>They are all related amendments.  I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 47, to delete &ldquo;caused&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;diagnosed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under the section a person who is injured after the appointed day will be entitled to compensation under this Act.  Subsection (1) provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to the provisions of the Acts, every person, irrespective of age, who, on or after the appointed day, is employed in insurable (occupational injuries) employment shall be insured under the Acts against personal injury caused on or after <Col N="716" /> the appointed day by accident arising out of and in the course of such employment.</P>
    <P>An injury may be caused before the appointed day, but it may not be diagnosed until after the Act comes into operation.  In that case a person who has sustained an injury will be entitled to benefit only under the existing workmen's compensation Acts.  Take the case of a man who is found to be suffering from an injury which was caused before this Bill comes into operation but which is not diagnosed until afterwards.  The amendment seeks to give him the same benefits as if the injury were, in fact, caused after the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act came into operation.  There are cases, and there will be cases, where an injury may have occurred as far back as five or six years, and it may only be lighted up by some constitutional change in the workman.  There are very often cases of that kind especially in relation to back injuries.</P>
    <P>I have known the case of a person who was working on the railway and fell.  He got TB and he was in hospital for five or six years.  This was in the old days when TB was not as readily cured as it is nowadays.  It was found that the TB from which he suffered was caused by the injury which lighted up the latent TB that was in him.  That was the medical evidence.  That case went to the Supreme Court, if my recollection is correct, and it was found that he was entitled to workmen's compensation, and he got back pay for the five or six years.  I think that case was Quinn and CIE.</P>
    <P>There have been other cases in my experience of men injured as far back as 1959 and their cases coming on in 1965.  An injury took place but did not manifest itself in incapacity to work until many years later.  I think we should benefit that kind of case.  We should give them the benefit of this Bill.  We all agree that the provisions of this Bill will be much more beneficial in terms of cash and other compensation that will be available, than what is available under the present unamended workmen's compensation code.  Therefore, I urge the House and <Col N="717" /> the Minister to accept this amendment, and to give the benefit of this Bill to persons with injuries diagnosed subsequent to its coming into operation, even though the injury was caused before the coming into operation of the Act, and latent until after the passing of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty here arises largely because of the fact that a lot of things are being done by regulation rather than being included specifically in the Bill.  If Senator O'Quigley will look at section 23, subsection (4), he will find that &ldquo;provision may be made by regulations for determining the time at which a person is to be treated for the purposes of the Acts as having developed any disease or injury prescribed for the purposes of this section, and the circumstances in which any such disease or injury is, where the person in question has previously suffered therefrom, to be treated as having recrudesced or as having been contracted or received afresh.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is intended that regulations will be made providing that an injury or disease will be deemed to have been caused on the first day of incapacity from the injury or disease.  I think that that will cover the type of case which Senator O'Quigley has in mind. On the other hand, if it is a recrudescence of an incapacity from some injury or disease that occurred before the coming into operation of this Act, then it is only right and fair that it should fall to be dealt with under the Workmen's Compensation Act, because the employer will have already incurred liability in respect of this particular injury.  I do not think, in fact, that the Senators who put down this amendment intended that liability should be taken over by this fund in such circumstances. The intention is, as I said, to make regulations providing that the injury will be deemed to have been caused on the date on which incapacity is first established.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat re-assured to hear that there is this provision in subsection (4) of section 23.  I am wondering whether or not <Col N="718" /> the Minister has power under the subsection. I would have thought that that dealt with injuries that had occurred previously and not recrudescence of a disease or any injury, and only for that kind of disease.  What I am inclined to think is that in subsection (4) we are dealing with the kind of case where a person suffers from dermatitis that clears up and is free of it for three or four years and then perhaps engages again in the kind of employment or uses the substance which causes a recrudescence of dermatitis.  That could be said to be an old injury.  One could take a case of arthritis, where progressive arthritis incapacitates the workman.  I am wondering what his position will be if he has taken a lump sum under the Workmen's Compensation Act in full and final compensation for his injury, and then when the money is perhaps invested or spent, will he be entitled, if his arthritis bothers him to the extent that he is completely incapacitated from work, to get compensation under subsection (4)  of section 23 of this Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid he would not.  If the liability for the injury has been fully determined by the acceptance of a lump sum under the Workmen's Compensation Act, then he would not be eligible for compensation under this Act for incapacity arising out of the same injury; but if he developed incapacity after the Act comes into operation, and even if it was quite clear that this incapacity arose from some injury or disease suffered or contracted before the coming into operation of this Act, his case would fall to be dealt with under this Act.  I could not reasonably be asked to establish liability to pay benefit under this Act for something which was already covered by the Workmen's Compensation Act and for which liability had already been established against the employer on whom the liability rested at the time the injury was contracted.</P>

      <P>Some temporary civil servants are entitled to gratuities, I understand.  It seems to me that this wipes out the right of a civil servant entitled in the ordinary course to superannuation, pension, and lump sum on retirement.  I do not think that that is what would be intended, but if it is limited to the type of person unestablished who would only be entitled to a lump sum or some small amount on retirement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Who would be entitled to a lump sum?  Where a person is entitled to a lump sum or a pension under the superannuation code it is obvious that he cannot get both.  If he is also covered by occupational injuries insurance this provides that the gratuity or allowance under the superannuation code will not be payable.</P>

      <P>I could understand it if it said that he should not be paid both, but that is not what this section <Col N="720" /> appears to say.  Supposing a man were entitled to, say £6 occupational injuries insurance, and if he retired he was entitled to £9 pension, subsection (3) seems to me to say that if he is getting occupational injuries insurance he will not get the £9 superannuation allowance.  That is to say, it reads to me that if he got it one way he cannot get it another.  In other words, this is the usual provision in legislation which provides for double payments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of things which are somewhat puzzling to me.  Perhaps I might deal with them one by one.  We refer to Part I of the First Schedule of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, for the purpose of determining what is insurable employment. That includes a variety of employment. It refers to employment in the State under any contract of service, written or oral, employment as master or a member of the crew of any ship registered in the State, employment in the civil service of the Government&mdash; I think that has been amended&mdash;employment as a member of the Defence Forces, employment under any local or other public authority and a number of other categories of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Part II of the First Schedule of the 1952 Act there are certain employments which are not insurable employments under the Social Welfare Act. It seems that in subsection (3) we are adding to Part II certain employments which will not be entitled to insurance under this new Occupational Injuries Act.  I must say when I read the Bill first, not having the Social Welfare Act before me, it seemed to me that what we were doing in regard to Part <Col N="721" /> II of the First Schedule was bringing in all those people mentioned in (a), (b), (c) and (d) under the ambit of the Occupational Injuries code of insurance. I found, to my astonishment, after looking it up, that Part II contains the employments which are excepted from insurable employment under the Social Welfare Act so that the net result of it is that the persons mentioned in (a), (b), (c) and (d) will not be entitled to occupational injuries insurance under this Act.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might be able to clarify the position as regards members of the Defence Forces.  I suppose occupational injuries there could be said to be the norm of the employment for which they would be entitled to pension under the Pensions Act.  I do not know what is the position of a soldier who is attached to a transport division and who is injured while repairing a truck.  Should he not be entitled to occupational injuries insurance or does he get better treatment in the form of injuries insurance under the army code of regulation or whatever Pensions Act applies to him? Could the Minister give us some information on that?</P>
    <P>I now come to employment as a member of the crew of a fishing vessel where the employed person is wholly remunerated by a share in the profits or the gross earnings of the working of the vessel.  That seems to me to exclude anybody who owns a boat, which is perhaps financed by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  If they share in the profit, if it is only a small one, it may be less than what might be the wages of persons in the boat, they will not be entitled to any occupational injuries.  I do not quite follow why they should be excluded.  The next category of people we are excluding are people employed otherwise than under any contract of service or apprenticeship.  I do not know what category of people are particularly involved in that?</P>
    <P>Subsection (d) refers to employment under any local or other public authority in the execution of any contract for services.  It seems to me if you employ a medical doctor as a house surgeon in a hospital that would be <Col N="722" /> a contract for services.  If a local county council employs him at £10 or £15 a week that is a contract for services.  There would be a different kind of contract for nurses.  I do not know whether they would come into that category or not.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that.  At any rate if a medical doctor, a student just out of his training, or while still in his seventh year, just before he is qualified, is employed in the hospital and is only earning £15 or £16 a week it seems to me that if he gets injured he will not be entitled to occupational injuries insurance but if the matron of the hospital, who would be earning much more than he is, was injured she would be entitled to occupational injuries insurance.  It seems to me that if you are employed in a hospital and are injured then you should be entitled to occupational injuries insurance. The disability in both cases might be exactly the same.  It might be a broken leg.  I do not see why one person should be entitled to occupational injuries insurance and the other not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to members of the Defence Forces the position is that there is provision for pensions for soldiers who are injured in the course of their duties.  I am not in a position to say whether in all cases this is better than what would be provided under this Bill.  I presume it is something comparable at any rate and they are not covered by workmen's compensation at present.  In view of the fact that this provision for them is there there did not seem to be any point in bringing them under this Bill now.</P>
      <P>I can quite see there could be cases of hardship with regard to people who are what are generally known as share fishermen but I cannot say how this can be avoided.  They are not, strictly speaking, employees and could not very well be brought under the scope of this Bill.  With regard to the case of medical students being employed in their final year the position there would be the same as anybody else.  If there is a contract of service they will be covered and if there is not a contract of service they will not be covered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to medical students, as I understand the position&mdash;I do not see any of my colleagues around to support me in this&mdash;if an ambulance driver is employed with a health authority, that is a contract of service.  If a carpenter is employed in the hospital, that is a contract of service. There is a distinction drawn between that in our legal system and a contract for service.  If you employ a solicitor, a doctor or any professional person or an expert of any kind, then this is what is referred to as a contract for service.  I do not know whether nurses fit into the first category or the second category.  Are nurses employed under contract of service or contract for service?</P>
      <P>If they fit into the first category we ought to be clear about this because we are accepting these people.  This is a case in which we are pushing people out of benefit.  We must be quite clear whether or not nurses are within this occupational injuries code. I want to know why we do not include physiotherapists who may be employed under contract for service, the radiographer and the pathologist, all of whom may be in receipt of the same amount of money, or less, as nurses employed under contract of service.  This is a very important matter because these people are being excluded.  It is a different thing where we are including these people within the scope of the Bill.  There must be some significance in putting in here:</P>
      <P>employment, which is neither wholetime as may be defined in regulations nor under contract of service,...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With respect to the share fishermen, I think when a code of legislation of this kind is being enacted we ought not take merely a departmental view of these things, and that has been going on in our legislation to the detriment of people and of industry, in a number of instances one could not mention.  As I understand it, it is difficult to effect any large-scale improvement in the fishing industry.  I do not see why, if that be the case, that we ought to single out share fishermen for unfavourable treatment under a <Col N="724" /> code of this kind.  I can quite see the Minister is not taking in farmers, or the independent window cleaner.  If the window cleaner is employed by a company he is covered but one who likes to go and come as he likes is not covered.  If those two window cleaners are working on opposite sides of the street and the two fall, the fellow who is employed gets insurance but the fellow who is self-employed gets nothing.</P>
    <P>I think when we are taking the trouble to exclude people like share fishermen we ought to have some regard to the difficulties of that particular industry.  In legislation of this kind to make their lot easier&mdash;there are not that many of them to affect vitally the statistical working out of the code&mdash;we ought to give them whatever benefits are going.  I suggest to the Minister that there is a way of bringing in share fishermen.  Under the present code the employer has to pay a fixed sum per week and I would suggest if we are going to have this scheme as part of the social welfare code we apply by analogy what is being done at the present time by way of voluntary insurance.</P>
    <P>If you are an insured contributor under the Social Welfare Acts as you exceed the income limit, or as in the case of a single woman who gets married and is no longer insured, she can continue to be a voluntary contributor, and that brings certain benefits in widowhood.  It brings the widow entitlement under the Health Acts as an insured person.  Similarly, when people become voluntary contributors they pay twice the rate the ordinary contributor pays.  It seems to me that if we have people like the share fisherman, or my independent window cleaner, he should be entitled to become voluntarily insured under this Act and pay twice as much, or two and a half times, or whatever you work out actuarially, and become insured under this Act.  There is no point whatever in saying to one person simply because he is more independent than the next that if he gets sick that he can go and lump it.</P>
    <P>In the case of share fishermen, and, <Col N="725" /> indeed, of all persons who are normally employed, paying a voluntary contribution of whatever is the actuarial amount, taking the figure of twice the contribution payable under this Act for an employee would be a much more sensible arrangement and would not greatly interfere with the funds.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not dealt with paragraph (c)&mdash;employment as an outworker. I do not know what that means, but I do urge the Minister, in relation to, first of all, the members of the Defence Forces, that he should make inquiry and perhaps give us some information as to what the position is in the Defence Forces.  If a mechanic employed by one of the garages here in town is injured he is paid, say, £15 a week and he gets, say, £7 10s. under this Bill.  If you have a mechanic in the transport division in one of our barracks who receives the same injuries I should like to be assured that the soldier mechanic receives the same occupational injuries insurance as the civilian mechanic.  I do not say that in any derogatory sense but I am not convinced by the Minister's argument that the members of the Defence Forces have their own code.  We all know that if teachers, civil servants, members of the Gardaí and such people are injured in the course of their employment they are paid their full salary for the first six months, then one-half for the next six months and then it terminates. But, notwithstanding the existence of these somewhat favourable conditions of employment, they are entitled to be covered by this Bill.  In fact, they are within the Bill.  Paragraph (3) of Part 1 of the First Schedule brings them in as civil servants in the employment of the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not see any difference between the civil servant who has his own code and his own conditions of employment and the soldier.  I do agree that if the soldier is on active service and is injured different considerations apply but the soldier who is doing the ordinary kind of routine that he does when he is not on active service should be entitled to at least as good conditions as the civil servant, or the teacher or the guard, and I should be glad if the Minister would look into <Col N="726" /> that matter and see what is the amount of compensation for members of the Defence Forces if they suffer from the same kind of injuries as their fellows in civilian employment.</P>

      <P>Therefore, the share fisherman who is only part-time is out. That is not so bad.  This brings me back to the anomaly.  Here we are letting in a wholetime share fisherman and to all intents and purposes he is self-employed.  But we are not allowing in other self-employed persons. Take my window cleaner.  I do not know why we should do that.  What we are trying to provide in the Bill, once one accepts the broad principle on which it is framed, is fair compensation for injuries that occur to people in the course of their employment while pursuing their particular occupations.  The very title of the Bill mentions &ldquo;occupational injuries&rdquo;.  I do not see any logic in saying that because a person is an independent contractor, a self-employed person, he should not be entitled to compensation if he has the same family, the same responsibility.  I do not know on what principle that distinction is being made.  It does not seem to be very logical.</P>

On the question of voluntary insurance, Senators may take it that I am personally in favour of extending the scope of voluntary social insurance to as many people as possible, but I would not be prepared to do it in regard to a single, isolated aspect of the social insurance code.  I think it would be better dealt with on a global basis, to examine the feasibility of extending whichever of the social insurance schemes would appear to be applicable to self-employed people.  I am investigating the feasibility of opening some of the social insurance schemes on a voluntary basis to people other than those who are compulsorily insurable at the moment.  I am investigating the feasibility of extending this new aspect of social insurance to such people but I do not want it done piecemeal.</P>

      <P>Before leaving the section, could the Minister throw a <Col N="728" /> little more light on this matter of a contract for service?

It is the kind of thing even the most skilled Appeals Officers might not be able to decide correctly.  Would the Minister indicate, if he is in a position to do so, what the position is so that we may be able to consider it for Report Stage?

What exactly does the Minister mean when he says wholetime as against part-time?  I realise fishermen have conditions of work far removed from the nine to five atmosphere, far removed from the 40-hour week.  Share fishermen might appear to be included in the provisions but in practice may be excluded unless we have some definition of what is meant by full-time and part-time employment. Is it a question of so many hours of work each week?  Will a similar standard to that applicable in the Civil Service and other employments apply to share fishermen?  With the best intentions in the world we might be excluding fishermen who should be included.</P>
