      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my brief opening remarks before the adjournment last evening I showed that there are three main facets of the work outlined by the Taoiseach in connection with the new Ministry of Labour. While a manpower policy is appropriate to a Department of State I proposed to him that the control of semi-State bodies&mdash;this terrible mess we have got into with such bodies&mdash; should be the responsibility of an Oireachtas sub-committee under the new Ministry of Labour.  It is only there that we can begin to get away from the anarchy and leap-frogging that have been created.</P>
      <P>I suggested in connection with the research arm that if the Government wish to make this a success&mdash;and without it I do not think the Ministry of Labour can be a success&mdash;it is vital that they enlist the support of individuals within the university system who are capable of making a contribution.  There may also be individuals in the Economic Research Institute, or somewhere else, who may have a contribution to make.  This will have to be administratively free of State influence so that it will be accepted alike by the State, by the workers and by management.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very good question and it is highly relevant. It is purely a lack of funds.  The individuals concerned&mdash;and I named them on the last occasion&mdash;are fully occupied doing not a 40-hour week but at least a 70-hour week with their existing commitments.  I suggested to the Taoiseach that if we made funds available to them they would be able to employ additional assistants within their own departments, and these assistants could relieve them of some of their present responsibilities.  Their ability and their know-how could be harnessed to directing studies on particular facets of industrial relations which are most urgently in need of exploration.  If you have a good man doing a full-time job and if you relieve him of part of that job, if there is something else which is more vital to be done you can avail of his talents to direct other studies as well.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the suggestions in regard to semi-State bodies and the responsibility of the new Minister, the Government could do a good deal to improve the climate if they allowed the trade unions concerned and some of the professional organisations to nominate certain members on the boards of these bodies.  Then you would begin to get a feeling of partnership in the work and nothing would contribute so much to that feeling of partnership as the knowledge among those bodies that their representatives were sitting on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to go into detail about the working out of these suggestions, particularly on the manpower policy, but I have been disturbed by some recent remarks, one by the Taoiseach in the Dáil, to the effect that one of the functions of the new Minister would be the retraining of workers leaving agriculture.  I have tried in this House many times to show that agriculture is suffering from a chronic shortage of workers.  Statistics show that the numbers on the land are going down by 10,000 a year.  That figure does not relate to workers needing retraining because, unfortunately, 7,000 are leaving in their coffins and they do not need retraining.  The new Minister <Col N="1520" /> for Labour should be made aware of this essential fact on the question of a manpower policy in this State.</P>
    <P>The fact is that we have fewer workers per 1,000 acres of arable land than any of our competitor countries, including Denmark, Holland and France.  If we take the effective numbers on the land here, we have less than half the figure per 1,000 acres. Consequently, I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Government to take full cognisance of this and see that the new Minister also does.  Instead of thinking about retraining workers leaving the land we should be deliberately orientating workers in order to maintain the present numbers on the land and, if possible, to increase those numbers. It is not possible that industry can provide, as required in the Second Programme, 10,000 to 15,000 new jobs per annum and at the same time take up the lamentable drop in the numbers employed on the land.  Industry has to maintain enough jobs to look after itself.  Let us have confidence in our agricultural potential, confidence in the need in the world to feed the hungry by agricultural produce. Let us base our manpower policy on the prospect that the numbers on the land can drop further only at our national peril.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the personnel who will man this new Department, a rather special type of Department in so far as it will have intimate connections with all other Departments and will impinge on them as much as the Department of Finance impinges on them today.  Therefore, there is need to look for a broadly trained and highly adaptable staff for this new body.  The time has come to break away from the classical 19th century type of administrator who did not require any professional training whatever, if we are to prosper as a 20th century State.  Among our engineering graduates we have a rich source to tap for leadership in this new Department. Compared with England and other European countries, we have a hidebound class distinction system of administration. To us an administrator is a man who never qualified in professional subjects; his education <Col N="1521" /> stopped at leaving certificate standard. The possession of a bachelorship of science or of engineering is regarded as anathema.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should go far and wide, outside the confines of the Civil Service, to pick some of the leaders of this new Department.  In bodies such as the ESB, Bord na Móna and the Irish Sugar Company there are many highly competent professional people capable, with a little extra training, of being developed into first class administrators, the type needed in a modern, scientific complex, a complex which will have to deal so much with figures.  In this respect, I suggest to the Taoiseach that we are in great peril here at present for lack of econometricians.  Everybody says there is a great lack of them.  I agree there is a great lack but, unfortunately, it is worse than a lack because we are totally unbalanced.  We are chronically short of the type of modern economist called an econometrician&mdash; highly skilled in mathematics and statistics who knows the type of subject he is dealing with, We have plenty of the other type but we need to balance up as soon as possible.  When you have a mature economist, you cannot give him at that stage the necessary grasp of mathematics and statistics necessary to turn him into an econometrician.  If you take a man who has been trained as a scientist you can easily get him to do economics.  You can pick up economics.  You cannot pick up mathematical reasoning.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am showing what is one of the greatest difficulties in trying to staff this new Department. Above all, the men concerned should be picked from a wide spectrum so that we will have a real cross-fertilisation of ideas among them.  The time has come to break with established practice both in the tradition of the appointment of Minister and of senior civil servants.  That has been the subject of some comment in those debates. My feeling is that we do not have enough Ministers.  I feel there should always be a spare Minister or two <Col N="1522" /> around, just as there should be spare officials in the Departments.  I mean by that that we should adopt the system that is essential in the scientific world, in the university world and, indeed, in the Civil Service world of the more advanced countries which we often talk about.  Those people should be given time to think.  Ministers should be given time to think.  A Minister should be given six months to study abroad, completely relieved of the responsibilities of his Department for that period.  That would be an excellent idea.</P>
      <P>I would also love to see senior civil servants, perhaps some of the officials attached to this new Department, given such leave of absence and time to think as a matter of course.  It is only thus that you can ensure freshness of thought and generate the new ideas that are so necessary today.  You cannot get those in a crowded labour week where you are just living from one routine job to the next.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to introduce something along those lines in this new Ministry and, of course, extend this to the Civil Service as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach should also explore in the structure of this new Department the possibility of temporary staff. It should be quite possible to invite someone from industry, a trade union official or university lecturer to work in such a Department for a year or maybe two years.  That is routine practice.  He need not necessarily be from this country.  In fact, it would be better if the system were extended wide so that you could bring in experts from similar small countries in Europe who have met many of the problems we are grappling with today.  I refer particularly to Holland, Belgium, Denmark and so on.  You could bring those people in for a year or so.  If you bring them in, do not muzzle them.  Those people have the ability to speak their minds and they should be able to do so without any fear from the Government or anybody else.  It is only with such a rejuvenation of our society in initiative, freshness and originality that you can keep abreast of what is needed in this constantly changing scientific world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1523" /> I would ask the Taoiseach not to overplay this new creation, the National Industrial Economic Council, in the structure of this new Department.  He should recognise it as a body capable of giving advice but he should also recognise it as a body very closely designed to Dublin and its interests.  He should recognise, too, that other opinions are very necessary in the formulation of policies.  The Taoiseach should recognise the fact that this particular body seems to very doctrinaire in a certain sense in its recent reports.</P>
    <P>I said on the Finance Bill, and I think I can restate it here, that in regard to this new Ministry of Labour a lead should be given by having a committee from this House.  Let us have a Seanad committee to assist the new Minister in the problems he is likely to encounter in this Department. It would be a very healthy step forward if such a committee was set up.  Such a committee would be taken as a matter of course in any of the small European democracies to which we look so much but we shy away from such here.  A committee drawn from this House would make a very significant contribution because, by and large, all of us here represent walks of life different from those who are advisers, traditionally, within a Department.</P>
    <P>We belong to many different walks of life and we have different points of view.  Let the Government and the Taoiseach make use of this House in such matters and give us the opportunity to contribute to the national development and not be just a mere talking Chamber.  Let us play specialised roles, beginning with this one. This is an excellent place to begin and I appeal to the Taoiseach to show his confidence in the Seanad and the contribution that democracy can make to the solution of our problems by setting up such a committee to help the new Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>I do not think I can close without making an appeal to the Taoiseach as I did on the Finance Bill.  When looking for a Minister do not start playing merry-go-rounds with Ministers. Above all, please do not shift the present Minister for Education <Col N="1524" /> from his position where he is fulfilling one of the most important posts in the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this Bill raises two rather different issues.  First of all, there is the general issue of industrial relations which will be the responsibility of this new Department.  Secondly, there is the issue of the structure and the format of the Government.  In the field of industrial relations, talk achieves something.  We are great in this country for talking about things and not doing anything but this is an area in which a good deal of talk should precede any action.</P>
      <P>We have to help reform public opinion and discussions on both sides reasonably and sensibly.  This can only be done if there are proper and intelligent discussions as there have been in this debate.  One of the matters raised already has been that of labour relations in State bodies.  It has always struck me as odd that labour relations in those State bodies have been so unsatisfactory. I had this feeling when I worked for 12 years as a member of the staff of one of those State bodies, not that, indeed, that particular company, Aer Lingus, had labour relations which were particularly poor.  On the contrary, they were, by the standards of State bodies, good and remained so. Nevertheless, I was always struck by the extent to which there did not exist between the bulk of the employees of the companies and the management as complete a sense of participation and working together in the national interest as one might expect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paradoxically, it was the most senior officials of the companies, the super managers and super officials whose instincts would have, on the whole, been conservative, who would not be particularly enamoured by national or State enterprise in the ideological sense and who felt most strongly the sense of service to the community in working for the country.  That sense of service did not seem to go down the ranks as far as one can see.  Without good leadership, as they have always had in the matter of industrial relationship, it never seemed possible to get this sense of participation among the whole staff <Col N="1525" /> and particularly among the manual workers as one would hope for.  There are several reasons for this possibly. The sheer size of some of those companies must make direct human contact between management and workers difficult.  There are factors which have gone to create a situation in which some of these companies have been to a greater extent than they should be leaders in the field of wage and salary increases and conditions of service without, however, receiving any return, and a corresponding degree of co-operation and enthusiastic support from the staff.</P>
    <P>The effect is that these companies, by the standards of most private firms, have generous terms of service and wages and salaries at a level which are above the normal in the private sector, and conditions of service, holidays and other fringe benefits of that kind are also beyond what is the average in the private sector although not necessarily, of course, beyond that of the better private firms.  Yet, despite this, there has not existed, as I said, the kind of industrial relations in these organisations that one would have hoped for in the circumstances.  There is the problem that these companies are inclined to run ahead of the market in some of these respects.  That is a good thing in some ways in that somebody has to give a lead.  But at times the extent to which they run ahead, the extent to which individual companies have got out of line with the rest, has been disturbing.</P>
    <P>I can recall about 12 years ago when I was making a claim for increased pay for myself and my colleagues in a particular group in a company how struck I was by the fact that, when I examined the structure of another State body, which was identical, similar officials in the other group had salaries of from £400, £600, and £800 higher than Aer Lingus.  It struck me at that time that there was an extraordinary lack of co-ordination here. Naturally, in putting in our claim we emphasised this and said it was most unfair that we were left behind.  We were able to prove that our position was identical with the officials in the other company and why should we be <Col N="1526" /> paid less.  Why should this situation exist where you have not got ownership by the State?  You have a situation of diverse pressurisation turning towards universal leap-frogging and many of our difficulties have come from this source.  The lack of co-ordination and a uniform system of arbitration have also been problems.</P>
    <P>We have had recently the Quinn Tribunal report which we should not go into in great detail here.  This report is a first step towards uniformity. It is a report with defects, defects with logical conclusions drawn, and defects from which certain attitudes were obtained, and this is a start towards unification of arbitration procedures and for some uniformity of conditions of service in those bodies and to an avoidance of leap-frogging.  But, it is unfortunate that a number of criticisms have been made and can be made on this report. They are of considerable validity and have made this first step a faltering one although we must continue in this direction if we are to avoid a chaotic condition in regard to pay and conditions of service in those bodies.</P>
    <P>In the more general issue of an incomes policy it was disturbing to hear the Taoiseach's views recently in respect of an incomes policy and at this late stage when one would have thought there was a fairly generous acceptance of an incomes policy.  If I remember rightly he used the words &mdash;an incomes policy whatever that means, or whatever that may mean. The suggestion that an incomes policy is something which is just a vague idea people talk about and is not something that could be a reality, that it is concrete and specific and is something which people use as an excuse for not doing something they should is disturbing.</P>
    <P>It is true that an incomes policy can cover a wide range of matters connected with the control and development of increases in wages and salaries and other incomes.  In this country we have the advantage of a serious study of an incomes policy and of the principles of an incomes policy by the NIEC which issued an agreed statement of the principles for <Col N="1527" /> an incomes policy.  These principles provided a basis for action and the report puts it to the Government to rest on these principles, to work from these principles to continue a more definite agreed system of developing an incomes policy in an arbitrary manner.  That report was published last November.  The Taoiseach had previously expressed scepticism of a more marked character concerning an incomes policy.  It is disturbing that when this report was published, despite the fact that it was accepted by the Government, that he should still cast doubts on the realities of the possibilities of an incomes policy.</P>
    <P>I think it is a great tribute to employers and workers that they should succeed on these principles. It involved considerable effort on both sides to commit themselves to the principles written into that report.  On both sides the people who signed it were running some distance ahead of information behind them and they took risks in so doing.  It has been the characteristic of this body, about which Senator Quinlan expressed some scepticism, that it has brought out the sense of responsibility that exists among people which is not always shown because of the tensions that arise in different groups.</P>
    <P>The NIEC has shown that when they are brought together to work constructively towards a common aim, instead of destructively, they are capable of showing a high degree of responsibility and give a leadership which we should all welcome.  One aspect of this report, which I think is important, and which is in danger of being lost, is the very pointed remarks on the agricultural side.  There is a danger that we will continue to treat the development of agricultural incomes and other incomes as two separate exercises to be carried out independently although the sum total of the decisions taken can impose an intolerable burden on the community which cannot be carried.</P>
    <P>The NIEC recognise the need for co-ordination of an incomes policy in the agricultural and non-agricultural fields and they recommend that the decision <Col N="1528" /> would require to be taken at the same time as&mdash;and be recognised as an integral part of&mdash;decisions concerning non-agricultural money incomes.</P>
    <P>That is a specific recommendation, a sensible one.  There is a notable lack of interest in it and a lack of interest on the Government's part in implementing it.  We are still at the stage when those two sides of our incomes policy are taken separately and not co-ordinated. The failure to co-ordinate in 1964 led to this more unsatisfactory condition, when the wages earned by agricultural workers were largely eroded and a large cause of that was an exceptional rise in agricultural prices which transferred overnight almost one-half of the benefits of those wage losses to the agricultural sector.  Now there are many in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt that in dealing with the Ministry of Labour the question of an incomes policy must be the prime consideration and that this Ministry would be concerned with this more than with anything else.  Therefore, the principles of an incomes policy must be the first consideration in this debate.  To be told they are irrelevant is, therefore, a little startling.  I shall not proceed much further along that line if it disturbs you, a Chathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I mentioned this&mdash;without developing it further in detail&mdash; is that this Ministry must have responsibility of some kind in this area.  If we are going to have non-agricultural incomes dealt with by a Ministry of Labour and agricultural incomes dealt with by the Ministry of Agriculture with no co-ordination between them, the decisions of the two Departments not part of an integrated decisionmaking mechanism, we could face very serious difficulties in this field.  The NIEC which recommended the establishment of this Department of Labour &mdash;and which indeed were ahead of Government opinion in that, because their recommendation was not accepted at the time&mdash;have gone to great trouble <Col N="1529" /> to emphasise that these decisions should be taken together, which can clearly only mean that fundamentally the Department of Labour would work in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture.  But, unfortunately, in this country we have two different Governments.  We have, in effect, a Department of Agriculture which continue to consider themselves to be almost a Government of their own, and the rest of the Government, so that when we come to simple economic planning the planning of the whole structure would clearly be the responsibility of the Department of Finance but agriculture is exempted from that and has its own planning mechanism.</P>
    <P>If we are to have this in the incomes sphere then&mdash;as was pointed out by the NIEC&mdash;there will be great difficulty arising from it.  It is entirely relevant that this question of control of incomes policy for the whole economy and not merely for the non-agricultural sector should be the responsibility of this Department.  It is, therefore, particularly alarming to hear, as was said in the Dáil, if I understood it correctly, that the Agricultural Wages Board will be outside the scope of this Department.  I cannot understand the logic of that decision and I think that this continued effort to divide our country into two parts, separately governed and with no co-ordination between them&mdash;agriculture and the rest&mdash;is a great mistake.  We must begin to look at the whole economy and stop thinking of two separate and largely opposed areas of activities.  The lack of co-ordination throughout the whole of the structure of Government is a matter which is disturbing and one which should certainly concern us when a Ministry is being established from which agricultural incomes are being excluded, apparently, at the outset, in order to again separate this, as if it were a pariah, from the rest of the economy.</P>
    <P>The NIEC, in dealing with an incomes policy, laid stress on three principles and I think the third of these is one which is in danger of getting lost in the consideration of the other two.  The third principle, which is referred to at page 48 of the report is:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1530" /> ...it will be more difficult to prevent total money income from rising at an excessive rate if there does not exist general consensus on what constitutes reasonable differences between wages and earnings in different occupations, between wages and salaries, and between wages and salaries and other kinds of income.</P>
    <P>It is this lack of consensus on differentials which is giving rise to most of our problems, and not so much the problem of working out what overall global increases in income are possible for the community in any given year.  This lack of consensus on differentials is alarming and something in respect of which the Government have not given a lead. One could say that the Government have been shying away from this.  It is always embarrassing for a Government to have to suggest that some group in the community should not do as well as some other group but if we are going to allow a situation to develop in which different groups each claim a bigger share of the total cake and the Government do nothing about it, we are opening up a situation which could be a very dangerous one indeed. The Government should have some social policy in this regard.  There should be some social philosophy upon which they should work.  The Government should, I feel&mdash;the Taoiseach may or may not agree&mdash;accept a principle that differentials between people at different levels of income have to be narrowed and that this principle must be generally accepted by all groups in the community, not something from which people could opt out or exempt themselves; rather something which all have to accept.  A lead is required here.</P>
    <P>We have at the moment many groups in the community seeking to catch up on others, an understandable desire, especially when most of those groups are trying to live on wages at a level which does not provide the minimum for a decent standard of living. But we have more groups which are equally determined to maintain their existing differentials and get as far ahead of the rest of the community as possible.  We shall not succeed in the principles of an incomes policy or <Col N="1531" /> in avoiding industrial anarchy unless there is developed some kind of consensus amongst those groups as to how this should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>These differentials will have to be narrowed and the people who are better off must accept, not a lowering of their standards of living&mdash;nobody would suggest that&mdash;but their standard of living will have to rise less fast than those not so well off and the gap between them narrowed.  It is up to the Government to give a lead in that respect in forming public opinion in such a way that people will not feel that they must have their 39 differentials <i>vis-a-vis</i> the rest of the community restored and kept in the privileged position they were seeking to share at that time.  They know public opinion will not accept that and that can only arise if the Government give a lead in this matter.</P>
    <P>This question of a consensus, of course, extends to many other areas of industrial relations also.  A consensus does not mean that all must agree; it means, I think, that the actions which people take are forced by public opinion to be in line with an evolving development of public opinion.  If public opinion is developed in a certain direction people will feel a moral pressure upon them to fall broadly into line with that.  Direction of public opinion in large industrial relations is clear.  It is towards more orderly industrial relations, away from unnecessary strikes, through provocation of management or indiscipline of labour, and public opinion on this issue is strong.  If in a country like Britain, where three-quarters of the population belongs to the working class group, if this is so strong there that the Government are bringing in a Prices and Incomes Bill, then we can be sure that in this country also, where less than half the population falls within this group, these pressures are certainly going to be at least as strong.  It is important that trade unions and management should realise this and also realise that the failure to end the unnecessary disruptions which occur at the moment is something which will inevitably bring <Col N="1532" /> about Government action of some kind, because public opinion will demand it.  It is unwise of any group in the community to ignore this pressure of public opinion and to ignore the development of consensus favouring a more orderly system of industrial relations than that which we have now.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it would be most unwise of any Government to interfere to any significant degree with the existing arrangements for negotiations between employers and workers.  The aim must be to create a climate of opinion in which these arrangements work better rather than to enforce them by legislation as was so unhappily necessary in the special instance of the ESB, which I hope will not occur in future on any occasion.  The structure of collective bargaining must be maintained and worked in a disciplined manner and the onus is on unions and management.  Though the Taoiseach used these words speculatively in relation to future occasions, the fact that these words could be spoken by the Leader of a Government not as a matter of immediate policy but even as something that would have to be considered in the future, is a warning which those concerned with industrial relations should ponder in their own interest if they are to maintain the harmony which is so vital to them and to the community&mdash;the warning that they will have to consider how to improve the existing arrangements to minimise some of the difficulties being created by the failure to agree on solutions to problems that arise between themselves.</P>
    <P>On the employers' side there is a need to create improved negotiating methods to which the Department of Labour should give consideration as well.  This arises from the fact that while union officials engaged in negotiations are full-time professionals who concentrate on this work of negotiating, employers negotiating are, by and large, not officials but employers without similar professional skills, who do their best in the small amount of time they have to do it, in the odd moments available to them, on matters and in a field with which they are not very familiar, where they feel frustrated by <Col N="1533" /> being drawn away from their principal task of running their own business efficiently to deal with this matter.  That frustration often issues in emotional outbursts and emotional reactions which you do not get in the same way from the professionals on the other side in such negotiations.  There is a certain imbalance in our negotiating system in the case of employers, who are not negotiating in the same professional way as the trade unions, and you do not get good results in negotiations if the two sides are unbalanced.  The trouble is that if the other side is not negotiating to full efficiency you tend to get an agreement which will lead to a breakdown or other trouble.  Some of the difficulties which arose out of the ninth round agreement arose out of the failure of some on the employers' side to draft a clear and specific agreement upon which that round would be based.  The difficulties of interpretation of the agreement which arose were the result of the fact that it was not efficiently negotiated.  Better negotiating machinery on both sides, but particularly on the employers' side, would avoid these difficulties in the future.</P>
    <P>On the general question of industrial relations legislation we can only await the Government's proposals, which, no doubt, will come before us soon.  Some of them we know something of already, but the full picture is not yet clear.  When the proposals are published in detail we will have to consider them constructively and debate them constructively.  They will require to be very carefully thought out.  Obviously, a lot of thought has been given by the Government to them, because this is a sensitive area and the Government will not lightly propose foolish solutions to the problem. It will be something which will require very carefully debate, but it is important that in this first serious review which we have had for several decades of our industrial relations machinery we should arrive at, as far as possible, agreed solutions.  Both sides will find it extremely difficult formally to agree to some of the conclusions, because they will be under pressure from their own members, but at least we must ensure that arrangements <Col N="1534" /> are reached which even if they do not have in every detail formal agreement from both sides are in practice broadly acceptable to them and will be worked by both sides. Otherwise there is no point in this exercise.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Government have tried to produce something along these lines, but it is only by full and careful debate in this House that we will ensure that what we will get is something that will be workable and will mark an improvement on the present arrangements.  We have had this difficulty over our industrial relations, but we should not underestimate the progress which we have made in recent years in this field.  As I have mentioned, the extent to which this has produced bodies such as the National Industrial Productivity Committee, the Committee on Industrial Organisation and the National Industrial Economic Committee, upon which the employers' and workers' representatives have been able to work together and to get unanimous agreement on a very wide range of problems, with disagreement recorded in only one instance, is remarkable, but the only emphasis is placed on disagreement. All the headlines quoted that, and not the agreed reports of the NIEC and the CIO when they are striving to carve up the cake which they have been working so hard and constructively together to increase and extend. It is unfortunate that we have not had the same progress in industrial relations, but that should not prevent us from seeing what has been achieved when both sides work together.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to one responsibility of this Department as being some form of social research. Senator Quinlan spoke at some length on this, and I see his point that it would be unsatisfactory if a Government Department should carry out research of this kind, the results of which might not command unanimous support, might not be accepted as being impartial, and moreover, that they have no experience of engaging in research of this kind.  The evidence we have suggests that when they undertake <Col N="1535" /> research of this nature it is to a limited extent, they are pretty ill-informed on the subject and do not really understand what the research is about.  This is a reflection of the fact that we have not in the public services the sociologists, the economists and the statisticians required for this kind of work, and that we have failed to develop the existing professional side of the service along these lines and to give authority to those of them that we have.  Nevertheless it is right that this Department should have a function and power to ensure that social research should be carried out, not by the Department directly but, as Senator Quinlan said, by people such as the universities economic research institute.</P>
    <P>One great step forward in social research has been the commissioning in the last year by the Department of Industry and Commerce on behalf of the National Productivity Economic Council of a very detailed and advanced research project into the nature of unemployment and employment problems generally in a particular Irish town, Drogheda.  The Department have no special competence themselves in the matter, but they sponsored those social research people in University College, Dublin which is the only place where a social research course exists at present.  They sponsored the work to be done by this group, and thereby they have both helped to develop social research here and look like obtaining from this extremely valuable data on the whole employment-unemployment relationship, about which we know so little and in regard to which the published statistics by Government Departments are so extremely uninformative.  I would be very concerned that this new Department of Labour should continue on this line from commissioning research projects of this kind, not, as Senator Quinlan said, by the Department themselves but carried out by people outside.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of this debate is in relation to the structure of the Government itself, because this proposal to change the structure of the Government <Col N="1536" /> by the establishment of a Department of Labour provides us with an opportunity of considering both the proposal itself and its implications for the Government and the running of government as a whole.  As I have said already, the proposal to establish the Department of Labour is one which represents a change of view by the Government.  The Taoiseach in opening the debate explained this change by saying that it arose out of the failure of the ICTU and the FUE in regard to the tenth round.  This was not a very convincing explanation, because on about half the occasions since the wage round negotiations started in 1947 those bodies have failed to agree, and on no previous occasion did the Government suggest that they would have to establish a Department of Labour.  This is a bit of a smoke-screen, but whatever the reason for the change of front we must welcome it. When the idea was put forward originally by the NPC and endorsed by the NIEC it was not accepted by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach gave as a reason for the establishment of the new Department&mdash;though he may have given other reasons too&mdash;that there was only one more place left in the Government under the Constitution and that this should be kept for a Ministry of European Affairs.  There was, therefore, no room for a Ministry of Labour.  I hope I am quoting him correctly, but I think that it was in relation to the Ministry of Labour that it was said.  I should like to know how the situation has changed in this respect. I am sure the Taoiseach in setting up this Department does not intend to suggest we do not need a Minister for European Affairs.  What he has in mind presumably&mdash;apart from the possibility of changing the Constitution about which he has made some tentative moves recently&mdash;is that other Departments can be amalgamated to make room for a Department of European Affairs when the creation of such a Department appears appropriate. I may say I think it is overdue.</P>
    <P>In the debate in the Dáil I seem to detect resentment to any reduction in <Col N="1537" /> the number of Government Departments or any amalgamation of the Departments.  There seems to be a clear implication that the Government have decided to establish a Department of European Affairs as well as a Department of Labour.  The Minister for Health, speaking some time ago&mdash;I think it was in 1956; he was not then Minister for Health but he was a prominent member of the Taoiseach's Party&mdash;suggested that the Department of Defence and the Department of Justice could be amalgamated.  There would be no great difficulty about that. A suggestion was also made in the Dáil that the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare could be amalgamated.  That suggestion seems feasible although I can see a case for keeping the Department of Health separate for the time being until the contemplated reforms are put through.</P>
    <P>We also have a Department of Transport and Power and a Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  If the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were handed over to one or more State bodies it would be run more efficiently. Departments are not adapted to run commercial enterprises successfully.  If that were done those two Departments could be merged into one, a communications Department.  There is ample room for amalgamation without even suggesting the abolition of the Department of Lands.  I have never understood why it is that we have a Department of Lands when we have the Land Commission with which they cannot interfere.</P>
    <P>There is ample room for tightening up the Government if and when the Taoiseach decides to establish a Department of European Affairs, in view of the growing likelihood of British entry into the EEC and the dissatisfaction in this country which is evident everywhere including the <i>Irish Press</i> at the failure of the Government to take the necessary steps to protect our position in regard to entry into the European Community if and when the British application goes through.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was rather scathing in the Dáil on the relationship between population figures and Government figures in other countries.  He must have <Col N="1538" /> misunderstood the point that was raised because it is a valid point.  The fact is that most small countries in Europe which have bigger populations than we have, have Governments under 15 in number.  I say that now without the record but I think it is right.  Most of those countries although their populations may be five, six or ten times ours have Governments numbering some 12 to 14.  Even the much larger countries with much more complexity in administration do not have very large Governments. Therefore, our complement of 15 Ministers is prima facie a little high.  One cannot be rigid about this. There may be a good deal to be said for having a large number of Ministers and for having as many people as possible gaining experience in that sphere, but prima facie the evidence would suggest that we are running on the high side as regards the number of our Ministers.  No one would relate Ministers per head of the population or anything of that kind.</P>
    <P>More serious than that question, which is not very vital, is the general need for some reorganisation of the Government and for a higher standard of administration by Ministers.  I have the impression&mdash;perhaps it is that far off hills are green&mdash;that members of the first and second Governments of this country&mdash;and I am not expressing a partisan political view; I say both the first and the second Governments&mdash; were men of great personality and character who came into office knowing what they wanted to do, ran their Departments, and told the civil servants what to do and how to do it.  I have the impression that members of subsequent Governments have not been of the same calibre.  We have ample evidence of that in this House when we see Ministers weakly trying to defend what they have been led up the garden path to do by civil servants.  I have the impression that Ministers are not to the same degree on top of the job as the Ministers in the first two Governments were, and that they are to a very large degree at the mercy of their civil servants. I think that only a minority of Ministers&mdash;and I accept that such a minority exists&mdash;are really on top of their jobs, and in a position to say <Col N="1539" /> what they want, and who will not be pushed around by civil servants and make that quite clear.</P>
    <P>It is evident, and anyone who follows public affairs closely will agree, that only a minority of Ministers can do that, and that the majority do not show any signs of imposing their own personalities or views, or indeed the thought-out policy of their Party such as it may be, on their Departments. There are reasons for this, and reasons they may be but not excuses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Time has marched on but it has not marched on to our benefit in that respect.  It would appear that a very large proportion of the policies put forward by this Government, and probably by the Governments which preceded them from either Party, emerged from civil servants and from recommendations by Commissions.  They did not seem to emerge from policies thought out by political Parties.  The Government have become a channel, and their policy seems to have emerged from some kind of consensus of the Civil Service mechanism or from Commissions. One reason for this is that Governments have been taking office without a clear and specific policy. That was not true of the first Fianna Fáil administration.  They had a specific policy and one which they had thought out for themselves.  When the Fianna Fáil Government were elected in 1957 we had to wait for two years for their policy in the form of the First Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may also be that Ministers are involved in far too many detailed decisions.  When a Minister has too many detailed matters to deal with he cannot possibly apply his mind <Col N="1540" /> adequately to the formulation of policy. That is true of the Department of Local Government where the Minister has to make so many planning decisions that he has no time to think out policy.  That seems to me to be a mistake.  With respect to the Taoiseach it may also be true that this Government are too long in power. When Governments are in power for more than eight years they seem to lose momentum.  This was true of the first Government and they seemed to lose their grip on the situation after a while.  I think, perhaps, this Government have also reached that point, as the Tory Government in Britain did before the end of their 13 years.</P>
    <P>When a Government are in office for a long time they have no opportunity of rethinking policy in Opposition and of looking at problems afresh.  Ministers have their jobs to do and they cannot sit down together in policy committees to work out policies because of their preoccupation with administration.  They must have a period of refreshment in Opposition.  Otherwise they become sterile, and this has happened to some degree.  This does not mean that Parties in Opposition always do that job. In the past Parties have failed to do so.  A lead is now being given by Fine Gael in this respect which I am sure will be followed by Fianna Fáil when they are in Opposition.  I think the lead given is one which will have healthy competitive repercussions and that in Opposition in future, political Parties will give more time to thinking out policies afresh.</P>
    <P>In this small country we have not got as many first-class people available in politics or elsewhere as in larger countries.  This is a deficiency we suffer from and in its background it is remarkable, considering the small range we have to draw from compared with 20 times more in Britain, France and other countries, what a high standard we achieve in all spheres of life, including politics, but obviously we cannot have as many, first-class people.</P>
    <P>This is something that makes one suggest it is a mistake to have a large <Col N="1541" /> Government, that a more compact Government of which all the Ministers would be of reasonably high calibre, would be far more satisfactory than one in which you have over-extended the resources of personnel by having a large Government for a small country. I think also that one of the drawbacks from which we suffer is that the remuneration of Ministers is not such as to attract anybody and it is sufficiently low to discourage many people from participation in Government. That must be a problem from which the Taoiseach, the present Government and other Governments have suffered.</P>
    <P>I do not think this is true of Dáil and Seanad membership where the remuneration is not inappropriate for the time and the responsibilities involved.  However, the remuneration of Ministers must operate as a severe disincentive to people to take on ministerial responsibilities.  It is absurd that when the Taoiseach appoints a member of his Party as a Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;there are quite a number of them&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary gets less than what he is getting already.  He gets £1,300 and this involves the discouraging feature that his responsibilities and his time preclude him from the possibility of making much more outside.  I think this is ludicrous.  The Taoiseach cannot expect to get Parliamentary Secretaries of high calibre on that basis.  It excludes anybody who is capable of earning outside the Dáil more than the £1,300 they will obtain. Therefore, their incomes are sharply cut and their wives suffer as well.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary must accept with his £1,300 a year a car and two drivers each of whom is paid almost as much as himself.  With the £1 a week increase they will get, the Parliamentary Secretary's drivers would be getting each about £200 less than the Parliamentary Secretary. Between the two of them they are costing almost twice as much.  The State car is costing, according to a reply to a Parliamentary Question, £3,800 a year.  Therefore, the Parliamentary Secretary's car and his two drivers are costing more than £5,700 <Col N="1542" /> a year and he touches only £1,300 in cash, making sure that anybody capable is discouraged from becoming Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>We have gone mad on perks but our economy on remuneration discourages anybody with ability from becoming Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries.  It is ludicrous the way Parliamentary Secretaries are treated. State cars with two drivers were introduced in 1927 for good reasons.  They should now be dropped except for the Taoiseach and Tánaiste and a pool of cars provided for Ministers going on long journeys.  We could thus save a lot of money and pay Ministers decent salaries which would ensure getting Ministers of a higher calibre than we have been able to get.</P>
    <P>A certain pattern has been created of working and living by Ministers which tends to cut them off from contact with the general public.  I know the Taoiseach does not believe this, that he thinks his Ministers are in touch with public opinion.  They are not, for a number of reasons.  Ministers have three main sources of contact with the public at the moment.  Representations are made to them by individuals and groups, but in this way Ministers get only the views of particular vested interests, rather formally and not in a way through which the Minister can discuss the matters in a give-and-take manner.  In other words, he is not able to test public feeling, public opinion.</P>
    <P>Secondly, a Minister has the opportunity of meeting people at public functions to which he is invited and where he is asked to make a speech. His contact with public opinion on such occasions is very limited.  He will not be given the thought-out views on public affairs that would be desirable knowledge.  He does not get honest reactions.  People with a definite axe to grind will say what they think, without inhibition, but others will be cautious and the Minister gets only a partial impression.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the Minister has access to public opinion at meetings of his political Party but this is a narrow and rather confined channel because political Parties have set political interests unlike the generality of opinion one <Col N="1543" /> gets from the man in the street.  In other words, the Minister is not involved in a genuine dialogue.  He is not engaged in an exercise that will give him an opportunity of testing out ideas. In Britain it is not uncommon for Ministers to preside over councils and commissions.  The British equivalent of NIEC is presided over by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  I do not recall having heard of a similar situation here.</P>
    <P>Our society is one in which Ministers can easily involve themselves in these affairs instead of simply getting reports from civil servants on what has been happening.  By being present themselves, arguing the toss themselves with people who have definite views and are able to explain them, Ministers would keep closely abreast of public opinion. As it is, Ministers are not in touch with public opinion.  They are insulated against it.  The present Minister for Health, for instance, presided over meetings with the Building Advisory Council which he established, and I suggest that the Taoiseach should encourage all his Ministers to involve themselves in such activities.</P>
    <P>Ministers often attend functions to speak but they rarely attend functions to listen.  I think this is a pity.  We all benefit by hearing a Minister speak but the Minister, in turn, because he does not attend functions to listen, does not benefit by the views of other people.  It is a pity Ministers do not turn up at meetings privately to listen &mdash;meetings where matters of public interest are being discussed.  I recall speaking at a meeting in Limerick and the present Minister for Health attended privately to listen.  I am sorry to keep coming back to him but he is the only example I can recall of a Minister sitting in the back and listening.  He may have learned something from the discussion after my few remarks.  It is a pity that other Ministers are not more inclined to listen instead of all the time speaking, useful though that exercise is to us.  I would be the last to denigrate the importance of Ministers' speaking because a lot of good has been done by the drip, drip, drip&mdash;meaning no <Col N="1544" /> disrespect&mdash;of Ministers speaking on national productivity.  At great cost to themselves, Ministers made great efforts on that subject though they may have been indiscriminate at times.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is a pity Ministers do not turn up to functions to listen and not to be asked to speak.  They would learn a lot.  Because they move around in these State cars, completely inappropriate to our simple way of living, they do not even have the advantage of hearing what is said in buses.  They are cut off to quite an extraordinary degree from the way of life of ordinary people.  This is a great pity.  I have heard the view expressed by civil servants that Ministers are out of touch in this way and the State car is attributed as one of the reasons that they are cut off.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that Ministers do not seek or get advice from outside the Civil Service, as well as from within it. In other countries Ministers have access to advice from expert groups outside the public service which they may have established personally or which may have been organised by their political Party.  I may say it has been the experience of Fine Gael that whenever one seeks the assistance of non-Party people in the formation of policies, unless they are Members of other Parties, one finds they are always willing to help.  Ministers would find if they had advice from all groups of people that the advice given would be reasonable.  That has been the experience of Fine Gael.  I am aware of one particular Minister who has established such a group but this is rather an exception.  It is a pity that Ministers do not seek a wider range of advice in this way from people who are experts in various fields.</P>
    <P>There is a very considerable volume of expertise in this country outside as well as inside the Civil Service.  I know a lot of it is inside the Civil Service. I have the greatest respect for those people whose advice is always so well backed up by facts and figures and which is so reliable, as far as it goes. You can always rely on what they are telling you is correct.  However, those people tend to be rather conventional in their approach and rather adverse <Col N="1545" /> to new ideas.  It is only if Ministers draw on other sources of expertise, particularly university people, that they will govern in an enlightened and progressive manner.  They should certainly draw from those outside sources as well as from the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is another problem of Government, which has been mentioned previously, and that is co-ordination of policies.  I know the Taoiseach has replied on this before and said that co-ordination of policies is a matter for the Taoiseach and the Government.  You cannot run any body, much less a country, by saying that the only co-ordination is at the top.  I liken the Government to a chairman and board of directors without any chief executive or any board of managers.  If there is any disagreement between the Departments they must go to the top for a decision. This does not work satisfactorily.  Of course, if one goes to the top one gets a decision but then the top is inclined to get clogged with decisions.  Many decisions simply are not taken because when there is a clash both sides prefer to let the matter drop rather than raise it at Cabinet level.  This absence of co-ordination within the public sphere is the cause of serious deficiencies.  This matter was referred to in the NIEC report which suggested the need for strengthening the power of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>This is very necessary as regards the Second Programme.  First of all, Departments do not have a clue as to what it is about.  I know most people who have any contact with economic programmes are convinced of this.  The absence of an understanding of what is an economic programme is the cause of our lack of progress.  It is certainly desirable that, as the NIEC recommended, and as has been announced since, the power of the Department of Finance to co-ordinate policy should be strengthened particularly.  They must in all their actions be governed and guided and they must, when reporting progress, specifically say what they wish to do in this respect.  There are many Departments carrying on policies regardless of the fact that they <Col N="1546" /> are contrary to the basic philosophies of the Second Programme.  They are not aware of this.  They are just carrying on a policy of inefficiency.  State bodies are particularly bad in this respect despite the fact that it has been hammered home in announcements that we must strengthen our economy and that if anybody is carrying on inefficiently we will go by the board.</P>
    <P>Government Departments, instead of pressing this policy, are busy protecting those boards from criticism all the time.  They do not seem to understand the idea of a low cost efficient type of operation.  This arises from a lack of co-ordination.  I do not blame the Taoiseach for this.  His co-ordinating of the Government is as effective as such co-ordination can be at that level. Absence of any co-ordination lower down is the cause of serious inefficiency.</P>
    <P>I should like to endorse what has already been said&mdash;that greater use should be made of committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I know the view has been expressed that it would be undesirable to have Members in Opposition in direct contact with civil servants and people in State bodies. This argument is very unconvincing. I cannot see what harm this could do. There would be great advantage in having an effective control of the policies of those bodies.  It would bring Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas actively into the public service supervising those bodies.  It would raise the standard of debate and information in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas would be capable of playing a most useful role if they were allowed to keep an eye on the organisation of the Civil Service and State bodies.  They would need some expert assistance and advice in this matter. That is normal in other countries.  I believe they could do this job very efficiently with the expert advice they would get.  The standard of relations in State bodies is not always high and it tends to deal with matters which would not concern the Houses of the Oireachtas but the standard of debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas could be raised if committees were formed of both Houses to deal with those public <Col N="1547" /> bodies.  At the present time the policy issues of those bodies never appear.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any State body in its annual report has ever referred to issued policies.  They are certainly never referred to in their annual reports.  They get away with that because there is no occasion for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas to question them on policies.  Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas have no opportunity to question them on policies.  All they can be questioned on is if a bus stop is changed or some such matter.</P>
    <P>A committee system would give all the information which we should have about those public bodies.  This would act as a check on those bodies and it would raise the standard of debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I press on the Taoiseach to look into this matter and not put it on the long finger. As far as I know in 1947 there was some talk about something like this.  There have been questions about this under successive Taoisigh since then.  It has always been said that the matter is under active consideration. It started in 1947 and went on from Government to Government and it is still going on today.  I think 19 years is enough to decide a matter of this kind and I ask the Taoiseach to stop procrastinating and to help the Houses of the Oireachtas more effectively and help the public system to be more advanced.</P>

      <P>It is easy to see that Senator FitzGerald was never a Member of the Dáil.  If he had been a Member of the Dáil he would know very well that there is not a single aspect of people's daily lives that a Deputy of any Party is not familiar with.  He is just a theorist.  He is a very good lecturer all right but to say we are not in touch with the people and how any Senator of any Party could say such a thing is beyond me. I was a Deputy for years and I would certainly say there was no aspect of people's lives with which I was not familiar.  I actually made a marriage arrangement.  Every Deputy knows this and that is the difference <Col N="1548" /> between a practical Deputy and a theorist.</P>
      <P>I do not speak here very often. I was a Minister for a number of years and to say that we are out of touch is beyond me.  How could we be out of touch?  If you represent a country constituency you know all about agriculture.  You must know it. You know all about the people and the land.  There is scarcely anything you do not know about.

      <P>I cannot understand how any Senator can say that we are out of touch or how a Minister, who has to be a Member of the Dáil, is out of touch.  I could understand the Senator if he had been involved in public affairs.  A man who has been a Member of the Dáil could not avoid knowing every problem of the people he represents.  Let the Senator put that in his pipe and smoke it.</P>

      <P>In view of the large programme of work before the House, and also I know the Taoiseach is busy trying to wind up affairs in the Dáil, I shall confine myself to what I consider an important aspect of the work of a Department of Labour.  I think it might satisfy Senator Boland's suggestion, that practical suggestions might be made. I refer to the provision of adequate advice and guidance for school leavers. Here we have a key aspect of the provision of efficient, satisfied personnel to help the economy.  I do not speak from theory.  I speak from practical experience of teaching school leavers in the 12 to 14 age groups over a long number of years.  It is my firm belief that entry into employment in this country has been entirely fortuitous and haphazard in the past. It depended upon chance.  There was a drift into employment in which children had little interest and out of which they moved quickly and ultimately emigrated.  I believe there has <Col N="1549" /> been a considerable acceleration of emigration because of lack of guidance for children entering employment.</P>
      <P>In the Ministry of Labour in Great Britain, and in Northern Ireland also, there is provision for parents of school leavers and there are pamphlets with details of every type of occupation within the State.  The educational qualifications are set out, the duration of training and apprenticeship are set down, the rates of remuneration, the prospects, and so on.  In addition to that, there is available also a system of aptitude testing so that a child has a reasonably good chance of moving into an area of employment suitable to his aptitude and ability.  He is not directed in a doctrinaire manner into, shall I say, sheet metal work, or a girl is not told she will be a good stenographer, and so on, but there is an indication of a range of employment suited to various ranges of ability and, by and large, a parent can form a good forecast of how the child will develop in that employment.  At the moment here jobs are often got by pure chance.  The father knows somebody and he asks this somebody if he has a vacancy and the good friend gives the vacancy to the child.  The child has not been tested as to his ability for this occupation or this post or as to his interest in this post.</P>
      <P>I consider that this has been one of the root problems leading to dissatisfaction in employment.  Many people are in places of employment in which they are not at all satisfied, in which they are not satisfied as individuals, and out of which they are trying to move at the earliest possible moment. This has led to an atmosphere of instability in the field of labour and to dissatisfaction and a great amount of emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Taoiseach to use his good offices to ensure that the Department of Labour will provide adequate advice to a school leaver and his parents about the various forms of occupation or employment available within the State.  Here also there might be, as Senator FitzGerald has suggested, co-operation between the Department of Education and the Department of Labour because there <Col N="1550" /> must be an axis of close liaison between these two Departments.  The Department of Education ensure that people who pass under their aegis are adequately trained and ready for employment. The Minister for Labour should take an interest in and see what is available and how that material which is available is best directed and put into areas of employment in which the material will be most satisfied and will best help the economy.  I would appeal to the Taoiseach to have a close look at this aspect of the new Ministry. I wish the new Department all the very best and I certainly, personally here as a Senator, welcome the establishment of this new Ministry.</P>

      <P>We have had a very full and instructive debate on this Bill, and especially I congratulate Senator Garret FitzGerald and Senator Quinlan on their contributions. I think what Senator Quinlan said about the need for the Ministers to have time to think creatively and to have leisure to think creatively is of profound importance.</P>
      <P>I had hoped to be able to congratulate Senator Garret FitzGerald on a particular point.  When he said &ldquo;finally&rdquo; I thought he had come to the end of his contribution.  It reminded me of the story about one of the differences between a curate and a bishop: when a curate says &ldquo;in conclusion&rdquo; he generally concludes, but when a bishops says &ldquo;lastly&rdquo; he often lasts.  In fact, Senator Garret FitzGerald said &ldquo;finally&rdquo; three times.</P>

      <P>Economically I was further instructed, but stylistically I was pained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn now to more serious matters. This Bill is designed to meet our present economic conditions.  These I shall not call heart-breaking but I shall call them heart-rending for every public spirited citizen of our country. Ten years or so ago by a minor economic miracle a gloomy and melancholy period of economic recession was changed into one of comparative prosperity. Now, once more we are faced <Col N="1551" /> with the risk of a decline.  How is that?  Mainly, I think, and I speak broadly, because of the failure of morale amongst employees and employers, and specifically, I think, because the employees felt, rightly or wrongly, that they have not had a full and fair share of the national prosperity. I do not propose to develop that theme but in my opinion those are the roots of the matter.  This condition of our country at the moment must be particularly disappointing to the Taoiseach who has honoured us by his presence on this debate.  It must be especially disappointing to him because it must be clear to every unbiased Irish man and woman that he has concentrated all his energies and abilities on the economic prosperity of our country, a prosperity based on efficiency, on the total enlistment of our national abilities, regardless of ancient historic prejudices.  He and his Ministers have looked coolly and calmly at all the major sources of revenue and development in this country.  They have asked one question &ldquo;Are these sources genuinely efficient, productive and progressive&rdquo; and, when they have decided that such sources of revenue and development are efficient, productive and progressive, they have shown their willingness to encourage and help them.</P>
    <P>Amongst those sources of revenue and especially development, I count our universities and I believe the Government have decided that all our Irish universities, including the one to which I have the honour of belonging, are genuinely making an effort towards the national prosperity and efficiency.  Certainly in Trinity College, our concern is to justify that confidence.</P>
    <P>To turn to this new Minister for Labour, whose appointment I think we all, without exception, in this House welcome.  How far will he succeed?  How far can he succeed? Clearly, only time will tell.  But may I, with the utmost brevity&mdash;because we are all conscious of not wanting to detain the Taoiseach more than we can possibly avoid&mdash;express two personal convictions?  As a layman in <Col N="1552" /> these matters&mdash;I am not a skilled economist, but I talk to people and I speculate about the national condition &mdash;this is, perhaps naively, what I personally believe.  First, I am sure we will never have industrial stability in this country until the lower income workers&mdash;and I use that phrase deliberately as I try to avoid the terms &ldquo;workers&rdquo; and &ldquo;employers&rdquo; because in fact we know that most employers work a great deal harder than most &ldquo;workers&rdquo; if we really face realities; and when the worker realises the fact that his employer is perhaps working a 12 hour day while he himself works an eight hour day, we will get nearer to economic success; until, I say, the lower income workers have a definite share in the profits and the losses of every profit-making concern. I emphasise in the losses as well in the profits.  I know it will be extraordinarily difficult to evolve a system by which this can be done, but humanly and psychologically, it is the only way we will get the best and most loyal service out of the &ldquo;workers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My second conviction is on the other side of the picture; that is until the inequities and the iniquities of the closed shop and the restrictive trade practice are checked, we will not have industrial wellbeing in this country. It is utterly deplorable, it is utterly demoralising, for an honest, hardworking worker that his intelligence and his industry should be prevented from developing to the full under the pre-text&mdash;and it is only a pretext&mdash;that if he works specially hard or specially well his fellow worker will suffer, he will put someone out of employment, he is harming the solidarity of the worker.  This really is insidious hypocrisy if one looks into it and I believe it must be faced very firmly by the coming Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that to propose these suggestions will sound naive stated just like this.  I am well aware that one could spend another three hours developing their complexities and subtleties.  I do not propose to do so at this stage in the debate but, broadly speaking, I do believe that the success of this new Minister will mainly <Col N="1553" /> depend upon his ability to establish those two principles; first, that workers and employers alike should share in the annual profits and, secondly, that the more intelligent and industrious worker should be free to use his powers to the full.</P>
    <P>That is all I shall say, except this &mdash;it is clear from the debate that the whole House supports the Taoiseach and the Government in this effort to restore our earlier prosperity.  I emphatically join in that support.  Some of us have expressed strong reservations but, in principle, he has our total support and I am glad to join in it.  I personally have full confidence that the present Government will succeed, if any Government can succeed, in these efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley, who opened the debate upon the Second Reading of this Bill, said that Fine Gael Senators had proposed the establishment of a Minister for Labour in a debate here in March last.  I was not aware of this but the idea of having here in this country a Ministry of Labour has been gestating for some time.  I should like to say, however, that if the employer-labour conference had produced the results hoped for, or even if the negotiations for a new national agreement this year had given us a real prospect of industrial peace for a time, I think it is likely we would have avoided making this change for the present, leaving the Minister for Industry and Commerce to deal with Government policy in this area.  The decision to set up a new Department of Labour came with the recognition that the situation was deteriorating instead of improving and that Government intervention and leadership were necessary if a better situation was to be brought about.  I should say, apropos some remarks of Senator FitzGerald that the decision appeared to be in conflict with views previously expressed by me, that the Government were, as usual, more concerned to be right than consistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large, Senator O'Quigley's speech was not directly related to the Bill, nor, indeed, were some others delivered during the debate.  There will be proposals for legislation for <Col N="1554" /> the amendment of the Industrial Relations Act and the Trade Union Acts, I hope, before the Seanad in the autumn.  Senators can, in the meantime, develop their ideas about some of the matters mentioned&mdash;the Civil Service arbitration arrangements, the labour relations of our State boards, the composition and operation of the Labour Court, all of which will be relevant to these measures.  I do not intend to comment upon these matters generally at this time.  The Minister for Labour will be preparing this new legislation and will, no doubt, consider the suggestions and ideas which were expressed by Senators.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy, who followed Senator O'Quigley, made some critical comments on the attitudes of some employers and some trade union leaders and on the situation generally, recognising, however, that he was oversimplifying the position to some degree even if only for purposes of emphasis or clarity.  In this area of industrial relations, as we all appreciate, conservatism is very deeply entrenched on one side as much as the other, old attitudes change slowly and old prejudices die hard.  I hope that the new Minister for Labour will be able to get new ideas circulating and to promote a general interest in the working out of a better system and in an atmosphere of co-operation.</P>
    <P>One innovation which I would agree would be desirable was suggested by Senator Murphy.  That would be the establishment or development in each of our important public undertakings of some institution, either internal to that undertaking or under the auspices of the Labour Court, whose judgment would be accepted as fair and as final not only by the management but also by the trade unions.  Senator Murphy referred to the fact that institutions of this kind existed at one time in CIE but were brought to an end.  I think it is true to say that the undermining of the authority and the status of those CIE institutions began when it seemed that they were regarded as final and binding only on the management.  Indeed, in the history of trade unionism in Ireland there are many instances of shortsighted disruption <Col N="1555" /> because of some temporary situation of arrangements of that kind which were designed for and, indeed, were capable of being used for the real advantage of trade union members.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators, including Senator Murphy, inquired as to the intentions of the Government regarding the staffing of the new Department of Labour.  The staff will, of course, be based upon experienced civil servants, particularly those who have had previous experience in respect of labour matters, but I think it will be necessary to attract, and I hope we will succeed in attracting, into the service of the Department some people from outside the Civil Service with specialist qualifications.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy in the course of an excellent speech referred to Swedish practice and traditions in this matter.  The history of the Swedish trade union movement is different to ours, and their practice in industrial relations is based essentially upon the idea of the negotiated contract legally enforceable.  It is notable, however, that the legislation which operates in Sweden which provides for the legal enforcement of contracts entered into by the trade unions on these trade unions and their members was negotiated originally by a Conservative Government and was bitterly opposed at the time by the Socialist Party in Opposition, but it has been maintained unchanged by a succession of Socialist Governments in that country for 35 years.  I am not going to draw the lesson we might learn here from that Swedish experience, but I think that our Irish trade union leaders would be well advised to study carefully the Swedish experience in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan argued that this new Department, if I understood him rightly, should have no function of research, which is work for the universities.  I think that there is involved here a question of interpretation of the word &ldquo;research&rdquo;.  In mathematics no doubt it is possible to pursue research to final and absolute truth.  In industrial relations there is no such a thing as absolute truth and <Col N="1556" /> certainly nothing like finality.  Basic research in industrial psychology is no doubt helpful, but the Department of Labour will be concerned with the more pragmatic topic of research in the direction of the right development of ideas that will work in Ireland, and if they do not work, will find out why they did not and what can be done to replace and improve them.</P>
    <P>I should not like to attempt to follow all the points raised by Senator Quinlan in his speech nor, indeed, those in the speech of Senator FitzGerald who followed, but there are one or two points on which it would be no harm to comment. Senator Quinlan was arguing that in respect of State boards the trade unions representing their staffs should have the power of direct nomination of members of the board.  The Government have established the practice of nominating as directors of State boards men who got their experience in the trade union movement but certainly not as direct representatives of the workers employed by the board of which they are members.  May I say that those trade union members of our boards are very useful members indeed, and this I think is a preferable system. It permits of a board of balanced qualities, capable of working harmoniously in the interest of the whole undertaking instead of transferring disputes relating to staff matters from the office of the personnel manager to the board.  I think that Senator Quinlan was tending to overlook the fact that these State boards exist primarily to serve the interests of the public and not the exclusive interests of their staffs.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald asked why have industrial relations in State boards proved to be so difficult.  It is only recently that they have proved to be difficult, excluding the one case of CIE where special problems always existed. I do not think that those difficulties that have arisen in respect of industrial relations in State boards are due to any personal defects in top managements. On the contrary, we have always been concerned wherever it lay within our power that there would be available to top management of those undertakings men with the special personal qualities and the experience which <Col N="1557" /> would enable them to manage their industrial relations well.  Neither can it be due in any sense to the traditional conflict which is deemed to exist between the interests of workers and private profit, because those State boards are not concerned with private profit, nor is it due to the failure of State boards to pay wages and salaries which are as good as those paid by private firms.  Indeed they have in many cases caused problems for private firms by elevating their standard of remuneration, and certainly in the case of the ESB they have in respect of many categories of their staff been paying higher wages than are paid to corresponding grades employed in the electricity undertaking of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The explanation, therefore, for the existence of industrial relations problems in those State boards must be due to something in the nature of the boards or the work that they undertake. Probably there is a feeling that political pressures can be organised in support of wage claims that would not apply in the case of private firms, and this may have something to do with it.  Workers seem to resent the application by State boards to their claims for higher wages or better conditions of the same commercial considerations that they would expect to be put forward in the case of private firms.  State companies are, of course, providing in many cases essentially public service on a monopoly basis and are, therefore, particularly vulnerable to trade union pressure.  This is also a factor in relation to the general situation.  Indeed, in the case of CIE it brought the Government at one point of time up against the need to consider the desirability in the public interest of dismantling or reducing the monopoly it exercised. Whatever our thoughts on the situation or whatever the remedies for it may be there is a situation in respect of those State organisations to which the Government and the trade unions must give very careful thought to find means that will ensure harmonious relations with their staffs and at the same time will prevent the development of those companies from being frustrated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1558" /> A question was raised by some Senator regarding the Agricultural Wages Board and the decision of the Government that for the time being at least the responsibility for the administration of the Act and of the Agricultural Wages Board should remain with the Minister for Agriculture. The problem of maintaining an adequate labour force in agriculture and the question of the ability of farmers to pay wages that will attract workers back into agriculture in sufficicent numbers are part and parcel of agricultural policy, and raise issues very different from those that are encountered in the industrial sector. That is the reason for the decision that for the time being at least the responsibility for the Agricultural Wages Board should remain with the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald expressed some very interesting views on the organisation of Government on which I do not feel called upon to comment.  His dedication to his Party line, right or wrong, pays better tribute to his loyalty than to his understanding of the problems involved.  It may be that Ministers are out of touch with public opinion.  One or other of us is, and whether it is the Government is a matter for argument.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald also expressed some extraordinary views on the relations of Ministers to their civil servants. I can understand his Party having an interest in suggesting that civil servants are the real rulers of the country.  That would give the public some assurance that a change of Government would not change anything else, and that they could even tolerate a bad Government for a while without undue risk.  It is only natural that an Opposition Party which have been unable to command sufficient public support to look like a creditable alternative Government have always to fall back upon the final and most futile argument that the Government which have been doing the work of the country need a rest, and that it would be good for the country to give them a short period out of office in which to revive and recuperate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1559" /> I want to point out that the present Government are essentially a new Government, the members of which are bringing to their work personal qualifications, fresh minds, industry, experience and, indeed, professional training at least as good as those of any of the other Governments in which I served, or, indeed, the country is ever likely to have.  It is, of course, the duty of the Taoiseach to keep the Government fresh by replacing members if required, or changing their responsibilities.  I for one believe even in the principle of change for the sake of change.  This is a far better way of dealing with the problems that can arise than to put in and put up with a bad Government for a time, while the permanent Government are recuperating.</P>
    <P>May I say in reply to suggestions of Senator FitzGerald and Senator Quinlan that I would be completely opposed to the conception of Government by committees?  I think that would be the worst possible system of Government.  If Fine Gael ever become the Government, they can try it.  So far as we are concerned we will not.  I believe this would prove to be completely catastrophic.  It would destroy initiative and make the effective application of policy impossible. It would serve no useful purpose whatever.  Nor do I regard it as a primary function of the Government to raise the debating standard of the Opposition Parties.</P>

Senator Brosnahan referred to the need for a system of vocational guidance for school goers and school leavers.

      <P>I want to make just one remark in regard to the speech made by Senator Stanford.  He referred to the country facing the risk of decline.  It is undoubtedly true that at this time we have problems of industrial and social relations of a rather special kind.  We always will have some problems of that character.  Nothing has happened yet which represents more than a period of temporary difficulty from which we can expect eventually to emerge, perhaps wiser for the experience&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This section contains a rather peculiar phraseology which originated in the Constitution. It gives the Title of the Bill in Irish and then says in English that it is something else.  I have never understood the reason for this.  Surely the correct procedure would be to say when we are writing this Bill in English&mdash;and all our Bills are written in English first&mdash; that a Department of State to be styled and known as the Department of Labour shall stand established, and then in the Irish version to refer to An Roinn Saothair.  The Constitution says &ldquo;Éire is ainm don Stát&rdquo;.  That has caused a great deal of trouble abroad because we still have not succeeded in convincing people that the name of this country is not Éire.  They still use the word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; as an abnoxious form of address.  They use it as a form of address to get at us in some way.  I can never understand why the Constitution does not say in English: &ldquo;The name of the State is Ireland&rdquo;, and in Irish: &ldquo;Éire is ainm don Stát&rdquo;.  I think the Taoiseach himself has complained at times about this.  We are referred to as &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; or the Irish Republic instead of the name of the State.  It is our own fault.  I suggest that we change this section so that it refers to the Department of Labour in English, and to An Roinn Saothair in our first national language.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the introduction with effect from 1st October, 1966, of a wholesale tax at the rate of five per cent.  This tax will not apply to sales of food, medicines, clothing and fuel; commodities which are exempt from the existing turnover tax will enjoy exemption from the new tax as will items such as drink, tobacco and hydrocarbon oils, which already bear heavy duties.  The Bill also contains a provision to enable other commodities to be exempted by order.  Since the new tax will be selective it is necessary that it should operate at the wholesale rather than the retail level.</P>
      <P>Section 1 contains the definitions necessary for interpretation purposes. Section 2 provides for the charging of the tax, with effect from 1st October, 1966, on moneys received after that date in respect of sales of goods (including goods sold before 1st October but not paid for until after that date). The corresponding tax on imports is imposed by section 11 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 3 specifies the persons accountable for the wholesale tax. They are:</P>
      <P>(i)  persons, other than manufacturers, whose wholesale sales of taxable goods exceed £500 a month;</P>
      <P>(ii) manufacturers whose sales of taxable goods exceed £150 a month; and</P>
      <P>(iii) retailers who purchase taxable goods in the quantities in which they are normally purchased by wholesale merchants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a provision, section 3 (3), whereby a manufacturer of exempt <Col N="1563" /> goods may be treated as an accountable person if he uses taxable goods in substantial quantities as materials in his business.  The purpose of this provision is to enable such a person to be registered under section 4 of the Bill and thereby become entitled to obtain his materials at tax-free prices.  The exemptions from the wholesale tax to which I have referred are covered by subsection (5) of section 3.  These exemptions are set out in fairly broad terms but a procedure for specifying them more particularly, if the necessity arises, is embodied in the subsection.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the registration of accountable persons and, by virtue of sections 5 and 6, such persons can purchase taxable goods free of tax subject to their paying tax in respect of any such supplies not used as materials for manufacture or as stock in trade.  Section 7 specifies the rate of tax as five per cent of the receipts from taxable sales.  These receipts will include amounts added to recover the tax.  Where manufacturers, wholesalers or retailers who are accountable sell goods by retail, the actual receipts may be reduced for tax purposes to the normal wholesale level.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that where the parties to a sale appear to be transacting business at artificially low prices, the Revenue Commissioners may estimate the taxable turnover by reference to the price which would obtain if the goods were sold in the open market. Section 9 makes specific provision to enable accountable persons to pass on tax by additions to their prices where the prices were fixed by contract before the 1st October, 1966.</P>
    <P>Section 10, for administrative convenience, enables the procedures applied in the operation of the turnover tax to be used for the purposes of the wholesale tax, with such modifications as are necessary.  It also enables the Revenue Commissioners to make regulations concerning some additional procedures required in relation to the wholesale tax.  Section 11 makes imports liable to a tax corresponding to <Col N="1564" /> the wholesale tax on transactions taking place within the State.  Sections 12 and 13 contain the usual care and management, citation, and construction provisions.</P>
    <P>I have now outlined, in general terms, the provisions of the Bill. Senators will, no doubt, have many queries regarding the detailed operation of the tax.  Such queries are more appropriate to the Committee Stage when I shall be happy to furnish as much information as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall with some satisfaction that I am one of the tethered Senators who cannot say much on this Bill.  Indeed, I have only a couple of general comments to make.  The introduction of this tax is a surprising decision for the Government to make.  Three years ago they had the choice of either a turnover tax at the retail stage or a tax at the wholesale stage and the Minister differentiated effectively between the two by saying that while the turnover tax had to attach to virtually all commodities subject to limited exceptions, wholesale tax is being applied to a small number of firms.  Such a tax can be selective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1565" /> The turnover tax, in a country which has not got a decimal coinage, can only be levied in units of 3d and 6d in the £ as to go below 3d would cause a great many difficulties.  This means the minimum amount the Minister can raise is about £7½ million a year.  I am inclined to the view that one of the reasons this tax is being introduced is because of the inflexibility of the turnover tax.  This tax is too good for raising money, for a minimum increase of £7½ million is too much of a bludgeon when one is trying in a Budget to collect a million here and £2 million there&mdash; where you do not want to raise a large volume of revenue.  This new tax is being introduced because of failure by the Government to appreciate, when the turnover tax was being introduced, how inflexible it was. This new tax will enable the Government to raise smaller sums when smaller sums are needed.  It will enable the Government to be selective.  This tax will not cover the full range of goods which would fall under the hammer and the bludgeon of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case for this tax as against the turnover tax.  At the time of the turnover tax I was surprised at the Government's decision to introduce it on all goods.  This was not in accordance with the recommendations of the Income Tax Commission which favoured rather a tax of this kind.  It is particularly difficult to swallow the argument made for the turnover tax&mdash;that it was simpler to operate.  We now find that the Government are turning away from that and imposing this other tax.  The Government have got themselves into a situation in which they are now imposing a tax which they said was too complicated and hard to operate when the turnover tax was introduced.  They now find it is necessary to have two such taxes.  It seems to me that the tax announced is flexible.  It can be applied to a relatively narrow range of goods and it will collect about £5 million or, if it is placed on the whole range of commodities at the wholesale level, it would bring in a much larger sum.</P>
    <P>I am not naïve enough to ask why <Col N="1566" /> we do not abolish the turnover tax and give up £15 million revenue.  But I want to know why we have got to have this new tax, which can be levied on some goods and also have to have another turnover tax on a full range of goods which applies to about 30,000 retailers.  I know there are more retailers than that but some of the smaller retailers do not pay the tax themselves but buy goods tax-paid. There are probably about 30,000 who actually pay this tax.  So far as I can make out the wholesalers from whom those people are buying goods will also be paying tax on some goods at the wholesale level.  Those wholesalers could, at the drop of a hat, add the 2½ per cent turnover tax to this new 5 per cent tax and thus save the retailers from the complicated business of filling up forms.  The retailers could then be exempted from filling up those forms.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I misunderstand the position. I realise that there are certain wholesalers whose lines are such that they will not be paying the wholesale tax.  Nevertheless, many of them will be paying it.  You could, therefore, by levying the turnover tax on them exempt 30,000 retailers from this complicated business of having to calculate their turnover which, at the retail level, is something not all firms do in the ordinary way.  Many small firms do not do so and they could be exempted.</P>
    <P>The only reason I can see for not doing it this way is that some wholesalers will not be paying this new tax and that you would have to extend the system to them in order to bring them within the framework of this tax.  That is a weak argument because, in fact, those wholesalers are probably already involved in turnover tax proceedings on behalf of small retailers buying from them on a tax paid basis.  I doubt if there are wholesalers, not under this new system, who are not paying tax of one or other type.  It seems to me that you could abolish the liability of retailers to make those returns and could collect both taxes at the same level.</P>
    <P>The only other argument I can see is that if this were done the Government <Col N="1567" /> might feel it was a climb down and an admission that they were wrong in the first instance and that this turnover tax should be at wholesale level. The Taoiseach a few minutes ago said that the Government were more concerned to be responsible than right.  If they find they were wrong about the turnover tax they should not be afraid to admit it and to change their minds. They would have a bit of fun poked at them by the Opposition but they should not be afraid of that.  I would like the Minister for Finance to do something with regard to this and to accept that there is no point in retailers, as well as wholesalers, filling up forms with regard to the turnover tax when the whole business could be done at the wholesale level.</P>
    <P>There is one other argument which could be put forward&mdash;that is that if you charge the tax at wholesale level the margin would be added as it goes along&mdash;that it is likely that if it was put on at wholesale level that you would get a certain amount of pushing up of prices and certain increased profits, but with the price control measures now available to deal with this matter this should not present any problem.  If you charge the turnover tax at the wholesale level it should not lead to any increased profit taking.  If it does, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has ample power to deal with any such abuses.</P>
    <P>I can see no reason for requiring over 30,000 people to continue filling up forms for this turnover tax.  If the Minister has some good reason for not doing this he should tell the House.  I have not seen anything in the Dáil debates referring to this matter.  I have not read that it has been justified in the Dáil that the turnover tax should continue to be levied at the retail level. If it has already been justified in the Dáil I would like to hear about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should explain why we have to have two different forms of taxation.  That is a fair question and it is one which I hope the Minister will answer when he is replying.  I would also like to say that the addition of this £5 million to the burden of <Col N="1568" /> taxation is something about which one should make some protest.  I am not personally opposed to an increase in taxation when one gets some concrete benefit from it.  I consider the Government were perfectly right in the Second Programme to plan to increase the burden of taxation by 10 per cent over the period.  They said that this money would be used for education and health.  It seems quite proper to do that but we now find that for the last three years the extra taxation is not producing extra educational or health services. We are getting increased taxation but we are not getting increased benefits from this.  We are getting the burden of taxation which was planned for 1970 at this stage, which is just three years after the start of the Programme. In that time the burden of taxation has risen 2½ times faster than was planned.  The extra taxes of which this tax is a part will take about 55 per cent of the increase in national output this year.  The amount which the Government expect to receive from the various taxes in the two Budgets, plus the somewhat uncertain buoyancy it expects, will represent about 55 per cent of the national output which the Government have forecasted.  The Government should not manage its affairs in such a way as to take 55 per cent of the national output in any one year.  Thirty per cent, perhaps even 33 per cent, is tolerable but no country can stand the situation in which the proportion of national output taken is not one-quarter to one-third but well over one-half, as is the case this year. This extra taxation which could have been avoided, if the Minister had held fast to the principles of the Second Programme, is something which is imposing an excessive burden on the economy.  I think it is fair to say that and if the Minister came back and asked &ldquo;What do you want to cut out?&rdquo;  it would be proper for me to say at this stage that I dealt adequately with that on the other Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The fact is that this involves a failure of management far beyond that which the economy should be expected to tolerate and the source of this extra taxation is not in the immediate decision <Col N="1569" /> of the Government to pay wage claims and additional aid to farmers, but it lies in the background of the past.  It is founded on errors made previously upon which these particular provisions have been superimposed.  It is there the trouble lies.  However, I do not want to go further on that.  I have spoken at length already on this general question of taxation.  I merely want to raise this particular point on the Bill and let others who are not so tethered as I am, unleash themselves on the broader fields.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the third Finance Bill to be dealt with in 13 months and our public certainly are browbeaten and tax bitten this year.  I feel the motoring public have been hardest hit by the two Budgets of this year, and it is reasonable to say that the Government, whose members enjoy free State cars and free State petrol, are obviously out of touch with the cost of motoring.  The fact is that the ownership of a motor car is no longer a luxury.  It is necessary for many thousands of our workers, not only in the towns but in the country, to have means of transport and we have a situation in Ireland today in which even the lowest paid workers in the Forestry Department, who have to travel long distances to their work in rural Ireland, equip themselves with an old small car for £40 or £50 to get to work.</P>
      <P>A car for those people is not a luxury; it is a necessity.  I feel that the new taxation, especially the increase of 25 per cent on the annual tax plus the two increases in the petrol, and now the five per cent wholesale tax, which I am sure will affect the price of cars, is a little much, and it is most unfortunate that this section of the community should be so hardly hit.  I certainly admire the young fellows throughout the country who by their own diligence equip themselves with some kind of car, and they now find that the annual rate of taxation is forcing those cars off the road.  I feel that the Government's order of priorities in the entire system of taxation has gone haywire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking back over the Book of <Col N="1570" /> Estimates for the year ending 31st March, 1967, I am amazed to find that in the Estimate for the prison services our prisoners are much better looked after than many of our old people and patients in our county homes and hospitals.  I see in the Book of Estimates for Public Services that £1 a week is allocated for victualling for our prisoners.  This is an extraordinary figure when we compare it with the sum allocated by the same Department for the entire cost of maintenance and education of our unfortunate younger citizens who are sent to reformatories and industrial schools.  The cost of maintaining a prisoner I reckon is something in the region of £2 a day. Yet they cannot find it within their power to give more than 35/- a week by way of capitation grant towards the cost of maintaining boys in our reformatories and industrial schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I bow to your ruling, but certainly I should like to deal with this matter when the opportunity arises.  Last week on this debate quite a lot was said about housing in general and I think it was Senator Dolan who said that there was more money spent this year than any other year by the Department of Local Government on the provision of houses for our people.  If Senator Dolan's figures are correct, I wish to make a vigorous protest in that at least one county council, that is Laois of which I am a member, is the cinderella of the 26 Counties as far as housing allocations are concerned, because even though we have had a scheme of almost 50 houses up with the Department for sanction for almost a year the Government could only find, despite the increased taxation, sufficient grants to enable us to complete 17 houses.  I should like to quote the number of houses which were built from the Government's White Paper, &ldquo;Housing Progress and Prospects&rdquo;. I feel there was a certain bandying of <Col N="1571" /> figures last week and we ought to clear the air on this matter.  This White Paper states that in order to cater for ordinary depreciation at least 8,000, odd, houses are necessary to be constructed annually.  In 1956 the number of houses built by private enterprise was 5,826 plus 2,363 which were erected by local authorities under the Housing of the Working Classes Act and a further 1,648 under the Labourers Act bringing us to a total of 9,837 houses.</P>
      <P>This certainly compares very favourably with a total of 7,431 for the latest date in this publication, which was 1964.  I certainly feel that, with the very steep increase in taxation our people have been experiencing over the last couple of years, the rate of house building by our local authorities which are so much subject to Government grants has not kept in line and in step.  Similarly, all the county councils have had experience of their efforts in this regard being drastically curtailed and the public whose rates are increasing find it very difficult to understand the Government's policy in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time is when an effort should be made to get back to having one annual Budget to cater for the entire 12 months.  Similarly, too, in local authorities, the rates meeting or the annual estimates meeting has lost much of its value for the simple reason that no matter what rate is struck for the year it is impossible now for councils and corporations to keep the expenditure down to that level because of the fact that the Department of Local Government and, perhaps, the Department of Health invariably notify increases after that meeting which the councils must put into effect.  Therefore, it is impossible for ordinary councils throughout the country to keep to the sum they had budgeted for at the estimates meeting.  This is, indeed, regrettable because the ordinary householder certainly must endeavour to live within his means and must make an effort to live within his income for the year.  Yet the only people who do <Col N="1572" /> not blink an eyelid about transgressing against this law are the Government who do so by their own action in bringing in increases, not in one but in two budgets now a year.  If this system continues it will be very difficult for the ordinary people of the country to know where they stand because they certainly will have no hope whatsoever of making ends meet.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to one matter in regard to our forces in Cyprus.  In the few cases where men have lost their lives, I feel the Department of Defence have been reluctant to supply headstones, even moderate ones, to the memory of the deceased soldiers. This is, perhaps, regrettable.  I should like if the Minister could, in framing his Budget, perhaps include £100 or £50 in the overall taxation&mdash;which is a staggering figure this year.  Surely we could find within the two Budgets this year £40 or £50 in order to put some sort of headstone over the boys who lost their lives in Cyprus last year.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points I should like to mention on this Bill but, as the Minister has said he will be prepared to answer questions on Committee Stage, perhaps I will defer them until then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief because I have spoken on Finance Bill No. 1 and the general arrangement between the Parties is that we would not cover the ground again when we were speaking a second time but apply this to the particular Bill we have now before us.  I must say, however, that it is rather puzzling and strange that we have had Finance Bill No. 1&mdash;which we finished yesterday afternoon&mdash;and now today, 24 hours afterwards, we have a second Finance Bill.  But, of course, the explanation is that these things originated quite a long time ago and we had the first Finance Bill at a time when the Presidential election was approaching.  The Minister then had to provide for the farmers and, of course, the announcement of the benefits and extra payments to be made to the farmers was again conveniently announced before the Presidential election.  Then, after the Presidential election, we had the <Col N="1573" /> extra taxation to be collected for the payments we made to the farmers. This is now embodied in Finance Bill No. 2.</P>
      <P>This, of course, is quite a cynical operation.  I do not see how we can expect the ordinary citizens to behave in a patriotic fashion in the economic difficulties facing the country when they see a democratically elected Government behaving like this; behaving in the cynical fashion of bringing in, first, a Finance Bill which did not provide all the necessary finances for the year, then announcing benefits before the Presidential election, and after having reaped the benefits of the Presidential election, announcing how they would collect the money.</P>
      <P>Of course, there is another part to it.  We now have a measure to be pushed through to avoid local elections this year because the Government would find it undesirable.  They would be given an answer from the electorate to this sort of cynical operation. This, of course, is another cynical operation&mdash;postponing the local elections for the second time.  I think last year a majority in this House again pushed through a Bill to promote local elections to be held this year. Now they find it again inconvenient to hold them this year and they will hoist their majority to postpone it again for a further year.</P>

      <P>It demonstrates the cynical approach of this Government; their contempt for the electorate, to treat them as children and to use the finances of the country to benefit politically by their actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I condemn this Budget on a second count.  Again, we had this approach to more indirect taxation which will lead to a further increase in the cost of living, taxation not on the basis of the ability of the person to pay but rather indirect taxation spread across the whole board.  We had it here in regard to petrol duties.  I am not too concerned about that.  I am particularly concerned about this five per cent wholesale tax which will again affect <Col N="1574" /> the cost of living and, no matter what the Minister may say about it, make it more difficult for the ordinary people of this country to exist.</P>
    <P>The strange thing about this is that we had the turnover tax two or three years ago when we were assured that it was impossible to differentiate; you had to apply turnover tax to everything. The Labour Party protested, there were marches, and we said if you must have a turnover tax, exempt food and the necessaries of life.  We were told that was administratively impossible; it could not be done.  Suddenly, it has been found possible in this wholesale tax to exempt certain articles; to apply it only on a limited basis but on a basis which, of course, again will affect the cost of living, again make it more difficult for the people to live and make it more difficult for the trade unions to pursue wage claims.  Of course, we will be told we are quite irresponsible in saying that.</P>
    <P>As I have spoken on the First Budget, I can only apply my remarks in a limited extent to Finance Bill No. 2.  I say it is a thoroughly cynical operation; it is to be condemned and we in the Labour Party will vote against it.</P>

        <i>(Longford):</i> When I was speaking on the other Bill, I was proposing to give my view as to why certain situations were developing. I do suggest to this House that our real difficulty was that we were overbuying <Col N="1575" /> ourselves, and hence the purchasing power for the little we were doing, and the value of our money, were depreciating.  So long as that situation prevails we will be in the vicious circle of demand for wages keeping in line with prevailing prices and demand for higher prices for agricultural produce, and that system is bound to continue so long as there is not an increase in production which will give more purchasing power to our money. I had intended to develop that idea but, at the request of the Chair, concluded to allow the Minister to come in.</P>

        <i>(Longford):</i> Yes.  I do think that many people throughout the country and in this House fully realise that simple thing, and that in the long run if we want a better estate now or in the future, even for our grandchildren, we must work, and that there is not an easy way to create a new heaven and a new earth by a Minister for Finance manipulating affairs in such a way as to put more money in circulation unless there is something backing that money in real terms, by production of goods or from services of some sort.  I am convinced that Senator Murphy and others understand this fact, and it annoys me then, because I feel that they do understand it, when I hear statements like the one just made by Senator Murphy. One would think that he felt that he and the Minister for Finance had an easy way to deal with this difficult problem.  In the long run it is a problem for our whole society.  I am satisfied that if we want an improvement it is by an increase in the production of wealth in this country whether it is agricultural output or industrial output, and by an increase in exports. Until we fully realise and give effect to <Col N="1576" /> that we will not get out of our difficulties. If that does not happen we will have a recurrence of the situation that Senator Stanford referred to on the previous Bill, that after a great acceleration in the economic growth of this country the situation will develop where it began and slow down, because it appears to me that once we as a society get an increase in purchasing power if we are not able to get satisfaction after that purchasing power in goods available here at home or imported from Shanghai or Hong Kong or somewhere else we will run ourselves into balance of payments problems.  That has been the record of this country to a great degree.</P>
      <P>The thing is not all that complicated. I am satisfied that in some way or another all our people and the Members of this House and of the Dáil fully realise this and will want to face up to it.  Our first real progress will be when we do face up to this situation, and it is not a political question except in the best sense of politics.  It is not a matter that should be the plaything of political Parties. There would be no hope for us if matters like this were a plaything between political Parties.  I feel that there was an undertone in Senator Murphy's speech that because Finance (No. 2) Bill intended basically to make provision for the increase in agricultural prices&mdash;I hope I am wrong&mdash;that is why Senator Murphy seems to feel rather cattish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Longford):</i> The Senator felt annoyed because this Bill rather than the Finance (No. 1) Bill is <Col N="1577" /> aimed at helping the agricultural community. Finance (No. 2) Bill, even though it followed close as far as this House is concerned on the heels of Finance (No. 1) Bill, did not come last, and it appears that the Bill does come closer in giving adjustments in agricultural prices for the agricultural community.  I say that quite deliberately, because it does appear to me that no matter what Government is in power the agricultural community seem to come last.</P>

While I do agree basically with the idea of a Ministry of Labour I hope that it will be a useful tool in developing better attitudes in this country and more sanity in our relationship with one another, that is, Christian charity.  I say that it is a great pity that self-employed people, whether the blacksmith, the farmer, or the small shopkeeper, because they are not in any well organised pressure groups, are not in a position to force their points of view.</P>

        <i>(Longford):</i> I regard all trade unions of people as pressure groups, because no matter how grand they might appear to be by their stated aims in practice they all seem to end up with the one aim of getting more and more of the national economy for their particular section to the disadvantage of the less well organised sections of our people. I do not want anybody to think that I am referring to trade unions of workers.  I am not, because it would be so simple for people to say &ldquo;so and so is hostile to trade unions of workers&rdquo;.  I do not think that anybody who wanted to do that would succeed. Nor do I see how I can be regarded as a capitalist.  I do not think that small farmers as a class will ever be in a position of being regarded as <Col N="1578" /> capitalists who want to grind the faces of the poor.</P>
      <P>I say this quite deliberately: there is a feeling of frustration among people.  They think that because they are not organised those who are well organised get more than their share of the national income, and that the purchasing power and the standards of living of the unorganised section of our people suffer.  This view is held in rural areas and that is why so many people &mdash;and young people particularly, unfortunately&mdash;are moving from the rural areas and seeking industrial employment. They feel, and rightly so, that well-guarded industrial employment is much more rewarding, profitable and pleasant than working on small farms.</P>

      <P>Más fíor do na ráflaí atá ag gabháil thart, seo é an ócáid dheiridh a mbeidh an tUasal Ó Colla againn mar Aire Oideachais. Más mar sin atá an scéal, ba mhaith liom, thar mo cheann féin agus thar ceann meánmhúinteoirí na hÉireann, a rá leis gur ábhar fíor-dhíomá linn é bheith ag imeacht uainn.  Níl sé ach achar gearr ina Aire Oideachais, ach <Col N="1579" /> le linn na tréimhse sin tharraing sé bá na múinteoirí leis agus bá gach éinne eile a bhí ag plé leis i gcúrsaí oideachais.  Is dóigh gur ar mhaithe leis féin atá sé á aistriú agus guím rath agus sonas air ina chéim nua, ach ní lúide sin an díomá atá orm é bheith ag scarúint leis an Rionn Oideachais.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an leasú seo atá ós ár gcomhair, is mian liom i dtosach mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le húdaráis an tSeanaid faoi am a chur ar fáil dó ar chlár an lae inniu, agus leis an Aire faoi theacht i láthair lena chur faoinár mbráid.  Thárla an leasú seo ann, mar a mhínigh an tAire, de thoradh idirbheartaíocht idir Cumann na Meánmhúinteoirí agus an Roinn Oideachais ar mhaithe le fostaí de chuid an Chumainn.  Tugann sé aitheantas i leith pinsin do chuid de sheirbhís an fhostaí sin nár sheirbhís mhúinteoireachta é.  Is mór agamsa é sin mar tá cáil ar an Roinn Oideachais agus ar Ranna Rialtais i gcoitinne go bhfuil siad an-stóinsithe ina ndearcadh ar chúrsaí mar seo, ach cruthaíonn an leasú seo ina n-aithnítear seirbhís nár sheirbhís mhúinteoireachta é go bhfuil siad níos solúbtha ná mar a samhlaítear dóibh go minic.</P>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an leasú freisin mar go dtugann sé faoiseamh go tráthúil don bhean uasal seo trí aguisín nach beag a chur lena pinsean.  Nuair a bhí leasú eile ar an Scéim seo ós comhair an tSeanaid roinnt blianta ó shin rinne mé achainí dúthrachtach leis an Aire san am comhdlúthú nó códú a dhéanamh ar an Scéim.  Séard tá ann Bun-Acht 1929 agus tranglam de mhionleasuithe ó am go céile ó shin. Tá sé sa riocht gur fíor-dheacair d'éinne nach mbeadh sár chleachtach air aon bhrí a bhaint as.  Is scéim é do dhaoine simplí mar mé féin agus ba mhór an gar é a shimpliú dá réir agus é a thabhairt faoi aon chlúdach amháin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sé mo bharúil fós go mba cheart é sin a dhéanamh ach feictear dom anois go gcaithfear roinnt leasuithe eile a dhéanamh air i dtosach.  Caithfear foláramh a dhéanamh ann le freastal <Col N="1580" /> ar na múinteoirí sna scoileanna cuimsitheacha.  Do réir cosúlachta, tá siadsan le teacht faoi scéim aoisliúntas na meánmhúinteoirí.  Níl ansin ach mion-rud nach mbeidh aon stró leis.</P>
    <P>Lena chois sin tá sé á thuar go mbeidh an oiread sin teacht agus imeacht idir meánscoileanna agus gairmscoileanna sna blianta atá romhainn go gcaithfear soláthat a dhéanamh sa Scéim do sheirbhís meánmhúinteora i ngairmscoil.  Is iarbhunscoileanna an dá chineál anois agus i bhfad níos mó i gcoitinne acu ná mar a bhí go dtí seo.  Faoi mar atá an scéal faoi láthair is féidir do ghairmoide aitheantas d'fháil i leith pinsin ar sheirbhís i meánscoil ach ní fíor a mhalairt.  Ní thugtar an t-aitheantas céanna do mheánmhúinteoir ar sheirbhís i ngairmscoil. Tá fhios agam é mar is duine mé féin a thug cúpla bliain de sheirbhís lánaimsire i ngairmscoil agus níl sé á áireamh i leith pinsin.  Tá sé in am an laige sin a leigheas.</P>
    <P>Ábhair eile gearáin atá ann faoin Scéim seo nach dtugtar aitheantas i leith pinsin do sheirbhís taobh amuigh den Stát.  Tugtar aitheantas i leith tuarastail do mhúinteoirí a chaitheann 3 bliana san Afraic nó 5 bliana sna Sé Condaethe ach séantar cearta pinsin are na daoine sin.  Ní fheicimse aon chúis nach mbeadh an tseirbhís sin inaitheanta i leith pinsin má tá sé inaitheanta i leith tuarastail, má dhéantar an íocaíocht chuí air.  Ba chóir rogha a thabhairt do na daoine sin na blianta sin a chur san áireamh i leith pinsin agus na sintiúisí cuí a íoc do réir a chéile.  Duine atá tar éis cúig bliana a chaitheamh sa Tuaisceart agus ar mhaith leis post a ghlacadh abhus, is mór an constaic air a fhios a bheith aige go gcaillfidh sé sciar chomh mór sin dá sheirbhís nuair a thagann sé in aois phinsin.</P>
    <P>Tá pointe amháin eile fós.  Tá meánmhúinteoirí sa riocht gur féidir leo bliain iomlán phinsin agus aisce a chailliúint trí bheith aon lá amháin as láthair gan cead.  Ní amháin gur féidir é ach tharla anuraidh gur tháining múinteoir in aois phinsin nuair a bhí 37 de bhlianta agus 364 lá de sheirbhís <Col N="1581" /> aitheanta tughta aige.  Áiríodh a phinsean agus a aisce do réir na mblianta críochnaithe agus ní bhfuair sé sciúrtóg ar na 364 lá.  Is scéim ranníocaíochta an Scéim s'againne agus bhí a chuid síntiúisí íochta ag an múinteoir seo i leith na laethanta sin.  Níl fhios agam an bhfuil aon scéim eile ann nach bhfuil foláramh réasúnta ann do dhaoine mar sin lena chur ar a gcumas bliain a chríochnú.  Tá fhios agam i gcás na Státseirbhíse, má tharlaíonn lá breithe duine taobh istigh de ráithe ó dheireadh bliana, go gceadaítear dó an bhliain a chríochnú.  I gcás an mhúinteora seo cé gur lean sé leis ag múineadh tar éis dó dul ar phinsin sa scoil chéanna ina raibh sé, níor cheadaigh an Scéim dó aon lá amháin féin a bhaint as an mbliain nua chun an bhliain eile a iomlánú.  Bhí an cheist seo faoi chaibidil leis an Roinn le gairid agus rinneadh tairiscint ina taobh nach bhfuil sásúil.  Maidir liom féin de, ní bhéinn sásta le aon socrú nach leighseodh cás an fhir áirithe seo.  Má tá an Roinn sásta an Scéim seo a mhúnlú nó a leasú chun aitheantas a thabhairt do sheirbhís nach seirbhís mhúinteoireachta in aon chor í, ní fheicim cén fáth nach múnlódh siad a thuilleadh é le freastal ar chás den sórt seo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Longford):</i> Before business was suspended I was about to refer to another matter in our attitudes that we should think hard about.  That is our attitude to taxation.  I know that it has been raised by many Members of this House, and my comment would be that it is my experience that people who clamour and press for services from the State which cost money are very often the people who, when it comes to paying for those services, object to the particular item of taxation calculated to pay for them.  If we are adult in these matters we have to think about them and behave in a rational and sane manner.  Another matter that has been raised in this debate on the Finance Bills&mdash;and I am inclined to couple both of them&mdash;is the incidence of taxation direct or indirect.  We must be adult enough to realise that taxation in any form, no matter how sugar-coated it may be, is not a very palatable thing to any of us, but it is necessary to maintain services if we want services and if we want the growth of services that our people press for or we regard as desirable.  We must be prepared for them unless we want governments to run into the sorry mess of unbalanced budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what our views may be on political questions none of us with any sense of responsibility, I feel certain, would like to see the position where you would have a financial mess in the country as a result of improper budgeting or imbalance in budgeting on current accounts.  It may be permissible to borrow for capital investment, but a Government that would be forced into the position, by <Col N="1583" /> pressure of people who do not like taxation, whereby they would borrow money for day-to-day running on current account I would regard as a very poor form of government.</P>
    <P>In this question of attitude to taxation it is easy enough to argue that direct taxation, though it may not be as sugar-coated, is undesirable by contrast to indirect taxation.  It is easy enough to argue in favour of higher levels of direct taxation if you had a large very wealthy class who could afford to stand a higher level of direct taxation.  We have not in our society a large group of very well off people who could stand a higher level of direct taxation.  It is the people who work whether in the factory, on the farm, in the workshop, or in business, who create wealth.  It is the people of modest means who create wealth and pay taxes.  There is not in our community a large group of well off people to whom we could turn to increase the level of direct taxation.  The Minister and his Department have a number of experts to guide them in deciding the levels and trends of direct taxation in relation to indirect taxation.  I do not think it can be seriously argued that we can do away with indirect taxation if we want to maintain our services and improve them.  We must pay direct and indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to our attitude to work, and to the growth of professional associations, trade associations, farmers' associations, veterinary surgeons' associations, dentists' associations and workers' associations.  It seems to me that the only real interest they have is to foster the interests of their own section.  That was made clear to me yesterday evening when a Member of this House said he was not speaking objectively but from a particular point of view which he represented. I know other groups do the same thing and I suppose it is forgivable. Despite the fact that the Senator said he was not objective I think he was objective in many ways.</P>
    <P>I remember reading a lecture by a person I regard as a fairly good social thinker.  One of the gems of that lecture was the suggestion that if <Col N="1584" /> work was not a necessity it would have to be invented.  The implication is that work is necessary to keep people out of trouble and that if they were not working they would dissipate their time.  Work is good for people.  It disciplines them, keeps their minds employed, and keeps them out of villainy.  I do not see any virtue in the growing desire for shorter working hours and more and more money for less and less work.  I do not see any virtue in a 40-hour week.  I know people who are self-employed and who cannot work a 40-hour week.  They are frustrated by the idea that other sections get a better standard of living while working shorter hours.  This ultimately leads to the financial difficulties which seemed to recur.</P>
    <P>I am not against workers whether organised or unorganised trying to get, or succeeding in getting, more remuneration and a higher standard of living. That is something we should all like to see, and it is necessary for the growth of our national income which I hope will continue to develop.  That can only be achieved by the work of our people.  I can see a danger to that growth and improvement in the standard of living of our people, and particularly those who are not well off, in shorter working hours.</P>
    <P>I should like to see people working more efficiently and, within reasonable limits, working longer hours, getting a higher output and enjoying a higher standard of living.  I see this from a rural point of view and I fully realise that it has become very annoying to young people in the rural areas that they cannot get a similar standard of living to that of the people in trade union employment, people in professional employment, or civil servants. The people on the land have to work much longer than a 40-hour week.  If we want to have a higher standard of living for ourselves, or even for our grandchildren, we must work for it. There is no easy way and no easy solution.</P>
    <P>People who are in a position to influence the thinking of other people should do a serious bit of thinking themselves in the hope that there will be more sanity in our relations with one another.  The new Ministry is only <Col N="1585" /> another tool.  A tool is as good as the person who uses it.  If the new Ministry is not used skilfully it will not achieve what many of us hope it will achieve. Because I believe that if work were not necessary it would have to be invented, I think we should review our attitude to work.  If we do that, many of our difficulties, financial and otherwise, will disappear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that whereever possible he likes to dole out the cake as equally as he can when framing his Budget.  It was, therefore, with the utmost disappointment and dismay that I found, when he introduced his Budget in March, that much maligned section of the community, the agricultural section, had been left out of the picture once again.  One felt possibly that the Minister was aware the dose of medicine would be very large and that the easiest way to administer it would be in two doses, but the amount of taxation he imposed in the first Budget was such that one felt there would be something in it to meet the urgent need of the farming community.</P>
      <P>Yet, all they got was the hope that their incomes would improve and that if they did not the Minister would come back later in the year looking for more money to meet the situation. I fail to believe that the Department of Finance were so badly advised they did not realise when the Budget was being framed that the situation in the country was as bad as it was.  Having gone through the bad harvest of last year, when it was impossible to save the hay crop, facing into the winter period with demands for fodder for extra stock, it was not in the least surprising that farmers' losses were considerable. By March those fears had been borne out.  The losses the farmers were suffering at that time must have been known to the various Departments and could have been conveyed to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One was, therefore, inclined to <Col N="1586" /> believe that what Senator Murphy said earlier this afternoon was true&mdash; that the second pill would be left nearer the Presidential election so that the Minister could dole out a golden handshake to the farmers and reap the rewards on 1st June.  Everybody understands that agriculture is the backbone of the economy and, that being the case, that the dairying industry is the backbone of agriculture.  It was more than obvious in March that the dairying industry was crying out for further support.</P>
    <P>While we welcome the help it received in the second Budget, it was too little and too late for a great many. Twopence per gallon for milk for a small farmer whose cows were already dead was very little consolation, and a great many small farmers were unable to meet the feed bill to maintain their cows.  They kept the cows in the hope that the grass season would come suddenly, always waiting for something to happen.  Unfortunately, they waited too long.  I do not think the increase given in the Budget will meet the situation in the dairying industry. While I am not married to the two-tier price system&mdash;the Minister for Agriculture has undertaken to have a second look at it&mdash;I feel it is at the moment the only solution.  The big farmers have greater expenses and they require further support to meet them; and the small farmer, in order to keep body and soul together, unless he can meet his commitments by increasing his stock and his production, cannot hope to survive.  The blow which has been dealt him this year by the elements largely, by the Minister's failure to meet him sooner, will mean that he will find it very difficult to carry on.</P>
    <P>I do not believe anybody can object to the taxes on the items on which the Minister imposed them in his first budget.  I do not believe anybody can object to taxation when it is designed to meet a critical situation.  What I object to is that the Government got themselves into a mess and the people now have to try to get them out of it. It was being built up over a long period.  Its imminence has been pointed <Col N="1587" /> out to the Government yet even today they are not quite certain where they are going.</P>
    <P>The taxes imposed on beer, tobacco and spirits, as the Minister remarked here last week, provide a certain amount of revenue occasionally.  So do I.  I do not believe anybody in the House provides the Minister with as much from tobacco as I do.  I am not cribbing about that.  I do not have to smoke, I do not have to drink, but I feel for the person, whether he be young or old, living in isolation on a farm.  The only pleasure he may have is a smoke or, when he goes to town, an occasional half one or a bottle of stout.  Other people living on small fixed incomes such as old age pensions will have an increase of 2/6d a week later in the year.  Meanwhile they have to cut their cloth to the measure of the further taxation imposed by the Minister.  These people receive our sympathy and, we hope, will receive further consideration from the Minister.</P>
    <P>The selective wholesale tax in the second Budget will to my mind make bad worse.  While it will bring in a considerable sum of money, it must be remembered it will also increase costs all round.  Though it is not being imposed on the necessaries of life, it will nevertheless be felt in a great many spheres.  The cost of building houses, the cost of transport, and the cost of the distribution of everything will build up.  I am afraid that the Minister next year will find that the last situation is worse than the first.  I am quite certain he has been worried about the loss of revenue during the last few months due to the trade disputes.  I am afraid, too, that in the months to come he will be equally worried about the growth in unemployment as a result of the further taxation. The loss of revenue must be reflected next year and we will then have a situation in which fewer people will have to pay more.  I do not claim to know the answer as to where we will finally land.  This is something which will have to be faced up to at a very early date.</P>
    <P>We had, to go back to the agricultural <Col N="1588" /> community, the unfortunate happening in regard to the manner in which the taxation in the second Budget was brought in.  It was brought in to meet increased grants to farmers and others.  The others seem to be just an afterthought.  The impression was created whether deliberately or otherwise&mdash;I do not believe for a moment that the Minister did it deliberately&mdash;that the farmers were getting money for jam and that there was £52½ million there for them this year and what were they crying about?  This is one of the things which turn country against city and it does not help for the better relations which should exist.  I should like to remind the House&mdash;I am afraid this applies more to the Appropriation Bill but I should like to say this in passing&mdash;that if you examine the figures the actual amount of cash going into farmers' pockets directly from that huge amount of money is very small indeed.  By and large, the figures relate to a very long-term process.</P>
    <P>Land reclamation is just one item which you could take out of this.  I forget the exact figures for this.  It must be about £1½ million or is it £4 million? Whatever it is, land reclamation is carried out by a farmer in the expectation that the work done will last for generations.  It also involves him in increased expenditure of one kind or another.  If he reclaims a portion of land, if he decides to till that land it will call for increased mechanisation and if he decides to graze it, it calls for increased stock.  Increased stock, on the other hand, calls for increased housing.  While you may argue that there are grants for farm buildings they are a very small percentage of the amount of capital farmers have to invest in those items.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Senator?  The figure for this year is £2.5 million.  It is £250,000 more than last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very grateful for it.  Nevertheless, I still maintain that that £2.5 million is not going directly into the pockets of farmers any more than in the case of a city <Col N="1589" /> man who goes and builds a house for himself.  He gets a site and he builds the house.  If he qualifies for the various grants he gets them.  He is not building the house for himself alone. If he decides to live in it he expects it will do his children, his grandchildren and their children afterwards.  It is the same with land reclamation, farm buildings and improvements in regard to the eradication of disease.  Those are all benefits but, while they are costly to the taxpayer, they will, nevertheless, eventually be of benefit to the State itself and not just to individual farmers. The farming community should be given some encouragement and not made to feel they are getting a handout. They should be made to feel that they are playing a part in the building up of the economy and helping to increase the country's prosperity.</P>
      <P>There is one item which I should like to touch on and which was dealt with extensively in the other House.  I think the Minister gave a fair reply to it.  I refer to the allowance for education. The allowance, bearing in mind the increase in the cost of education over a number of years, is not in proportion. While there is an improvement, nevertheless, everything else, no matter what it is, should take second place to education.  The education of the young people should come first. Those children wanting advanced education must receive more assistance than the Minister has been able to give them this year.  I am quite sure the Minister will bear that in mind and that he will, whenever the money is available&mdash;I hope it is very soon&mdash; help those who are trying to help themselves and the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all happy about what the position will be in a few months hence. The Minister told us last week that an improvement has already set in.  That reminds me of the time when Deputy Sweetman was Minister for Finance. When things were at their worst somebody asked him when we would turn the corner.  While the corner did not seem to be in sight he remarked: &ldquo;We have already turned it&rdquo;.  Maybe the Minister can see what Deputy Sweetman could see then.  If the <Col N="1590" /> corner is turned I hope it is true and when the Minister comes back next year I hope he will be able to give some relief and please let him not forget the agricultural community.</P>

      <P>I do not know how this Budget can be described as a mini-Budget.  In my opinion when the full impact of this new Budget is felt it will deal a major blow to our cost of living and so create new problems. It is an extraordinary situation that only last week we were discussing the Finance (No. 1) Bill and we are discussing Finance (No. 2) Bill today.  It is extraordinary that the Minister was not sufficiently advised, when framing Finance (No. 1) Bill, to include the taxation included in Finance (No. 2) Bill.</P>
      <P>Various things have happened between the framing of Finance (No. 1) Bill and Finance (No. 2) Bill.  We had an election in the offing, and we had people marching up and down outside the gate.  Senator O'Reilly complained today that the poor farmers had no way to put on pressure but I can assure you that no one put on pressure as effectively as the farmers did prior to the Presidential election.  They put on such pressure that they did very well as a result of it.  Dairy farmers certainly have come out well.  I would not say that the farmers who do not go in for dairying have gained nothing at all by what has been given to the farmers in the Finance (No. 2) Bill.  It has not done anything for workers except to force them to pay from the first day it comes into operation 3d a pound more for butter.  The Minister should be advised by people in his Department whose job it is to advise on long-term requirements.  The Minister should have been advised at the time of the first Budget and not come along scourging the people within a few months with a second Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the new Budget solved our requirements, I would be inclined to support it fully.  It does not solve our requirements as regards houses, hospitals or schools, for example.  In my own county &mdash; Westmeath &mdash; our commitments up to the 19th January last were £134,000 for SDA loans and <Col N="1591" /> grants.  The Minister gave us £92,000 and, while we have approached him again and again to see if more money would be made available to meet our commitments, we have been told we will get no further grants or loans from the Department this year.  The same arises as regards schools.  Schools are held up at the moment in various ways.  You will not be told it is due to shortage of money but you will be told they are being held up as a result of a survey which is being made and which has been going on for quite a long time.  While they have no result of that survey, and as long as that is the case, it will be an excuse to hold up the building of schools.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which has prevented progress and the Government have not shown any worry about it; that is the bank strike.  Every day in the week we are told that the loans will be sanctioned; they will tell you some loans are sanctioned but they cannot get them when the banks are closed and the Government do not seem to be interested in the least in the re-opening of the banks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when there was a deadlock and no one tried to bring about a settlement, or encourage a settlement in any way.  The people of the country think that the Government were absolutely dishonest in introducing this second Budget; that they would not face up to their responsibilities when the first Budget was being framed.  The Government knew this money was required for farmers and yet they would not face the issue when Finance (No. 1) Bill was being thought of.  One of the provisions of the new Budget is the reversion to collection of money by turnover tax.  I remember when Senator Dr. Ryan introduced the turnover tax&mdash;he said that beer and <Col N="1592" /> cigarettes had reached saturation point.  I wonder what has happened since, because beer and cigarettes have been the chief source of revenue and the chief sources of new taxation since the introduction of the turnover tax.</P>
      <P>We find now that the wholesalers and the retailers are both tax collectors. It is the new way to collect tax, having 5 per cent on certain goods and collecting it from the wholesalers.  I understand there is not another country in Europe which collects a turnover tax both on retail and wholesale goods.  When it was first introduced, we opposed the turnover tax bitterly but, when we were beaten with our backs to the wall, we did ask the Minister to take it from the whole community and not have every shopkeeper big and small plagued and worried about the collection of tax.  Everyone knows how some small shopkeepers run their business; they have no help; they must go in and out to do other jobs and it is almost an impossibility to know what tax they should send off.  They pick out a figure and apparently the Government are satisfied with it but I am quite sure that even they would be getting their money on a smaller turnover by taking it in tax from the suppliers; that it would have turned out a much more remunerative tax and there would, perhaps, be no reason at all why we should have this mini-Budget today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find, too, that the Government accepted guidelines from the Labour Court as regards the £1 a week.  It is rather extraordinary that the various Ministers have failed to honour their obligations.  For example, forestry workers have not got any offer of 20/-a week yet; the Board of Works have not got it and neither have the Land Commission workers got it.  Is it not an extraordinary thing that the Government should turn round and support guidelines from the Labour Court and say: &ldquo;We are in agreement with the £1 for everyone under £1,200&rdquo; and, at the same time, leave their own employees without that £1?  A start should be made by the Government, if they did accept the guidelines, to give the £1 a week to employees of <Col N="1593" /> State Departments and thereby give good example to other people.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House any longer on this Bill; it is not a good one; I do not agree with having tax collected from both the wholesalers and retailers and I know it will have a grave impact on the cost of living because you can take it from me that for every £100 worth of goods the wholesaler gets out he will have to give £5 to the Government but, when he is handing it across to the retailers, he will not be satisfied with his 5 per cent; he will have to collect the extra costs he will have incurred in connection with the sale of the goods.  For that reason, I am opposed to the taxation and the manner in which it is collected under this particular Budget. I regret, too, that it does not solve our problems at all, except that it did appease a certain section of the community&mdash;the dairy farmers.  They were the only people who seemed to be satisfied as a result of this Budget.  I do not know anyone else who is satisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very easy to oppose new tax measures.  From the Labour benches, there seemed to be an echo of the same kind of opposition&mdash; that this taxation was necessitated by an announcement made to draw support in the Presidential election. Actually, I think the announcement was very badly timed; the announcement was not made at a good time at all, so you would not get a large measure of agreement on the timing of it at all.  We have differences of opinion.  Senator FitzGerald is all in favour of indirect taxation while Senator Murphy is totally opposed to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Minister is going a long way to meet both.  He is going half way with each, so he is doing a pretty good job.  What any Minister would tax is probably going to displease that particular section of the people who are actually going to make the contribution, but if one goes around the country these days and tries to find out the prices of two of the commodities mentioned here, petrol and spirits, you find a vast difference <Col N="1594" /> more than the difference in the tax imposed by the Minister in the case of petrol.  The price of premium grade petrol ranges from ? to 5/10, so that there must be a margin here that is bound to catch the Minister's eye.  If this kind of profit can vary even in a short distance from one town to another the Minister is bound to see that there is money there that can be taken.</P>
    <P>I am very much surprised at Senator Murphy and the Labour Party opposing this Bill, because if the contribution to the farmers is coming late nevertheless it is a contribution that is going to the agricultural community and they are entitled to their share and to their increase.  For that reason I find it very difficult to reconcile the Labour Party view on this.  Certainly there are a lot of places where money can be spent.  We need a lot more money for education and for various services, and we will never reach the day when we will not need in excess of the amount we have.  I consider that the Minister is doing an excellent job, and that regardless of how they opposed him the public are becoming harder to mislead and see that though the Opposition have done a tremendous job in trying to mislead them the public are well aware of what is actually provided when he has got something to provide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill is, of course, one of the rare opportunities we get in this House of agreeing with, or criticising where we think it necessary to criticise, the broad lines of Government policy.  As one of those who offered to speak on the main Bill I take it that we are free to comment in general terms on that policy on this Bill.  I should like to join with the Members of the House who have paid proper tribute to the Minister here for what he has tried to do in this particular task of his.  It is not a very easy one.  I fully appreciate that, and to a certain extent any Minister for Finance dealing with the affairs of any country passing through the phase we are passing through at the moment is entitled to expect a certain amount of sympathy or at least understanding on the part <Col N="1595" /> of most people in the community.  I should like, therefore, to begin in all fairness by welcoming what the Minister is trying to do in one or two respects in this particular Bill, speaking now on the main Bill.  As one of those who had the opportunity during the year of drawing the Minister's attention to certain anomalies that were in the 1965 Act in so far as it affected estate duty, I am glad to see that the Minister, on having his attention drawn to it, is very properly and appropriately making provisions in this Bill for removing certain anomalous impositions particularly at the upper limits of the new rates of estate duty, under which now there are certain marginal reliefs provided for in the new Bill. Again&mdash;I have made this comment already&mdash;it is in all fairness due to him to acknowledge that he has likewise faced up to his responsibilities in the improvements which he has effected in the increased rates of allowances for children over 11 years of age and within the category where education is so important, when education, naturally, in this country is such an additional burden on parents generally.  These are some of the improvements that the Minister ought to get credit for when introducing this Bill, and it would be very unfair to him if we did not at least advert to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I must, like most of the other speakers, I am afraid, say that regardless of what sympathy or understanding we may have for the Minister's predicament we have to look at this particular piece of legislation each year coldly, analytically and objectively if possible, but at all times we have to view it in the context or against the background of the economic scene as we find it generally throughout the country.  One of the features of this debate has been the absence of any intensive comment on where we are, in fact, standing in such fields as employment or unemployment as the case may be, emigration, and so on.  It is important, therefore, that we ought to bear in mind the facts in respect of our economic life when we are discussing this Bill.  I want to refer <Col N="1596" /> to the latest statistics published by the statistics department over the past 12 or 15 months&mdash;I think the figures I am quoting are actually the latest available&mdash;to the 17th June, which incidentally only refer to the number of unemployment claims current.  Unemployment has increased very sharply over the past 12 months.  On the 17th June last the total number of registered unemployed was 42,462 of whom 34,269 were men, bread winners.  Comparable figures for previous years are not available in that bracket, as the unemployment figures have been compiled on a new basis since the beginning of this year, so that accurate comparison is not possible.  However, the number for unemployment benefits claims current on the 17th June last was 5,306 or an increase of one fourth in the corresponding figure a year ago. The unemployment rate among insured persons at mid-April was 6.6 compared with 6.3 last year.  So much for unemployment.</P>
    <P>Turning to the numbers in employment we find that the total number of people in employment fell last year for the first time since 1961.  The number actually at work was 7,000 fewer than in 1964.  The facts are that although we actually had an increase of some 4,000 people in industry and approximately another 3,000 in services generally, giving roughly 7,000 people all told, we actually have that figure offset by a drop of 14,000 in the number of people employed in agriculture, leaving us with 7,000 people fewer in employment in this country this year than we had in 1964.</P>
    <P>The total number of people at work in April was 1,050,000, of whom some 330,000 were employed in agriculture, roughly about one-third.  It might surprise some people to realise that the total number of people employed in industry, as compared with agriculture, was only 291,000.  In addition, we have some 421,000 people employed in the various services, transport, communications, and so on.</P>
    <P>We should bear these figures prominently in mind because the Finance Bill each year should be regarded as the exercise by which the Government <Col N="1597" /> of the day would endeavour to do something about these trends.  Candidly, I do not think this Bill will go very far towards arresting those trends. We have additional taxation imposed which will add to some of the problems these figures reveal.  Indeed, these figures do not give the whole picture because, as will be noted, over very much the same period there has been an increase of not less than 2.3 per cent in the consumer price index, an increase of 4.7 per cent in what might be described as import prices, and an increase of 1.0 per cent in wholesale prices.  Finally, of course, you have to look at some of the real consequences of these trends.</P>
    <P>We have to take into account the fact that these trends can only be arrested by a new and dynamic approach on the part of the responsible Ministry if, in fact, they are to be arrested at all.  We had one or two disquieting experiences during the past year which I am sure have set quite a number of people seriously to think. One of the matters to which I should like to advert very briefly is the failure of the attempt on the part of the Government during the past year to secure any practical support in their effort to raise a fairly insignificant amount of money on the foreign currency markets.  I think the loan which the Government sought to raise on the New York market some time during the year did not amount to more than £10 million.  It must have come as a shock to some people to realise that we could not draw on our credit to the tune of that amount on the American market.</P>
    <P>I have adverted more than once in the past in this House to one or two rather extraordinary features of our economy and administration.  I have referred to the amount of money which leaves this country year after year by way of life assurance premiums.  I will not bore the House by quoting the figures.  They have been published and given widespread publicity from time to time.  The fact is that the amount of money which is still leaving the country by way of life assurance premiums by Irish citizens with foreign companies is still increasing.  It is at a <Col N="1598" /> higher rate than the rate at which we are expanding that business in the country.  This is something the Government must sooner or later do something about.</P>
    <P>While the Minister for Finance held another portfolio he endeavoured in response to some of our exhortations to do something about that.  I think he came back to both Houses and reported that he had secured an agreement with some of the foreign companies operating here under which they had undertaken to provide investments here over a period of years that would be sufficient to cover the liabilities they were undertaking in this country.  My grouse is that the Minister's approach to this matter was not what I thought it might have been and should have been.  It is high time for the Government to realise that they have a responsibility and a duty to our own citizens.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister should make that sort of approach to those people.  His duty and responsibility is to tell those people plainly that if they want to operate in this country in life assurance, and to continue to expand their sales of life assurance, they will be permitted to do so only so long as they are prepared to maintain inside this country enough money by way of investment in Irish securities to cover the liabilities they are incurring through Irish policy holders.  I do not think that is asking too much of them. In fact, I doubt if they would get away with as modest a restriction as that in any other country in the world.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in the light of our experiences during the past year, in the light of the conditions which we are reviewing at the moment, and, above all, in the light of the Minister's obligation to our own people, it is time the Minister did something effective about those problems.  Those are my observations on this Bill.  I do not propose at this hour and at this stage to hold up the House any longer.  I urge on the Minister that the time is now ripe for something effective to be done about the problems to which I have alluded.</P>

      <P>In the circumstances <Col N="1599" /> of the time at our disposal I wish to make a very brief intervention in the debate on a very significant issue.  On the last occasion when the Finance Bill was before the House I put this point in the form of a question to the Minister, and I would have been content if he had not ignored the question in his reply which, unfortunately, he did.  Unfortunately also, we always seem to run short of time here, and perhaps some Senators are not as considerate as they might be in that regard.</P>
      <P>I want to say a word on behalf of a very weak section of our community which to my mind has been entirely neglected in the budgetary provisions of the current year.  I refer to the group of retired State servants who are striving to exist on pensions awarded to them some years ago on the basis of salaries which have since come to be regarded as entirely inadequate for the services from which they have retired. The group includes all categories of teachers, and civil servants, and personnel of other institutions paid from State funds.  I proposed originally to restate their case, but I hardly think it is necessary because the Minister is fully aware of their deteriorating economic conditions.  He is also aware of the justice of their claim.  They met him by way of deputation and I am told he listened very sympathetically to them, as he is well capable of doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He told them then that he would consider the position.  Unfortunately for them, they have no power beyond their vocal power to make their presence felt; as a pressure group they have no influence at all and are forced to rely exclusively on the social conscience and sense of fair play of the Minister. It is little consolation for them to be assured that there is no money in the kitty to meet their claim.  They feel all the more aggrieved because they are the only section in the country least able to bear the increasing burden of taxation and rising costs.  In these circumstances, will the Minister say in his reply what prospects he will hold out of alleviating their distress?  I ask him to issue some message of hope to them. They are people who have served their <Col N="1600" /> country well in their time and they are waiting on the Minister's words and looking solely to him to relieve their distress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I shall not take too long.  I concluded reasonably comprehensively on the first Finance Bill.  While I expected some new speakers today, I did not expect them to be so numerous or some of them to be so comprehensive.  I shall deal first with one who was not so comprehensive. I refer to the suggestion by Senator FitzGerald that the wholesale tax, if it was necessary, rendered the turnover tax unnecessary.  I shall take up a few other points made by other Senators suggesting that the wholesale tax as now introduced would have sufficed at the time the turnover tax was introduced.</P>
      <P>Many of the arguments made by Senators were based on the wrong premise in that the wholesale tax is a tax on sales of goods at a certain level. A turnover tax is a tax on retail turnover, including sales of goods and services.  Therefore, they are not one and the same thing at all from that point of view and possibly from the point of view of getting a little from one or the other.  It must be remembered that the turnover tax is almost of universal application.  There have been some exceptions but its base is sufficiently wide to ensure that a low rate of tax brings in a reasonably adequate return.</P>
      <P>A selective wholesale tax must of necessity be on a much more restricted base and, therefore, the amount of money on which taxation can be imposed is more strictly limited.  In order to get a return comparable to that from the retail tax, the rate would have to be inordinately high.  In this case it would have to be as high as 20 per cent&mdash;indeed I do not think 20 per cent would be high enough&mdash;in order to get a comparable return.  I do not think anybody would suggest that we ought to impose a selective wholesale tax at that level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald said that since we have a selective wholesale tax now we could eliminate the retail turnover tax by making the wholesaler bear all <Col N="1601" /> the burden and by making him also look after the accounts.  He said there was no answer to that and he said that cascading of the tax should not occur because the power of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to restrict profits could be invoked.  I can assure the Senator that it is very difficult to avoid a marking up by a wholesaler from his supplier or by a retailer from a wholesaler.  That often amounts to 30 per cent, so if you impose a tax at an early stage the ultimate tax will have borne these various marked up prices and that would pass on to the consumer without a commensurate return to the Exchequer.  The wholesale tax is not on all goods covered by the turnover tax, only on a selective range.</P>
    <P>Many goods find their way to retail outlets that never pass through a wholesaler at all&mdash;goods bought in markets, perhaps, like agricultural produce bought for home consumption and things of that nature.  The Senator has forgotten completely that the turnover tax covers services as well.  It covers ordinary services like haircuts and things of that nature.  I think the argument against Senator FitzGerald's contention in this respect is far too convincing.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to what the impact of this tax will be.  Senator Murphy said it would generate another demand for increased wages.  This tax will be applied, as far as possible, to goods of a luxury character and of a less essential nature.  The whole range of consumer expenditure in this country is of the order of £700 million a year. The selective nature of this tax will reduce the base of the tax to £100 million, in other words, one seventh of total consumer expenditure.  In the current year we hope to get into the revenue by way of this tax £1½ million. If we take that figure as a fraction of total consumer expenditure of £700 million, we get a figure of imposition on the average person who buys goods of 3/14ths of one per cent for this year. It will take a lot of convincing for the unions to be able to argue that this is the basis for a widespread wage increase.</P>
    <P>Let me take another example which <Col N="1602" /> might be a fairer one&mdash;the effect of the tax in a full year.  I take £700 million total consumer expenditure and the tax base as £100 million.  The yield in a full year is estimated at £5 million which is 0.7 of one per cent of the total consumer expenditure.  If this level is averaged over everybody who buys goods and we take a man who earns £20 a week, as many people do, the impact on his £20 a week of this tax would be 2/9d, which is, indeed, a very limited impost.  The person with £10 a week, if he spends on the same level, will only have to pay 1/4½d, and so on down the scale.  Therefore, I suggest that Senator Murphy's argument in favour of another widespread wage increase demand is not very well based.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come to a few of the general comments that were made in the course of the debate. When Senator McDonald was speaking I did some more sums.  The Senator made reference to a decline in building and construction.  I should like to refer the Senator to the booklet published with the 1966 Budget, and in particular to Table 7, and he will see that between 1961-62 and 1966-67 expenditure on building and construction increased from £15.2 million to £34.4 million, rather more than a 100 per cent increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That was increased costs.  There was not an increase in living accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a second and the Senator will find that my figures will answer his interjection. Housing alone accounted for £9.67 million in 1960-61 and it increased to £21.84 million in the current year.  That is an increase, in my estimation, of about 125 per cent.  I now want to refer to schools.  I am sorry Senator FitzGerald is not here or that Senator Quinlan is not here either. They made some comments on the extent to which school building was being neglected.  We find from this Table that there was an expenditure <Col N="1603" /> for school building of £1.69 million in 1960-61 and almost £5 million in the current year.  That is an increase of almost 200 per cent.  The increase in hospital expenditure went from £0.86 million to £3.14 million in the same period, an increase of about 270 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is there and it will be provided in the current year. Senator FitzGerald made some references to the fact that we were getting more taxes but that this was not reflected in increased expenditure on social services or education.  If you take even a shorter period&mdash;I will not take a longer period because the percentage increases might be too staggering for the Opposition members&mdash; we find that in 1963-64 we spent just short of £31 million on social services. That was social welfare payments.  In the current year we are providing £42.2 million.  In my working out, that represents an increase of about 40 per cent.  In 1963-64 we spent £20.6 million on education and in 1966-67, the current year, we are spending £30.5 million.  That is an increase of just under 50 per cent.  In 1963-64 we spent £11.7 million on health and in the current year we are spending £16.4 million. That is an increase of 40 per cent.  That indicates very clearly that Senator FitzGerald's suggestion that the increase in taxation over those years has not been reflected in the increased expenditure on education is not correct. Those figures show very clearly it has.</P>
      <P>We will now come to the number of houses.  Senator Rooney mentioned that the figures I have given did not reflect increased housing.  In 1964 there were 8,064 houses built.  In 1965 there were 10,900 odd houses completed.  In the current year we will almost equal that figure.  It will be between 10,700 and 10,900.</P>

      <P>I can give the breakdown. In 1960-61 the total was 5,800, of which 1,500 were local authority houses.  In 1965-66 out of the figure I gave, 10,900, we find that approximately 3,000 houses were provided by local authorities.  The rest were private grant-built houses.  That represents a virtual doubling of the number of houses built between 1960-61 and the current year.</P>

      <P>Substantial progress has obviously been made in the building programme.  I can assure the House that roughly the same level of expenditure will be maintained next year.  It will possibly be even higher than it was this year over last year.  It is not unreasonable to suggest that we must wait for a further capital upsurge, and until the necessary capital resources become available to us.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to develop my point in case I am accused, as Senator Ó Conalláin has already accused another Minister, of not dealing with the point.  In 1965 a sum of £400,000 <Col N="1605" /> was provided for an increase in pensions to public servants who retired before the 15th December, 1959.  That was done to compensate them for the rise in the cost of living between November, 1959 and February, 1964. That brought them up roughly to the eighth round increase in the cost of living.  That increase was made available from 1st August, 1965.  It costs at the present time £600,000 in a full year.  That was the fourth consecutive budget increase granted by my predecessor to those pensioners.  I said, when I was speaking on the television debate on the Budget the last time, that I was sorry I was unable in the prevailing circumstances because of difficulty in finding the necessary money to increase a lot of things and that I was not able to provide a little more for pensioners. I naturally had sympathy for their position and I do, naturally, as soon as circumstances permit, hope to continue as my predecessor did in giving them reasonable increases to account for the cost of living increases that will have occurred in the meantime.  I know these pensioners have another problem in that there have been certain increases, not only cost of living increases, given to public servants at the present time.  There are status increases as well and they complain that they were doing the same work as their successors or those who continued on working are doing now and that, especially, the status increases had not been taken into account.</P>
      <P>It is an arguable point for the person who is enjoying a certain level of salary, and who gets a pension in proportion to that level of salary, whether he should continue to get status increases concomitant with those who are still working.  It is an arguable point but, however, I want to assure the Senator that I am not shutting out of my mind the possibility of doing my share in due time for those pensioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to come back to Senator Murphy.  He referred to the cynical approach of introducing <Col N="1606" /> a Budget and then introducing another Budget, having given certain benefits before an election and introducing the necessary taxation after the election. In dealing with this point I hope to answer a few points made by other Senators also.  First of all, I said in my March speech that I was covering known expenditure, expenditure that I knew would have to be provided for in the current year.  At that time I knew there was a demand from the farmers for increased income.  I knew there was a demand from workers generally for increases in their level of wages.  I said publicly at the time, and I repeat again, that it was anticipated and agreed on with the farmers' organisations that farmers' incomes would increase by about £6 million in that year which would be roughly comparable with the increase in incomes from non-farming activities.</P>
      <P>At that time, too, I readily admit the weather was not good.  In fact, there was an improvement in the weather around the Budget time, in the week from the Budget to St. Patrick's Day but it deteriorated again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the Budget brought in good weather.  The week from the Budget to St. Patrick's Day was a glorious week.  Speaking from an agricultural point of view, that kind of weather did not last and it became obvious because of the lack of growth in grass that the income, especially of the dairy farmers, would not be as high as we were entitled to anticipate.  As well as that, and this is in answer to Senator McAuliffe's point, it is not the practice for the State to lead in fixing the levels of wages.  It is the practice that the State, in dealing with their employees, follow what are described as the down-town rates.  At that time the down-town rates had not been settled.  I said, and I repeat, that what I said was right from the economic point of view, that assuming we had about 3½ per cent growth in our GNP, or in productivity, that would provide for an increase in wages of about 3 per cent. Otherwise, if wages increased more than the increase in productivity there <Col N="1607" /> would be a corresponding decline in the real value of wage increases.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, this was being fought out in the private sector and there were a number of negotiations going on and a number of strikes had already taken place.  Eventually, the Labour Court in dealing with one or two of those strikes came out with a statement in which they set out their guideline, that there might be an increase of £1 for adults and 15/- for females and juvenile workers but it was possible that some employments might not be able to afford even that, and they suggested that workers claiming increases ought to act with restraint especially in dealing with employers whose business and profitability would not be able to carry the increases.</P>
      <P>However, the £1 and 15/- had been granted more or less generally, and certainly to those who had been negotiating settlements.  The Government expected that but it did not invalidate in any way what I had said, and what the Government endorsed, about the increase in wage rates being related to the projected increase in productivity. The Government accepted it because, in their judgement, as in the judgement of the Labour Court, they felt that less damage would be done to the economy by accepting that level of wage increases as against a succession of stoppages of work which would have depressed economic output and industrial output and which would have caused a worse decline in the economy than the grant of wage increases in excess of what would be appropriate according to the increase in productivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going back to Senator McAuliffe's point, there are at present negotiations in train between the official side as it is called in the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration proceedings and the staff panel side.  That is not a question of £1 and 15/- only.  There are within the Civil Service other categories who are in not absolutely fulltime employment.  There are differences and shades of differences that have to be taken into account.  These are being worked out and I understand <Col N="1608" /> there will be another meeting between the staff side and the official side tomorrow at which I think the matter will be almost finally decided.  I think the points at issue now are reduced to very few and I am confident&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so much £1 and 15/-.  It is the minor points that have to be settled and I am sure Senator McAuliffe will know that the issue in an industrial dispute is not so straight that one can draw a line through it and say: &ldquo;That is that&rdquo;. Of course, I am not suggesting there is an industrial dispute here; there are negotiations going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been speaking on economic points for so often and so long that I am beginning to get tied up in what I said before and I wonder if what I have said before is relevant to what I will say now.  One thing is relevant to what I will say now and it is the repeated suggestion that we failed to get a loan in New York and the repeated allegation that it is disreputable in present circumstances for a Government to look for money abroad.  I did not say that but I want to repeat what I did say and that is my difficulty in trying to disentangle what has been said in the debates to which I am referring.  Almost all the progressive countries we know have gone into the foreign bond market to get capital to supplement their home resources for economic development and expansion and these countries include, and I shall spell them out again, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Japan and even the United States and Britain have been using this device of going outside their own country and encouraging or inducing voluntary investment of capital, and most of the others have been going out and negotiating bond issues.  As far as this dollar loan is concerned, these are not dollars in the United States but dollars held in Europe called Euro-dollars by Europeans or by US citizens.  US citizens might not want to repatriate dollars for one reason or another; European citizens might want to hold them in Europe for <Col N="1609" /> their own good reasons&mdash;possibly to support the strength of their own currencies. But at the time we went for that loan, the United States, having already imposed what is known as the interest-equalisation tax, brought Ireland within the ambit of that interest-equalisation tax; in other words it would have obliged us, if we went for a loan of dollars in New York, to pay one per cent more than if we got dollars outside.  Therefore, we had no immediate interest and we did not apply at all for dollars in New York.</P>
    <P>We went then for the Euro-dollars but, in addition to the imposition of the interest-equalisation tax, the United States Government decided to get after these Euro-dollars for their own development and encourage all their own big international trading and big international manufacturing companies to get after these dollars, and most of them did.  Not only did they pay the going rates, which were probably 6½ per cent to 7 per cent at the time, but they gave the right at the end of a specified period to convert the loans into the equities of the company. No country could compete, number one, with giving more than the going rates and, secondly, certainly not with the prospect of converting the loan into equities which might bring in 20 per cent or 25 per cent to the lender.  A lot of people, including ourselves, had to pull back from that market because this was too serious for us and amongst these was an international body of very sound standing &mdash;the European Coal and Steel Company&mdash;which was going after that money as we were to proceed with their economic development.  Therefore, we did not go after the Euro-dollars; we went elsewhere.  We got our £7 million Deutschemark sterling loan.  We have got a £5 million loan from the Bank of Nova Scotia.  I suggest that rather than in any way denigrating ourselves or our economy, that establishes our credit-worthiness in the world, establishes us as a forward-looking country.  We are doing exactly what every other country in Europe and, indeed, in Australasia, is doing in order to expand their economies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1610" /> The important thing, of course, is to restrict that foreign borrowing to the minimum and to ensure that, to the extent to which we do borrow, we will apply the proceeds to the capital expenditure of the highest possible productive nature.  That is what we propose to do.</P>

      <P>Senator Crowley also mentioned this idea of foreign insurance companies coming in here, getting their premiums and bringing them out of the country for investment abroad. Of course, we must remember we cannot live in a completely insular state.  We have to realise that there has to be a flow of money between this country and, particularly, the United Kingdom.  When it comes to capital investment from Ireland into the United Kingdom and from the United Kingdom into here, we come off the better.  In the case of insurance policies effected here, of course, the premiums &mdash;in so far as they are paid to British companies&mdash;go out of the country. But, first of all, we must remember that we have certain built-in protection <Col N="1611" /> for Irish insurance companies, just as we have built-in protection for Irish industries.  As well as that, we have an arrangement with the British companies that they will plough back an increasing percentage over the years of their premiums derived from Irish insurances back into our country.  That was commenced&mdash;I am not claiming credit for it&mdash;when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce; it was put in <Col N="1612" /> train before that.  But I am informed that the British companies are living well up to their bargain.  They are doing their best to find increased outlets for investment in this country.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into any other points and, if I have not answered any Senators' particular points, it was not because I wanted to dodge them but they just do not occur to me at the moment.</P>
