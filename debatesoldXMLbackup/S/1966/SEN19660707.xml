      <P>I should like to raise a matter about the division bells last night.  The division bells did not ring in the Party room and as a result four members, including myself, were locked out when we came here as a result of a telephone call.  We could not attend the division because we were locked out and the bell did not ring in the Party room.  I should like the Chair to do something to ensure that that will not occur again.</P>

      <P>Might I take this opportunity, before <Col N="1614" /> going on to deal with section 1, to offer an apology to the House for a misunderstanding on my part last night as a result of which I understand the House was waiting for me to return. It was a misunderstanding on my part and, in fact, I was moving the same motion in the Dáil while the House was waiting for my return.  I want to apologise for the misunderstanding.</P>

      <P>Section 1 is the interpretation section and I am wondering if I am correct in understanding that in this Bill we are now imposing a tax on electricity, that we are increasing the cost of electricity to manufacturers and to ordinary consumers. It is my understanding of the first paragraph of section 1, that the cost of electricity will be increased by five per cent as a result of this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>No, this is the interpretation section. The purpose is to include the generation of electricity within the definition of manufacturer.  The production of gas is regarded as an activity in goods. Coal gas is within the category of goods but electricity is not.  The definition brings the generation of electricity into that category.  That permits of the registration of the Electricity Supply Board as a wholesaler so that they can purchase the necessary equipment and raw materials for the generation of electricity without having to pay tax.</P>

      <P>On the section, it is my understanding that the Minister will have power to exempt any goods other than those listed at the very end of the section, or is it only those ones?  In subsection (5) (b) (ii) there is reference to any activity which is declared by the Minister for Finance for the purpose of the section to be exempt and then there is a list of items following.  Is the idea that the items under subsection (5) (b) (iii) are absolutely exempt subject to definitions but that under subparagraph (ii) the Minister may further exempt any other article?  If that is the case, how wide a discretion are we giving to the Minister as regards definition?  There seems to be a distinction here that for these particular articles there is to be exemption subject to definition, but the <Col N="1616" /> Minister has a further power in the other subparagraph to exempt any other goods which he wants to exclude. How is it supposed to work and how much discretion are we giving to the Minister in regard to exempting the articles?</P>
      <P>It seems that under subparagraph (iii) a list of goods are exempted but the Minister has the discretion to get them in again by defining articles which are not food, drink and tobacco. Is it simply a method of defining precisely what is food?  Secondly, how does the Minister propose to exercise his powers under subparagraph (ii) as regards exempting other goods?  It seems to give him a very wide discretion. Is there an implicit idea that he may use it in a broad way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first question is yes: the Minister will have the function of defining but it will come within a very narrow range&mdash;it will be in a very marginal area that the Minister will have power of definition.  The purpose of subparagraph (iii) is to define more precisely&mdash;and it will be done at a very early date&mdash;which goods are excluded.  I may say generally that the purpose of these orders will be the exclusion rather than the inclusion of anything.  The Minister cannot do any more than the Oireachtas gives him power to do but he can narrow the field by taking out of the range of tax, sales of goods which are regarded as marginal. In effect, the Minister's area of definition will be very limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that approximately 500 business firms will be required to keep two sets of records&mdash;under the 1963 turnover tax system and under this Bill?  Apparently it will involve large and small firms.  The Minister says he has discretion regarding the exclusion of a number of items subject to the provisions of this section.  If the Minister has such discretion, can he give an undertaking now to use it for the purpose of preventing increases in the cost of houses as a result of the effects of this Bill?  The Minister's own estimate <Col N="1617" /> is an approximate two per cent increase on the cost of houses which, on a house of £5,000, works out at £100.  Other people estimate that the effect of the Bill will be a four per cent increase in the cost of houses, which will mean £200.</P>
      <P>It appears the effect of this Bill will be to increase the cost of houses by between £100 and £200 each.  The Minister says he has discretion to eliminate items which are subject to this Bill.  The housing situation is so drastic and the need is so urgent to have houses erected as quickly as possible that he should take steps to use this discretion.</P>
      <P>It is certain that this Bill will cause another round of wage demands because of increased costs in the end product.  It may seem a small imposition at its origin but when it gets to the consumer through the retailer this tax will be much more than the base amount.  The turnover tax of 2½ per cent ultimately became an 8 per cent cost when it got to the consumer.  If the 5 per cent on these goods will have the same effect and chain reaction down along the line we can take it that eventually the consumer will be saddled with a charge of approximately 16 per cent, assuming that this is double the amount of the turnover tax.  It certainly looks as if we will have a situation in which this tax will be a gross 10 per cent on the original figure with the chain reaction down along the line.  It will certainly increase the cost of living and push prices higher than they are at present.  No steps have been taken in this Bill to ensure that this chain reaction will not take place.  In so far as it will affect housing loans or grants as a result of the increased prices in addition to the payment of loans it is a very serious matter.  There is another point here, too.  I do not know whether it is under this section or not&mdash;the date.</P>

      <P>Another section.  It is rather a pity that Senator Rooney was not here yesterday when Senator Garret FitzGerald was speaking when he gave a fair enough appraisal as to how the impact of this tax could not be permitted to escalate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When he gave what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator indicated that with the present powers of the Minister for Industry and Commerce he was going to suggest that the turnover tax could now be eliminated and placed on the shoulders of the wholesalers in connection with this wholesale tax, and that there might be no danger of prices increasing because of the powers now vested in the Minister for Industry and Commerce in that field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the powers are exercised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Otherwise I can only describe Senator Rooney's remarks as either deliberately malicious in connection with this tax or deliberately designed, as I suspect, to gain political Party advantage out of an ill-considered observation of the Bill.  The suggestion that turnover tax accounted for 8 per cent in the increase in prices since it was introduced is not only inaccurate but completely ridiculous. Since the turnover tax was introduced there has been roughly a 12½ per cent increase, of which turnover tax accounted for 3 per cent and an increase in wages and incomes accounted mainly for the balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>An increase in prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It contributed to some of the price increases but also to incomes.  There were price increases amounting to about 12½ per cent of which the turnover tax accounted for no more than 3 per cent.  I indicated last night what the effect of this tax is likely to be.  Assuming a range of consumption expenditure to be annually about £700 million the range on which this tax will be based is about £100 million, on which it is expected that £1,500,000 will come to the Exchequer in the current year as a result of the imposition of this tax, which is about three-fourteenth parts of one per cent in the current year, and in the full year it will amount to not more than 0.7 of one per cent. <Col N="1619" /> I gave the case of a man with an income of £20, and the impact on his wages would be no more than 2/9 in the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>At least it is worked out on some mathematical basis and not just a malicious shot in the dark like Senator Rooney has taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is that when the turnover tax of 2½ per cent was imposed the trade unions&mdash;and I consider that they adopted a responsible attitude towards it&mdash;made the case that it had caused an increase of up to 14 per cent, and they applied for an increase of 10 per cent in wage levels as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They sought an increase of 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>You will have to hear me out on this.  The Taoiseach made the point that it should not be more than 8 per cent, and the battle went on between the Taoiseach and the trade unions.  They wanted 16 and he wanted 8 and eventually they agreed on the figure of 12 per cent.  That included an increase in the standard of living apart from increased costs, but at least the Taoiseach made the case that they should not claim more than 8 per cent at that time because of the operation of the turnover tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense: The Senator knows that that is complete nonsense. I will withdraw my charge of being malicious and add this, that the Senator did not understand what was happening at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to enter into a debate on the ninth round or the reasons for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not within the section anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with that over-simplification by Senator Rooney.  On the section, which is rather <Col N="1620" /> a large section, I have a few questions to ask.  The first is on subsection (1) where we deal with the limit of £500 for a wholesaler.  I understand that a wholesaler whose turnover in any month does not exceed £500 will not be, in this queer phrase used in this Bill, &ldquo;an accountable person&rdquo;, and will not be subject to this wholesale tax. I can quite appreciate that you reach a stage where it is not worthwhile trying to collect the tax at a certain level. Later in that subsection we are dealing with the manufacturer and here the limit is £150.  The manufacturer with a turnover selling goods not exceeding the total value of £150 in any month is not subject to the tax.  I quite appreciate the sense in excluding a certain limit if you are going to put on this wholesale tax at all.  It does not become worthwhile attempting to collect it at a certain level, but it seems that here you are on a rather slippery slope.</P>
      <P>You are encouraging people to keep below a certain limit and there is a sort of subsidising, in a way, of a person to keep at a very slow pace.  A manufacturer when this Bill is in operation would want to be watching if he is in a small way that he would not go over this £150 per month.  I do not know whether that is very big or small, though I imagine it is very small, and we seem to have the situation that the person who is starting in a small way of business is being put under a little pressure to keep watching that he will stay in a small way of business and will not start growing so as to become liable to this tax.  I think that is dangerous, and I do not like it particularly. I should like the comments of the Minister on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot make any comment on subsection (4) because I do not know what it means at all.  I have read it a few times and it still does not make any sense to me.  The next subsection, subsection (5), deals with exemptions, and here I should like to make a comment on housing, like Senator Rooney.  I do so very deliberately because in my capacity as a trade union representative I have to act for people many of whom are lower paid workers.  We are all very fond of talking about the white-collar workers and relating them to the <Col N="1621" /> £1,385 or whatever the maximum is for the ESB clerk, a favourite topic of Senator FitzGerald.  But we tend to overlook the fact that quite a good number of people climbing the scale in these various clerical employments are very lowly paid, and the position is that a man who is about to get married, aged 24 or 25, in many cases in those employments is in receipt of £500 or £600 a year, or about £11 a week.  This is a man who, in our present set up, has to go out into the open market and try to borrow money in order to purchase a house.  He is not catered for by local authorities.  He is one of the excluded grades.  He is not eligible for housing by them.  The general position is that this sort of person has to go out and borrow money from the local authorities or insurance companies and pay, not the £500 mentioned by Senator Rooney, but possibly £3,000 or £4,000.  That man is only earning about £11 or £12 a week.</P>
    <P>Before such a man starts to put a bite into the mouth of his poor bride, himself, or the children when they come along, he has to pay out £5 or £6 a week in repayments.  This is a very serious problem.  I am very conscious of this because this is a fact which tends to to be overlooked in the structure of our society.  We hear a lot of talk about the lower paid workers.  I have every sympathy with them but I have greater sympathy with the sort of people who are not catered for by local authorities and who have to go out into the open market in order to purchase a house.</P>
    <P>We are, in this section, deliberately increasing the price of housing for those people.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;Of course, it is only five per cent.  It only means a certain amount.&rdquo;  That may be true but it means that the cost of houses will go up for those people. The more important point here is that the person has to borrow a larger sum of money and the cost of repayments will be greater and will, therefore, place a much heavier burden on those people.</P>
    <P>The Minister, with the power he will be getting under paragraph (ii) of this subsection, should look at the possibility of exempting housing up to a <Col N="1622" /> certain limit.  I am not speaking about the £10,000 house or the £5,000 house. I am speaking about the modest type of house which those people have to purchase.  There is no other way in which they can provide a house for themselves.  They are already in very serious financial difficulties.  I hope the Minister will look at the possibility of this.  I am not trying to make a political point or trying to be in any way malicious.  This is a very serious problem and I hope the Minister will look at the possibility of doing something with regard to houses up to a certain level.</P>
    <P>When we speak about housing we also come to the question of furnishing the house.  I am reminded about somebody remarking in the Dáil that a mink coat could be put down as clothing and we would not be putting a tax on that but we would be putting a tax on other things.  I am not interested in mink coats.  I am talking about the problem of young married people trying to set up a home and the further difficulties that will be created for them here.  Furnishing, for example, will be affected by this 5 per cent wholesale tax.  It is a fantastic problem already for those people and we will make it even more difficult and expensive for them now.  I suppose bedding will be subject to this 5 per cent tax.  I do not know whether this will come under clothing or not.  In other words, the bedding and furnishing that goes into a house will be subject to this 5 per cent tax.  It will certainly make the purchase of a house much more expensive.  I hope the Minister will look at this and see if there is any possibility that he could do something about the power he is taking in paragraph (ii) of this subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, before raising another query, to support Senator Murphy in that.  I think that the purpose of this tax is to raise money by a more selective method than the turnover tax.  This will be placed on goods which are not regarded as essentials.  The idea behind this is one we would all support as a general principle where it is practical to implement it.  The exceptions <Col N="1623" /> which the Minister has made are ones which are reasonable, having regard to this, and having regard to the existing taxation structure on drink, tobacco and hydrocarbon oil, which are so heavily taxed at the moment. We can quite see why they are excluded. Having regard to essentials it says &ldquo;plus shelter&rdquo;.  This takes a very high priority.  It certainly takes a higher priority than some kinds of clothing although one can appreciate the Minister's difficulty in distinguishing between different types of clothing in regard to this tax.</P>
      <P>The Minister should give serious consideration to this covering of shelter, housing.  Apparently, it is the intention to tax articles which in the ordinary way are employed to build a house and articles which are installed in a house when it is built.  Those articles are not normally bought frequently as replacement articles.  I do not know how far this goes but I gather it covers a very wide range of goods.  The Minister's estimate that, by and large, this would raise the cost of a house by 2 per cent is not the opinion of responsible people in the trade nor is it the opinion of responsible people in Government Departments and agencies involved.  A higher figure has been estimated authoritatively.  I generally accept most of the estimates by the Department of Finance but in this instance I rather doubt the 2 per cent. I wonder whether it has been fully and accurately calculated?</P>
      <P>It seems to me that articles, such as sinks, which are employed in the building of a house are not articles which are replaced very often.  They are installed as equipment rather than purchases.  It seems to me that the Minister should exercise the power which he has under subsection (ii) to exclude that range of articles.  I cannot see that the loss in revenue would be that great.  It seems wrong that those articles which can be such a heavy burden on the group Senator Murphy has mentioned should be taxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country, owing to the quite extraordinary inadequacy of the local <Col N="1624" /> government housing programme, which represents a smaller fraction of our total building than anywhere in Europe, anybody who is not virtually destitute, has not got TB and has not got five children, is forced to go out into the open market to get a house. The burden which is placed on the incomes of the people Senator Murphy has mentioned is an intolerable one. We should try to alleviate that burden instead of adding to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to be able to prepare a list of exemptions here which would get rid of most of those problems. There is a wide range of goods which could be specified and which really belong to the building of a house rather than to the current purchases of a family.  On the further question of the equipment of a house one comes up against difficulties.  Carpets and curtains are not alone purchases in regard to a house when it is built. They are current purchases.  Probably the majority of those articles are replacements rather than initial purchases. The Minister will be reluctant to extend instances into this field of current purchases but he should carry it as far as he can and he ought to consider some arrangement under which all this taxation on goods which are bought by people when starting married life and have to be replaced from time to time would be compensated by a marriage bonus of some kind.  I see the need for taxation of this kind.  I sympathise with the Minister when he cannot exempt such articles as curtains and carpets.  He must realise that he is imposing a heavy burden on people who have to buy these things initially. To make a crude calculation, if he provided for every marriage in the country, without any means test, say, £50, it would not cost him more than about one-sixth of the total yield from this taxation.  I am not suggesting that figure nor that it should necessarily be available to everybody, but it ought to be possible out of the proceeds of a tax like this to find some means of giving some compensation to people who are starting a family.</P>
    <P>He is taxing goods which are not current purchases but which are a capital investment.  I commend to him, <Col N="1625" /> therefore, both the exception of goods which are clearly primarily or exclusively purchased in relation to the initial construction of a house or its equipment, or, secondly, some measure of alleviation in a subsequent Budget from this taxation by some type of marriage bonus.  That will give back to people some of what they had to pay out when they are establishing a home and family, at a time when they can least afford it.  Both of these are ideas which flow naturally from this section and ones which the Minister should seriously consider.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to raise is about clarification.  I have read subsection (1) (a) a number of times and I find myself completely confused by the treble negative.  I can cope with a negative and with a double negative but I am always confused with a treble negative.  It is the last negative that gets me down.  The subsection says:</P>
    <P>...that the following persons shall not, save as otherwise provided by this Act, be accountable&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) sellers who are not engaged in selling by wholesale taxable goods or whose monthly receipts from selling by wholesale taxable goods have not in any month exceeded, and are not likely in any month to exceed £500, but exempting any such seller who is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Is this an exception to the exception or an exception to the rule?  As drafted, I cannot make sense of it.  I hope the Minister with his expert advice will be able to tell me what the exceptions under subsections (1) and (2) are.  Can he express in short cogent sentences what subsection (1) (a) means?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with Senator Murphy first.  He raised subsection (4) of section 3 and asked what the meaning of that is.  That simply means that where a person, who has been registered as accountable for the wholesale tax, sells, for example, his debts to somebody else, that somebody else gets the benefit of his sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall make that clearer.  Certain people owe him money, let us say £100, <Col N="1626" /> a third person comes along and says: &ldquo;I will buy your £100 debt for £90 and I will take a chance on collecting it.&rdquo; That third person would be obliged to pay the tax.  It did happen in the turnover tax that retailers in the same position were able to say: Well, I do not own those debts any more, I sold them to somebody else, an agent collected them.  It is the person who collects the money who is liable under that section for the tax.</P>

      <P>With regard to the general point, the impact of the tax as a whole levied on housing, as Deputy Colley, now Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was deputising for me in the Dáil while I was in the Seanad, even though certain journalists said I was indisposed &mdash;I suppose this could be regarded as a place of some asylum from the Dáil&mdash;said in the Dáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley said when deputising for me, that the figure of 4 per cent by which it was alleged the cost of house-building would be increased was wrong.  He said it would not amount to 2 per cent.  There is no very scientific way of working this out but I think Senators will agree that it would not amount to 2 per cent.  Firstly, the cost of building a house is made up by many elements, the principle one of which is the cost of labour, which is estimated at being in the region of 50 per cent.  The cost of labour will not be in any way taxed. As well as that, the basic elements of the physical make-up of the House, such as sand, gravel and cement, and so on, are also exempt and these are calculated to make up about 50 per cent of the balance of the cost of the house, so that, on that basis, you reduce your 5 per cent by one half and that one half again by another one half and you certainly get much less than 2 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of no other way at the moment of calculating it but it is <Col N="1627" /> obvious that the impact would be rather limited.  I would say, too, that, while I cannot give any undertaking, I can broaden the range of the exclusions, the range covered by sand, gravel, cement and so on.  I will, of course, give the matter further consideration when the definitions come to be decided upon.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Exemptions&rdquo; is right.  I cannot understand where Senator FitzGerald got the phrase &ldquo;current purchases&rdquo;, even though I know the context within which he used it.  It was not the intention to confine this to current purchases as such.  I gather what he means is that people starting in life buy certain things initially, and in some cases they have to be replaced at only prolonged intervals and in some cases they have not to be replaced at all.  I must say it was never the intention to exempt even isolated purchases.</P>

      <P>Purchase of a house is a capital investment and is treated as such for all our national accounting purposes and, therefore, the materials that go into it are not current purchases.  What the Minister is saying is that he is now taxing capital investment and not current purchases.  It was not my understanding that the intention was to tax capital investment on dwellings.  I <Col N="1628" /> understood it to be a tax on current purchases as, indeed, the turnover tax is intended to be.  The Minister is introducing a new tax on investment.</P>

      <P>When one comes to make exclusions in the operation of a tax of this nature, one gets into tremendous difficulty, and into fields so wide that the implementation of the tax would hardly be worthwhile.  If I repeat what is in the explanatory memorandum about the treble negative, it might be helpful as far as section 3, subsection (1) (a) is concerned. It says here:</P>
      <P>(a) provides, in effect, that the persons accountable for and liable to pay wholesale tax shall be</P>
      <P>(i)  persons, other than manufacturers, whose wholesale sales of taxable goods exceed £500 a month in value;</P>
      <P>(ii)  manufacturers whose monthly receipts from sales of taxable goods exceed £150; and</P>
      <P>(iii)  retailers whose purchases of taxable goods are made on a similar scale to those of wholesalers;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum is perfectly clear.  It was the Bill which was worrying me. <Col N="1629" /> My question to the Minister is why have the words &ldquo;but excepting any such seller&rdquo; here?  I want to know what is that an exception to?  Is it an exception to the first or the second negative?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all sure that will get us anywhere.  The phrase is &ldquo;that the following persons shall not ...be accountable&rdquo;.  Is the Minister suggesting that the &ldquo;but excepting&rdquo; refers to that particular &ldquo;not&rdquo;; it is not an exception to the phrase &ldquo;sellers who are not engaged in selling&rdquo;.  As a matter of drafting, it is very unsatisfactory to have something saying &ldquo;except&rdquo; which is in a clause which itself is governed by another clause because the effect, of course, could be the direct opposite, depending upon which of the two previous clauses this is an exception to.</P>

      <P>On this question of the increase in the cost of housing as a result of this tax, I would have thought that the calculation involved was one which should be available to the Government and that the Board of Works should be able to furnish it at ten minutes notice, because the percentage of the average constituents going into any average housing scheme is available.  Therefore, the effect of the tax on this could and should have been calculated and made available right at the start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree, as raised by Senator Garret FitzGerald, that this will again hit the newly married couples setting up homes.  I suggest to the Minister that it is not the first time when a tax was being brought in that the Government found a way of compensating any particularly deserving party affected by the tax.  In the debate on the Housing Bill I adverted to something equivalent to <Col N="1630" /> this tax; in other words, the necessity to encourage young people, before marriage, to embark upon a savings campaign which would provide a substantial contribution towards the cost of their housing.  If the Minister could marry the relief to be granted, to offset the present tax, to the necessity for increasing savings by young people prior to marriage, then he would have achieved a very desirable result and something which would be very worthwhile. In other words, grant some kind of additional bonus or increase in interest yield or increased housing grant to people who availed of a savings scheme prior to marriage and who had saved a certain amount.  By that means, both targets would be achieved.  But, in equity, the Government are bound to compensate the newly marrieds for any additional burden likely to be imposed upon them, and which will be imposed upon them, by the tax in Finance (No. 2) Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I raised the point regarding the tax on housing, I also coupled with it the fact that the Minister has taken discretion to exempt goods purchased for the Electricity Supply Board because he considers that an essential service.  He should have regard to the need for housing and he should consider that housing is an essential service for the community and should be one of the end products, if you like, of the goods and services which should be exempted from tax in this case.  The Minister should find it quite easy to ensure that the tax will not be applied to building materials or furniture which will go into new dwelling houses.  He mentioned that a portion of the cost of the houses will not be subject to this tax but, of course, we are discussing the effect of the tax so far as housing is concerned.  Considering he has mentioned that a very large sum of money has been put on paper for the provision of local authority houses this year, it can be expected that a substantial amount of that money will be subscribed towards the payment of tax through the contractors and those who engage in the building of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister should take power here and exercise discretion in <Col N="1631" /> order to exempt building materials used for the construction of new dwellinghouses, whether they be local authority houses or private houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>May I deal with Senator FitzGerald's point again and go through the section rather than the explanatory memorandum?  Section 3, subsection (1) says:</P>
      <P>The person accountable for and liable to pay wholesale tax shall be the seller of goods....</P>
      <P>but the next subsection exempts sellers who are not engaged in selling by wholesale taxable goods; in other words, people who are not wholesalers or whose monthly receipts from selling by wholesale in any one month do not exceed £500.  But there could be, within this definition, people who are manufacturers and selling in a wholesale way.  Therefore, we excluded a manufacturer, or a person who, though selling by retail, may be regarded as a wholesaler; in other words, people who buy bulk purchases from manufacturers and sell through their own retail outlets, such as chain stores.  They are selling by retail but they got their goods on a wholesale basis.  These people are sellers but they are excepted from the exemption.</P>
      <P>Now we have already in subsection (a) excepted sellers who are not selling by wholesale, or wholesalers whose sales do not exceed £500 a month.  Out of that exception we have excepted manufacturers because some manufacturers sell direct to retail outlets.  It would be impractical to catch all manufacturers, and for that reason we have this further exemption of manufacturers whose monthly receipts from selling taxable goods have not in any month exceeded, and are not likely in any month to exceed, £150.  That is a paraphrase of what is there.  I feel sure Senator FitzGerald understands it exactly, unless he is possibly objecting to the pattern or the format of the section as a whole up to the end of subsection (1).  I do not know if I have made myself clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I <Col N="1632" /> want to raise with the Minister.  Does this refer to average monthly receipts or to a specific month?  A manufacturer's average in a year might be only £150 but in one month he might sell £1,500 worth.  I am wondering now does this £150 relate to an average month or to a specific month?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Later on in the section it says that if he runs over £150 in two months in succession he would be caught in the third month. He would have to pay in the third month.  There is no question of averaging. It is a question of taking one month after another.</P>

They refer to the immediately preceding sentence which is &ldquo;sellers... whose monthly receipts from selling by wholesale taxable goods have not in any month exceeded, and are not likely in any month to exceed £500...&rdquo;  Some manufacturers and retailers who are exempted by that exemption are exempted in a very particular sense in line 7 but there is this limited exemption on people whose sales do not exceed £500.  I am not sure the Minister intends this at all, yet that is the way it reads.  I do not think anyone could read it strictly in any other way.  The words &ldquo;excepting any such seller&rdquo; must refer to what is immediately preceding.</P>

We start off in paragraph (a) with sellers who are not wholesalers, and, if they are, whose sales do not exceed £500 a month.  In exempting any such seller we go back again to the word &ldquo;sellers&rdquo; immediately after small (a).  In other words, the small (a) takes the sellers described there out of the liability for tax, but if such seller is a manufacturer or a person who carries on a retail trade on such a scale as to be akin to a wholesaler, he does not get in under (a).  This exemption is meant to apply to a seller who is not engaged in selling by wholesale taxable goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator must have been engaged elsewhere when someone else raised this.  I shall deal with it quickly.  In the generation of electricity the end product is not regarded as coming within the category of goods.  Therefore, for statutory purposes the Electricity Supply Board do not deal in goods.  We have said that the generation of electricity is an <Col N="1634" /> activity within the ambit of these goods. Therefore, we regard the Electricity Supply Board as accountable persons. If one registered wholesaler buys from another registered wholesaler there is no accountability for tax as between them, but the ESB being a registered wholesaler has to buy raw materials such as coal, oil and other equipment necessary for their undertaking.  They are not accountable to other persons from whom they buy because they are registered themselves.  They do not pass on anything except electricity which is not taxable.</P>

    <P>When goods are brought into this country and they are now liable for customs duty, they are defined under the Brussels Nomenclature and it is <Col N="1635" /> that definition an importer has to use in describing goods he has imported. Because of the necessity of customs procedure to define articles in the precise terms of the Brussels Nomenclature, the general terms of exemptions which have been enumerated in section 3 (5) cannot be used here and, therefore, a detailed list in customs terms of the goods exempted from wholesale tax will have to be drawn up.

What is stated here is that tax shall be paid on an article declared in this Finance Bill as being chargeable and so on, but it is not set out that particular people shall be exempted because they pay tax by some other system.  I wonder if the Minister is right in the first part of the statement.  In regard to the second part, I was simply anxious for an assurance that this provision would be used to apply to the import regime engaged in transactions involving commodities identical with a list of articles being sold internally.  I should like an assurance that there will be no differentiation.</P>

      <P>I am relating it to <Col N="1636" /> imports.  I am speaking about items subject to this tax which have not been paid for before 1st October.  It is possible that Government loans and grants may be unpaid and I am suggesting that if people have begun but not completed transactions before 1st October because of delay in the payment of Government grants and loans, they should be excluded from the tax in relation to these transactions.  Some provision should be made to ensure that where applications for loans and grants have been made before 1st October but the loans and grants have not been paid, those concerned who have while awaiting payments of such loans and grants negotiated certain transactions, should be exempt from this tax.  Otherwise, the effect of the Bill will be to compel people to clear their own accounts and have all their payments made, even those depending on loans and grants.</P>

      <P>As far as this section is concerned, the person who imports goods and who has a contract made in connection with them is entitled under the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876 to add to the price of the goods any duty that has in the meantime been imposed. It is intended for the purpose of this section, as far as taxable goods are concerned, to apply the same procedure so as to permit an increase in the price of goods to compensate for the wholesale tax.</P>
      <P>On the general question, even if it is not relevant, I should like to say that a concession of the nature Senator Rooney has suggested was given initially on the application of the turnover tax.  In other words, persons who had certain transactions completed but not paid for before the operative date were permitted to be relieved from payment of turnover tax on such transactions. Subsequently it proved to be the case that there were so many evasions by so many people who deliberately got away with it&mdash;even though the transactions were not contemplated before the operative date they pretended they had been negotiated but not paid for&mdash;that I am afraid I must stick to 1st October as being the operative date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the question yesterday on the Second Stage debate about the turnover tax and the possibility of eliminating the separate administration of it as regards goods in any event and incorporating it with this so that the retailers would not have to continue to fill up forms. Unfortunately, I was not here when the Minister replied but I understand that his reply was that this would not cover cases of services.  I appreciate this, and should have made this clear when I was speaking.  Where you have services that would not be covered by wholesalers you must need to retain the type of administration that you have for the turnover tax.  That is quite acceptable, but what is not acceptable is that where you have retailers selling <Col N="1638" /> goods which have passed through wholesalers in the normal way or are produced by manufacturers, they should have to continue to fill up these forms when without any additional burden the wholesalers involved could carry this by simply paying 2½ per cent on their turnover.</P>
      <P>Some additional wholesalers might have to be brought in over and above those covered by this tax, but they would be already dealing with turnover tax in respect of retailers buying the goods tax paid, so that that would not create any problem.  Maybe I have not fully understood the Minister's reply which I did not hear, but could he not at least eliminate the administration of turnover tax on retailers even if it has to remain in the case of the provision of services?  This seems to be relevant to the question of the care and management of this tax by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that this is relevant but I will be irrelevant for Senator FitzGerald's sake.  I dealt with the point he made on services last night.  He did not refer to the point I made about the danger of the cascading of this tax, that if it is dealt with only at wholesale level ultimately there might be mark-ups passed on at a higher level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only half-finished my argument.  Nevertheless, the danger is there of mark-ups being made effective before the tax is applied.  I said that last night as part of the argument against the point made by the Senator.  I did say, of course, this morning, that there are certain powers now vested in the Minister for Industry and Commerce about the control of prices, but nevertheless, they are not always effective and there is always the danger of mark-ups creeping into the sale value and, therefore, into the percentage added for tax purposes which would have to be carried by the consumer. I did make one other point, and it was that there are many goods coming to the retail shops that never passed <Col N="1639" /> through wholesalers&mdash;bought at fruit and vegetable markets, food coming direct from farmers, etc.  There are a lot of difficulties involved.  As the Senator knows, retailers would not be involved in this tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister's reply is convincing on the question of cascading.  I feel that I am dealing with a skilled practitioner of the three-card trick, that when one thing fails he hops to the other position.  This morning he was using the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had these powers and that he could use them effectively in another direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not entitled to use one argument he made to Senator Rooney and the opposite which he made to me.  I think that if the Minister for Industry and Commerce has powers he will use them effectively.  The Minister this morning clearly implied that he believes the same thing.  His point now is that they are ineffective and, therefore, this cascading of prices might operate.  This tax is to operate on £100 million worth of goods but we have heard nothing up to now from the Minister about this cascading.  It is only mentioned by him when he thinks it is convenient.  This is a very poor form of argument.  There is no problem about cascading with the appeal mechanism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other point the Minister made in this extremely weak defence for imposing a continuing administrative burden on 30,000 retailers is that some of them may buy goods direct from farmers and thereby evade payment of tax.  I can think of nothing that we should be more anxious to achieve than that they should buy direct from farmers, and if some minor incentive can be given to them to avoid middlemen and buy direct from the farmers it should be given effect to.  Why the Minister should take this as a great argument against a change I cannot <Col N="1640" /> understand, but he has failed to meet the case for abolishing the tax in its application to 30,000 retailers.  The Minister has totally failed to reply to the point.  If he cannot do it now he should at least do it next year, study the administrative machinery for this and eliminate the necessity for filling up all those 30,000 forms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they are consequential.  I move recommendation No. 1:</P>
      <P>In pages 3, lines 11 and 12, to delete &ldquo;but excepting any such seller who is&mdash;&rdquo; and between lines 12 and 13 to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) a seller shall be accountable for and liable to pay wholesale tax who is&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This arises out of what was said a few moments ago in an attempt to clear up and make unambiguous both what is obscure and ambiguous in the section. I pointed out that the words &ldquo;but expecting any such seller&rdquo; could be read as applying to the immediately <Col N="1642" /> preceding subclause, that is, &ldquo;and are not likely in any month to exceed £500&rdquo;, or the whole of subsection (a) or could refer back to the main clause. I gather from the discussion of the Minister that the intention is that the people referred to in subsections (1) and (2), manufacturer or retailer, shall be excluded from the operation of the whole of subsection (a), whereas the present wording is ambiguous and may not give effect to what is the Minister's intention.  The simplest way would be to terminate subsection (a) at £500 and put in the new subsection (b) which would include the remainder of (a) and also the present (b) and which would say quite clearly that &ldquo;notwithstanding paragraph (a) a seller shall be accountable for and liable to pay wholesale tax who is (i) a manufacturer of, (ii) a person who makes.&rdquo;  It is a tidying up operation.  The present subparagraph (b) is unnecessary and a separate clause.  I am afraid I have put no verb in my recommendation, I am sorry.  We will have to insert a verb in order to make sense of my subsection (b).</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 2 is not of itself essential.  The same recommendation would be required to convert the present subsection (b) into the new (b) but my particular wording is not satisfactory and would need some slight change.  If the Minister would agree to the first recommendation which would clear matters up we should not have such difficulty in coping with the secondary problem of the second recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I admire Senator FitzGerald's drafting.  He did a good job in a short time and it would seem to me he has conveyed the meaning with a slight omission of the verb in the second recommendation that I understand the section to mean already.  That is the nub of the question.  I am not suggesting the parliamentary draftsman is omniscient in these matters but he is a person whose advice I am prepared to accept.  I want to assure the House that when the purposes of this section were put to him and when his draft appeared and was discussed with him he was satisfied that it was fully <Col N="1643" /> effective by the wording he had already incorporated in section 3 as a whole. I admit it requires careful reading but I do not accept that there is ambiguity in it.</P>
      <P>The Senator suggested particularly that there might be ambiguity in so far as paragraph (a) of subsection (1) is concerned and that the word &ldquo;sellers&rdquo; is used at the beginning of the paragraph and &ldquo;seller&rdquo; is used as the third last word of the paragraph as well, but the latter word &ldquo;seller&rdquo; may, as well, apply to the word &ldquo;sellers&rdquo; at the beginning of the paragraph as the word &ldquo;seller&rdquo; in subsection (1).  I am satisfied that the proper interpretation of this word is that the word &ldquo;seller&rdquo;, the third last word in sub-paragraph (a), refers to the word &ldquo;sellers&rdquo; at the beginning of paragraph (a), and I am satisfied there is no ambiguity whatever in it and reluctantly, much as I admire the Senator's efforts for clarification and I think he succeeded to a degree, I must resist his Recommendation.</P>

      <P>I have been on a number of occasions unhappy at reactions of Ministers on proposed amendments who will not accept them because the parliamentary draftsman did it the other way and he must be right.  I think the Minister said the parliamentary draftsman is not omniscient but he proceeded to treat him as if he were.  The fact is that the Minister is responsible for the Bill, its clarity and its ambiguity.  He is properly advised in this matter but he must be prepared either when a proposal or a suggested amendment is made to consult with the parliamentary draftsman or to have got from him the reasoning that led him to adopt such dubious verbiage or else accept the change which is clearly a clarification.  It is unsatisfactory for Ministers to say &ldquo;I do not understand what it is about, but the parliamentary draftsman said it and I will not accept amendment on it&rdquo;.</P>

That is the reason given. If the Minister explained to me why it is drafted this way and why my recommendation, though to a degree acceptable, is not accepted I would accept it immediately.  I think we must call a halt to the fact that we must accept on faith what the parliamentary draftsman does.  We cannot demand an explanation why he did it; we just have to accept it and any change cannot be accepted because the parliamentary draftsman drafted it that way and has not deigned to explain why he did it that way.  That is what I am objecting to.  I am willing to accept there is a good reason.</P>

    <P>It might be dangerous to accept my recommendation but I do not know enough about it to accept that.

If the reasons were given I would accept it.  I find it very hard to accept that I need not be told the reason why the parliamentary draftsman has done it that way.  We have <Col N="1645" /> had this in this House on a number of occasions recently and I find that this is a most unsatisfactory response from Ministers.  In future Ministers should be prepared to justify the wording in their Bills.  If they get a Bill from the parliamentary draftsman which is ambiguous they should find out why it has been put in that way and if we are given a reasonable argument we are always prepared to accept it.</P>

    <P>This Bill includes the provisions necessary to implement the decision announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Speech in March last to increase the rates of non-contributory old age, blind and widows' pensions and the personal and adult dependent rates of unemployment assistance for persons with no means.  In addition, two important changes in the Social Insurance scheme are being made&mdash;the modification of the contribution conditions for widows' (contributory) pension and the extension of unemployment insurance to cover women employed in private domestic service and in agriculture.  A number of provisions dealing with miscellaneous improvements in the social insurance and social assistance schemes are also included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill is not very long, many of the provisions are, of necessity, drafted by way of reference to existing legislation &mdash; a method which unfortunately can lead to a considerable amount of obscurity in the text. The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill attempts to explain the effects of the various provisions and I trust that Senators will have found it useful and informative.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> The Budget increases are all on the social assistance side this year and I am convinced that, where resources for improving the social services are limited, the bulk of these resources should be devoted to the most deserving groups in the community.  For that reason, the money made available to me this year has been devoted mainly to increasing non-contributory old age, blind and widows' pensions and unemployment assistance for persons who have no means, that is, persons whose means on investigation have already been assessed as nil.  This will benefit some 21,000 old age or blind pensioners out of a total of over 112,000 such pensioners to the extent of 5/- in the weekly rate of pension, while some 6,500 widows out of a total of 22,000 widows will similarly benefit.</P>
    <P>Because the manner of applying the means test to recipients of unemployment assistance differs from that applying in the case of pensioners, the Budget increases could not be applied only to persons with no means without causing a number of anomalies. For unemployment assistance purposes, the existing Acts lay down for the various categories of persons maximum rates of assistance which are payable where the weekly means do not exceed 2/- in the case of a person with no dependants or 5/- in the case of a person with a dependant. The rates of assistance are reduced by 1/- for each further 1/- or part of 1/-of means which the person may have over and above the amount disregarded, 2/- or 5/- as the case may be.  The Budget proposals in relation to unemployment assistance have, therefore, been extended so that every recipient will get some increase.  The maximum rates of unemployment assistance, both urban and rural, for the various categories are being increased by 5/- in the case of persons with no dependants, 10/- in the case of persons with adult dependants and 8/-in the case of persons with child dependants and, at the same time, the disregard of the first 2/- or 5/- of any means is being withdrawn.  Thus, the new maximum rates will be paid to persons with no means and these rates <Col N="1650" /> will be reduced by 1/- for each 1/- or part of 1/- of weekly assessed means.</P>
    <P>I have had in mind for some time the question of modifying the contribution conditions for widow's (contributory) pension.  The present conditions are quite satisfactory in the majority of cases as the requirement of having 156 contributions paid and a yearly average of 39 contributions paid or credited over the last three or five years immediately before the husband's death are comparatively easy conditions to satisfy.  However, they are not satisfactory in cases where the number of contributions during the years immediately prior to the husband's death is low due, say, to a break in insurable employment for any reason and they do not permit of any pension being paid unless the conditions are fully satisfied.</P>
    <P>A number of cases have come to my notice where there had been a considerable amount of insurance over the husband's working life but insufficient contributions in the vital three or five years before his death to qualify the widow for pension.  It could be argued that the man had had the right to become a voluntary contributor and thus to preserve his pension rights but this is of little consolation to the widow who knows that her husband had a large amount of insurance in earlier life which is useless to her for pension purposes.  I propose in the Bill, therefore, to continue the existing requirement of having 156 contributions paid but, where a widow fails to satisfy the existing average test, to provide an alternative test under which the average will be calculated over the full insurance lifetime with full pension being paid if the yearly average so calculated is 48 or more and reduced pensions being paid where the average is less than 48.</P>
    <P>To help meet the cost of the additional contributory pensions which will be payable, there will be an increase of 2d in the rates of employment and voluntary contributions.  Some of the widows who will qualify for contributory pension under the new conditions may also be entitled to widows' (non-contributory) pension which will not be paid where the contributory <Col N="1651" /> pension is better.  Regulations will, however, be made to permit any widow to draw the non-contributory pension in lieu of the contributory pension if the rate of non-contributory pension for which she could qualify would be higher, the contributory pension in any such case being paid from the Social Insurance Fund into the Exchequer to offset in part the cost of the non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Women employed in private domestic service or in agriculture are excluded from the unemployment benefit scheme and I am not satisfied that a good case exists for the continuation of this total exclusion.  I propose, therefore, in the Bill to increase the rates of social insurance contribution payable in respect of these women to include an element in respect of unemployment benefit and to permit the new increased contributions to count for unemployment benefit purposes.  Additional conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit by these women will, however, be prescribed by regulations under existing powers and, while the terms of these additional conditions have yet to be settled, the general intention is to restrict entitlement to unemployment benefit to women with a good employment record over a minimum period, of probably, ten years&mdash; possibly with some scaling down of the requirements beyond that point in step with advancing age.  Because of this restriction of entitlement, the consequential increase in the relevant rates of contribution will only be 1/-a week, of which the employer will pay 7d.</P>
    <P>Apart from the proposals for increasing rates of social insurance contributions in this Bill, other increases in these contribution rates are proposed in the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Bill recently passed by the Oireachtas.  There are reasons why all three increases in contributions should be synchronised and, accordingly, the proposals for increased contributions in this Bill, together with the related provisions, will probably be brought into operation on a date to be appointed by order by the Minister. <Col N="1652" /> It will then be possible to bring the increases in contributions under this Bill and the increases in connection with the Occupational Injuries Scheme into operation on the same day.</P>
    <P>One provision of the Bill is consequential on the increase in the maximum rate of non-contributory old age pension.  This is section 13 which provides that a person who is disqualified for receipt of non-contributory old age pension because he is benefiting under the Old Age (Contributory) Pensions scheme may have the option of drawing the non-contributory pension if he can qualify for it at a higher rate than the payment to which he is entitled under the contributory scheme.  Where a person opts to receive the non-contributory pension, the amount he would otherwise receive under the contributory scheme will be paid out of the Social Insurance Fund to the Exchequer to help meet the cost of the non-contributory pension.  A similar position will arise under the widow's (contributory) pension scheme in relation to widows aged 70 years or more when the new conditions provided in the Bill become operative and section 13 is, therefore, drafted to include widows.</P>
    <P>One of the remaining provisions of the Bill will enable regulations to be made providing for the payment of increases of old age (contributory) pension in respect of qualified children to persons other than the pensioners where the circumstances so warrant. This will extend the power already existing in regard to the increase of pension in respect of an adult dependant which is used, for example, to allow the adult dependant's allowance to be paid directly to the wife where it is clear that the husband is neglecting her.</P>
    <P>Other provisions involve qualified children for the purposes of increases of pension under the Old Age Pensions Acts.  These increases are payable in respect of children for whom the pensioners are receiving children's allowances under the general Children's Allowances Scheme and a blind mother is thus precluded from receiving an increase of her blind pension in respect <Col N="1653" /> of her children where her husband is the person entitled to the children's allowance.  It is proposed to permit the blind mother in such a case to receive an increase of her pension for her children.  The payment of double increases in respect of the same children to both the husband and the wife will be prevented by regulation.</P>
    <P>In some recent cases where widows have lost contributory pension by reason of the default of their late husband's employers in the payment of contributions, I have been advised, in connection with proceedings for recovery of the lost benefit for the widows under section 35 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, that I could not recover more than the net amount of the benefit lost, due allowance being made for the fact that the widow had been paid non-contributory pension.  I am not satisfied that the employer in such circumstances should be allowed to evade his liabilities at the expense of the Exchequer.  The Bill will, therefore, make it clear that the amount repayable by the employer in such a case is the gross amount of benefit lost and that, if assistance has been paid to the beneficiary, it will be repayable to the Exchequer either as part of the gross amount repayable by the employer or, if he has repaid the beneficiary the full amount of the lost benefit, by the beneficiary.</P>
    <P>Finally, the powers in relation to the making of orders in connection with reciprocal agreements with other countries on social security matters are being consolidated and expanded to cover all the main social security schemes administered by my Department. Our ratification of Convention No. 118 of the International Labour Conference made it necessary to obtain such powers in relation to children's allowances and the recent agreement with the United Kingdom on social security matters showed the desirability of having clearly defined powers covering the widest possible range of our schemes.</P>
    <P>I hope that I have given Senators a comprehensive picture of the proposals in the Bill and of their effects.  It may help if I summarise the cost of the <Col N="1654" /> various proposals in the Bill.  On the social assistance side, the total cost will be £694,500 in a full year of which the Budget proposals as amplified will account for £674,500.  There will, however, be savings to the Exchequer consequent on the modification of the widow's (contributory) pension scheme amounting to some £144,000 a year and this will leave the net cost to the Exchequer of the proposals in the Bill as £550,500.  The gross annual cost of the improvements on the social insurance scheme will be £310,000 in a full year of which £288,000 will be met by the increase in contributions leaving the net cost to the Exchequer, £22,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>The improvements in the Social Welfare schemes being provided in this Bill are worthwhile improvements within the limits of the resources available.  The Bill is moreover an indication of the Government's continued interest in developing social welfare services and a continuation of the process of effecting each year such improvements in them as are found possible.  I have pleasure, therefore, in recommending the Bill to Seanad Éireann and I would ask for speedy and favourable consideration for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Bill as a measure which in some way will assist in abating the difficulties which the classes who benefit from our social welfare code are suffering. The benefits provided in this Bill fall far short of the amounts merited by the circumstances of the moment. Frequently we hear Ministerial statements regarding the affluence of our community but it is only when we get a measure like this that we find the Minister's statement studded with references to the resources being limited and that worthwhile improvements are being given within the limits of the resources available.  We have repeated references to &ldquo;resources&rdquo; when it comes to doing something to improve the lot of those least well off among us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though we accept the contents of the Bill as in some way mitigating the hardships which old age pensioners, widows and orphans and unemployed <Col N="1655" /> are undergoing, we must express dissatisfaction at the fact that the Government have not gone further in meeting the requirements of these classes.  We are repeatedly informed that the objects of Budgetary proposals are to collect certain taxes from certain sectors of the community who are in a position to pay for transfer towards the easement of people who cannot maintain even a reasonable standard of living if they are in receipt of assistance from State resources.</P>
    <P>The impact of taxation on those persons has been growing and reducing the benefits intended for them.  We have substantial evidence that long before the recipient gets a penny of the increase intended for him he is obliged, with everybody else in the community, to pay the increased tax.  There have been formidable delays in the implementation of proposals enshrined in Budgets.  These delays, no doubt the Minister will say, are caused by administration difficulties involved in the preparation of new payments but it is surprising the alacrity with which the Minister for Finance can go into action in extracting the taxation we are told is intended for the benefit of these people.  We all realise that we are catering for people of an age group who may not survive to get a penny of the increased benefits.  There is urgency from that point of view alone in the more speedy payment of increased benefits.  How often have we made representations to the Minister's Department about old age pensions, and, due to inordinate delays in recent years, found that many of those aged people have been called to their reward before a decision emanated from the Department?  Other people, such as the unemployed, are seriously affected by cost of living increases.  In the circumstances, many of them have to reduce their intake of normal requirements to maintain life while awaiting these increases.</P>
    <P>Consequently, the fact that there was such an early indication of the financial requirements this year in an extraordinarily early Budget, it should have been possible for the Minister to ensure that the payment of increased benefits <Col N="1656" /> is made at an earlier date.  I agree with Senator Quinlan that from the point of view of public relations it would be worthwhile, when framing Budget policy, to marry the taxable impost to the benefits for which the taxation is intended.  Not so long ago, when a special tax was placed on simple luxuries for the benefit of a slight increase in old age pensions, the consumers were satisfied with the tax once they knew the increase imposed on them was going to the benefit of the less well-off sectors in our community. Recipients of social welfare benefits are not an organised group.  They have to rely on the goodwill of the Government and on the exertions of public representatives to ensure that their efforts to secure fair play will be successful.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been persistent in stating that whatever benefits accrue from improvements in the amounts of benefits always combat any effects of increases in the cost of living and other charges which follow from increased taxation, but surely as a Christian society we must do more for the aged, the disabled, the widows and orphans than merely cushion the effects of Government policy on them.  Surely we could move forward and do something more positive to achieve a clear improvement in their standard of living rather than be satisfied with the defensive effort to cushion the effects of Government national policy.  In regard to taxation there is an obligation on the Minister for Social Welfare in any Government to ensure that in the framing of Budgetary policy he should use his influence with the Minister for Finance to safeguard the lot of social welfare recipients from the effects of taxation so that they will not receive in benefit less than the increase given to them in real values.</P>
    <P>I said last week that the Government have failed in their Budget this year to exempt hard-pressed tobacco from the new tax.  The old age pensioner, for his favourite little luxury, is being asked to pay 10d per plug more, months before he gets the little increase in his old age pension.  His family will be likewise affected in taxation. Very many of these old people find that this is their only little luxury. <Col N="1657" /> They are, possibly due to failing eyesight, unable to read very well.  They cannot enjoy television or read newspapers, and their delight is to meet people of their own age, converse with them and enjoy a pipe of tobacco.  I feel that the Minister should have defended these people against the exaction of a tax on them, particularly so because predecessors in the Ministry of Finance were quite agreeable to exempt hard-pressed tobacco from increased tax.  I merely cite that as an example of the meagre sympathy shown for these people in leaving such a heavy impost of taxation on the aged classes.</P>
    <P>There are provisions in the Bill that are certainly welcome, but then we come down to the cold, hard facts in the opening paragraph of the Minister's statement.  He referred to the fact that, on investigation, the means of 21,000 old age pensioners or blind pensioners out of a total of 112,000 were assessed as nil.  I should like to think that all our people enjoyed a certain standard of living, and we must record with a sense of shock that the report of the Department of Social Welfare reveals that there were 21,000 recipients of old age or blind pensions whose means were assessed as nil.  Out of 27,000 widows, 6,500 are obliged to exist on a similar report on their conditions. This is a pretty frightening record of the conditions in which many aged people and widows have to live in present circumstances when we see other sections of our people revelling in what they regard as a very large increase in their standard of living, and it certainly is an indication that we have not done all that should be done to protect some of our people from the impact of the reduced value of money as we realise it is today.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of this provision for unemployment benefit for women engaged in domestic service and agriculture is certainly to be welcomed, because those ladies who provide services either domestic or in the farmyard are doing a very worthwhile service and one which is essential to productivity to permit the other womenfolk in the family to engage in <Col N="1658" /> other work, to assist them in the performance of their domestic duties and particularly in relation to animal husbandry. Many of those ladies employed in agriculture are absolutely essential to the increased production which is so desirable in the agricultural field.  It is a good thing that we in our legislation should ensure that their circumstances are protected against the hazard of unemployment in that sphere.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to state that these provisions will be made operable on a date to be appointed to coincide with the implementation of the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Bill.  I would exhort him to try to implement both measures with reasonable despatch, because how often have we passed legislation which was dependent on implementation at some future date by a Minister and found too much time elapsed before it became operative? We hope and trust, now that these measures will have cleared the Oireachtas, that no time will be lost in making the necessary arrangements in the Department for their implementation.</P>
    <P>This discussion permits the House to make representations relative to the implementation of our social welfare benefits in general, and I note that we have, particularly in relation to insured workers, with some notable exceptions, improved their lot in various measure by some little advances from time to time, and that, similarly, with relation to the non-contributory recipients. I want today to concentrate on one aspect of the enactment of a means test, and that is that an improvement in this field is overdue and very desirable.  I know from a little research that in August, 1962 the income limit for recipients was £130 15s and since that time we have only extended the scope by £26.  During those years there have been very remarkable changes relative to the reduced value of money.  I know from personal experience of the lot particularly of widows, non-contributory applicants for widows' pensions, of the harsh implementation of the current means test relative to their applications.  One must bear in mind the special circumstances of <Col N="1659" /> ladies who are unfortunately placed in this situation.  They have had an increase in the cost of living, and particularly those whose children are at an age that they incur considerable expenses relative to their education. We know the huge increases that have occurred in the cost of school books and in general educational charges, and that little or no account is taken by the investigating officers of the Department of Social Welfare of expenses where the widow finds herself in the circumstances that she has lost her partner in life and there is no allowance made for the education of children, particularly when they are at the more expensive educational ages.</P>
    <P>The effect of increased rates now bears heavily on such unfortunate people, particularly in small businesses in country towns.  Very many of these businesses are regarded, seemingly, by officials of the Department of Social Welfare as being lucrative, but we all know how much they have been affected by changes in our society that have been for the benefit of the society as a whole but, using the old saying that you do not make omelettes without breaking eggs, very many of these unfortunate people are in the category of the broken egg, and they have experienced setbacks in the conduct of their businesses, particularly those who are dependent on incomes from licensed premises in small rural towns. Our people demand a higher standard, and it is only those with capital who can engage in that, and they are inclined to attract business away from these people.  It is a sore enough blow to lose the head of the family and the active partner in the business, and to realise the charges and the worries that these people have to face up to, having lost their partner in life, at least we could give them some consolation, some assistance, in allowing them some benefit from non-contributory widows' pensions.  I happen to have quite a few of those cases and I feel very strongly that they are being very harshly dealt with in that particular type of instance. Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister to adjust the table relative to <Col N="1660" /> means when he is next considering any improvement in relation to the old age and widows' non-contributory pensions by extending the scope of the means test to allow them to benefit.</P>
    <P>I know that in 1963 we had the extension of the limit from £143 15s to £156 15s but this was to qualify them for the miserable sum of 7/6 a week, which, when one takes the administrative cost into mind, must be regarded as a trivial and a petty benefit to give to anybody.  Even so, it is an admission that they are regarded as being worthy of some benefit.  I suggest that the upward extension of the means tests, to allow more people to come within the scope of the benefit, would be beneficial.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister, when he is replying, what changes will be effected by way of economies in his Department relative to the setting up of the Ministry of Labour.  We understand that there will be a transfer of some staff.  What will become of the money which will be saved?  What purpose will the money be devoted to?  I would also like to know from the Minister the reasons which caused the exclusion of a sum of £100,000 from the original Finance Bill and which was included in the later document, which seemingly had not been foreseen in the Minister's submission to the Minister for Finance at Budget time.  How did it come about that such a formidable sum was not anticipated when the Minister was making his submissions?  Is this indicative of the manner in which many Ministers prepare their submissions? Does this mean that there is more than one Minister who has done this and does it mean that we could have Supplementary Estimates to cover this?</P>
    <P>Those are the remarks I wish to make relative to this Bill.  As I say, we very much welcome the fact that such a measure is before us but we regret the delay in the implementation of the benefits.  We deplore the alacrity with which the taxes were imposed and the extraordinary tendency nowadays to tax immediately while the benefits are not given until a very much later date.  Other sections of the <Col N="1661" /> community get immediate recompense. The question of the taxes to pay for this is deferred until some time after an event has transpired.</P>

      <P>The Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain contains certain provisions relating to duty free licensing and rules of origin which make it necessary to amend the powers conferred by existing legislation in this matter.  Certain provisions are also required in connection with the tariff concessions which are being given on goods of Northern Ireland origin.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide the powers required in these respects.</P>
      <P>The Agreement provides for the continuance at reducing rates, and for a limited period, of the 10 per cent preference given under the 1938 Agreement to British goods when licences are issued for the importation of goods at a reduced rate of duty.  This was provided for in the Finance (Agreement with the United Kingdom) Act, 1938 and the relevant provision ceased to have effect on 1st July, 1966.  The Bill, therefore, gives power to issue licences in which different rates of duty may be specified for goods originating in different countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In pursuance of the policy of closer co-operation with Northern Ireland, the Government have given tariff concessions on Northern Ireland goods with certain specified exceptions.  The duty on these goods was reduced by 20 per cent on 1st July, 1966, compared with 10 per cent in the case of British goods, and will be reduced by 10 per cent annually after that&mdash; the position to be reviewed in 1971. The initial concessions are provided for in the Government order which has been made to fix the new rates of duty on British goods under the trade agreement. However, the procedure for <Col N="1662" /> making such orders is unduly cumbersome for the normal administration of the concessions and the provision now proposed, which will enable me to vary them with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by a more informal process will greatly facilitate the operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Under present Irish rules, manufactured goods imported from Britain are regarded as being of British origin if they were manufactured there, and if a specified percentage of the cost of production was the result of work done in Britain or in Ireland.  The specified percentage is 25 per cent for most goods but in some cases it is 50 per cent or 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>As a result of discussions with Irish industry, provision was made in the Free Trade Area Agreement for certain changes in the Irish rules, in order to protect Irish industry more effectively against unfair competition from goods produced in third countries which receive insufficient processing in Britain.  The changes are to raise the specified percentage from 25 per cent to 50 per cent for footwear, paint and furniture, and, for jute goods, to lay down a rule that the goods should be fully manufactured from the raw fibre either in Britain or in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I already have power, under the Finance (Agreement with the United Kingdom) Act, 1938, to make regulations prescribing the proportion of the value of an article which must be the result of labour within a particular country, in order that the goods may be treated as manufactured in that country.  That Act does not, however, empower me to prescribe rules of the type decided upon for jute goods, and it will be necessary to obtain new powers for this purpose.  The Bill provides, therefore, that I shall have power to make regulations prescribing the conditions which must be satisfied in any country before goods can be regarded for Customs purposes as originating in that country.  The provision in the Bill is in general terms in case it should become necessary in the future, as a result of developments in international trade, to prescribe <Col N="1663" /> rules of origin for goods from other countries.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the favourable consideration of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I want to compliment the Minister on three fronts but before I do so may I tender my congratulations on his promotion, if that is the appropriate word, to the Ministry of Labour and wish him well in his new post and assure him that from the trade unions he will have every co-operation in making a success of the new Ministry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to compliment the Minister on three fronts.  The first is on his attitude towards promoting closer relations and developing trade between the two parts of our country, which is something the trade union and labour movements have been advocating for very many years.  We are glad to see that progress has been made on this front.  I want to make that clear because in view of what I have been saying on another matter and of what I will say later, this may be in some doubt.  It is not in any doubt.  We are greatly in favour of promoting trade and closer and more harmonious relations between the two parts of our country.  The Minister has been engaged on that and I compliment him on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second compliment I want to pay to him is that he has been behaving and ordering his affairs in accordance with legislation, and anything he has done has been in accordance with orders he has been empowered to make and for which he has legislative authority.  He is now coming along with this Bill and getting more permanent authority, as I understand it, to do those things.  This is in sharp contrast to one of his colleagues who disregards completely legislative authority, who does things with no regard as to whether he is empowered to do them or not.  That is by way of compliment to the Minister in contrast to one of his colleagues, who has done this in relation to Northern <Col N="1664" /> Ireland lorries and I think earlier in relation to Northern Ireland trawlers, inviting them to fish in our territorial waters, without legislative authority to do so and to the detriment of our citizens.</P>
    <P>The third compliment I should like to pay to the Minister relates to his very sensible and down to earth attitude. He said very sensibly in answer to a question in Dáil Éireann last week, when he was asked to comment upon the disappointment expressed by the Northern Ireland Ministry of Commerce in regard to the tax, that the Government's policy was to try to put the Six County industrialist in an advantageous position <i>vis-a-vis</i> the British industrialist.  That is what we have been saying all the time, that where this is possible it should be done.  The Minister came down to rock bottom and very sensibly and having regard to his duty as a Minister of State says: &ldquo;Well, our first concern must be our own industries&rdquo;.  I commend him for that; that is sensible, practical, and shows that the Minister has his feet on the ground, he knows what he is about and that his duty is to protect, in the first instance, his own people.  This was in sharp contrast, again, to another Minister of the Government and I am puzzled sometimes as to what Government policy is because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is part of the pattern which is emerging as a result of the Free Trade Area Agreement with Great Britain.  The proposal here is very commendable and, before I go <Col N="1665" /> any further, I Should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to the Ministry of Labour.  I know he will have a gigantic task there. From his record, I am quite sure he is equal to that task and I wish him every success in it.</P>
      <P>This Bill is designed to make regulations in relation to new rates of duty which will apply to goods imported from Great Britain and Northern Ireland, giving preference, of course, to goods from Northern Ireland.  That is as it should be and I suspect, although the Minister did not say so, that this Bill is the result of his discussion with the Northern Ireland Minister who visited us some weeks ago.  The Northern Ireland Minister, when he arrived back in Northern Ireland, stated that he was disappointed with the number of concessions he had secured as a result of the interview here with the Government.  However, I am quite sure this is one of the matters which came up for discussion between the Northern Ireland Minister and our own Government here.  It is very commendable to give concessions to the Irish people residing in the Six Counties engaged in business and in the export of goods.  It will certainly steady the situation in Northern Ireland regarding the maintenance of employment there.  Any concessions, such as these&mdash;where Northern Ireland is concerned&mdash;are bound to improve the employment position there.  On the other hand, the preference is being given to Northern Ireland, as against the exporters from Great Britain, who will also be exporting similar goods, but who will not have the same measure of advantage in relation to the tariffs which will apply to the goods imported from Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice the Minister mentioned particularly an increase in the measure of protection for our footwear against footwear from Great Britain.  I know that is a very important concession so far as the Irish manufacturers are concerned because they are capable of producing vast quantities of footwear in this country and we appear to be expanding our trade in footwear outside this country, particularly in <Col N="1666" /> America.  This measure of protection will give the manufacturers a chance to continue consolidating their position so that they can engage in further exports of footwear.</P>
    <P>It is an industry, apparently, which is very sensitive to economic conditions outside this country.  Of course, we had one of our footwear factories closing because of the difficulty in relation to competition and probably, too, by reason of the fact that in these modern times different materials are used in the making of footwear.  When you have different materials, particularly in the more advanced industrialised countries, you have a situation in which the original product is unable to compete with the synthetic material used particularly in footwear.  Therefore, I see that as a result of that situation, the Minister has decided to step up the measure of protection for footwear to 50 per cent as far as imports from Great Britain are concerned.</P>
    <P>This is all part of the freeing of trade as a result of the Agreement with Great Britain which will be spaced over a period of ten years and which, of course, will be subject to review after five years of progressive reduction in the measure of protection being afforded to our own industries. I feel it is necessary to watch carefully the manner in which that protection will enable our manufacturers to become more efficient and ready to compete in the open market, which is the position with which they will be faced at the end of ten years, when this progressive reduction of tariffs takes place.</P>
    <P>At that stage, of course, we will find ourselves on a common basis within the United Kingdom so far as prices and competition in trade are concerned. I am glad to see that this benefit is being made available only to Northern Ireland, first of all, and, secondly, takes into consideration the United Kingdom because our economic sphere comes within the UK area and should have a different scale of import duties from the countries outside that area.  It is possible that when we have joined the Common Market another adjustment of our import duties and <Col N="1667" /> trade protection will have to be considered, that we will be obliged by the EEC countries to make adjustments. However, that question does not arise at present and the main purpose of the Bill is to legalise the advantages which will be made available now to exporters from Northern Ireland.</P>

We had the most happy and cordial relations with him in the office he previously occupied, and we look forward to a continuance of those relations in future.

      <P>Having quickly discovered what subject was under discussion, which I did not expect to be taken at this time, I should like briefly to welcome the Bill. For many years past I have held the view that we ought to have done more than we were doing in relation to Northern Ireland in this matter, and that we should do all in our power to reduce some of the barriers we ourselves created between north and south in regard to tariffs.  I have often been struck by the extent of the reaction of people who have vested interests when there is a proposal to <Col N="1668" /> remove these barriers, whether they were industrialists or fishermen.  The reaction to any proposal to treat the north as part of our country is very often a negative one, and an adverse one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

      <P>It is we who are trying to reunite the country and it is up to us to make the gestures, and I am sure we will meet with a favourable response.  I also welcome the fact that in this Bill that part of the country is referred to by its proper name.  I heard rumours that behind the scenes there were pressures that the words &ldquo;Six Counties&rdquo; should be used.  I am delighted to note that those pressures have been resisted, and that, in fact, we are referring to Northern Ireland by the name which the people in that part of the country chose for themselves, just as we expect other people to refer to us by the proper name of our country and not try to impose false names on us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I have anything to answer except the question Senator Rooney raised about the protection of the shoe industry.  I should perhaps make clear that what is provided for here is raising the value of the labour in the cost of the shoes so as to ensure that shoes from a third country will not, without adequate processing in Britain, get into the market <Col N="1669" /> here.  The normal protection on shoes by quota will change.  The quota on rubber footwear has gone, and in two years time the leather footwear quota will go and will be replaced by a duty arrived at by the Industrial Development Authority after an examination of all the relevant factors.  This will give adequate protection during the transitional period until the quotas are replaced.</P>
      <P>Our footwear industry is already exporting footwear of a substantial value.  It has done everything to adapt itself to free trade conditions.  The fact that the market both here and in Britain has been having difficulties recently does not mean that I am not confident in the future of the footwear industry.  Its performance in the export market, the positive way in which it went about adaptation, and the transitional period during which it will be protected in order to get ready for the Free Trade Area will ensure its continual expansion.</P>

      <P>The 1938 Agreement and the Finance (Agreement with the United Kingdom) Act, 1938, provided for the issue of duty-free or reduced duty licences, that such licences issued should be free to British manufacturers and that third countries would have at least 10 per cent <i>ad valorem</i> to pay. Article 22 of the Free Trade Area Agreement continues that preference for British goods when such licences are issued.  A licence is issued when the goods are not available in this country.  When goods are not available from our manufacturers such a licence would give preference to a British manufacturer under free trade in the case of materials for manufacture here or for further processing.  The preference, which was 10 per cent, has been reduced to 8 per cent from 1st July, to five per cent on 1st July, 1967 and it will disappear on 1st July, 1969.  In the case of other countries, it has been reduced to eight per cent; it will come down to five per cent on 1st July, 1969 and will be eliminated on 1st July, 1974.</P>

I am glad some provision is being made for the speedy abolition of duty on materials for further process here because the obligation to pay the duty on raw materials and other intermediate goods would create difficulties for our producers.</P>

A firm might import goods over a long term from several countries <Col N="1671" /> in respect of which different duties would be chargeable.

    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the section of the Social Welfare Act of 1952 which operates to deprive workers of their rights to unemployment benefit when they are out of work due to a trade dispute or when they are locked out.  It would seem that under that Act trade disputes, even when they occur outside the State, may <Col N="1673" /> cause Irish workers to be deprived of unemployment benefit.  I refer to the so-called neutrality provisions contained in section 17 (2) of that Act. The workman contributes 25 per cent to his stamps and provides another 25 per cent through various forms of taxation.  These neutrality provisions, which the Minister inherited through the first Social Insurance Act of 1911, cause injustice to workers.  The principle of neutrality should act in a neutral sense and my suggestion here is that the worker should get at least 25 per cent and possibly 40 per cent of the benefit, as of right, if and when he is on strike and that he should not be deprived of benefit at all if he is locked out.  I suggest the Act should be amended to meet these points.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that the National Insurance Act, 1965 has eased the position for workers to some extent and I think the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have been in touch with the authorities seeking amendment of the 1952 Social Welfare Act by substituting for section 17 (2) of the Act the provisions in the British 1965 Act which removes disqualification for unemployment benefit where the worker can prove, among other things, that he is not participating or financing or directly interested in the trade dispute which caused the stoppage of work.  The considered opinion of the trade union movement is that the amendment referred to with the deletion of the words &ldquo;or financing&rdquo; would be fair and reasonable to the workers involved.  The Labour Party would wish to table amendments on the Committee Stage to bring about this alteration of section 17 (2) of the 1952 Act as it affects workers generally in a trade dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to refer to the rates of benefit in section 3 of the Bill now before us.  The definition of rural area, which, by the way, formerly appeared on Form UA 19 but seems to have been deleted from the latest version, stated that for the purposes of unemployment assistance the urban areas are the county boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, the urban districts of Athlone, Bray, <Col N="1674" /> Carlow, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dundalk, Galway, Kilkenny, Sligo, Tralee and Wexford.  It is also arranged under the Act that residence in a house owned by the local authority of an urban area but situated outside the urban area is deemed to be residence in the urban area.  A person living in Dublin city suburbs or Dún Laoghaire suburbs in the county area, is deemed to be in a rural area, and qualifies only for the lower rate of benefit, yet those two areas have population figures far above many of the areas classified as urban where a higher rate of benefit is payable&mdash;for instance, Dún Laoghaire suburbs, 20,309 and Dublin South City suburbs, 54,553.</P>
    <P>These figures exceed, with two exceptions, the named places in the regulations, most of which are considerably lower than those population figures.  In the case of an unemployed person drawing unemployment assistance and residing in Stillorgan, he is paid the lower rate set out in section 3 of the Bill, yet the population in Stillorgan, 13,000, is higher than many of the urban districts set out in the regulations.  The same applies to Milltown with 9,487 population and Dundrum with 15,125.  As I have said, these different areas are not urban areas for the purposes of the Act.  They are rural areas, and people on unemployment assistance can only draw the much lower rate for that category of worker.  It is surely necessary that there should be a revision of the grading of those areas for the purpose of paying the higher rate of unemployment assistance, and I should be very glad if the Minister would look into these things and see if he could do anything to put a more reasonable interpretation on what are rural and urban areas.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief, for I have only a few observations that I would like to make on the Bill and the Department of Social Welfare and their activities in general. I can never understand the mentality of the Department of Social Welfare officers, especially the pensions officers. I feel that these gentlemen must be allowed or get some bonus for the <Col N="1675" /> people they turn down and refuse. Many of our people who are applicants for various pensions take exception, and rightly so, to the manner in which those social welfare officers investigate their cases.  Invariably they call along next door to some of the neighbours and in many cases they base their judgment and their assessment of the merits of the particular case on hearsay from neighbours who may be, I can go as far as to say, evilly disposed to the unfortunate applicants. I think that our social welfare applicants in general are not getting a fair crack of the whip.</P>
      <P>The Government, and especially Fianna Fáil spokesmen, are inclined to take it on themselves to let it be known to these people in the social welfare bracket that the pensions and allowances they get are directly from the goodness of heart of the Fianna Fáil Government.  This is not so.  The pensions that are given by the Department of Social Welfare are the right of those people.  As the less fortunate members of our society it is their right that they should be looked after and should have some assistance in this way.  I feel that especially in the case of people with small holdings, who apply for non-contributory old age pensions, the method of assessment of those applicants' means is something that certainly needs to be brought up to date. I know of one instance where an applicant in County Laois applied in February for an old age pension.  The committee turned down the officer's decision and granted the applicant in their judgment the full pension, but since March it has taken that length of time and the appeals officer has not got around to making a decision on that case yet.  That is a lady who has six acres of land and yet is not entitled to a measly old age pension. That lady and her brother are solely dependent on the milk of two cows for their livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time surely has come when we see in this country people getting quite respectable and hefty allowances and emoluments and salaries, one thing and another, that we should see that <Col N="1676" /> there are people, old age pensioners, who are in effect living off the milk from one cow, and for that they are penalised and not even allowed the old age pension.  Surely when a committee sits in deliberation on a matter like this and from the members' personal and local knowledge of the applicants involved makes a considered assessment of a case the Department should not hold up further consideration of it for as long as three and four months. I think that the Department are being most unfair to people in many cases throughout the country.  It is always the poor people who cannot afford this lengthy indecision who are hit worst.  I would appeal, therefore, to the Minister. If he could reactivate the activities of the appeals section of the non-contributory old age pensions, I would, indeed, be grateful, as would very many unfortunate applicants in every administrative area in the country. There are a few points I wish to mention but perhaps it would be better to leave them over until we get to the sections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful to the Senators for the manner in which they have dealt with this Bill.  I am glad to see that the only criticisms are that more generous increases would be welcomed. In so far as the suggestion goes that we should have gone further, I would <Col N="1677" /> like Senators to realise that those increases cannot really be taken in isolation.  There have been increases in the rates of payment under the different social welfare schemes regularly every year and there has been a continuous gain in the case of the payments under every single scheme since 1957.</P>
      <P>While the step we are taking this year is a small one by Fianna Fáil standards it still is quite a considerable step.  When it is associated with the major improvement made last year, when the arrangements made resulted in an increase in the gross payment of the different income maintenance services of £10 million in one year, it can be seen that we are, in fact, implementing our programme of allocating an increasing proportion of the national resources to social welfare arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan exhorted me to try to get the Government to do more than, as he put it, merely cushion social welfare recipients against rises in the cost of living.  I think I should put on record what, in fact, has been done in this regard by the Government. While I agree that we cannot be satisfied with the rates of payment under some, if not all, of the social welfare schemes, still we have considerably outpaced increases in the cost of living since 1957.  In so far as the non-contributory old age pension scheme is concerned, which is the one that is usually mentioned for those people who have no means, the new rate of payment will be 52/6.  In 1957 it was 24/-.  That is an increase of 28/6 in a period when the cost of living rose from 135 in February, 1957, to 185 in May, 1966.  That is an increase of 37 per cent in the cost of living figures and an increase of 119 per cent in the maximum rate of non-contributory old age pensions.  In 1957 the maximum rate of pension was payable to those whose means did not exceed £52 10s a year.  For people in that category now the rate of non-contributory old age pension is 42/6, that is an increase of 18/6 or an increase of 77 per cent.  For the other new means category we have introduced the increase <Col N="1678" /> is from 24/- to 47/6, an increase of 95 per cent.  Therefore, in a period when the cost of living has risen by 37 per cent those people who were in 1957 in a means category which would entitle them to the maximum rate of pension have got increases varying from 77 per cent for those who have a means of £52 10s per year to 119 per cent for those who have no means.</P>
    <P>We introduced, in addition to that, for the first time, additions in respect of eligible children of non-contributory old age pensioners.  I will deal with that later.  The increases in the case of non-contributory widows' pensions are on a similar scale.  For those with means not exceeding £52 10s a year the increase was from 22/6d to 41/-, an increase of 82 per cent in a period when the cost of living increased by 37 per cent.  For those with no means the increase was from 22/6d to 51/-, that is an increase of 127 per cent corresponding to an increase in the cost of living of 37 per cent.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, in so far as non-contributory widows' pensions are concerned, there have been many easements of the regulations and extensions of the scope of the scheme.  Similarly, with regard to unemployment assistance, in the case of a single person in an urban area the increase has been 21/- from 18/- to 39/-, that is an increase of 117 per cent.  In the case of a married man the increase is from 28/-to 72/6d or 159 per cent.  In rural areas, which have been mentioned here, when it was said that the rates were lower there, the percentage increases have been greater still.  They were 175 per cent in the case of a single man and 222.5 per cent in the case of a married man.  Admittedly, although we have made this considerable gain over the cost of living we cannot yet be satisfied with the rates of payments in those social assistance schemes generally. That is largely because of the fact that the base from which we started in 1957 was too low and that was largely because of the neglect of the previous Government to keep pace with increases in the cost of living during that period.</P>

      <P>The consumer pays for it in any case.  The percentage increases, as I pointed out, in regard to unemployment assistance, have been even higher than in regard to the other social welfare assistance benefits.  This is because those rates have been left untouched on a number of occasions. In fact, there have never been increases given in unemployment assistance by any Government except the Fianna Fáil Government.  With regard to the social insurance benefits the increase in this period, in respect of unemployment benefit and disability benefit, when the cost of living rose by 37 per cent, has advanced for a single man from 30/- in 1957, to 52/6, an increase of 75 per cent and for a married man from 45/- to 92/6, an increase of 106 per cent.  For contributory widows without children it went from 30/- to 52/6, an increase of 75 per cent.  In addition to that, the contributory old age pension which did not exist at all in 1957 has been available since 1961. In November 1960 the cost of living figure was 148; in May 1966 it was 185 and that was an increase of 25 per cent.  In that period the contributory old age pension was introduced. The pension for a single man has been increased by 50 per cent from 40/- to 60/- and for a married man by 57 per cent from 68/6d to 107/6d in a period when the cost of living increased by 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, additions in respect of dependent children have been provided in the last couple of years for both non-contributory and contributory old <Col N="1680" /> age pensions.  Although some people might think this would have only a very marginal effect, it is a fact that the maximum rate of non-contributory old age pension which is in course of payment at the moment is £5 7s 6d in the case of one particular individual who tip to 1957 would have been getting only 24/- with the same family circumstances and the maximum contributory old age pension in the course of payment at present is £9 17s 6d, including additions for children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This has all happened. This is something that Senator Rooney does not realise.  While we have not yet reached a state of affairs which I consider to be entirely satisfactory, we have been making quite considerable gains in every social welfare scheme over the cost of living, and there is no question whatever of this Government doing nothing more than what Senator O'Sullivan says&mdash; merely cushioning the recipients of social welfare against the increased cost of living.  We have been pursuing a definite policy of making an improvement in their position relative to the cost of living and that process will continue.  We made a major breakthrough in this regard last year.  This year the steps taken were on a much smaller scale but the policy that produced the increases of last year is still in operation and I admit that although we have made these gains over the cost of living if you take the period, since the major increases of last year were given, in isolation there has been an increase in the cost of living which has not been covered.</P>
      <P>Senators may take it for granted that from the record of this Government we are not at this stage going to allow the cost of living to gain on the social welfare rates as it did under the Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the date on which the improvements which we are making now in the social welfare scheme can come into operation, I said in my opening statement that it was intended to bring this into operation <Col N="1681" /> on the same date as the Occupational Injuries benefits.  It certainly will not be later than that but if it appears feasible they will be brought in earlier.  If it appears feasible to make two changes in the price of social welfare insurance stamps these changes can be made on an earlier date.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan also raised the question of the income limit for the minimum rates of non-contributory old age pensions, which he alleged were too low.  The position has been established, especially in recent years, that when there is an increase in the maximum rates of non-contributory old age pensions there is an automatic extension of the means scale at the other end.  That is then automatically extended to bring in new categories of means for the lower rates of pension. So, there is really no point in talking about those in receipt of the lower rates of non-contributory old age pensions.  If we take care of the maximum rates and bring them to a reasonable level Senators can be sure that anybody who is in receipt of an old age pension at less than the maximum rate it at least as well off as anybody who is in receipt of a pension at the maximum rate and, in fact, very probably better off because most people who have some means have included in their means the right of residence and maintenance which are assessed at a very low rate indeed.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, these new categories we are creating now, those who have no assessed means at all, which is not the same thing as having no actual means, is that which we should concentrate on and if we can get the rate of pension payable to them to a reasonable level and extend the means scale accordingly, then we can be sure that the amount of money available for this purpose is being distributed as equitably as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Davidson's question about the disqualification for unemployment benefit for workers who are held to have lost their employment due to a stoppage of work or due to a strike at their place of employment does not appear to me to arise on this Bill but I can only say that my Department <Col N="1682" /> is pursuing the possibility of arriving at a more acceptable formula for dealing with cases like this with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and I may say that something on the lines of the provisions in the British Act appears to be the only reasonable formula that can be accepted and which would ensure the neutrality of the social insurance funds in strikes.  It is a matter which is on record that the formula which is in operation here had at the time it was introduced the full approval of the Labour Party. Admittedly, since then there has been experience of it in operation and my Department as well as the Labour Party are of the opinion that it has caused hardship in certain cases and that it is desirable to arrive at a more suitable formula and I hope we will be able to do that.</P>
    <P>The question of the different rates of unemployment assistance which are payable in rural areas as distinct from urban areas was raised.  Senator Miss Davidson did not make it quite clear that it is only in regard to the unemployment assistance this applies.  I would be inclined to agree with her that the definition of rural area is probably not quite satisfactory but I have not been doing anything with regard to changing that definition because I must admit I am not fully convinced that there should be a difference at all in the rates; that it is possible to justify a different rate for the rural area to the urban area at all. I am more inclined to think that, whenever it becomes financially feasible it would be desirable to abolish the differential altogether rather than start tinkering about with the definition of rural and urban area.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald raised the question, again, of the manner of approach of Social Welfare officers.  This has been raised on a number of occasions in the Dáil.  I have always made it clear that it has been impressed very forcibly upon Social Welfare officers what their approach to the question should be.  The Oireachtas has provided certain Social Welfare schemes for the benefit of people who qualify for them and their approach should <Col N="1683" /> be, in the case of any applicant, to try to find out if that applicant has qualified for the benefit for which lie or she applied.  There should be no question of it being a contest between the Social Welfare officer on the one side and the applicant on the other&mdash;one trying to get something to which he is not entitled and the other trying to deprive him of it.  It should be purely a question of ascertaining the facts and starting off from the basis that the applicant, either by having reached the age of 70, being a widow, or being unemployed, has already fulfilled one of the conditions for the receipt of the benefit concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare officer's task should be to find out if the other prescribed conditions are fulfilled.  Every Social Welfare officer should look upon it as being a serious load on his conscience if, through any lack of tact or any lack of thoroughness on his part, even one person was to be deprived of some benefit to which he was, in fact, entitled.  Therefore, the Social Welfare officer should approach each case from the point of view that it is at least as much his duty, in fact more his duty, to ensure that nobody is deprived of any benefit to which they are entitled, as it is to ensure that nobody obtains benefit to which they are not entitled.</P>

The difference between the amount of the liabilities and the amount of the assets on hands&mdash;£828,000&mdash;represents the aggregate of the moneys which have been withdrawn from the funds of suitors over the past 200 years under the authority of various Acts of the Parliament of Ireland, the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Oireachtas.  All these Acts indemnified suitors for any loss which they might sustain by reason of the withdrawals, and these indemnities are backed by the Central Fund.  Thus, a portion of the funds of suitors amounting to £828,000 is represented not by cash or securities held by the Accountant but simply by the liability of the Central Fund to indemnify the suitors against loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The money to be withdrawn under the present Bill will be taken from the sizeable cash balance which is maintained by the accountant in a current account in the Bank of Ireland.  This cash balance amounts at the present time to £860,000 and is constantly growing.  Apart altogether from the <Col N="1687" /> fact that, as under previous Acts, suitors will enjoy a complete indemnity against loss, I am fully satisfied that the sum of £450,000 may safely be withdrawn from this cash balance.</P>
    <P>Part of the funds of suitors has already been applied to meeting the cost of rebuilding the Abbey Theatre and the Cork Opera House.  Under the Funds of Suitors Act, 1959, £250,000 was allocated for the Abbey, and under the last Act, passed in 1963, £50,000 was advanced for the Opera House.  Estimates of cost for the two projects, furnished when these Acts were being prepared, indicated that the amounts in question would be sufficient to enable the projects to be completed. However, events proved otherwise, making necessary the further payments provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Abbey, the estimated cost of rebuilding was put at £235,000 in 1959, with a further £20,000 for professional fees and an unspecified sum for furniture other than seating.  It was accordingly considered that an allocation of £250,000 from the funds of suitors would suffice for the purpose.  However, rising costs since 1959 have rendered that estimate obsolete.  The successful tender, accepted in June, 1962, was for £310,000 for the Abbey and the &ldquo;shell&rdquo; of the Peacock Theatre, with an additional £34,000 for fees.  The cost of the work is now put at £555,200, to which must be added £95,000 for the Peacock.  These sums include professional fees; and the figure for the Peacock covers the full equipment of this theatre.  This gives a total cost of £650,000, leaving a gap of £400,000 over and above what has already been made available.  Allowing a small margin for contingencies, section 2 (3) of the Bill provides for further withdrawal from the funds of suitors of not more than £415,000 for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The increases in the cost of the Abbey and Peacock Theatres, though substantial, are inescapable.  They are due to increases in the cost of wages and materials, the effects of the building strike of 1964, changes in plans involving the installation of additional <Col N="1688" /> stage equipment, extra dressingroom accommodation and an increase in the height of the stage tower, special reinforcement work on the basement and additional work on adjoining property.</P>
    <P>The Abbey authorities have no funds which might be used to meet the increased costs.  The sum of £30,000 received in insurance following the fire which destroyed the old Abbey has long since been eaten up by current deficits.  The directors of the Abbey are, however, prepared to arrange a public appeal for funds to help meet the cost of the Peacock Theatre.  Section 2 (4) of the Bill provides that any sums raised in this way by the Abbey authorities will be paid into the Capital Fund, while section 2 (5) provides that the Minister for Finance shall repay to the funds of suitors any sums paid to the Capital Fund which are not required for the purposes of the section.</P>
    <P>The £250,000 made available under the Funds of Suitors Act, 1959, had been spent by July, 1965, and as any further withdrawal from the funds would involve fresh legislation, it was decided that a Supplementary Estimate should be taken on the Vote for Miscellaneous Expenses to ensure that the work in progress might continue. On the 21st July, 1965, the Dáil agreed to a Supplementary Estimate on this Vote in which a sum of £255,010 was included for this purpose.  Approximately £185,000 has been issued to the Abbey from this provision.  The Bill provides in section 2 (3) that this money will be refunded to the Exchequer. The rest of the money allocated under the Bill will be available to meet the balance of the cost of the project.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Cork Opera House, the estimated cost of rebuilding was put at £200,000 in 1963, and it was on the basis of this estimate that the Funds of Suitors Act, 1963, provided for the allocation of a sum of £50,000 to supplement the moneys which had been raised from other sources for the project.  As in the case of the Abbey, increases in costs occurred and the final cost of completion amounted to approximately <Col N="1689" /> £235,000.  This left the Opera House Company to find a sum of £35,000. The directors were compelled to approach the Government for further aid.  They felt there was little hope that a further appeal to the public would raise any significant sum, as £82,000 had already been subscribed from private sources.  Again, as in the case of the Abbey, a further withdrawal from the funds of suitors would involve fresh legislation.  Consequently, as the project was then nearing completion&mdash; the new Opera House was, in fact, opened on 31st October, 1965&mdash;and final bills were expected shortly, it was decided to take a Supplementary Estimate on the Vote for Miscellaneous Expenses.  This was approved by the Dáil on 28th October, 1965, on the understanding that legislation to authorise a further withdrawal from the funds of suitors would be introduced and that any payment from the Vote would be recouped.  In fact, a total of £11,514 was issued under this provision and this amount will be refunded to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre and the rebuilding of the Opera House are enterprises of national concern.  It has been recognised that projects of this nature cannot in modern conditions be undertaken successfully without the patronage of the wealthy or of the State or local authorities.  There is no doubt that this is a most desirable form of public investment since it will provide suitable entertainment and culture for our own people, provide employment for native artists and, at the same time, constitute an attraction for tourists.  The material needs of our citizens have been provided for increasingly in recent years and it is only right that the State should also help in the provision of these centres of entertainment in our two main cities.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to mention that, since the text of the Bill was circulated, I have received an application from the Society of King's Inns to have provision made in the Bill for the payment out of the funds of suitors of a sum of £50,000 to cover expenditure which has been incurred on renovation <Col N="1690" /> of the Society's buildings. Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Andrews spoke in support of the Society's application when the Bill was before the Dáil.  The position is that, under the Funds of Suitors Act, 1959, the Society was given £45,000 for building renovation, but the Benchers&mdash;that is to say, the controlling body of the Society&mdash;now claim that, because of a further outbreak of dry rot in the main building and increased building costs, the £45,000 has not proved sufficient. They say that actual expenditure amounted to £94,000 and that the Society has had to sell a large portion of its capital endowments to complete the financing of the work.  It is to recoup these capital funds that the sum of £50,000 is now required from the funds of suitors.  The Benchers say that, if their capital funds are not made good, they will be unable to carry out the educational and other functions of the Society and to maintain the Society's buildings.</P>
    <P>I have not had anything like sufficient time to consider the Benchers' application in the detail required.  A request to allocate a sum of £50,000 to the King's Inns is not one that can lightly be agreed.  A number of aspects must be considered.  For one thing, the future educational activities of the Society may be affected very considerably by the forthcoming recommendations of the Commission on Higher Education.  Then again, if we are to provide more assistance from the funds of suitors for the preservation of the King's Inns buildings, we will have to look into the question of the future of the King's Inns Library, which is not frequented to any appreciable extent by the public or by practitioners. Moreover, there are in the Library many valuable works which could more appropriately be housed in the National Library.  All these are matters which will have to be examined in some depth before it will be possible for the Government to make any decision in regard to the Society's application.  The application is, therefore, not one that can be dealt with in the present Bill.</P>

      <P>In general <Col N="1691" /> principle, I heartily support the Bill because it provides support from public funds for two of our greatest national artistic gifts, our talent for music and our talent for drama.  I imagine, most, possibly all, will support the Bill in general principle.  But as public representatives we have a duty to ensure that as far as possible such money is well invested.  I quote from the Minister's opening remarks&mdash;I only wish the Abbey productions were as brisk as his delivery was&mdash;</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that this is a most deserving form of public investment since it will provide suitable entertainment for our own people, provide employment for native artists and at the same time constitute an attraction for tourists.</P>
      <P>Admirable sentiments.  But I have recently consulted some of our citizens who are experts in theatrical affairs and others in the country who support the drama intelligently, and I have found that there is a general conviction that the present policy of the Abbey Theatre is unworthy of the Abbey's own high traditions and unworthy of its title as our National Theatre.</P>
      <P>Visitors from abroad&mdash;the Minister referred specifically to them&mdash;I find are frequently disappointed at the general level of production there.  Let me emphasise that this is not the fault of the actors.  By common consent they are good and some of them are excellent. Nor is it the fault of the producers. Some recent productions have been remarkably good considering the very difficult conditions in the Queen's Theatre.  What is at fault, and very gravely so, is the general policy of the Theatre&mdash;the choice of plays, the allocation of funds.  These are very widely criticised, justly so in my opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drastic changes are needed if the State is to show a satisfactory return for this very large sum.  Am I right in thinking that something like £1 million will have gone into the Abbey if we include the annual grants and if this Bill passes?  The Minister has said how carefully he must consider the allocation <Col N="1692" /> of £50,000.  What about the allocation of three-quarters of a million or half a million?  Last year the Government very rightly made an effort to improve matters.  New shareholders were appointed.  Most of them, if not all of them, were generally eager to revive the former glories of the Abbey. Many of them were experts in drama. Now this effort seems to have failed. Recently an artistic director whose appointment offered a great hope of improvement resigned.  Why?</P>
    <P>Some of the new shareholders have told me personally that they see little hope of real improvement until the present system of management has been changed.  It also seems to be a general belief, which I personally share, that such reforms must include the retirement of the present managing director, now more than 77 years of age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>He has controlled the destinies of the Abbey Theatre with declining success for many years.  The simple fact of the matter is, I regret to have to say, that this beautiful new theatre which we are providing will not perform its function, will not repay our investment, until there is a drastic change in this way.  It is a matter of public policy. We cannot, and neither should the Minister, condone a state of affairs in which so large a sum from public funds will be prevented from being fully productive perhaps for several more years.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, then, the House should not consent to the allocation of this money until we have had a clear assurance from the responsible Minister that the necessary reforms will be quickly made.  We ought to be told just how the finances of the theatre are administered and controlled at the moment&mdash;to what extent is it still a private concern as it was until recently, and to what extent is it a public body. The Minister would help greatly to clarify matters if he would answer a few questions, if not at this stage at a later stage, on similar topics to these. I should like to ask him four questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> First, how exactly are the present finances of the Abbey Theatre controlled and administered?  Secondly, what are the terms of appointment of the present managing director and, in particular, is there a retiring age? Thirdly, is the Minister satisfied personally with the present direction of the theatre, both in its personnel and in its work?  My impression is that the present compromise is unwieldy and ineffective.  I should be interested to hear the Minister's views on that. Fourthly, does the Minister not think some such system of management as holds in the National Gallery and National Library would be much preferable to the present system?</P>
    <P>My hope is that when the Minister has reconsidered these questions and others which may incidentally arise he will amend the Bill to make sure that this money to be granted to the Abbey will be well invested.  At any rate, I hope he will promise firmly that he will take early action to ensure the necessary reforms.  I cannot emphasise too strongly&mdash;the Minister does not seem to have the slightest interest in what I am saying, but I shall continue for the benefit of the House&mdash;that the theatrical world both in this country and outside it deplore the lack of vision and the lack of enterprise in the direction of the Abbey during recent years.</P>
    <P>A beautiful theatre and great national asset, risks being wasted.  Let me say once again that the dissatisfaction is not with the actors or with the producers.  They have been doing good work in very difficult conditions.  The new theatre will relieve some of those difficulties.  But even the finest theatre in Ireland, which I believe the new Abbey will be, will not enable enthusiastic artists to do their best work unless those who decide major policies are progressive and imaginative. I urge the Minister with all the force I can command to lead the way to the necessary administrative reform by persuasion or by legislation.  I urge him to do this not next year or next month but here and now before the Bill passes.  May I add the personal conviction that he has the integrity <Col N="1694" /> and public spirit, if he is convinced it is the right thing to do, to do it immediately?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended asking the Minister on this Bill if it would be possible for him to provide some funds for the King's Inns Library but he has dealt with that in his opening speech in a way which makes it quite clear it is not possible on this occasion because he has not had sufficient time or been given sufficient notice of the requirement.  However, it is a worthy object which deserves further consideration and I hope the Minister will find it possible, if not under this Bill under some similar measure in the future, to provide some funds for that purpose.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I think it is an unusual type of Bill in the sense that, unlike most legislative proposals where one section of the community is going to benefit but another section is going to have to find the money to pay for it, this is rather a happy arrangement in so far as it seems that two very worthy objects are going to benefit and nobody seems to be going to pay for it, because these funds are lying there unused and the owners cannot be traced, and to that extent at any rate nobody is providing the money and nobody is going to be at the loss of it.</P>
      <P>I am very glad, indeed, to see that the Abbey Theatre and Cork Opera House are going to continue, and I hope that these funds that they are now receiving will in fact be the final amounts that they require to bring the premises to completion.  That is certainly so in regard to Cork Opera House and I hope it will also be so in regard to the Abbey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Abbey Theatre with these new premises will have an opportunity of becoming again a theatre with an international reputation.  They have no excuse now, as they certainly bad in the past, particularly in recent years, in regard to the premises in which they were operating.  I do not think that the board of directors of the Abbey should try to recreate the past glories, try to get back to anything they did in <Col N="1695" /> the past, because this, of course, would be a complete mistake.  It must be remembered that the original Abbey became famous because they were putting on a new type of play and because at that time in the Abbey there was a new kind of acting.  This was something different.  It was a welcome change from the rather artificial and over-sophisticated acting and theatre generally of that time.  It was because there was something new about it, and different, that they made their name. It will be necessary for them to do the same again if they are to bring the Abbey back to the reputation it had before.</P>
    <P>Of course, it must be recognised that apart from the fact that they did something different and new they did have in the early days both directors and players who had a sense of dedication and an inspiration which enabled them to overcome the rather mundane considerations which tend to bring down drama and theatrical productions to a low standard.  This is a tendency which exists everywhere, and it always needs somebody with dedication and imagination to overcome this.  I hope that the Abbey will succeed in doing this.</P>
    <P>I hope that in making what they must realise is a new start they will begin by recognising that their performance during the past 15 or 20 years leaves much to be desired.  I agree to a very considerable extent with what Senator Stanford has said, that the Abbey has been far from satisfactory in recent years.  While saying that, it must be recognised also that, like Punch, the Abbey is not what it was but it never can be what it was. No matter how it does in the future I am sure you will have people saying that it has fallen from the glories of the past, that it is not the same as it was before, and that it is just falling away and losing its standards.  However, I think that the board at present, or whatever board of directors it may have in the immediate future, will have to start by recognising that there has been widespread dissatisfaction with the productions, and that from the <Col N="1696" /> international point of view it now does not have the name it had in the past. This is something which is slowly evaporating.  The position can be rectified, but it is certain that something will have to be done very soon. There will have to be a new approach, and there will have to be great courage shown, and imagination, and the Abbey will have to introduce a positive policy for the future.</P>
    <P>Policy is a matter for the directors to decide on&mdash;exactly what kind of plays they are going to put on, exactly what kind of production and what exactly from the artistic point of view they are going to concentrate on.  But there must be a definite policy, and one of the weaknesses, one of the causes of the unsatisfactory position that has existed there in recent years, was the fact that there appeared to be no policy.  It was just a matter of haphazard picking of a play out of the hat this week and putting on another play the following week, with no real defined policy or long-term plan.  It is essential that this should be changed.</P>
    <P>The Government has powers, naturally, when it is providing a great deal of money for the Abbey, to ensure that the best possible use is made of this money, but whereas the Government should be extremely slow and reluctant to interfere in a body of this kind, to appear to interfere in any way with artistic decisions, nevertheless I think that the Government will have to avail of its powers in the near future if there is not a clear indication that the board recognises its responsibilities and if it appears that the board is not rising to the occasion which is now presented to it.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I take this opportunity of wishing every success to the Abbey on the return to Abbey Street, and I hope that in the future visitors from abroad who come to the Abbey, having heard of its reputation, will feel that that reputation is justified.</P>
    <P>Before finishing I should like to suggest to the Minister that this principle of using neglected money or unused money, unused goods, is one which might usefully be extended.  I visited a distillery recently and found <Col N="1697" /> one entire huge floor upon which there were hundreds and hundreds of hogsheads or whatever you call them full of whiskey, the owners of which were unknown, and the owners of the distillery said that they could not do anything with them since they did not know the owners and were unable to dispose of them, and the contents were gradually turning back into water again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot hope to offer such an original and popular idea to the House as that which Senator Ryan has just offered to it.  I should like to say that we have been listening to the excellent contributions of Senator Stanford and Senator Ryan on the Abbey and that I do not feel competent to follow upon what they said or to support or reject their diagnosis, although, like everybody else, I share in the concern that the Abbey is not the centre of dramatic activity in Dublin which one has a right to expect that it should be.  It does not seem to attract or be the place that young directors and producers would wish to come to produce plays. It does not seem to draw on the fund of increasing talent that is available. It does not seem to use the fund to the full.  It is likely that there is something unsatisfactory here which should be tackled.  The reasons for it are beyond me to diagnose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was perturbed to note the escalation&mdash;that is the only word one can use &mdash;in the cost of the building of the Cork Opera House and the Abbey Theatre.  The increase in the case of the Cork Opera House seems reasonable enough due to rising costs.  The increase here is about 2½ per cent and seems reasonable enough.  Frankly, the increase in the case of the Abbey <Col N="1698" /> Theatre is a little difficult to follow. It seems that the estimate of the cost originally turned out to be so far below the actual cost quoted in the tender that it involved an increase of 35 per cent on the estimate.  It seems a very bad estimate if the tender was 35 per cent below the actual cost, to begin with, when on top of that the cost if virtually doubled.  This becomes very difficult to swallow.</P>
    <P>There are references to the increased cost of materials and the building strike in 1964.  That would hardly account for more than 10 per cent or 15 per cent.  That is the very height of it but for the rest of it it seems there was a failure in planning.  The changes in the plans involved the installation of additional stage equipment, extra dressingroom accommodation, an increase in the height of the stage tower, special reinforcement work on the basement and additional work on adjoining property.  That does not say very much for those who were responsible for planning this building.  It is something we should all be concerned about when initial plans turn out to be so wide of the mark and expenditure cannot be controlled within reasonable limits as was done in the case of the Cork Opera House.  We must express some concern when the final cost of the Abbey Theatre is increased over two and a half times the original estimate. This is something we cannot be happy about.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to make on the Bill relates to what the Minister said with regard to the application from the Society of King's Inns.  It seems that this application was received too late to do anything about it in this Bill.  The only thing we can reasonably ask the Minister at this stage is to see if he can make some provision for it in the future.  I am really concerned with some remarks by the Minister.  He said :</P>
    <P>A number of aspects must be considered. For one thing, the future educational activities of the Society may be affected very considerably by the forthcoming recommendations of the Commission on Higher Education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1699" /> This is no doubt true but no matter what the outcome of the report of the commission is and no matter what our educational activities are I hope that no change will be made at the risk of not preserving a building which is very worthy of preservation.  It does not matter what is done inside the building. Whatever the activities may be the building must be preserved.  The cost of the preservation of such a building must be provided from some source. I am a little perturbed about the suggestion that there might be a change in the future educational activities of the Society and that because of that the building might not be preserved.  There is no question but that the building must be preserved.  We must draw a line at the demolition of valuable buildings in this city.</P>
    <P>The preservation of the library is what really concerns me here.  The Minister said in his statement that the library is not frequented to any appreciable extent by the public or by practitioners.  I consider that the library facilities should be readily available and if the public were not allowed in I am sure that a request from the Government would ensure that anybody who wished could obtain the facilities of the library.  We are told here in the Minister's statement:</P>
    <P>Moreover, there are in the Library many valuable works which could more appropriately be housed in the National Library.</P>
    <P>One sees here the covetous eyes of the Government being cast over the work in that library.  It is no good reason to say that because the number of visitors to that library is not great that we should rationalise it.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered why something has not been done to rationalise our existing libraries.  We have the Trinity Library and the National Library very close together but instead of integrating them we are contemplating moving the National Library out of the centre of town.  The rationalisation of libraries is something we should consider seriously but in this case it can <Col N="1700" /> be carried too far.  We have in this city several very ancient libraries.  They are very unique and should be maintained. The additional cost of maintaining them is not very great.  We certainly should not rationalise them in this way.</P>
    <P>When I speak of those ancient libraries I refer particularly to the King's Inns Library and March's Library.  The collection in March's Library is not very much use.  The books there are not in continuous demand.  Nevertheless, it is a library which has existed for three centuries. There is a valuable collection there.  It is a unique building.  Even if it is only a library which is used on occasions by some students it should be preserved.  I do not believe if you took away all the books in Marsh's Library it would affect the issue very much.  The books there are used only by a few scholars. The effect of rationalisation here would be to get rid of this ancient institution as a place of interest in the city and as part of our past heritage.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the King's Inns Library.  This is a unique library.  There is an ancient part of our tradition here. It would be a pity if those ancient libraries were done away with and the books transferred to the National Library.  The National Library is not in a position to house extra books until it gets more suitable premises.  I hope the Minister will not think of transferring the books from the King's Inns Library.  Perhaps he will give us some assurance, when replying, that he will give further consideration to this.  I should not like to see that library close down.</P>

As a youngster, I frequented the Abbey Theatre.  I considered it the only theatre in Dublin worth frequenting. I sat in the back seat in the parterre at a cost of sixpence.  I shall carry to the grave recollections of that period and the plays which were performed.</P>
      <P>The burning of the original Abbey and its transfer to the Queen's Theatre is the main difficulty as far as the public, artists and producers are concerned until the day on which we move to the new Abbey Theatre.  The whole set-up of the Queen's, and the pollution of the atmosphere there when there is a crowd, is unsatisfactory and the accommodation for refreshments anything but adequate; but what I wish especially to refer to is the seating accommodation.  There is no accommodation for Americans, Japanese or anyone else.</P>

      <P>The popularity of the Abbey declined during its transition period in the Queen's Theatre.  I saw most of the old Abbey Theatre actors.  I saw there the plays of Senator Yeats, the present Senator Yeats's father, who was a Member of this House in the early days of this State; I saw Shaw's plays and others, and I thought the actors of those times were magnificent.  I want to emphasise that the Abbey players of the present day are equal to any of the Abbey players of older days The bilingualism, especially in the Christmas pantomimes, and their adaptability to Irish language productions is possibly due to the person to whom Senator Stanford seems to object.  I do not know who the person to whom he objects is.  He is possibly the person to whom I referred as a competent Irish speaker and I believe maintenance of the Irish-speaking atmosphere of the Abbey Theatre is due to him no matter what other criticism there may be of him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the money comes <Col N="1702" /> from a source other than the poor, unfortunate taxpayers or ratepayers, and that it is being utilised to reorganise the national theatre.</P>
    <P>There was, of course, a great difference between the Abbey Theatre at that time and the music halls.  I did not often frequent the music halls.  I frequented the Abbey when I had my tanner to go there.  Something similar to what was in the general theatres then is to be heard on Radio Éireann now.  &ldquo;The Old Town Hall Tonight&rdquo; radio programme reminds me of what I used to hear in the old theatres.  It reminds me of what was done in some theatres when the Abbey Theatre was in its glory.</P>
    <P>During the past week we have been discussing State and semi-State bodies and I wonder what the Abbey Theatre will be classified as.  It will not, I hope, be classified as a State or semi-State institution but I hope it will have some autonomy of its own and that it will restore some of the popularity of the old Abbey Theatre.</P>
    <P>Criticism in recent years of the Abbey Theatre had to do mainly with the site of the theatre and the problems which actors, producers and, possibly, playwrights had to put up with and the conditions under which the plays had to be produced.  In the new Abbey Theatre I hope that the facilities will be such as to make the production of plays and general presentation easier.</P>
    <P>The Abbey players of today are as good by national or international standards as were the old players about whom we used to speak in glowing terms.</P>
    <P>Let me finish on this note.  One of the plays in the old days was called. I think, &ldquo;The Prodigal Son&rdquo; which would have impressed any young fellow of the time and which would impress anybody today when we see what criticism there is of the language and things national and local.  The play finished with the Prodigal Son saying to people, members of the household and others: &ldquo;You are all a pack of hypocrites, the whole damn lot of you and so is everybody.&rdquo;  I think <Col N="1703" /> we are inclined to be hypocritical in public and private matters.  I hope the same will not be said of us in the future as was said in the epilogue to the play.  I hope we will not be too hypocritical in regard to this Bill.</P>

      <P>The first sentence in the Minister's statement says that the purpose of the Bill is to enable a sum not exceeding £450,000 to be withdrawn from the funds of suitors.  In fact, the purpose of the Bill is to legalise a raid on the funds of suitors. It is intended to take £450,000 out of these funds for the purposes of meeting the cost of building these two theatres. The estimate is much greater than the original one.</P>
      <P>What are the funds of suitors? There are funds lying in court which can be claimed by those entitled to them.  They also include statutory deposits from insurance companies and banks, trade unions, auctioneering establishments, house agencies, wards of court and other contributions. Those are the contributions which make up this fund and the purpose of the Bill is to take £450,000 out of these funds and put the Exchequer into debt to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister was giving figures he told us, first of all, that the total amount concerned was £17,640,000 and that the assets held by the accountant, mainly securities, amounted to only £16,812,000.  In other words these funds are short to the extent of £828,000.  The proposal is to increase that liability by a further £450,000.  In other words, when this Bill is passed we will then owe these funds of suitors approximately £1,278,000 instead of £828,000 as at the present time.  It was mentioned that these are dormant funds but what annoys me is the suggestion that, in fact, there is a deficit.  There is a liability there which has not been repaid and apparently it is proposed now to increase the liability of that fund.  The question arises as to how far will this liability be increased.  Is there another project at a future date which the Government will use for the <Col N="1704" /> purpose of increasing the liability still further?  Of course, the reason this money is being taken out at this stage is that the Government have not got other liquid assets which they can conveniently make available for the purpose of meeting the extra costs here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>They were very interesting assets all right but apparently they are losing their value, too.  That is what will happen in this case if this procedure is to continue beyond a reasonable limit.</P>
      <P>This Bill demonstrates a fantastic incompetence on the part of those responsible for estimating, designing, planning, surveying and providing all the other services which go into the construction of a building of this type. They fell very short of their estimates. First of all, they fell short of their original estimate but they also fell short in regard to the accommodation and facilities which ought to be expected in a building of this type.  It was, therefore, necessary to bring in new designs and new plans for the purpose of meeting those shortcomings.</P>
      <P>In addition to those failures, we had a situation&mdash;brought about, of course, by the Government themselves&mdash;which caused the building strike of 1964. After the strike of 1964, building never got under way again: it is still struggling and, in fact, it is on the wane.  But the 1964 building strike is being used now as an excuse for increasing the cost ; it amounts to double the original estimate and is now approximately £555,000.  I am sure that there have been many red faces amongst those associated with this building project.  Certainly, no private individual could stand up to that kind of bungling and incompetence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is the question.  In the course of his statement the Minister did not indicate when it is proposed to repay this money.  He merely mentioned that the Central Fund is liable to indemnify the suitors against any loss resulting from this withdrawal but I think some specific suggestion should be made regarding <Col N="1705" /> the repayment of the money. Another question arises also.  Does this Fund continue to earn interest?</P>
    <P>My friend, Senator Ó Donnabháin, mentioned that the managing director was a very competent Irish speaker. Nobody disputes that but is that sufficient at the present time for a progressive managing board?</P>

      <P>I was very impressed by Senator Stanford's contribution in this respect.  We must take another look at the situation which exists in regard to the management of the Abbey.  Considering the taxpayers' money or, if you like, the money which is to be guaranteed by the taxpayers, anyway, is being used to such an extent in this case, it is only right that the Government should ensure that a competent progressive managing board is appointed so that the maximum advantage will be obtained from the new Abbey Theatre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary for people with a more modern outlook these days to have final responsibility in relation to management, facing&mdash;as we do at the moment&mdash;the space age, the atomic age, the automated age, all of which affect our lives.  When we pay tribute to our young artistes at the present time and when we observe that they are inclined to shy away from the Abbey, we must ask ourselves: &ldquo;What is the reason for it&rdquo;?  Do they feel that there is some stultification there so far as acting, artistry and enterprise are concerned?  There is probably a very good reason why the young artistes did shy away from it and those are the people who should be consulted when the question of modern management comes up for discussion and decision.  It is only right to say, in fairness, that the fame of the old artistes will live for a very long time. The names of such players are still on the lips of the people, particularly those who had the privilege of seeing them and enjoying the roles they played during those years.  We have <Col N="1706" /> many talented artistes.  With all the facilities and a progressive enterprising management, they will make a name for themselves, too, and will be given the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>All of us are in favour of the Bill in so far as it enables the cost of these projects to be paid.  That is essential. I consider it regrettable that the Minister has had recourse to this method of financing the payment in relation to the cost of building these two theatres.</P>

      <P>Anyway, that is the situation.  I do not think it is a gift horse.  I do not think the Minister will say it is a gift; he is merely taking it but he is creating a liability in another Department as far as the payment of this is concerned.  I hope we will all meet at the opening of this new Abbey Theatre next week and that invitations will not be withdrawn from those who had not very complimentary remarks to make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>In page 4 of the Minister's opening address he said:</P>
      <P>There is no doubt but that this is a most desirable form of public investment since it will provide suitable entertainment for our own people and provide employment for native artistes.</P>
      <P>Being from that part of the country which is outside Dublin, I feel that the public, in general, get very little value for the public funds spent on this establishment.  Of course, being not only outside Dublin but outside the Government Party I suffer a double handicap: I do not even qualify for a ticket to the opening night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, the general public would really enjoy the work of this renowned establishment if we had a few more of their productions on Telefís Éireann, instead of a number of the ancient films which are fed to the public.  The people in the country are in a different position from the citizens of Dublin who have a definite <Col N="1707" /> choice and can go to the live theatre to enjoy the fruits of these players' work.  I have a crib, too, about the professional theatre, and the Abbey in particular, because they do not go out of their way to encourage native writers or actors, so far as I know.  I am particularly interested in amateur dramatics, and I find many professional people frowning on that activity. There are vast numbers of amateur productions throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It is quite evident that the general public appreciate live theatrical performances, and it is regrettable that a company like the Abbey, a subsidised body, do so little to meet this demand. In practically every second parish there are amateur groups who put on shows of one sort or another for various purposes, mostly charitable.  We also have a number of drama festivals, and when the adjudicators, who are all from the professional theatre, come down the country they very often slate these unfortunate people who are doing their best.  These people who go on and expose themselves to criticism do so out of a sense of loyalty to their parish or to their colleagues.  This is an indication that the public in Ireland are very receptive to the theatre and the stage.</P>
    <P>The Abbey have been resting on their past glories during the past few years.  Perhaps much of that can be attributed to insufficient funds, but it is reasonable to expect an improvement in their productions now that they are being provided with what should be one of the most modern theatres in the world.  The theatre in Dublin has slipped somewhat.  We all know of the tremendous work of a few well-known people in Dublin such as Lord Longford, and people like him, who have devoted so much time, energy and finance to the theatre.  Without them we might not have even as many theatres as we have in the country.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann could do much more for our native artistes.  Looking at the hoardings in Dublin, and looking at the number of excellent artistes we have, it is very regrettable to realise how few of them ever get a look in on <Col N="1708" /> Telefís Éireann.  There are some people on Telefís Éireann and we could certainly do with seeing less of them&mdash; some of the people who are constantly on our television screens.  When we enjoy one of the live shows in the Olympia, or the Gate, or whatever theatre it is, we realise how seldom we see these excellent artistes on Telefís Éireann, and for that reason I feel the national network is not giving fair value for the money of the public generally, and especially the people outside Dublin who have no opportunity to enjoy the work of these artistes in live productions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, but I agree with Senator FitzGerald when he questioned the contract price and the estimate.  It is extraordinary that the old Abbey was insured for a sum as low as £30,000 only since it is taking over £½ million to replace it Surely that is bad business, and something that should not occur again.  I should like to conclude by wishing the Abbey Theatre every success in the years ahead, and I hope they will live up to their reputation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief, and I promise in this debate not to introduce any Northern Ireland lorries or trawlers.  The point raised by Senator Stanford is very serious.  We are now debating the Second Reading of the Bill, and I think it would be desirable that, having heard the Minister's reply, we should consider this matter between now and Committee Stage.  It should certainly not be taken today.</P>
      <P>I do not think we are involved in the issue of the estimate of the price of the Abbey.  In fact, £¼ million has been given and the fact that that estimate might have been out is not a responsibility of the Minister's.  We are concerned with the second demand for the Abbey and judging by what Senator Stanford has said, we have no control over the spending of the money, or of the theatre as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also interested in the grant of money to the Cork Opera House. Being the only Corkman in the House at the moment, which does seem very strange&mdash;except for the Chair and one <Col N="1709" /> Senator behind me&mdash;I must say I welcome this grant.  There is no question but that it is one of the most desirable provisions that could be in this Bill. We are not opposing the Second Reading, but we should like to hear the Minister's explanation before taking Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is largely a machinery measure to enable these funds to be allocated in respect of works which are now practically completed and in regard to which these debts have been incurred.  Senator Rooney is about the only person in the Dáil or the Seanad who is not delighted that these funds are available which can be used from time to time by the State to further cultural projects of this kind which are of national benefit.  It is appropriate that these funds should be used for this purpose provided the basic interests of the suitors concerned are preserved, as they are in this Bill in the indemnifying clause.</P>
      <P>Senator Stanford and Senator Murphy raised important matters of policy concerning the administration of the Abbey Theatre.  Indeed, the Government are very conscious of the importance of the Abbey Theatre, from the point of view of their reputation, from the material tourist point of view, and from the point of view of their standing as the cultural centre of Ireland in regard to dramatic art.</P>
      <P>Conscious of that fact, the articles of association of the National Theatre Limited were amended 18 months ago. They provide for shareholding by people of prominence in the cultural life of the country.  Twenty-five shareholders were issued with 30 shares each and there are in that very representative body such names as Micéal MacLiammoir, Ria Mooney, Sheila Richards, and Lady Longford, people who cover a wide spread of the various aspects of dramatic art.  The Government increased their representation on the board to two who are men with cultural interests also.  The combined effect of this has been to make for a wider policy attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With that objective in view, an artistic director of the calibre of Mr. <Col N="1710" /> Walter Macken was appointed.  I understand he resigned for purely personal reasons which had nothing to do with policy matters.  I also understand that at the present time the board and shareholders are actively pursuing the problem of obtaining an artistic director of the same stature as Mr. Macken.  This, of course, will be a very important appointment as far as the future of the Abbey Theatre is concerned.  I mention this to illustrate that the Government and the Minister for Finance&mdash;the Minister with responsibility in the matter&mdash;are conscious of the need to ensure that, now that we have got this magnificent building, the finest theatre of its kind in the world, the management can be equated to the stature of the building itself.  It is with that endeavour in view that these active efforts are being made to appoint an artistic director of outstanding merit who will gather under him the best talent that can be found in the way of producers and theatre cast.</P>
    <P>Far be it from me to anticipate any policy decisions taken by the board, but I have much sympathy with Senator McDonald's suggestion that it would be good for the Abbey Theatre to go into the country, to the bigger country towns, to bring to them the outstanding dramatic art of which they are capable and at which we as a people are so good.  That suggestion will, I am sure, engage the attention of the board.  I should also like to see a greater breadth of selection in regard to the theatre's top plays.  This can be achieved under the articles of association.</P>
    <P>Having got all these things, I am certain that the theatre will prove itself in the future as outstanding a medium of dramatic art as it did in the past. We are rightly proud of the Abbey Theatre and its traditions.  It introduced a new style of acting known throughout the world as Method Acting, far removed from the histrionic dramatic art form of the last century.  I am confident that the Abbey in its new surroundings will continue to contribute much dynamic effort to dramatic art in the future.</P>
    <P>Amateur drama flourishes throughout <Col N="1711" /> Ireland.  Hundreds of amateur dramatic groups perform at festivals and have their own national festival each year.  The country has a tremendous reservoir of talent which can be tapped by the Abbey in the future.  More can be done in this matter than has been done in the past. I have attended several amateur drama festivals and I can assure the House that the standard of acting at these festivals has been incomparable.  It behoves the Abbey management in the future to tap this talent.</P>
    <P>These are all largely policy matters which will be the problem of the Abbey management in the future.  The important matter now is that we agree to make these moneys available from the Funds of Suitors.  This will be the start of what we hope will be an enhanced Abbey of the future such as Senator Stanford envisaged.</P>
