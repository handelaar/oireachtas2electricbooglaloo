      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dublin Gas Order, 1966, proposed to be made by the Minister for Transport and Power and laid in draft before Seanad Éireann on the 5th day of July, 1966, under subsection (4) of section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, be approved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Gas undertakings generally operate under special Acts which authorise them to manufacture and distribute gas in certain specified areas and which impose certain controls on their finances.  Modifications to these special Acts may be made by Order under section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920.  Before an Order of this kind is made it has to be laid in draft before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Houses of the Oireachtas may, by Resolution, approve the draft Order in the form submitted or they may approve it with modifications or additions.  When such approval is given I may make the Order in the form in which it has been approved.</P>
      <P>The Alliance and Dublin Consumers' Gas Company have applied to me for a special Order.  The objects of the proposed Order are to enable the Company to raise £500,000, by borrowing, to increase fourfold the amount of revenue that they may allocate for replacement or renewal of plant each year, at present the limit is £26,000 a year, and to increase similarly the limit to the total amount in the funds which can be set up for such purposes, at present the limit is £260.000, to use more of their lands for the manufacture of gas and for ancillary activities and to acquire, by agreement, further land for other purposes and to take over, jointly with Calor Gas Limited, the interests of G. Anderson Ltd., 11 Merrion Square, Dublin, in a number of the smaller gas companies in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Notice of the proposed Order was published by the Company in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in a daily newspaper.</P>
      <P>The Company also sent copies of the draft Order to the public and local authorities concerned and to the occupiers and landlords of houses within three hundred yards of the site which it is proposed to use for the manufacture of gas.</P>
      <P>No objection to the proposed Order was received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the power relating to the takeover of the interests of G. Anderson Ltd. in the other gas companies, <Col N="1716" /> the powers requested by the company are necessary in order to make improvements in their gas manufacturing process which will be required if the gas undertaking is to survive against growing competition from suppliers of other fuels.  The new process will use oil instead of coal as its main raw material.</P>
    <P>The proposed takeover is in the interests of the smaller gas undertakings as it will place the company's resources in the fields of science and technology at their disposal and should improve the supply of gas to the communities served.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied as to the need for the Order and that there is nothing in it repugnant to the public interest.  I, therefore, recommend the Order for the approval of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an Order which I think the House will have little difficulty in approving.  I think the procedure which has been adopted here is one which we have been commending to other Ministers in Bills they have been passing through the House within the last year.  I am very glad to find that the procedure for submitting Orders in draft to the House has its roots in the Gas Regulation Act, 1920. I hope that the speed with which this Order will go through this House, as I think it has gone through the other House, will show to the Ministers concerned that where Orders of this kind are made the Houses of the Oireachtas act reasonably and the procedure which is adopted does not necessarily involve any delay in the making of the kind of Orders which are required to be made under various Acts of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me to be right and proper that a company such as the Dublin Gas Company should be enabled to increase its capital to the extent indicated in the draft Order, and I hope that the Dublin Gas Company will continue that procedure.  Although I am not a gas user myself&mdash;and, indeed, I had to ask the Gas Company to remove gas which I had supplied to my dwelling because I had the experience of inhaling some of it at one time&mdash;I have never heard anything but the highest <Col N="1717" /> praise for the courtesy, competence and efficiency of the Dublin Gas Company, which is the kind of example which I would suggest should be followed in detail by semi-State bodies involved in the supplying of power to the community. I do not think I have ever heard any complaint about the manner in which the Dublin Gas Company conduct their affairs.  On the contrary, I have on numerous occasions heard great praise of the Dublin Gas Company, and I hope with the extension of their activities, with the increased capital they will get as a result of the making of this Order, that they will continue to give in increasing measure to the community in Dublin the services for which they have been so justly acclaimed up to the present time.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the Order about which I am more curious than concerned.  The Dublin Gas Company are taking over jointly with Calor Gas Ltd., the interests of G. Anderson Ltd. I wonder has the Minister any discretion, or power, in relation to a matter of this kind. I think he and his Department will be aware of the fact that there has been a number of accidents through the unfortunate misuse of bottled gas.</P>
    <P>Recently, when a strike was pending in the ESB, I had occasion to get one of these cylinders and the necessary accompanying jets, and so on, as a kind of temporary makeshift for domestic purposes.  I cannot say that on any cylinders I got there was any notice indicating the dangers attending upon misuse or any word of caution issued to the purchasers of bottled gas.  Could the Minister use his good offices with the Dublin Gas Company, and, indeed, with other manufacturers or suppliers of bottled gas, to ensure that all the dangers inherent in the misuse, or the accidental misuse, of bottled gas will be brought to the notice of consumers?</P>
    <P>I can quite see that when somebody is selling a product he does not want to advertise any of the disadvantages that may be attached to its use.  I do say that the Minister should request this to be done by the Gas Company when they take over with Calor Gas Ltd. G. Anderson Ltd.  If there is not some agreement reached among the <Col N="1718" /> consumers of bottled gas as to the kind of warning that should issue, power should be taken in legislation, as was done in the case of oil heaters, to ensure that this is done for the protection and safety of the public.  Apart from that, it seems to me that this is an Order which the Oireachtas should, as the Minister said, approve and it only remains for me to wish the Dublin Gas Company success in their expanded undertaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember we had something like this in connection with the Cork Gas Company some years ago.  I was arguing then that the gas company was in a rather special position and that it was because of that this measure of control was imposed on them by the 1928 legislation. These are not ordinary commercial businesses engaged in competition. They are in a rather privileged position in that there is only one gas company and you do not have a number of gas companies supplying gas to your house and you use one or the other according as the price varies.  Once you get the gas into your house you intend to use it and the supplier of gas is in a rather privileged position in that respect.  It is because of that that there is a measure of control which we do not impose, for example, on the oil companies or commercial organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purposes of this Order are generally acceptable to me.  There is one question I should like to raise in regard to the £26,000 per year allocated for replacement and renewal of plant. That is possibly well justified because of the extension of the area the Dublin Gas Company now services, but I should like to know from the Minister if this would lead to the issue of bonus shares by the Gas Company eventually, thereby, in effect, taking higher profits from the consumers.  We all know the device of laying aside a certain amount of the profits each year, accumulating them in reserve and then suddenly issuing them as bonus shares to the shareholders, the public believing that the dividend is the same, about six, seven, or eight per cent, whereas the capital may have been <Col N="1719" /> increased fourfold by this device.  I should like to know if the Minister is in a position to prevent this.  It is to be hoped that the permission given to the Dublin Gas Company to lay aside a greater amount each year, which of course will come from the profits as a result of their operations, will not result some years later, the capital having been increased by a bonus issue&mdash;the dividend, I think, is controlled for gas generally and may still stay at the normal level&mdash;in the profit on the subscribed capital being increased.  Has the Minister provided for this or will it be possible by reason of this Order that this could happen subsequently to the Dublin Gas Company?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister is replying perhaps he will indicate what the consequences are expected to be as a result of modernisation of equipment and the change in the foundation fuel for the provision of this service.  I understand that a consequence will be much reduced costings in fuel and, furthermore, effect a greater safety in the use of the finished product.  I should be glad if the Minister when replying would refer to these aspects and to the possible results to the industry that would flow from these developments.</P>

      <P>Arising from this Order, we note that the process for the manufacture of gas is to be changed from coal to oil.  This is a fundamental change and I wonder whether, in the circumstances, a change to natural gas might not be more in line with future economies in this field because we see the great change which has come about there.  Now it is quite feasible to transport natural gas, under pressure, from regions in the Sahara and elsewhere and use it much as we use calor gas.  From the rate at which natural gas fields are being discovered at present, it would appear that in the near future natural gas may be a very strong competitor to oil for the production of gas.  I wonder whether the Minister can enlighten us as to what is the present relative position and whether the margin between the two, which is decreasing very steadily, will create the <Col N="1720" /> likelihood that in the near future the balance will swing over to natural gas. We have read with great interest recently there is a possibility that there might even be natural gas deposits under the Irish sea.  If that were the case, of course, it would mean that we would be able to use it without the long transport which is now one of the factors which increase its costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members of the Seanad for their friendly reception of the Order.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley made a remark about the time taken being very short to discuss this Gas Order, which has proved right since the debate has been of very short duration ; but, if all the Statutory Instruments laid in one way or another before the Oireachtas were debated, the time taken might be excessive. However, I will not engage in controversy of that kind.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Senator had difficulties about the accidental inhalation of gas.  In actual fact, the Dublin Gas Company, as time goes on, will be installing equipment which will eliminate the amount of carbon monoxide in gas which can be the cause of poisoning, in certain circumstances.  I have not had very much information about the explosive effect of calor gas but I will draw the attention of the calor gas companies to the observations made in relation to the possible danger of explosion. There must have been a very small percentage of casualties through the explosion of calor gas and kosangas in the past ten years but whether or not that might justify some precautionary notices on the bottled gas equipment I do not know.  At least I will refer it to the companies concerned for attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy asked questions about possible increased profits through increasing the amount allowed for replacement of assets.  I understand the £26,000 additional money to be used for the replacement of assets cannot result in an increase in the capital upon which increased dividends can be paid.  The amount devoted is purely for the replacement of existing assets, not necessarily for an increase in the total amount of capital upon which <Col N="1721" /> dividends can be distributed.  Incidentally, Senator Murphy probably knows that in 1957 an Act was passed eliminating any control over the dividends paid by gas companies in this country because of the tremendous competition between the gas companies and those providing other fuels, domestic coal, electricity, calor gas, kosangas and oil for heating.  I should also make it clear that the Dublin Gas Company is not taking over the calor gas companies but is taking over, with Calor Gas, the company of Anderson Limited.  It is a kind of joint operation.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan and Senator Quinlan referred to various matters.  I understand that natural gas is not economic for the Dublin Gas Company to use at the moment.  The piping of this gas would be uneconomical and its movement in vessels from the sources where it is obtained would not be economic for their purposes at present.  As the Seanad may know, legislation is being introduced this autumn to enable the Oireachtas and the State to have control over the coastal continental area in regard to natural gas exploitation.  If natural gas should be discovered on the Continental Shelf adjacent to the island, then we would have to examine again whether or not it would be economic for the Dublin Gas Company to use natural gas.  At the moment, I understand it is not economic and, therefore, the proposal is to make use of oil.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Gas Company has shown reasonable initiative in examining all the new methods of producing gas and I have encouraged them at all times to examine what lies in the future.  As I have said, at the moment it would not be economic to make use of natural gas and indeed, if Senators will read the correspondents' accounts in the British newspapers, it will be seen that there is still a wide area of controversy as to exactly how natural gas in the North Sea is to be integrated into the general fuel and energy economy of Great Britain.  It is still a matter of acute discussion and controversy, particularly in regard to the price to be charged.  Therefore, it is a matter of which I really have not any great knowledge at the present time <Col N="1722" /> because it is Still under examination and liable to re-assessment, I think, in the course of the next two or three years.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their reception of the Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE have had under consideration for some time past the position in respect of the continuation of the services on the Waterford-Mallow railway line.  Normally, CIE could proceed in a matter of this kind by giving notice of intention to close the line under the powers vested in the Board by section 19 of the Transport Act, 1958.  Section 19 of that Act gave CIE full discretion in the closure of railway lines, subject to the Board, before terminating any service, satisfying themselves that the service is uneconomic and that there is no prospect that it could be operated economically within a reasonable period.  I am advised, however, that a technical legal difficulty arises in relation to that part of the line between Waterford and Fermoy.  While the services on the line are operated wholly by CIE and the lines and works are maintained wholly by them, they are only part owners of the section from Waterford to Fermoy.  That section forms part of the undertaking of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE and British Railways are part owners of the Fishguard and Rosslare Company.  The undertaking is jointly worked, managed and maintained by CIE and British Railways under the provisions of certain old statutes dating back to 1898.  CIE are responsible for the services on the Irish side and British Railways are responsible for the services on the British side, including the shipping service between Fishguard and Rosslare.  In these circumstances, there is a legal doubt as to the applicability of section 19 <Col N="1723" /> of the Transport Act, 1958, to the Board's services on the lines of the Fishguard Company and it is considered necessary to remove that doubt.</P>
    <P>In the course of my speech to the House on the second reading of the Transport Bill, 1964, I indicated that the Government had decided after very full consideration to preserve the railway system subject to such further concentration and reorganisation as might prove practicable and desirable. CIE have now advised me that they have carried out a detailed analysis of the cost of operating the rail services on the Waterford-Mallow line.  They have found that the services are seriously uneconomic and they are satisfied that there is a clear case for making at an early date a final decision on whether to close the line.  This situation obtains despite the fact that operating costs had been reduced by dieselisation.  CIE have had to order a number of replacement diesel locomotives this year and if the line remains open they will have to spend an extra £344,000 on additional replacenient locomotives.  Apart from this capital saving, CIE estimate that a saving of £50,000 per annum would result from the withdrawal of rail services on the line and the provision of substitute road services where necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill is intended to provide the necessary statutory power to enable the termination of train services on the lines of the Fishguard Company in this country as if they were services on the CIE railway system.  CIE will thus be empowered to terminate services on the Waterford-Mallow line if they so decide.</P>
    <P>I would like to give Senators some details of the line and of the services. The Waterford-Mallow line is approximately 76 miles long, all single track, with 14 intermediate stations.  The principal passenger service over the line is the Rosslare Express between Rosslare and Cork, which connects with the Fishguard/Rosslare passenger sailings.  During the summer timetable the express operates twice daily from Cork on Mondays to Saturdays, twice daily from Rosslare Harbour on <Col N="1724" /> Tuesdays to Saturdays and once daily from Rosslare Harbour on Sundays and Mondays.  During the winter the express operates each way on three days a week.  In addition, there is one passenger service each way daily, except Sundays, between Waterford and Cork all the year round.  This service also provides main line connections at Mallow and Waterford.  For freight traffic there is one train each way daily between Waterford and Mallow.  The number of passengers joining and alighting daily per intermediate station on the line has been found to average between eight and nine.  The volume of freight traffic originating and terminating at these stations is relatively small and could be catered for by CIE with an addition to their road freight fleet of seven lorries and trailers.</P>
    <P>CIE have advised me that if the final investigation clearly indicates the need to close the line, there would be no intention to withdraw the Rosslare Express service serving Waterford, Mallow and Cork.  This service would be diverted via Limerick Junction with 20 minutes increase in overall time for through passengers, who will still have the benefit of a through service without change of trains.  CIE are satisfied that this arrangement, together with the substitute road passenger services for the areas no longer served by rail, would provide an adequate substitute for the terminated services.  Substitute road freight services, based on Waterford and Mallow, would be provided for intermediate station traffic, and through freight traffic, Waterford-Mallow-Cork, would be diverted by rail via Limerick Junction.  CIE are satisfied that these measures would meet requirements adequately.  The number of additional road vehicles required by CIE for the substitute road passenger services is five single-deck buses.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, I have, in recent months, stressed many times that CIE must live within the annual subsidy of £2 million for which provision was made by the Transport Act, 1964.  If the railway system is to be preserved even in attenuated form it <Col N="1725" /> is essential that CIE should continue to seek all possible ways and means of reducing losses.  The Board's costs continue to rise steadily due mainly to increases in salaries and wages and there are definite limits to the extent to which they can recover these losses by increases in fares and rates.  It is, therefore, clearly in the interests of the taxpayer and of the Board's employees and of the general public still relying on the Board's services that the Board should make a final decision on the possibility of cutting losses on uneconomic rail services which can readily be substituted by cheaper road services and, as in this particular case, by better utilisation of alternative railway lines.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was published I received a deputation of Senators and Deputies from the counties concerned. I have requested the Chairman of CIE to arrange for one representative deputation to be received in order that the Board may hear the case for the retention of the line.  I should make it clear that in my experience over many years there is always a protest at almost any change made of this and other types but the Board of CIE will be able to make their final decision having evaluated the two conflicting sets of arguments.</P>
    <P>It has been CIE's general experience that people in areas affected by rail closures have found that the alternative road services provided have proved a satisfactory substitute for the former rail services and over seven years I have had very few complaints of substance.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that when CIE receive a deputation on the matter there is one argument which I as Minister cannot accept.  I do not believe that a minor branch railway line whose major traffic can be carried on a parallel line has any prestige value whatever in a rural area.</P>
    <P>If the line were to be closed provision would be made for redundant staff either by transfers of personnel or by payment of compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Transport Acts.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with other matters <Col N="1726" /> covered by the Bill.  While, as I have already indicated, CIE have a statutory obligation to work, manage and maintain that portion of the Fishguard Company's undertaking within the State, the undertaking still remains vested in the Fishguard Company.  It will be necessary to provide for the abandonment of the Waterford-Fermoy section of railway line by the Fishguard Company if the line is closed and the purpose of section 3 of the Bill is to give the company the same powers of abandonment as apply in the case of CIE.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill is designed to facilitate the disposal of the land of any abandoned railway line.  It will enable CIE to sell by private treaty cottages and land forming part of an abandoned railway system to the tenants of such property.  It will also enable CIE to include in the sale, where convenient, some additional land of the abandoned line in order, for example, to make the tenant's holding more attractive.  It will be noted that it is the intention that section 4 will be deemed to have come into operation on the 9th day of July, 1963.  The reason for this is that certain sales of this kind have already been made on the assumption that the position was covered by the powers given under section 18 (2) of the Transport Act, 1963, whereas in fact that section was not adequate for the purpose.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 5 of the Bill is to provide for the more expeditious handling of disputes arising in regard to claims for redundancy compensation under transport legislation and so to avoid inconvenience to claimants. As some Senators may be aware there has already been delay in dealing with a number of claims.  I have considered how best to remedy this situation and I am advised that the most effective and expeditious remedy is to give claimants the right to apply to the Circuit Court to have their claims heard and determined.  Section 5 accordingly provides that claims, which have already been submitted to arbitration and which are not decided within three months of the passing of the Act, may be referred by either party to the dispute to the Circuit Court.  In the <Col N="1727" /> case of future claims the applicant will have the option of referring his case either to the arbitrator or to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I must demur from the recommendation the Minister has put to us in relation to this Bill.  We have an unhappy history in our activities in relation to the closure of branch railway lines. The proposal is one to permit the closure of a particular line and the proposal would not be before us at all, were it not for the question of the legality of some of the operations which have already taken place.  As the Minister has informed us, certain sales have been made on the assumption that the Minister had the necessary power, which, in fact, he had not. It is in consequence of this that the Oireachtas now have an opportunity of examining the situation.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether it is because of this discovery or of a change of heart consequent on the retirement of the outgoing Chairman of CIE that some form of consultation is being permitted by public representatives and interested parties in relation to proposed closures.  At least we welcome the change.  We can all recall the manner in which people representing substantial interests in the community were treated in the past by the dictatorial attitude of the retired Chairman who denied any consultations to parties affected by closures despite undertakings and promises given during the passage of the Transport Bill by the Taoiseach, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, that no railway line would be closed without adequate consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was completely discarded subsequently when it came to particular closures.  It is a very sore point, particularly in relation to the West Cork area where we are now devoid of any railway system west of Cork city.  The Minister has made certain claims in relation to alternative systems of transport, both passenger and freight.  He claimed that he has had very few complaints in this respect. <Col N="1728" /> There is one very good reason why he has had such a limited number of complaints.  What is the alternative now?  The lines are being used in the continent of Africa and what good would it do to advance criticism of the alternative system of transport provided?</P>
    <P>We know what the impact is on the local authorities in the increased maintenance costs of roadways because of the abandonment of the railway lines. In the course of his opening statement, the Minister referred to economies and to the prospect that this line could not be made to operate economically within a reasonable time.  I do not know what he had in mind as to &ldquo;a reasonable time.&rdquo;  Which railway line is economical and is it not a fact that the people throughout the State are contributing by way of subsidies to the maintenance of the railway system? Are they not entitled therefore to some claim to services since they are paying for them?  The day is gone when we are naive enough to think that we could ever succeed in making our lines economical.  It is a question of the degree of the economy involved and the effect a closure will have on the local community.</P>
    <P>In relation to the present case, the Minister says a saving of £50,000 will be made but we must put against that saving the extra cost involved for local authorities in the maintenance of roadways. We know that the customary pattern will recur in this case as regards compensation.  There will be capital compensation for the improvement of roadways but there is no provision here, never has been and never will be, for the increased cost of maintenance of roadways.</P>

      <P>We can take past experiences as a guide line for the people who will be concerned by this closure.  I do not know of any firm undertaking by the Minister in his presentation of the Bill that the road freight services to be provided by CIE will be equal in cost to the services that will be abandoned.  This possibly is the result of a lesson learned. Suggestions were made before and they did not stand up to investigation.  We know of the very heavy additional cost imposed on private firms, on business people, for the delivery of goods that were formerly ex-rail.  There has been a substantial increase in charges for the delivery of machinery and heavy goods by comparison with the former rail charges.  This is an important question, particularly in view of the exhortation to keep our production costs low in order that we may compete effectively in the modern world. These increased costs will have to be transferred to the shoulders of the agricultural community in affected areas and to business people in the towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also consider the position in towns and in the country where CIE have failed to provide reasonable <Col N="1730" /> passenger services as an alternative to train services.  Various submissions have been made to CIE to provide shelters for schoolgoing children and other persons affected by the abandonment of railway stations.  There have been complaints of people having to stand for long periods in bad weather. School children have to wait for bus services, and while waiting, they engage in many pranks and there have been complaints about this from business people and others outside whose buildings children have to wait because of the failure of CIE to provide shelters for bus passengers.</P>
    <P>Alternative accommodation to the closed railway stations has not been provided.  Surely it is not too much to expect that the buildings vacated because of rail closures could be converted and made available, particularly in towns, to provide shelters?  I speak particularly of the town of Bandon in this respect.  We understand from communications we have received that it is not the intention of CIE to provide such shelters outside the town. That is a very poor show on the part of our national transport undertaking.</P>
    <P>As I say, the objections I have to the rail closures are the cost involved to the people who have to pay higher charges for the transport of goods, the fact that the local authorities have to bear the brunt of the increased cost of maintaining our roads&mdash;and all Members of the Seanad appreciate the increased traffic there is on our roads &mdash;and the fact that we are now adding to the problem of increased traffic on our roads.  It may be said truthfully that it is not substantial, but it is an addition and it exacerbates a situation which is developing fast.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that there will not be a complete withdrawal of the Rosslare Express serving Waterford, Mallow and Cork and that this service will be diverted via Limerick Junction, adding 20 minutes to the overall travelling time for through passengers.  I do not think we can accept with equanimity an increase of 20 minutes in the train time between Rosslare and Cork. People who have travelled already are feeling tired enough and are anxious <Col N="1731" /> to get to their destination, particularly people travelling with young children. It is regrettable that so much extra time must now be spent in travelling.</P>
    <P>The Minister says this closure is clearly in the interests of taxpayers, and he refers to cheaper road services. I should like to think it was true but I have doubts about it.  At any rate, we do not think that satisfactory substitutes for former rail services have been provided, and we are disturbed by the economies that have been effected, not overall but for the benefit of one sector of our community at the expense of other sectors who have to pay for the substitute services provided.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, there is a change of heart in regard to consultations, and I am sure the members of the Oireachtas who represent the interests of the community concerned in this proposed closure will have a well-documented case to make against the closure of the line.  Knowing that a deputation is to be received, we think they are privileged people when we consider the treatment meted out to the people in the part of the county from which I come, who were denied any opportunity whatever of making a case in regard to the serious effects of the closure of the West Cork railway line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that in this debate we are considering the closure of a branch line.  We all subscribed to the 1958 legislation.  It was supported by all Parties in the Dáil and in the Seanad, and there was a certain agreement or understanding as to our approach to the problems of public transport.  The desire was that the railways would be maintained, and there would be, of necessity, pruning of uneconomic branch lines. The trade unions were asked by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, now the Taoiseach, during a debate on the Beddy Report in November, 1957, to face up to the realities of the situation.  The Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, was putting it to the trade union leaders that there was a problem in regard to those railways, <Col N="1732" /> that in regard to redundancy, they should co-operate in reducing the overall labour content in the railways so as to make the employment of the remainder more certain.</P>
      <P>The trade unions accepted that invitation. They co-operated, and there has been a great measure of redundancy of CIE employees, particularly on the rail side.  The compensation provided in the 1958 legislation was reasonably adequate, but, apart from the people who benefited by this compensation, there were scores, possibly hundreds, of railway employees who suffered by reason of transfer from one area to another in this general reorganisation.  I have a feeling&mdash;and anything the Minister has been saying or doing does not reassure me in this respect&mdash;the Minister is completely overlooking this invitation by the Taoiseach, the co-operation which was extended in the reorganisation of CIE, the suffering which CIE railway employees bore in the intervening years, and is now proceeding to depart from the general understanding behind the 1958 legislation.</P>
      <P>If I could be satisfied that the Minister's approach to this matter was still in conformity with that general understanding in regard to the 1958 legislation, then I and, I think, railway people generally would be prepared to continue co-operation in order to achieve the maximum economies, in order to ease the burden on the taxpayer by way of subsidy and to provide the best possible service to the community.  However, there is a general feeling that in spite of all the sacrifices, in spite of all the co-operation extended, the Minister is going to sell the railwaymen down the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister look at the problem which lies there because if his approach, as we understand it to be, continues, then, quite obviously, the approach of railway employees affected by this and other closures must be simply to hold on, not to co-operate, to stick as hard and as long as they can to what they have and forget about economies, forget about co-operation and forget anything but trying to cling <Col N="1733" /> on to their particular corner.  That is a very human and understandable reaction if we are now to have a situation in which the general approach to the 1958 legislation is gone overboard with this Minister.  Because we have had a change of Minister, we have a different approach to the problem and all that has gone before is wiped out and the railwaymen are to be sold down the river.</P>
    <P>As I said, we are not dealing with a minor branch line.  We are dealing with a relatively long stretch of line which serves a relatively important area, as has been demonstrated in recent years. The Minister, last winter or autumn, was at Mallow to open a new marshalling yard and new offices and there was a general improvement of the facilities available at Mallow.  A week or so afterwards he was at the other end of the line, namely, in Waterford, to open new offices there.  There was also an expenditure of money on the improvement of the loading facilities in Waterford. These are the two major points connected by this line but in between there are important towns which, if this line is closed, will no longer have any rail service or any rail connection. They are Fermoy, Dungarvan, Cappoquin and others not quite as big or as important.</P>
    <P>That area of West Waterford and East Cork will be without any rail service if this line is closed but, perhaps, that is not the most important aspect of the matter.  We have had the report of the NIEC, which has been accepted by the Government, about development centres.  It is recommended by the NIEC and agreed by the Government that Waterford should be designated as a growth centre.  I have seen recently in the Press advertisements inviting tenders for the building of roads approaching the general basic facilities for the establishment of factory sites in Waterford city. In this measure it is proposed to close a line which will directly connect Waterford.  Mallow and Cork.  This is rather foolish if we are really serious in believing that we can develop our economy.  If Waterford is to be a <Col N="1734" /> growth centre and industrial area where there will be a concentration and a growth of factories and industry generally, it is essential that there should be maintained, at least until we see the result, the existing rail facilities serving that important and growing industrial centre.</P>
    <P>Also involved in this is the fact that the line we are talking about is part of the Fishguard-Rosslare railway line, built by the company, which was 50 per cent owned by the British interests and 50 per cent by one of the old companies, possibly the Great Southern and Western Railways.  It was built along this route because of the facilities which it was designed to offer. British Railways were lectured over many years&mdash;the Minister was in the Seanad years ago on this matter&mdash;in regard to the facilities they provided between Britain and Ireland, and it was urged on British Railways the importance to us and to our economy of providing adequate services, particularly for our tourist industry for which the Minister also has responsibility. We have seen in recent years a development of the services provided by British Railways, after many years of complaints.  We all know now that the facilities are good.  There has been a vast improvement in the last year or eighteen months and we have attached importance to this because of the value to our economy of the tourist industry. Now we are proposing to close part of the Rosslare-Fishguard Railway Company line.  If British Railways, in turn, decide that they will close the line serving Fishguard, how can we complain? They could equally argue that the line into Fishguard is uneconomic, that the services to Fishguard could be provided by a few buses and lorries. It is not simply Fishguard.  It is part of the whole line, the whole service linking South Wales, Southern England, London, to the southern part of the 26 Counties.  This is the direct route.  Here we are proposing to close a line which was built in order to service this route and in which British interests were involved at the time and in which British Railways, I think, still have a 50 per cent interest. We would look very foolish if we <Col N="1735" /> started complaining later on if British Railways were to close the line on their side, namely, the line into Fishguard.</P>
    <P>The Minister may well say that there is an alternative route into Cork, a route which would follow the line from Rosslare to Waterford, then up to Carrick-on-Suir, Clonmel, and so on, into Limerick Junction and then south to Mallow and Cork again but that, of course, leaves out the important area I have referred to, the West Waterford-East Cork area, and it would close one of the remaining railway links into Waterford city.  We have already closed one of them, a line which ran from Kilkenny, from the main line.  That is closed already. Now the Minister, in this Bill, is proposing to give CIE authority to close another railway line serving the important area of Waterford.  If traffic is now to go via South Tipperary, around Clonmel into Limerick Junction would the Minister say if he is prepared to agree that the large amount of money necessary should be spent properly to develop Limerick Junction?  Those of us who travel know that Limerick Junction is a particularly difficult centre in regard to traffic operations.  There is the backing in of trains to the main platform&mdash;an island platform.  A great deal of money would be necessary in order to make that a proper junction so that trains could get through quickly and avoid all the loss of money and time involved in the present arrangement.  Now the Minister is proposing that more traffic should be routed through Limerick Junction.  That will lead to further delays and difficulties.  I wonder has he looked at the problem and is prepared to agree that the money should be spent in order properly to develop Limerick Junction?</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the Bill, not so much for what is involved in this particular line but rather in opposition to what I interpret the Minister's policy to be, namely, a change from the policy advocated by Deputy Lemass when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce and accepted <Col N="1736" /> and supported by all Parties at that time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill causes another wave of regret among most Members of this House because, here again, we have decided that another serious surgical operation on CIE is necessary.  To me, it is always a source of the greatest regret, not based upon any romantic conception of railways but upon hard, practical considerations, that branch lines are being closed down for whatever reason.  I quite well remember when the Taoiseach was here as Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1958.  He gave us the most positive assurances that when the Transport Bill, 1958, was passed and under the new and vigorous management which was about to take over, and when the necessary moneys were provided for the then ensuing five years, all would be well-but all is not well.  It does not look as if there will be any great improvement so long as matters are allowed to go on in the way they have been proceeding for so many years back.</P>
      <P>We have now got away from the mood enshrined in section 7 of the 1958 Act that it was possible to provide reasonable, efficient and economic transport services, and so on, and that the Board would become solvent within five years.  I remember that many Members of this House at that time protested against the nonsense of incorporating a provision of that kind in legislation when it was clear that it was only a piece of pietistic nonsense, as it was then described.  Notwithstanding that, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;the present Taoiseach&mdash;gave us all these solemn assurances, very few of which were realised in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said before, and I continue to say, that I do not believe the authorities in CIE&mdash;the Chairman, the General Manager, people who have the power of control, people who can make large changes&mdash;know what is going on.  I do not think the Minister for Transport and Power knows what is going on.  He has assured us that he has travelled upon railways and is <i>au fait</i> with what is going on&mdash;what <Col N="1737" /> passengers have to put up with, the kind of services provided.  Every time I travel on a train I could sit down and write a note to CIE telling them the kinds of things that ought not be allowed to happen and the kinds of changes they ought to make.  It is always a source of the greatest surprise to me that CIE permit the obvious deficiencies that result from bad management and indifference of approach on the part of the people in authority.</P>
    <P>We will get nowhere with our transport problems until we make up our mind that our railways are a necessary service which the community will have to provide for.  It is as necessary a service as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  We all accept the subsidisation of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  We have to pay large sums of money out of taxation for the upkeep and maintenance of the roads, in addition to what is provided by people who use the roads.  To fix at £2 million the subsidy to be granted to CIE as the absolute maximum is again the same kind of thing as was done in 1958 when it was said that the Board should become economically viable within five years from the passing of that Bill.  So long as that kind of Sword of Damocles is held over the employees of CIE and over the managers in CIE, we shall not have the right approach.  People think they are working in a firm that is condemned to be contracted, that they are working against a financial limit, that they will not get the kind of co-operation necessary to make CIE a going concern which, indeed, a transport system ought very much to be.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the failure of CIE to advertise their good wares.  They provide some excellent services. Recently, I travelled to Limerick on a Sunday and I retain happy memories of that Journey.  Unfortunately, I got a lift back as I should have preferred to come home by train.  The cost was only 18/- or 26/- which is superb value in these days.  I was not aware that such good value was available from CIE. It was purely accidental that I had to go to Limerick on that Sunday by train, as it was arranged that I should <Col N="1738" /> go by car.  We must all agree that it is very good value to travel 240 miles for 18/- or 26/&mdash;I forget the correct figure. Consider the cost in terms of driving&mdash; the cost of petrol, wear and tear, and so on.  CIE provide superb value in that way and one would not get better value for his money these days, no matter how else lie employed it.  I am quite certain that equally good services are provided by CIE but that they do not tell people about them.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill to make further provision in relation to transport.  We are entitled to talk fairly widely upon the subject of CIE.

      <P>I do not travel by rail as often as I should like.  One way in which CIE can help to reduce their losses is by advertising to greater effect the services which they provide.  As I say, I think they have very few lights and, such as they have, they appear to hide under a bushel.  It seems to me Córas Iompair Éireann will continue to decline and we shall have more Bills of this kind if they do not look into some of the fundamentals involved in the running of any transport system.  One of the fundamentals is that there should be punctuality.  I do not think CIE err to any great extent under that heading, but there are ancillary services which CIE fail to provide. Certainly the catering services as far as the western area is concerned are wholly inadequate.  I have complained before against this physiological directive to passengers travelling west of the Shannon that, when they enter Mayo, they shall cease to have stomachs and appetites, cease to be hungry or thirsty.  CIE say that, after Athlone, all people going into Mayo must not be hungry or thirsty and small children and babies must not require bottles heated, or anything of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as CIE do that kind of thing, there is great danger that what is now happening in Fermoy will very shortly happen in Mayo and we shall find CIE cutting off the Mayo line in the same way as they are cutting off the line from Rosslare to Cork.  There is nobody in a better position to oppose this kind of thing than the Minister for Transport <Col N="1740" /> and Power.  He can put a stop to what is being sought to be done by CIE through the agency of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister is in charge of a Department which is, in my opinion, one of the most important in the State.  He is also in charge of tourism.  It is hardly necessary to point out that if a longer route to one's destination is provided, it will not encourage tourism.  More important, this country at the moment is a haven for British motorists and for people coming from the crowded streets of English cities and the crowded roads of the English rural areas.  The more buses that are put on the roads, the more of these horrible lorries, the less attractive we will make the country from the point of view of tourists.  It is regrettable that we should be diverting more and more traffic to the roads at a time when we should be trying to preserve the things that make this country so attractive from the point of view of the enormous tourist potential from the British Isles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tells us there will be five single-deck buses in substitution for this service which will be dispensed with under this Bill.  Córas Iompair Éireann have an obligation to provide proper services at different points along the route on which this bus service will be substituted.  CIE are also under obligation to provide proper amenities in substitution for those normally to be found at railway stations.  In some of the areas in which branch lines have been closed down, people are compelled to hang around in the open waiting to catch buses or meet passengers coming off buses.  There are absolutely no amenities, no heated waiting rooms, no lighting, and no toilet facilities of any kind.  In my opinion, CIE should provide suitable waiting accommodation at points along the route to serve the public in the same way as the railway stations served the public so that people will have some degree of comfort and hygiene.  The taproom of a public house is not a suitable place in which to ask people to wait for buses.  In wintry weather the streets are not suitable places in which to require people to wait for buses; neither is the <Col N="1741" /> outside of shops.  There are people who do not frequent public houses. There are young boys and girls going to or coming from school; they cannot wait in public houses.  Since CIE are doing away with the railway stations, there is an obligation on them to provide suitable alternative waiting accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the fact that there will be an increase of 20 minutes in the alternative route.  I do not suppose that will make a tremendous difference but it is rather a pity that it is not a shorter route of shorter duration.  Will there be an increase in fares because of the longer distance to be travelled and the longer time involved?</P>
    <P>There is, too, the problem of abandoned railway lines.  A good example of what happens is that of the line from Harcourt Street to Bray. Sections of that line have been sold to adjoining landowners.  That may be a good thing from the point of view of providing some much needed capital for CIE but I wonder whether it is good policy in the long run.  These lines could be turned into one-way highways, thereby relieving congestion on the roads.  The number of cars is increasing and such alternative roads could prove a valuable asset in helping to reduce traffic congestion on the roads.  The danger is that, if these sections of abandoned line are sold, some time in the future they may have to be bought back again or compulsorily acquired and the owners compensated. That is an aspect that should be considered by the Minister, his Department and Córas Iompair Éireann in conjunction with the Minister for Local Government and the relevant local authorities.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in the Bill with regard to redundancy.  It may be that there will be no redundancy.  If there is redundancy, there is no reason whatever for giving less favourable treatment to those rendered redundant under this Bill than was accorded under other pieces of transport legislation up to this.  There may be some provision in the Bill under which those who may become redundant will automatically <Col N="1742" /> be entitled to the same compensation as the people were in 1958, but I have been unable to discover it. I should like the Minister to clear up that point.</P>
    <P>There is a point in regard to section 5 which I can take up on Committee Stage.  However, I do want to say that it is with the greatest reluctance that I would assent to the passing of this Bill, which, as Senator O'Sullivan pointed out, comes before us only as a legal technicality.  The Minister and the Government should reorganise their thinking about railways and realise that rail transport in this country inevitably falls into the same category as postal services and road services which have to be subsidised regularly out of public funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said about the closing of railways and one can be quite sure that when anybody says anything about closing a railway line, one will see many crocodile tears being shed and will see displays of histrionics.  I am sure that when the Minister has to decide to close a line he has very good reasons for even considering it.  Most of the reasons stem from the fact that the people themselves abandon the railway lines. Most of the people who engage in the greatest protests at the time of a closing are those who are responsible for the closing by virtue of the fact that they have traffic which they could offer to the line but do not do so.  We had the same situation in Clare over the West Clare line.  Deputations came from all over West Clare composed of important persons who had traffic to give but would not give it.  It was traffic which would have remunerated the line, but instead they gave it the traffic which would not be carried by anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If anybody came along now and asked to have the West Clare line reinstated and the present road system withdrawn, the howl would be heard from one end of the country to the other because the people know that now they have a much better service provided by the road section than they could ever hope to get from the railway system.  Anybody who wants <Col N="1743" /> to look at the thing sensibly knows that the railways were built at a time when economic conditions demanded a particular service and the best that could be done at the time was to provide the railway system.  Railway stations were often located at places determined by the route taken by the system and in most cases they are to be found in the most inconvenient locations.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody could make a good case for some of the redundant lines because private concerns, if they can afford to do so, are providing their own transport.  In other cases they are engaging people who can offer these services.  Thus they have neglected and walked away from the railways for good, sound economic reasons.  So far as the employees are concerned, my experience is that the people who were made redundant were so well treated by CIE that there was great jealousy among the people who are not re-dupdant and who tried to get influence used to have themselves made redundant. I do not think that the employees suffered in any way.  Generally, the people have got a better service, the roads have improved very considerably, to the advantage of the motorist who is always using them, and I do not think the people would want to go back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that it has been necessary to introduce this Bill because while it is easy to close down a service and tear up a system, it is a different matter to provide replacements. I have had some experience of this because in my own county the line between Portarlington and Kilkenny was closed some years ago.  The effect of that closure was to burden the county council with the removal of a number of obsolete railway bridges, and we have been left with many derelict sites in the shape of railway stations, and the railway line itself is in a disused condition.  This certainly is not in accord with the Minister's responsibility in regard to tidy towns. What the country needs at present is not a new Dr. Andrews to continue on the present queer system of CIE but a <Col N="1744" /> new Percy French who will whip up public opinion and get those in charge of CIE to tackle this problem realistically.</P>
      <P>Senator Honan outlined the reasons why people are not using the CIE services.  I assure the Minister and the House that the reason is purely one of economics.  CIE charges are high, and if transport is opened again to private enterprise, the public will have a much more efficient and cheaper transport system.  I cannot understand how private individuals can equip themselves with buses and run services which are not in competition with CIE, except in regard to tours: I know of private buses which are being used to service routes which CIE would deem uneconomic.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the number of fares taken up on the 76 miles of railway line, serving 14 intermediate stations, was an average of eight or nine per day.  In order to cater for these eight or nine people, CIE find it necessary to purchase five new single-deck buses and seven lorries and trailers.  I cannot understand why it should be necessary to have so much equipment to transport nine or ten people.  Surely there is something inconsistent in the Minister's figures and perhaps he would explain them in his reply.</P>
      <P>CIE appear to put very little thought into their decisions.  Last year the railway station at Geesala, on the Athlone line, was closed down.  There is a single track there and while they closed the station, it was necessary to retain the services of two men, the stationmaster and another man, because trains were forced to pull in to allow other trains to pass.  Residents from that area who wish to avail of the CIE services had to travel 12 miles to Tullamore to get a train.  The train then came back to their own station before continuing on its journey.  Surely in a case like that, where the staff have to be maintained for shunting and other purposes, we could devise a system of a one-man station where one officer would be able to act as ticket seller and the lot, especially for the convenience of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1745" /> CIE forget they are giving a public service.  They have had a monopoly of that service and like many other services it has not been paying its way. The public know that.  People living in rural Ireland have as much right to expect some service from the public services, to which the taxpayers are subscribing generally, as anybody else in any other part of the country.  I would use the CIE train service entirely if it suited me but it does not suit my particular business.  The speed and efficiency of the service from Portlaoise to Dublin are very good.  That is the part of the rail system with which I am quite familiar.  I feel it is second to none.  As Senator O'Quigley said, it is a most reasonable and cheap service.</P>
    <P>At the present time with the increase in taxation on motor cars, and the increase on petrol I feel that many cars will go off the road.  Therefore, it is regrettable that the Government should deprive the people of the transport service.  I would have preferred to see CIE endeavouring to sell their services in a much better way.  A couple of years ago they did that to quite an extent in their advertising on Telefís Éireann.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate whether or not the money the Board spent on advertising paid any dividends at all.  It is a pity to see this great State concern go.  Several reasons are given for this but it should be within the competence of CIE to correct them.</P>
    <P>It is bad that those at the top in CIE in Dublin are completely out of touch with what is happening down the country. The rules and regulations of CIE should be a little bit more flexible.  CIE should be able to suit their clients' wants.  I should also like to refer to the exorbitant charges which CIE make for cattle and livestock haulage. This is something which should be looked into.  In many cases where people want to transport a prize animal to a show CIE could do a little more to bring their charges to some reasonable figure.</P>
    <P>If the Minister insists on closing the Southern railway line, he should as an experiment hand the region over completely to private enterprise and see if <Col N="1746" /> private hauliers and bus owners could provide as good a service to the public at a much cheaper rate.  I believe they could provide it at a much cheaper rate than CIE are at present able to do.</P>
    <P>We are told that it costs up to £100,000 a mile to lay down a new dual carriageway.  I am not overawed by the Minister's figure of £334,000 for new rolling stock should the railway line remain open.  I should like to know the cost of a new locomotive, also the cost of the new single-deck buses and lorries which are necessary to provide a service for the dozen or so people whom the Minister states are the only people using the railway lines in question at the present time.</P>
    <P>The public relations aspect of CIE, and especially of the Minister's own Department, needs to be overhauled. That is something to which the Minister could devote a little more time than he does.  I know that the Minister has been criticised in the past for his disowning of CIE when any problems arise.  If there were better public relations, especially where Members of the Dáil ask questions of local importance and if the Minister adopted a different attitude and endeavoured to meet Deputies' queries in this regard, people might, perhaps, take a more lenient view and he would not be drawing as much criticism of his Department as he is.  After all, public relations could be good for business. We have an excellent service but the whole thing is to provide a service to suit the majority of the public.  Having regard to the cost of motoring at the present time more and more people will be abandoning their own transport and turning to the railways.  For that reason, CIE should do their best to provide as good a service as possible for the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to say a few words regarding the closing of railways.  We had experience of that in the west.  The whole thing arises out of an evolution, a changing of times, a changing of the requirements of the people and the people demanding facilities and services which are best suited to themselves.  I can remember the time when we had <Col N="1747" /> guaranteed railways.  As a matter of fact, I was a member of two sections of those guaranteed railways.  In those early days the number expected to travel on them was sufficient to justify the construction of those lines.  When they were abandoned, they were abandoned by the people for whose use and benefit they were constructed. Those people felt it was in their own best interests to allow those sections of railway line to be abandoned rather than provide the small subsidy&mdash;it might have been a considerable subsidy for them&mdash;to keep the lines in existence.</P>
      <P>Later on, after CIE was established, sections of lines were abandoned.  The main reason those sections were abandoned has been very clearly stated in this House.  It was because it was in the best interests of the people using the lines that they were closed.  The people did not use the lines.  There is no use placing the blame where blame does not lie.  I personally counted among my very great friends the last two Chairmen of CIE, Dr. C. S. Andrews, and before him Mr. T.C. Courtney.  I know these men were absolutely dedicated men.  Mr. Courtney, God rest his soul, was taken out of the Department of Local Government.  He was then Engineering Adviser to the Department of Local Government and he was taken out of that very responsible office and appointed Chairman of CIE.  It is a coincidence that these two people were appointed by different Governments representing different thinking.  One, to my mind, was as dedicated as the other and both of these were in the closest possible contact with the problems they were given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know furthermore that, in the case of the late Mr. Courtney, he was promised a particular salary which could not be realised, unless and until he made the railways a paying proposition. He tried that and he failed, and any other person who tries to keep the railways of this country, as they existed, a paying proposition will fail. That is generally recognised now.  We have had during my time in Seanad Éireann a Bill which authorised a <Col N="1748" /> subsidy of £2 million a year to maintain CIE.  That amount cannot be exceeded and the responsibility of the Minister and the responsibility of the Chairman and Board of CIE is to operate within that annual subsidy.</P>
    <P>Senator D.J. O'Sullivan said that the new services have resulted in a substantial increase, or may result in a substantial increase, in the cost of delivery of goods.  I fail to see that, in view of the fact that as I travel 150 miles from the west of Ireland a few times in the month, sometimes by road and more often than Senator O'Quigley by rail, I meet lorries on the road from Claremorris, Ballyhaunis and Castlebar which are already being served by a very adequate rail service.  I meet lorries going out across the country to Belmullet, although there is a good service to Ballina, within 50 miles of Belmullet.  These people by using their own lorries on the roads disprove the allegation that the new service will cost more than the existing service.</P>
    <P>It is also suggested that the old railway stations may be used as shelters. Anybody who studied the old railway system in this country must have realised that in the construction of the railways every effort was made to keep the cost as low as possible. Consequently, all our railways run through the poorest country, through bogs and they were never brought into the towns.  Sometimes they were brought convenient to the towns but most of the railway stations are a mile or more from the centre of the towns. How people can suggest that these old railway stations could be used as shelters and that the bus services could operate from these railway stations beats me.  They are out of touch with reality.</P>

      <P>I did not say the Senator did; it was Senator D.J. <Col N="1749" /> O'Sullivan who said it.  I agree that the bus depots in the towns are very often quite inconvenient and not up to the standard we would all like to see.  I agree with Senator O'Quigley that this is a matter which should be looked into.  As far as possible, more suitable accommodation should be provided, particularly in the larger centres, rather than having people use the taproom of a public house or stand in the street.  There should be a reasonable waiting room with reasonable accommodation in the large centres.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley made one historic journey to Limerick which cost him something like 17/- or 18/- but he must not have travelled on the west of Ireland trains recently.  The last time he travelled, there was no dining car west of the Shannon.  I very frequently travel on the 10 o'clock train from Castlebar to Dublin and very often on the 2.55 or 6.50 from Dublin to Castlebar and on all those there are dining car facilities.</P>

      <P>We all have in mind, and sympathise with, Senator Murphy's interest and concern for the employees who may become redundant as a result of the closure of a particular railway line, but I think that although he expresses that concern and we sympathise with him, the concern is not very seriously founded because in most cases these people are given alternative employment.  I agree with one Senator who said that in many cases they would prefer to be considered redundant than to be kept on because the alternative was more attractive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McDonald questioned the demolition of bridges.  Generally, the <Col N="1750" /> demolition of bridges on a railway line is dealt with by Government grant and does not fall on the ratepayers.  He asked a question about the cost of providing transport and the number of buses required to accommodate travellers on the line now about to be abandoned.  The Minister said there was on an average eight or nine passengers per 14 stations, or 120 passengers per day&mdash;not eight or nine as Senator McDonald said.</P>
    <P>With regard to opinion in the country generally, on the suggested closing of a railway line there is an outburst and more often it is an outburst emanating from some local organisation which of itself possibly cannot be of great service or give much traffic to the railway line, but, in any case, which does not represent people who could give a lot of traffic to the railway line.  Those people who have traffic and who are not giving it to the railways are generally mute. They have not a word to say and know very well that they are not using the railway line and are not concerned whether a particular branch is closed or not.</P>
    <P>Once a branch is closed and the road repaired and put into good condition by grants by the Government, the people are delighted rather than displeased.  They adjust themselves to the new conditions and nobody will convince me that the type of transport of stock which starts off in Belmullet through Claremorris up to the midlands is preferable.  I saw them, when I came along today.  I saw them at Edgeworthstown and other places where they have their marts; they load their cattle on to the trucks and take them right on to the farm. That is what suits the people and, as far as the ordinary passenger traffic is concerned on those small sections of the line, I would say that one in four or one in five of the houses in the west of Ireland has a motor car at the present. There is no isolated village in the County of Mayo at the present time. I go out fishing and, when one goes out fishing in the remote areas, one sees a car at every second or third <Col N="1751" /> house.  Those people do not want rail transport, they have their own means and if the branch lines were there, they would not use them.</P>
    <P>We must support the Minister in the action he is forced to take by the circumstances, by the lack of passenger traffic, by the lack of goods traffic on the lines and operating, as he must do, within the terms of the subsidy, which is very definitely limited, we must give the Minister the permission he seeks to close down this particular railway line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I wish to join with the last speaker, Senator Flanagan, in the tributes he paid to the last two Chairmen of CIE, the late Mr. T.C. Courtney and Dr. C.S. Andrews, for their work for CIE. Their work as great public servants should be known to everyone and appreciated by all.  It is a pity it has been the subject of so much wrong comment in recent months because whatever gratuities or pension to which the Chairman of CIE was entitled were laid down by an Act of the Oireachtas some four years ago.  Consequently, it was known to all and was regarded, at that time, as the minimum incentive necessary to entice a man of adequate standing to face the very difficult and unrewarding task of trying to make CIE pay their way.  Dr. Andrews deserves the gratitude of all for the intense effort he made to have them pay their way and I am very glad to have an opportunity of joining with my colleague, Senator Flanagan, in this tribute in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the Bill itself, I think it would never have come before us were it not for a doubt about the legality of CIE being entitled to close this line. I think the next line on the schedule, which is probably the Mallow-Killarney line, will fall without any opportunity to discuss it in the House. It is a pity to see this happening.  I know, at the present stage in our evolution, it does seem that the tendency is away from rail traffic to road traffic.  But just as surely as this is the tendency in the evolution today, that must go on, and in a very short time <Col N="1752" /> the swing will be back to the railroads, or, at least, to what we might call the main traffic lines, the main arteries of traffic where I hope and expect that engineering inventiveness will have perfected the means of a quick transition from road to railroad.</P>
    <P>Indeed, we all ought to be perturbed at seeing the increasing congestion on our roads today and the great part played in that by these trailers and lorries, and especially by the abominable lorries with trailers which are, in many ways, a greater hazard on the roads today than the speed-hog because, while the speed-hog goes along at an excessive speed, they err on the other side and, consequently, bottle up traffic on the main lines.  The only solution at present would seem to be wider roads, dual carriageways or some opportunities of passing these lorries.  It is high time the Minister took cognisance of the threat posed by these lorries and trailers and laid down a minimum speed for them or else let the lorries operate as lorries without trailers attached.</P>
    <P>I do think in the very near future it will be commonplace for such traffic to be diverted on to the main lines for freight, one might say, that is our railroads. At present there are great economic difficulties about that because the prices charged by CIE for this are not, in many cases, competitive with what the firm could do it for themselves.  It is something which should be capable of being ironed out in the future; it is all a case of the chicken and the egg.  If CIE can get a lot more freight they can charge this, but they will not get a lot more freight until they charge this, so which has got to come first?  In England at the present time they are very anxiously exploring ways and means of getting a good deal of the heavy goods traffic off their roads and on to their railroads. This is something we should watch very carefully and that is why I am always perturbed about seeing main arteries closed down because, once you have closed a main railroad, you cannot reopen it without great cost.</P>
    <P>I am not very impressed by the <Col N="1753" /> figures quoted by the Minister or, indeed, for that matter, by the reliability of the figures we are ever given to justify various Government actions. We are always finding, having been told a certain thing will cost 2/6 in the £ on the rates, that afterwards it cost not that but four, five or six times that amount.  It is the same thing in all the claims usually made by Ministers about savings which will result from closing branch lines and so on. I do not think those savings ever materialise.  I should like&mdash;and it would be very instructive if it could be done&mdash;to have a report by a couple of efficiency experts, operations and methods men, on the actual situation which has evolved out of the closure of the West Cork railroad.  It would be a great guide for the future to know precisely what has been the overall saving, if any&mdash;and &ldquo;if any&rdquo;, I think, are the operative words&mdash;to the country as a whole due to that action. Probably it is very hard to disentangle it but the extra expenditure on the roads over and above probably what would have been necessary in any case, has been rather defeated in that we have failed to get the heavy freight off the roads and on to the railroads. Therefore, our solution seems to be to put it all on the roads.</P>
    <P>There is an astonishing claim made in the present report that if the line remained open, it would be necessary to spend another one-third of a million pounds on additional replacement locomotives.  On the other hand, we are told that most of the really heavy passenger traffic on the line from Rosslare to Cork will be carried by CIE in any case.  It will be carried by Limerick Junction.</P>
    <P>I do not want to press this cost analysis too far: it is only a bookkeeping device.  If you have to carry for a certain extra number of miles, you probably multiply by the increased percentage of mileage that has to be gone through.  Equally, there is no foundation for this, because we are dealing only with 76 miles of line which is one-thirtieth of the national network.  The total of all the freight operated on the national network today is given as under £15 million.  How <Col N="1754" /> then would we require on this little-used portion of that line an expenditure of £1/3 million?  In cost analysis, if you make an arbitrary assumption, you get an arbitrary result.  You have to make some assumptions, but this one seems to be taking the straight line method of cost analysis much too far.</P>
    <P>Again, the amount of equipment is suspiciously close to being two-thirds of the average amount of equipment per line on the existing railways system.  I do not think that can seriously be justified.  In any case, there will be new buses and new trucks.  It is very difficult to make any firm estimate but I doubt if there will be any real saving.  I for one cannot see CIE, a year after the closure of this line, having their losses reduced by £50,000.  The whole concept of what is an economic unit needs to be gone into.  Today, an economic line is not one that breaks even, which is the standard meaning of an economic unit. It is one that is not losing more than is lost on an average mile of railroad track.</P>
    <P>I dislike seeing trunk roads, even if they are iron roads, being dismantled while there is still a hope that the engineers will succeed in completing the present evolution and switch the traffic from road to rail at very little inconvenience, thereby providing an efficient railroad system rather than pushing all the traffic on to the road system, which could store up many problems for us in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put a brief question to the Minister on an item which has been mentioned by various speakers in the debate.  Does the Minister have prior consultations with his colleague in the Department of Local Government about the roads which will have to carry the additional traffic when a line is closed?  Invariably we find that when a railway line is closed, roads which were never intended to carry heavy traffic are immediately cluttered with it.  Regardless of the merits of this case, a line should never be closed until the Minister has made sure that the roads are adequate to cater for the huge volume of traffic <Col N="1755" /> which will flow from the closing of a line.  The disruption of traffic on the roads as a result of the necessary repairs being carried out because of increased heavy traffic, the diversions, the frustrating travelling, and so on, could be avoided if, when it was intended to close a line, the Minister would make sure, through his colleague in the Department of Local Government, that the roads were capable of carrying the extra heavy traffic before the line was closed, and not wait to lock the stable door when the horse has gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill demonstrates the tangled mess into which our railway system has been brought by the Government Party.  From the day our transport system was nationalised, it began to decline, and the element of private enterprise disappeared.  It is regrettable that the closure which is about to take place will create a certain amount of hardship for those who depend on the services provided on that line.  However, the figures which the Minister has given, if we can take them as being perfectly accurate, provide the Minister with a strong case for closing this line, but that does not relieve him and his Party of the guilt for making a mess of our national transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this line is closed, there will be extra traffic on our public roads. The Government are not spending all of the Road Fund towards the construction and maintenance of our public roads.  In my view, this track could be turned into a roadway and some of the Road Fund should be used for that purpose so that heavy traffic could be diverted to this new traffic line.  That would take a certain amount of traffic off the roads which are already crowded.  Many people are being killed and accidents are happening on the roads because our roads are not capable of taking the volume of traffic and providing the facilities for the higher speeds of which modern transport is capable.  I believe that the Minister should give an assurance now that the Government will consider using part of the Road Fund for the <Col N="1756" /> purpose of turning this railway line into a roadway for heavy traffic.  This would take the heavy traffic off the other public roads which will, of course, have to bear the extra traffic diverted from the railway.  Previous speakers have indicated various problems which the Bill will create.  The Minister must face up to the fact that it was a mistake to nationalise transport in this country.  I know the Minister will put up arguments, which will seem acceptable, to soften down the effect of nationalisation but we must realise that since the day nationalisation took place traffic on the railways has dwindled until now we are in the process of closing down line after line. Here we propose to close down another 76 miles of railway.</P>

      <P>The debate has been interesting.  Senators, no doubt quite rightly, raised issues which go far beyond the ambit of the Bill.  In connection with the section of the Bill dealing with the abandonment of the land owned by CIE when the railway is closed, no land has yet been sold on or beside the Mallow-Waterford line.  The section of the Bill dealing with abandonment of land and the method of disposal of land will apply generally all over the country.  It will not apply to the Mallow-Waterford line until it has been decided to close it.  Therefore, there is no commitment on CIE in regard to the selling of property along the line to private individuals by viewing in advance the inevitability of its closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator D.J. O'Sullivan said that the coming retirement of Dr. Andrews has something to do with Government policy in relation to transport.  That is not true.  Everything that has been done in relation to CIE&mdash;the passing of the 1964 Transport Act, for instance&mdash;was done with full cognisance of the Chairman and Board of CIE who accepted decisions of Oireachtas Éireann in regard to CIE and the limitations of the subsidy to which CIE are entitled. The coming retirement of the Chairman bears no relation to any alleged change of attitude on my part or on the part of any of my colleagues to <Col N="1757" /> transport policy.  Everything I have said recently, and particularly my observations in December, 1965, about the future of CIE was said with the knowledge and the forethought of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who was interested with me in the development of trade and industry and in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>I wish to deny the rumours being circulated that I have been out on a limb because of my particular attitude to CIE and the future of CIE.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that some Senators referred to the fact that when meetings of protest are held in connection with the proposed closing of a railway line the vast majority of those present have never made use of the services. That is one of the human difficulties associated with the closing of railway lines.  It is the same in every country. I have met most Ministers of Transport in Europe: I have been with them constantly in connection with the Ministers of Transport Conference and I know they go through the same difficulties as we do.  They have to deal with the same traditional reverence for the railways in every country, including some of the more modern countries using the most modern techniques.  This is a human difficulty affecting other countries besides ours.</P>
    <P>I have been asked about the number of CIE lines which are profitable at present and how does one judge what is a profitable and an unprofitable section of line.  The answer is that 410 miles of line are truly profitable, 750 miles are unprofitable and 300 miles are marginally profitable.  The lines closed are those where there is a very extensive loss in comparison with the others, taking into account the proportion of the line which is not economic which can contribute revenue towards an economic line.  A main arterial line may suffer through the closing of certain branch lines but in other cases the minimal traffic on one branch line may make it more profitable to carry the traffic by lorry.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the subsidy paid to CIE and it was suggested that quite possibly it is not sufficient.  The subsidy is £2 million, equivalent to <Col N="1758" /> 4s 6d per pound of rail freight and rail passenger revenue.  To use a rather vulgar phrase, I think it is the hell of a subsidy for the taxpayer to pay 4s 6d per pound of rail freight and rail passenger revenue.  It is a very good subsidy indeed.  It is equivalent, incidentally, to a tax of 4d per gallon on petrol.  If anybody would cheerfully like to suggest in Dáil Éireann that another 4d a gallon be imposed on petrol to double the subsidy for CIE I should like to hear him make the suggestion.  Fourpence a gallon on petrol is a fairly good impost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There were observations, quite rightly, in regard to the possible damage to the roads occasioned by the closing of this line.  I honestly do not believe that some 12 heavy vehicles will seriously affect the roads that run alongside the railway. I know very well that as in the case of other lines that were closed there will be a tremendous protest and that the county engineer, quite rightly, on his own behalf and on behalf of the county councillors whose county council administer the road services, will complain, but there will be improvements needed anywhere in the next 20 years and they could not possibly be said to relate to the immediate impact on the road services of the additional buses and lorries to carry the traffic diverted from the railway.  In this case, the major through traffic will be carried on the Waterford-Clonmel-Limerick Junction line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Senator referred to the increases in charges by CIE.  Of course, these are inevitable when costs go up.  Labour costs have regularly increased on all transport services everywhere, particularly on railways which, of the safety requirements, particularly on lines where the traffic is light and which in the case of CIE involves 61 per cent of total costs.  Even if inflation can be evaded by relating wages and salaries to productivity, the transport services <Col N="1759" /> are affected seriously by the level of salaries and wages because of the inability to decrease the labour content over large sections of the system due to safety requirements.</P>
    <P>Some Senators suggested CIE should be a social service.  Of course, it is a social service.  It is already trans-subsidised within itself in that the more profitable services of both freight and road and rail passengers are allowed to subsidise the less profitable services. It is true to say that all the services of the remote rural areas are not only subsidised by the taxpayer to the tune of £2 million a year but are also subsidised within the system, and a small proportion of the road passenger services, rail services and freight services make profits and there are a great number of services that do not pay and these are trans-subsidised by the more profitable services.</P>
    <P>Senator Flanagan gave a very good history of the railway and the inevitable changes that have taken place through the adoption of private transport by a huge number of people.  He has indicated the changes of habit that have taken place in this country, and there again we are not alone.  Thousands of miles of railway lines are being closed all over Europe, and although Ministers for Transport differ in their attitude, they generally agree at some point to the closing of a railway line, whereas there may be in certain countries a more restrictive attitude.  I can assure Senators that allowing for the fact that there is a reasonably good road system in this country, the kind of lines that have been closed in the past six years come within the category of lines that in the case of most countries in Europe would be regarded as suitable for closing and for replacement by road traffic.  As Senator Flanagan and Senator Honan remarked, when a substitute service of buses and lorries is provided, people in the area begin to realise that the bus and the lorry can reach more people, are more convenient and afford a better distribution and collection of goods system and a better method of transport for those people who do not <Col N="1760" /> have their own private cars, motorcycles or cycles.</P>
    <P>The redundancy compensation provisions apply to all the staff who may cease to have employment on the Mallow-Waterford line, if it is decided to close it.  I want to assure the Seanad on that that there is no question of the 1958 legislation applying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in the 1964 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1964 Act, which again relates to the 1958 Act.  The rate of redundancy will apply, but the redundancy on this occasion would be paid by CIE and not by the State. That was provided for in the 1964 Act.</P>
      <P>The impression has been given by some Senators that it is my policy to sell the railwaymen of CIE down the line, to quote one Senator.  All I have been is absolutely frank with the staff of CIE.  I pointed out that there is such a growth of private transport, such an enormous investment to the tune of £30 million a year in new equipment, that one is bound to treat CIE as a nationalised enterprise which is subject to heavy and very efficient competition.  When these State companies were started at different stages &mdash;most of them by my Government and some of them, including the ESB, at an earlier stage&mdash;they were not started for socialist reasons.  They were started because either the State company set up in a particular way was able to do a better job than private enterprise, had to take over a bankrupt private enterprise or was engaged in some entirely new form of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to look at each State company&mdash;and so do the Government&mdash; in a different light.  In the case of Aer Lingus, there is competition by surface transport but there is no private enterprise, Irish-owned, attempting to compete with Aer Lingus on a large scale. Bord na Móna has to compete with importations of coal but there at least is no competitor on a large scale in this country attempting to produce briquettes and milled peat.  In the case of CIE, there is growing and continuous competition, and all I have <Col N="1761" /> said to the management and staff of CIE is that they have to face the competition and not engage in exercises that are going to swell the costs of CIE to the point that they no longer can increase their charges, because if they increase their charges excessively, they will lose traffic and to a point which would be asking the public to pay a subsidy grossly in excess of what is required, having regard to the tremendous growth of private transport and to the huge quantities of goods now carried by companies in their own transport in this and in every other country.</P>
    <P>That is the point, and I have seen CIE, in spite of this competition, increase their volume of traffic over the past six years, increase their road freight traffic by some 58 per cent, increase the number of passenger miles on the shortened railway system by three per cent and increase by some very modest percentage the number of road passengers, in face of all this competition.  Therefore I believe they have the capacity to maintain and even to expand traffic, provided they are given a reasonable chance of conducting their operations without excessive interruption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>One Senator made the suggestion that we should be willing to increase constantly the subsidy. I do not think this idea would be good for any State company.  To give a State company in any country the impression that there was, on the occasion of the Budget, a possibility of an increased subsidy would simply be asking for inefficiency of a purely human kind and for inflation of the company's costs, and I think the Members of the Seanad, in the vast majority, would agree with me in that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Getting back again to the whole question of railways, Senator Quinlan <Col N="1762" /> suggested there might be a postponement of the closing of the line until it was quite certain that it would form part of a railway system that had been revitalised through modern techniques. It is possible that in the future the economic distance upon which a 125 to 200 miles per hour railway express might run may reduce from 300 to 800 miles to the length of the Cork line.  I very much doubt it, but I can assure the Senator that if both of us live long enough, no one will see the day when a very short twisting single railway line can be revitalised to take very high speed traffic.  I just do not believe it will happen.  I think people will be perhaps leaving the roads and getting into the air before they will start making use of single lines such as this for high speed traffic based on new techniques.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Other Senators asked some questions about the use of disused railway lines.  First of all, I have consulted the Minister for Local Government about the closing of this railway line.  If it is closed, it will be up to the local authorities to make such representations as they desire if they think the roads are going to be severely damaged.  The Minister for Local Government may have sufficient funds to give a once and for all grant, as he did in other cases, when lines were closed and when county councils claimed certain parts of the road needed improvement because of the growth of lorry and bus traffic.  I regret that having made a study of the question as far as I can, I find that very few engineers anywhere in the world seem to want to make use of abandoned railway tracks for road purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not absolutely true of double-line railway tracks that are abandoned but, of course, there are not many double-line railway tracks abandoned.  There are in some countries, but I cannot find any evidence that it is considered economic to turn a single track railway line into a road, particularly in rural districts. <Col N="1763" /> If it so happened that there was a single track railway line emerging from a city into suburbs, with a huge density of traffic, it might then be worthwhile to have the traffic, for example, go north to south in the morning and south to north in the evening, but even in that case I do not seem to have been given any reassurance by anybody that such a proposal is practicable.  I think I am right in saying that Dublin Corporation turned down such a proposal in respect of the Harcourt Street-Bray line where one might consider there would be a case for a single track railway at peak hours.  They did not consider it to be economic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not speak well for Dublin Corporation, having regard to the traffic situation now in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know anything about the details but I do know that they considered it was not practicable to do it.  British Railways have accepted the position that the Mallow-Waterford line will close and it will not diminish their initiative in the improvement of the services via Rosslare and Fishguard.  That matter has already been discussed with them.</P>
      <P>Limerick Junction is down for improvement. I cannot say at what date the improvement will be undertaken, but in the long list of capital improvements to be undertaken by CIE since 1958, Limerick Junction has been included and I think it is reaching towards the point where the work will be undertaken, although I could not guarantee exactly when, and I agree with the Senators that there should be an improvement of facilities there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley suggested that the Taoiseach in 1958 when speaking on the Transport Bill was extremely optimistic in his general commentary on the likelihood that CIE could pay.  I have not brought the reference with me because I did not think the debate would expand beyond the immediate ambit of the Bill, but I can assure the Seanad that the actual quotations from the Taoiseach's speech, indicate that he was guarded.  He hoped CIE <Col N="1764" /> would make progress and pay but he expressed doubt that the railway system could be made to pay, so he did protect himself in that regard.  He did not make an overall statement to the effect that under the new dispensation CIE would finally get into the black for all time.</P>
    <P>I might add that the Taoiseach is not the only Minister for Industry and Commerce who has expressed guarded optimism about the future of railways. Ministers for Transport all over Europe in the past 50 years have spoken rosily about the future of reorganised railways and two Coalition Ministers, the Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1950 and the late respected Deputy Norton, in 1955, both made grossly over-optimistic comments on what could happen to CIE if certain re-organisation took place.  The reason for this was quite natural because CIE, like other railways, were operating under legislation designed to control and limit their activities and their freedom of operation.  They simply did not have the kind of accounting system that has been put in since 1958.  Until after 1958 no one really knew what it cost to run traffic over any part of CIE in strictly modern terms.  So no one was ever able to furnish Ministers before that with detailed costing analysis of how the system would run, and cost benefit analysis in relation to all parts of the system, including all sections of the tracks.  Now that is common practice among modern railways but the Pacemaker Report published by CIE was one of the first of its kind in Europe&mdash;a modern analytical examination of the costs of CIE in detail.  It enabled us for the first time to assess the whole economic future of CIE and to make up our minds quite definitely that a subsidy should rightly be paid up to a certain limit for the sake of the social element in a public transport system and because of the difficulty of replacing a rail system with any other system, even if it was desirable to do so.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senators about the lack of publicity by CIE in certain connections and I am constantly pressing them to modernise some of their <Col N="1765" /> publicity in regard to the services they operate, and so forth.  I think their publicity could be more widespread but I have noticed an extension of modern forms of publicity recently by CIE, and I hope it will continue.</P>
    <P>The rumours that the Killarney line is to close are without justification, and in connection with Senator Quinlan's speech in general, in so far as it referred to the value of the arterial system of CIE, there can be no major decision in connection with the arterial rail system of CIE without a long-term examination, and the fact that the Mallow-Waterford line might close does not relate to any decision by the Government that the main arterial railway lines of CIE should close either now or in the near future.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald referred to various matters in connection with the local administration of CIE.  I do hope that all Senators will have no hesitation in contacting area managers where there is evidence of lack of initiative or inefficiency because area managers are supposed to have very considerable delegation of powers to be able to make changes without having too much recourse to headquarters, particularly in matters of a purely local kind.  From what I know, they are competent persons and I hope Senators will not hesitate to keep in contact with them because that is the way in which there can be a check on the day to day management of CIE.  It is utterly useless to have people asking questions which could reach the Dáil, for example, by the dozen and which, by the political pressure exercised, would completely take away from the independence of the Board.  Most Members of the Opposition know this in their heart of hearts.  Area managers are there to receive complaints in regard to local services and to act on them.</P>
    <P>So far as my own position is concerned, we have a complaints service in my Department and all the complaints that become repetitive and that are numerous in regard to a particular section of the CIE service or any other State company are discussed with the management of CIE at regular intervals <Col N="1766" /> and with the management of other State companies in respect of their services.  It seems to me that a combination of ministerial general supervision, of general discussion in the Dáil at Estimate time and of contact between the public in general and the area managers of CIE is the best way of ensuring that inefficiency is reduced to the minimum and that the Board and all the executive staff become aware of such inefficiency as exists.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that Senator Quinlan took the occasion to pay tribute to Dr. Andrews for what he did for CIE and that Senator Flanagan referred to his work and also to that of Mr. T.C. Courtney.  This was very nice to hear after the abuse that has been published in the newspapers from another quarter, to which I will not refer.  I was very glad to hear that very rightful tribute to Dr. Andrews for his tremendous exertions and for the fact that CIE traffic, through the cooperation of the vast majority of the staff, has increased, that the efficiency of CIE has increased, that punctuality of the trains is far better than it was and, from very closely examining the operation of the railway system, it is quite evident that there has been an improvement over the years.  I think there can be still more improvement.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan referred to piggyback traffic on the railway, such as large lorries being taken on trucks. That may come in the future on the arterial lines.  In Great Britain and America, experience has shown that such traffic seems to be economic only for distances of about 300 miles and upwards.  With changes in costings of various kinds in the future, it may be that the CIE system could be used to some extent for that traffic.  However, there are restrictions because of the nature of the traffic and the various technical restrictions upon the development of that kind of traffic on any considerable scale.</P>
    <P>I do not think one can compare the number of diesel engines in use by CIE, per mile of line.  Everything depends on the kind and frequency of the traffic and also on the conditions that apply to the working of the staff, <Col N="1767" /> their rest periods, time off, and so on.  If this line goes, CIE will have to order only 12 diesel engines instead of 17.  The remaining five would be required if this line were maintained.  I do not think it is any use to relate the five diesel engines to a particular length of line.  They have to be related to the continuous traffic and to the general use to which the line is put. It is not a matter on which I can go into detail at this stage but I am quite certain that CIE made the right kind of calculation about it.  I thank the House for a very constructive debate.</P>

      <P>I am still not satisfied with the figures the Minister gave in relation to the train services on the section of line proposed to be closed. I feel that if CIE were really out to make economies, they would, perhaps, stop the daily passenger service each way, except Sunday&mdash;the ordinary passenger service between the 14 stations.  The Minister said that, as people will have to travel on the diverted route, the journey will take an extra 20 minutes.  I feel that CIE could easily drop the ordinary regular service and operate the existing <Col N="1769" /> express service, stopping at each of the 14 stations.  I am sure it would not take much more than an extra 20 minutes.  In that way, I reckon they should be able to cut the costs by one-fifth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a general discussion on the Second Stage.  This Bill really only enables CIE to close the Mallow-Waterford line, if they so decide.  It would seem to me to be contrary to the procedure of the Oireachtas to begin a Second Stage debate again.  I told the Senator that CIE investigated all this.  The use of the Mallow-Waterford line from Mallow to Waterford is negligible by current standards and it is best to send the through traffic from Waterford to Limerick and Cork via Clonmel.  That is what CIE have decided, having gone into the matter in detail.  We have checked their figures.  I think it may be taken for granted that they have not made any mistake.</P>

      <P>Do I understand the Minister to say that if this closure takes place, CIE will not have to purchase five locomotives?  He said they would have to purchase 17 locomotives but that if this closure takes place, the number will probably be reduced by five.  In other words, five locomotives are involved in providing the service between Mallow and Waterford. During the summer, the Rosslare express operates twice a day from Cork and twice a day from Rosslare. In other words, the one locomotive does a round trip.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It will continue to do the longer round trip because there is not an express service between Waterford and Limerick Junction. There is an ordinary diesel train between Waterford and Limerick and again at Limerick Junction, from the main line.  There is also another passenger service operating on this Waterford-Mallow line once a day.  I am sure the Minister is well aware that the modern diesel electric locomotives operate practically 24 hours all round <Col N="1770" /> the country.  If you subtract one service from it and thereby save five locomotives, it seems extraordinary, to say the least of it.  I do not know if the Minister is in error about this but it simply does not make sense.</P>

      <P>Is it right to say that this is what CIE said, remembering that the Minister has a responsibility to understand his figures?  If he is basing his case to the House on a saving of five locomotives, surely he has a responsibility from the point of view of understanding what the problem is to tell us about them as against coming in here and merely stating that this is what CIE told him.  I am sure CIE would not mislead him.  But that is the Minister's answer and, in my opinion, it is a fantastic answer.</P>

      <P>The Minister suggested a possibility of the de-nationalisation of certain parts of the transport system.  It now looks as if we have gone full circle and are back to where we started.  In this particular section we seem to be reverting to the earlier position because we are now getting away from the arbitrator and going back to the courts.  That is a procedure I always welcome.  The standing arbitrator was appointed under the 1950 Act.  I do not know what retainer or fees he gets, but I do know that he would require some form of clerical assistance because there is quite an amount of work involved.  Every other arbitrator has assistance of some kind and that is very useful in dealing with correspondence, typing reports, making awards and so on.  The Minister understands the position as well as I do and I suggest difficulty has been <Col N="1772" /> created because of a lack of clerical assistance.  The Minister should inquire into that aspect.  It may only involve providing a shorthand typist to take dictation and do some typing, and that on maybe ten or 15 days in the year. I would urge upon the Minister that, if some assistance were provided, it might be possible to dispose of claims which are pending.</P>

Surely it would be more intelligent to clear up the cases rather than put people to the trouble and expense of starting afresh in the Circuit Court? Some of us know what is involved in such cases and this would impose a very serious burden on these people, some of whom are getting on in years. Provision is being made now for them to go to the Circuit Court because we failed to make proper provision for having their cases dealt with by the standing arbitrator.</P>

The Senator probably knows that the majority of people, that is, those entitled to redundancy payment as distinct from compensation for worsening of service, are receiving some redundancy pay.  It is only a question of whether they should receive more and therefore the number of real hardship cases is not, I am glad to say, very great.

There is no one in the Seanad who has had the training or technical knowledge in regard to how to use a locomotive. I go as far as I can to answer these questions.  It would be the same type of thing if we were, for example, discussing an ESB Bill and somebody were to ask me a highly complicated question about the improved generating economy of various types of generator, whether it would be more suitable to have a smaller generating station at Tarbert Island and a bigger one at Great Island.  If we should get into that kind of discussion, it would be quite unrealistic.</P>
      <P>I have given the facts about this Mallow line but Senators will realise that in a railway system, when diesel engines operate, their movements relate to the operation of other diesel engines and carriages and goods vehicles far beyond the limit of those operating on the line in question.  It would be quite impossible to read out long technical descriptions of how the traffic moves from Mallow to Waterford, to Tralee, Killarney and so on.  It would be immensely complicated. All I can say is that I have not found CIE to be grossly inaccurate in their statements.</P>

In other words, will a widow, who has been debarred by virtue of the fact that her husband failed to make the contributions and now cannot draw the pension, be able to get the back money as from the date of the death of her husband or will it take effect only from the time the Bill comes into force?</P>

Now it will be possible to assess that average over the whole period of the insured life of the husband.  It is quite likely, in the type of case to which Senator Malone refers, that the widow will qualify for a pension either at the maximum rate or, more likely, at a reduced rate but it will only be from the date this Bill comes into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider an arrangement whereby payment could be made by post instead of leaving hundreds of people queueing up in inclement weather? When the weather is very cold they have to wait their turn for payment in very uncomfortable conditions.  At the moment payment falls due on a certain date.  Of course, most people want to be paid as soon as possible.  The result is that in areas of large population hundreds of people have to queue for service, without shelter.  They have to remain out in the sun, wind and rain waiting their turn for payment.</P>
      <P>Something should be done regarding payment of those people.  They want to be paid at the earliest possible moment and very few would be prepared to wait for payment until later.  There are some people, of course, who, rather than join these long queues and suffer the weather, wait until a later date for payment.  I should like to know from the Minister whether it would be possible to have a different system whereby paying orders could be issued to those people in order to avoid this hardship which so many of them have to suffer at the moment, particularly in areas of large population and areas where there is a large number of recipients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, those people are, in fact, paid by payable orders.  They have in their possession <Col N="1777" /> an old age pension book which includes payable orders for some considerable time in advance.  The stipulation is that those orders may be cashed at any post office nominated by the pensioner.  It is essential that it be done that way because there has to be some check, even if only a theoretical one, on whether the pensioner is still alive and still entitled to draw the pension.  I do not think it would be feasible to allow those payable orders to be cashed any place at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the type of attitude that is always adopted where you want to avoid the creation of any kind of abuse.  Of course, there must be a check-up on people to see that they are alive but I do not think, in order to have a check-up of that kind, that it is necessary that a person should present himself every week or every month, whatever is the period, at a post office the assistant of which is not in the slightest bit interesed as to who is cashing a particular allowance. I think the point made by Senator Rooney is worth considering, that these payable orders should be cashable in the local grocery store, and if the Minister wants to make sure that the person is alive, that there is no fraud committed, then he can provide that once a year, or whatever the period is, even twice a year perhaps at a time when the weather is more agreeable, not in the winter months but on 1st May or 1st October, or some date like that, these people will have to cash their allowances at a post office.  I am quite sure that the number of people who would be parties to a fraud of this kind would be minimal and I do not see why the majority of the widows, who will be honest at any event, should have to undergo this regular routine of going to a post office to get what they are entitled to under the Acts relating to social welfare.  I think the Minister should consider some modification to relieve the hardships to which Senator Rooney has referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support that.  It is not only a question of hardship but there is a <Col N="1778" /> question of cost also.  I have a letter I received from a man who, at 69 years of age, is not qualified for the old age pension itself but who is on unemployment assistance at this stage. He has to travel a considerable distance and pay out, I think, 3/8 a week in bus fares in order to present himself at the unemployment exchange to verify he is in existence and also to verify in some way that he is unemployed. It is another example of the extent to which these checks impose an excessive burden.  I think the Minister should look at this and see how it can be eased.  It seems to me that this whole business of checking is overdone. There must be re-checks but, as Senator O'Quigley said, they could be carried out at less frequent intervals.  To expect a man to spend 3/8 a week to verify that he is unemployed and to require a pensioner to turn up at a post office which may be equally inconvenient seems an unreasonable and excessive requirement and one the rigours of which could be mitigated. The Minister ought to look at this.  He cannot do so now on this Bill naturally, but it is something which would be well worth his while, and he should come back with legislation, if necessary, or make the necessary orders, if that is all that is required, to improve the situation here now that this has been drawn to his attention, as I am sure it has been previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked into this before and I have failed to find any other satisfactory way of having the necessary checks carried out. I have no objection to having another look at it but, obviously, one cannot require the local grocer to do things we can get the local postmistress, or postmaster to do. I should point out that it is necessary on occasions for one reason or another to issue a stop order on these cheques. There may be for some reason or another changing circumstances by virtue of which the person becomes no longer entitled to a pension.  If these orders were freely exchangeable in any place rather than in one particular place there would be nobody to whom we would be able to send notice <Col N="1779" /> that further cheques were not to be cashed, on these occasions when that would arise.  It would be unlikely to arise in the case of contributory pensions but in the case of non-contributory pensions it might be, for instance, discovered that there had been fraudulent concealment of means and that a person was no longer entitled to the pension which he had been awarded and that person would, in fact, be in possession of a book of orders.  If these were freely exchangeable anywhere there would not be much the Department could do except write to the person concerned to send back the book.  If he did not do that the Department could be at some loss.  I have no objection to seeing if any easement can be made but I do not think there is a great hardship involved here.</P>
      <P>I think when Senator Rooney is talking about queues he is not thinking about queues of pensioners, he is thinking about people collecting their children's allowances.  Pensioners are not that numerous and the day on which pensions fall due is not the same day as people collect children's allowances. I think there are rarely queues for this purpose.  It is important that the pensioner, himself or herself or an agent, should call to the post office to cash the order.  It is a post office of their choice.  They can nominate whatever post office they like.  It is a bit of an imposition but not an excessive one in view of the necessity to keep a check.</P>

It is extraordinary the difficulties Departments see in things and how they magnify them and write long memoranda and treat them as major obstacles and at some stage or another they may be able to find a solution to the major obstacles they created themselves and then there is a sense of accomplishment and achievement.  In a case of this kind we ought to adopt the dictum adopted by Senator Flanagan this evening&mdash;try to suit the majority.  I believe <Col N="1780" /> 90 per cent of the people are honest all the time and I think ten per cent of the people are honest 90 per cent of the time.</P>

Therefore, I think, all this elaborate paraphernalia to catch the criminal that may arise, this would-be widow or pensioner who is lurking around only waiting to defraud the Department of Social Welfare, is quite unnecessary.  I believe we could have a much more flexible system.  The grocer who would be taking the pension from someone who would be already dead is not such a fool as that.  You have to realise there is a check on them.  The Minister said this would be a burden on the grocers.</P>

      <P>That may be so, but there are not that many fools in the community.  If the Minister feels that these allowances, pensions, and so on, can be cashed over a period when there is nobody actually entitled to them there is an easy remedy by using the same kind of legislation in relation to this as there is in relation to Bills of Exchange.  If somebody gets a cheque to which he is not entitled and it is a supposed fraudulent cheque, there is the simple remedy, under the Cheques Act and the Bills of Exchange Act, to come along to the unfortunate person and say: &ldquo;Look, you got money from the bank on the head of that cheque; that cheque is a fraud; now, pay me.&rdquo;  That is a simple way <Col N="1781" /> for the Department of Social Welfare to get back their money.  Presumably the butcher or trader who cashed the cheque to which somebody was not entitled knew the Department of Social Welfare can come along in the same way as a bank in relation to a fraudulent cheque and say: &ldquo;Look, pay me on the head of that which was a fraudulent cheque &rdquo; and that would be a suitable way to prevent fraud which, at the present time, may arise as far as the assistant in any post office may know.</P>

I have been informed&mdash;I have not checked this&mdash; that in other countries it is quite common practice for these things to be paid by post, by cheque; that only occasional checks on the continued existence of the people or as to their continued eligibility are carried out and that this operates very well, without fraud of any kind, and satisfactorily. I wonder if the Minister would look into this as regards the various types of social welfare and if he would be kind enough to let us know, in some form, what he finds in this regard. Perhaps a White Paper is asking too much but if he could communicate to those of us interested what the position is in other countries in this regard, it would be helpful because I think that by looking around to see what other people do, we could find solutions which work elsewhere.  We seem to work on the basis that we are the most dishonest people but systems which work elsewhere should work here and it is only a question of looking at the systems elsewhere to find something suitable to our requirements, which would mitigate the hardship this involves and which causes people to go considerable distances to collect these small sums.</P>

I have a case in mind where that happened.  A man was paid 5/- per week too much over a period of months and he was not by any means deliberately frauding the Department.  The pension, when the increase came, was given to him, even though he was not entitled to it at the time.  When the Department discovered their mistake, they immediately recalled the pension book.  This was a man of over 80 years of age living alone.  It is hard to understand how the people in the Department could be so callous as to just write down to the postmistress and say: &ldquo;Collect the book&rdquo;.  That man was to be deprived of his pension until such time as they had recouped the amount they had overpaid.  Would not it have been much more humane to have written to the man a polite letter explaining the position and saying that a small sum would be deducted in future to recoup their loss?  Even with the representations, five shillings per week was deducted until the sum would be recouped.</P>

      <P>I find myself in agreement with the Minister on this matter because I would not like to see the shopkeepers getting the privilege of changing pension orders.  The fact of the matter is that many sub-postmasters have shops and the Department is continually on the look out that the books are not kept as security against debts. If you allow every shopkeeper in the country to cash these pension orders, you will find people saying: &ldquo;I shall give you credit if you give me your <Col N="1783" /> book&rdquo;.  I should not like to see that occasion arising and I think we will have to bear with the Minister that there is too much danger and there have been abuses in this particular line where the sub-postmaster had a shop. Let nobody think that these abuses did not arise in such cases.  I actually have proof of it myself.  I have proof that children's allowance forms were kept in such places.  If we allow pensioners to change pension orders anywhere they like, you will find that every pension book in the country will be in the hands of the shopkeepers.  For that reason, I must bear with the Minister in this because it is quite natural that anybody who gives credit will try to get security against it.</P>
      <P>There was a statement by the Minister to the effect that a subpostmistress would be under an obligation to give information to the Minister regarding people dying and people drawing a pension who are not really entitled to the amount they were getting, on a non-contributory basis. It is the first time I have heard that and I am wondering whether that is the business of the social welfare officer and not the business of the sub-postmistress.</P>

      <P>Senator McAuliffe must know that most sub-postmasters have shops of one kind or another. I suppose when they cash their orders there in the post office, these recipients do their business in that shop.  The Minister quite rightly mentioned that the real picture is shown on the date of payment of children's allowances; that is the day on which there is a big invasion of the post offices.  That is the kind of problem I have asked the Minister to consider.  It is foolish for anybody&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What I want to mention is this&mdash;that, of course, the local shopkeeper or publican, or whoever it may be, knows he will be committing an offence if he accepts one of these vouchers knowing that the person is not entitled to the pension by reason of his previous demise, or otherwise. At the moment when those vouchers go into the bank and, through the bank, on to the Department of Social Welfare, it is the shopkeeper or publican who would be the first to answer for this voucher which had been found to be out of order.  It is a very good check.  The Minister knows very well that in the larger post offices hundreds of people go in there, draw their money and the shop assistants do not know the person personally who draws that money; it may be a brother or sister of the recipient, or it might even be a messenger for the recipient and the postmistresses apparently are not required to know the people to whom they are giving the money.  The voucher is stamped; it is franked by the official post office franking machine and the person signs for payment.  There is a solution there and the Minister ought to try it in order to come up to, if you like, modern business methods or a businesslike way of dealing with these issues. In commercial life you would not have the kind of problem you have here and here is a problem which I feel the Minister ought to be able to solve.</P>

    <P>I cannot see why Senators assume that the receipt of a cheque every week through the post would be any better than the receipt of a book of cheques which lasts for a year.  The cheques will still have to be cashed somewhere.  I doubt if that would be any better solution.  It would merely <Col N="1785" /> be a more costly method of doing this business, so far as I can see.</P>
    <P>There is no question of subpostmasters, or subpostmistresses, or clerks in post offices being under any obligation to report as to whether or not in their opinion a pensioner is entitled to a pension.  They have no standing whatever in a matter such as that.  As I say, I have no objection to looking at this again and seeing if a more suitable method can be arrived at.  I do not think this is a very onerous requirement and I think it is the minimum necessary to safeguard public funds in this regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that officials in my Department should keep in touch with Members of the Oireachtas, the officials in my Department have been in touch with a number of different members of the Oireachtas from both sides of the House, in the capacity of Minister for Social Welfare, and those Members of the Oireachtas are more in touch with other Members of the Oireachtas than any other Minister.</P>

The purpose of this section is to consolidate the existing powers enabling orders to be made in connection with reciprocal agreements on social security matters adapting and modifying the Acts involved, and to widen those powers to include schemes which are not at present covered, for example, the children's allowances schemes.  At present there is not power to make reciprocal agreements in connection with that.</P>

      <P>This is the kind of <Col N="1786" /> thing we were dealing with on other Bills.  This afternoon an order was laid in draft form before the House, and I am sure the Minister will be heartened to learn that it went through in double quick time.  It was a draft order which had to be approved by the House.  The Minister for Transport and Power can make an order in accordance with the draft which was approved.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that this is the kind of order which, if it is going to be made, should be subject to some kind of approval by the Oireachtas.  So far as I can see, it is not the type of order which comes within the scope of the 1952 Act, requiring regulations to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. It seems to be in a different category from the regulations which the Minister is entitled to make under the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  We must again demur at this procedure whereby orders of this kind can be made by the Minister without, apparently, as I see it, laying them before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister says this section will enable him to make orders adapting and modifying Acts of Parliament.  We must continue to register our protest at the fact that the Minister can, by order, amend legislation.</P>
      <P>I should also like to know if this order comes within the category of statutory instruments.  If one wants to look up reciprocal arrangements between this country and Britain, America or France, where does one look to find them?  On the Occupational Injuries Bill, the Minister referred to the ignorance of a member of the judiciary about a reciprocal agreement between this country and another country in relation to workmen's compensation.  I must frankly confess that it is extremely difficult to find these orders and instruments when one looks for them from time to time, and I should like to know from the Minister whether this is a statutory instrument, and whether it will be found amongst the statutory instruments. Will it be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Is it a statutory instrument which one would normally expect to find in a volume of statutory instruments?</P>

      <P>I want to make one short comment on this Bill and I think the Minister will agree with it.  If you read this Bill from start to finish, it means nothing to anyone.  You will have to get the 1952 Act, the 1963 Act and the 1964 Act, and so on, in order to make some fist of what is intended to be effected by this Bill. Social Welfare Acts which Members of the Oireachtas have to look up from time to time, purely in discharge of their duties as public representatives, should be drafted in such a way that if you look up a particular section, you will know what someone is entitled to.</P>
      <P>Section 11 of this Bill provides that the Second Schedule to the Act of 1952 is amended by the insertion of &ldquo; 2A &rdquo; after &ldquo; 2 &rdquo; in paragraph 1.  It provides for &lsquo;the substitution of &ldquo;7s 5d&rdquo; for &ldquo;7s 4d&rdquo; (inserted by the Act of 1965) and &ldquo;6s 4d&rdquo; for &ldquo;6s 3d&rdquo; (inserted by the Act of 1965) in paragraph 1(a)&rsquo; and so on.  You are really in a jungle, and this is legislation which affects the poorer sections of the community who, if they want to look up what they are entitled to, should be able to find out in one section in an Act of Parliament, what the latest position is.  The Minister should insist upon the parliamentary draftsman drafting a Bill which will be intelligible to members of the Oireachtas.  On this occasion I have great sympathy with the Minister.  This is a case of <i>parvum in multo.</i>  The Minister had little to give and thought it desirable to have all this rigmarole so that the littleness would be hidden in the multitude of amendments he is effecting in this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister should give us at some stage figures to show how much is actually being contributed by employers and how much by <Col N="1788" /> workers towards the payment of these increased benefits.  The amounts involved in social welfare cards have increased several times and have reached a record figure.  It is expected they will increase still further.  An employer with a large staff who has to deal with these cards knows what a big job it is.  His contribution is a very substantial one. Many employers pay the full amount of the stamps themselves.  Whether they do or not, they are involved in substantial contributions towards old age, widows' and other pensions.  The public should be told exactly how much the contribution is from employers and from workers towards the various social welfare schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opening statement, I referred to the fact that a Bill of this kind is necessarily confusing and I explained the object of it in the explanatory memorandum which was circulated and which I hoped would help to dispel the confusion.  I deprecate that it is necessary to put this legislation through in this way, as Senator O'Quigley does, but I cannot offer any solution to the problem.  Apart from issuing the explanatory memorandum, we also publish advertisements in the national and local newspapers explaining the increases in benefits and contributions that are being provided in this legislation.  We also issue a booklet explaining as briefly and clearly as possible what benefits are available and this is brought up to date when changes are made.  That has been done in every year of this Government's term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Senator Rooney's point about the contributions of employers and workers to the benefits provided in the social insurance scheme, I agree it might be no harm to refer to them, particularly since the position in this regard is so much different in this country from what it is in others.  I have taken the figures from a paper issued by the Economic Research Institute on Social Security in Ireland and Western Europe.  The figures are for contributions paid by employers and workers in terms of the percentage of the average worker's wage.  The contributions by workers for this country and a number of western <Col N="1789" /> European countries are as follows: Ireland, 2.3 per cent; Belgium, 9 per cent; France, 6.1 per cent; Germany, 12.5 per cent; Italy, 5.8 per cent; Netherlands, 11.1 per cent; United Kingdom, 5.3 per cent.  If we take the total contribution of both employer and worker in the form of a percentage of the average worker's wage, we find : Ireland, 4.6 per cent; Belgium, 18 per cent; France, 21.6 per cent; Germany, 25 per cent; Italy, 29.8 per cent; Netherlands, 17.6 per cent; United Kingdom, 9.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the position here is that we take less of the worker's wage in the form of contributions towards social insurance than any of these other countries, and this of course means that the State participation here is correspondingly greater.  In Table 10 of a paper <i>Cost of Social Security</i> 1958-1960, issued by the International Labour Office, we find the figures for State participation in social insurance and family allowance schemes according to source: Ireland, 73 per cent; Austria, 13.2 per cent; Belgium, 26.2 per cent; Denmark, 52.5 per cent; France, 6.6 per cent; Germany (Federal Republic), 16.5 per cent; Italy, 17.3 per cent; Norway, 15.2 per cent; United Kingdom, 27.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>When this Table is taken in conjunction with the figures showing the percentage of workers' wages which is taken in contributions, the position here is that there is a much greater contribution by the State towards social welfare generally and a much smaller percentage contribution by both workers and employers.  Obviously, in any effort to make further substantial improvements, consideration will have to be given as to whether it would be feasible for a country such as this to make worthwhile improvements in these schemes on the present basis of contributions by workers, employers and the State.</P>

Funds of suitors can means a variety of things and what I am concerned with is the amount of dormant money in relation to actions six or seven years old that are not current in the way administrative actions are which go on for long periods and can be current for ten, 20 or 30 years.  What is the total amount of really dormant funds as distinct from deposits by auctioneers, trade unions and such bodies?  Secondly, what effort is made by the court authorities to trace from year to year, in relation to moneys due to them, people who would be very happy and who are entitled to get those moneys if they knew they were there.

I am sure he appoints the person in consultation with the President of the High Court or the Chief Justice.  The Minister has control over and can give directions to, among other officers, the Accountant to the High Court.  I am thinking of funds lying in court which may be lodged there under the Trustee Act where a person is a minor.  Some notice may have been served upon the minor's guardian; the guardian may have died or the guardian may have been somebody who felt that business of this kind should not be disclosed to a young person, that the young person would get notions if he knew he had so much money coming to him on reaching 21.</P>
      <P>It is not too much to ask that the Accountant of the High Court and his staff, perhaps during the Long Vacation when they are not too occupied with other work, should go through their ledgers and notify the solicitors of persons who are entitled to these funds that they are there.  Once in five years &mdash;I think it should be more often but even once in five years&mdash;a letter should issue to the solicitors on record and, if possible, at the same time, to the parties who would appear to be entitled to the moneys telling them they are there and that they should in due course make a claim for them.

      <P>By the unparliamentary means of interjection when Senator O'Quigley was speaking, I tried to point out that the State has nothing to do with this.  These funds are administered by the courts, and in a very formal and detailed fashion.  I have to prepare the case for the Chief Justice, and the Chief Justice has to make a detailed investigation into the reasons for my request before he consents to these funds being dealt with in such a manner.  Claims against the <Col N="1792" /> funds are the subject of rules of the Superior Courts and are matters for the rules-making committee of these courts.  These committees are very jealously guarded by both sides of the legal profession and by the Judiciary, and I found, in relation to other aspects in regard to which I made enquiries, that any intrusion by the Executive into its rules-making committees or the rules they make is jealously guarded against.  As I say, this is not a matter for the State at all but for the courts.  These are funds in the custody of the courts which are only released to the State on the agreement of the Chief Justice, when he is satisfied that the purpose is legitimate and that the funds can stand the withdrawal.</P>

      <P>One would imagine from what the Minister has just said that he had no shadow of responsibility in respect of this matter.  If the Minister for Justice were convinced, as I think he ought to be, of what I suggest ought to be done, then it is within his power to initiate the appropriate legislation to deal with a matter of this kind.  It is a matter of justice to citizens of this country who are entitled to funds lodged in court that they should be told those funds are there. This business of a notice appearing in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> cuts no ice.  The Minister talks of the Rule-Making Committees of the Superior Courts as if he had nothing to do with these.  I would advise the Minister to look at the rules made by the Circuit Court and the Supreme Court and he will see at the end of the document: &ldquo; I agree with the making of this rule.  Signed:&rdquo; So-and-So.  &ldquo;Aire Dli agus Cirt.&rdquo;  The Minister has to concur in the making of these rules that relate, among other things, to funds in court, and there is no point in saying he has no responsibility. I have always thought it was most unjust that people who are entitled to funds know nothing about and will know nothing about them because the funds were lodged perhaps under a will before they were born. The Minister spoke as someone who regarded himself as <i>profanis</i> when it came to rules-making committees making rules and who respected <Col N="1793" /> meticulously the authority of rules-making committees, but I cannot believe the Minister does not take an active part in rule making and that, indeed, the Minister does not exercise considerable influence over rule making and use, I might say, a delaying veto or what amounts to a delaying veto on some rules which we should like to see issuing from the Department one of these days.</P>

      <P>On the Second Stage, we were discussing the cost of the building of the Abbey Theatre and the fact that the cost turned out to be a good deal more than had been anticipated.  We were relying on the statement made by the Minister in this respect which, I think, on reflection, he may agree was a little incomplete. As a result of what he had to say about the increasing cost, the account he gave of it, the limited information he gave, I was prompted to say that it seemed there was a lack of planning in the arrangements made, in that the cost of the building turned out <Col N="1794" /> to be two-and-a-half times what was originally estimated.</P>
      <P>It has come to my attention that that comment of mine could be read as a reflection on the architect.  Indeed, I think a subsequent comment of Senator Rooney's might also be read in that way.  I should like to say that that was not my intention.  I did not know who was responsible for the changes to which the Minister rather briefly referred.  At the time I spoke, I was unaware of who was responsible, but certainly I had no intention of attacking the architect in this matter because from such knowledge as I have of these matters, it is right to say that it is not usually the architect's fault when plans are changed.  Because what I said was taken, or could be taken, as such a reflection, I should like to make it clear that it was not my intention.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he would clarify the position a little as his statement was, I am quite sure not intentionally, rather misleading. The Minister said that the estimated cost of rebuilding was put at £235,000. I rather assumed that that estimate was, in fact, a professional estimate.  I think I am right in saying that it was not and that it was an estimate not made by the professional people concerned but, perhaps, an estimate given to the Minister in some Government Department or privately by the Abbey Theatre.  The Minister's statement goes on to say that the successful tender was for £310,000 for the Abbey and the shell of the Peacock Theatre, with an additional £34,000 for fees; that the cost of the work is now put at £555,200, to which must be added £95,000 for the Peacock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference between the £344,000, including the Peacock Theatre, which was the successful tender, and the £555,200 was really the item that struck me as being a very large gap and the Minister seemed to attempt an explanation of that further on when he said that the increases in the cost were due to the increase in the cost of wages and materials, the effects of the building strike of 1964, changes in plans involving the installation of <Col N="1795" /> additional stage equipment, and a long list of additional items.</P>
    <P>My understanding of what happened&mdash;if I am wrong, no doubt the Minister will put me right&mdash;was that the original estimate of £235,000 plus £20,000 for fees, was not a professional estimate, that the tender was one of a number of tenders for different work to be done; that the other tenders were not accepted, for example, the completion of the Peacock, and a number of items of equipment, and the project went ahead on that basis and subsequently the decision was taken to go ahead with the things omitted.  A change in plan subsequent to the tender being accepted was not the problem.  The difficulty was that the original proposed building was not accepted and put to tender in the way in which the plans were drawn up but part of the plan was omitted to bring down the cost and subsequently brought in again so that the appearance of a very sharp increase in cost because somebody had forgotten to put in lifts is completely misleading.  The various items which added to the cost because they were additional were ones originally contemplated but excluded at the time in order to bring down the price to an unrealistic level, for a building which would not have included anything more than the shell of the Peacock and would not have included lifts which had to be put in subsequently.</P>
    <P>When I talked of planning, it was that kind of thing I was contemplating. I did not realise that the situation was quite as it appears now to be and that, in fact, there had been this exclusion of items which were tendered at the beginning and then there was a change of mind again subsequently.  I want to put that on the record.  If I have it incorrectly, the Minister will put me right.  If I have it correctly, it is not a question of things omitted and not thought of but things that were excluded in an attempt at some kind of economy which could not succeed as the things were required and put in afterwards, which is really bad planning, if I may say so.  I do not think the Minister is responsible.  He is only here <Col N="1796" /> to provide the cash but, in any event, there was bad planning but certainly not on the part of the professional advisers to the project and in fairness that should be said, as the Minister's statement certainly did not make that clear and could be taken as misleading and did, in fact, mislead some people in some respects and the remarks I passed on it could be misread to involve a reflection on the professional people concerned.  That was certainly not my intention, although I was not clear where the responsibility did lie for the various changes that took place.</P>

      <P>On the Second Stage, the Minister very kindly said that he would give us further information on the implications of this grant and I think the House to a fair extent agreed that it was our duty to see that these funds would be properly administered and that our fine new theatre would be properly run.  The questions I directed to the Minister were, first of all, about the conditions of tenure of the present managing director, whether there was a retiring age, what his remuneration was, and was there any promise of retirement on his part.  Then there was a second question about the present organisation of the Abbey Theatre, or in its full title, the National Theatre Society Ltd.  I submitted that the present organisation is very cumbersome and hardly workable in many ways.  The Minister, I think, agreed that he would give us more information on that.  I am not too clear about it.</P>
      <P>The third question was about the resignation of the artistic adviser and whether there were any possibilities emerging along those lines.</P>
      <P>Another question&mdash;and it is perhaps the principal one which should concern us tonight&mdash;was, how are the finances of the Abbey Theatre regulated and managed at present?  We are giving the equivalent of £¾ million capital sum, taking into account the previous grant, and it is extremely important that we should know exactly how this will be administered.</P>
      <P>So, I personally would be very grateful to the Minister if he could enlighten us further on these questions.</P>

      <P>When I read the Minister's statement on Second Reading, I was shocked at the discrepancies that appeared in the original figures and the figures presented to us in the House last week, and I feel that I was misled to a certain extent by the extraordinary differences there were and, of course, I was very critical of them.  In what I said I did not intend any reflection on the professional advisers.  My remarks were directed mainly at the fact that so many adjustments and changes compared with the original plans were made, which resulted in the altered figures, apart from the building strike which, of course, caused considerable expense.</P>
      <P>I just wanted to make this statement in case what I might have said would be regarded as a criticism of the professional people concerned in this project. What I had to say related to the extraordinary difference in the figures. It seems now, at this stage, that the figures presented to us originally and mentioned to us in passing by the Minister were only a rough estimate.  It was not an estimate made out on a specified concrete plan&mdash;if I may use that expression.  It was not a firm estimate.  It was an imaginary, rough estimate and it was from that imaginary rough estimate that the case has been built up for the purpose of putting forward these comparisons and these figures which help to make the case now for securing this money which is necessary, of course, to meet the total cost of this new project.</P>
      <P>This project has been welcomed by all people associated with culture and drama in this country.  It will give greater opportunities to the very many talented persons we have who will be enabled now to display their talents with the more modern facilities and a very fine building of the type that we know has been brought to completion in Dublin city, to be run in the name of the Abbey Theatre.</P>

      <P>First of all, on Senator FitzGerald's point, I thought I explained the position fully on the Second Stage concerning the increase in costs.  The main item in the increase in costs concerns the Peacock Theatre which, apart from the shell of the building, was not envisaged originally. What happened, in effect, was that the first plan was discarded and a new plan was decided upon providing for much more up-to-date equipment, ventilation, light control and consequential structural changes to give the theatre, from the interior point of view, the most up-to-date equipment available. If the House so desires it, I can go through the various constituents of the increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that most of these things were incorporated in the original plan and that, in fact, in a number of cases, they were put to tender and tenders were received. The tenders were then not accepted and only the tender for £310,000 was accepted and subsequently they were brought in again.  I quite concede that they were brought in again but not as if somebody had an afterthought to improve the theatre.  Essential elements were excluded so as not to accept the original tender, with a view to saving money.  If I am correct in that, it should be brought out.  It should not be suggested that the position was otherwise. They were excluded only for reasons of false economy and only temporarily, until the tender was got through.</P>

      <P>The new conception arose of doing the whole job as one job.  The advice of the architects, in effect, was that if you left over the Peacock until subsequently, then you would incur additional expense, and why not have the whole job done as one?  It was then agreed to go for the increased allocation from the funds of suitors.  At first, we were concerned to do a limited job on the funds available. Then, on the architects' advice on the Peacock Theatre, it was decided that it would be better to have the job done in conjunction with the main project.</P>

      <P>The Senator raised a number of matters on the Second Stage.  He asked about the control of the finances of the theatre.  The Abbey Theatre is controlled and managed by The National Theatre Society Limited, which is a limited liability company registered under the Companies Acts. The object of the company, as expressed in the Memorandum of Association, is &ldquo;to establish and create a Theatre for the purpose of acting and producing plays in Irish or English, written by Irish authors or on Irish subjects and such dramatic works of foreign authors as would tend to educate and interest the Irish public in the higher aspects of dramatic Art ...&rdquo; and to do all things necessary towards that end.  The company is a non-profit making one.  All the property and income of the company may be applied to its objects and no portion of the property, income or profits may be transferred in any way to the members of the company. Article 11 of the Articles of Association of the Company provides that the management of the business and <Col N="1800" /> control of the Company shall be vested in the directors.  The number of Ordinary Directors may not exceed three without the consent of the Minister for Finance who may also appoint two Directors.  The Articles of Association also provide for the annual audit of the accounts of the Company in accordance with the Companies Acts.</P>
      <P>Senator Stanford also inquired about the terms and conditions of appointment of the General Manager of the Theatre.  Under Article 12 the Directors may appoint a member of the Company as General Manager of the business of the Company and may delegate to him or her such of their powers, not being powers to borrow money or issue shares, as they may deem expedient.  The Directors may remove and discharge any such Manager and appoint another in his or her place.  There is no stipulation as to a retirement age.  That means that the Manager or Managing Director, the chief executive of the Company, acts at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.  They may fire or hire as they see fit.  There is nothing else embodied in his or her terms of appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is aware that certain changes were made in the Company last year.  As the work of the Abbey Theatre was about to enter on a new phase and in view of the substantially increased public investment in the Theatre, it was arranged that there should be two Government-appointed Directors instead of one.  The issue of company shares, which would continue to have no financial value, was extended to a group of 25 persons of standing who were interested in the theatre and in the cultural life in this city, to people of standing in theatre. I mentioned some of their names on the Second Stage last week&mdash;Micheal MacLiammóir, Ria Mooney, Sheelagh Richards.  They include the Chief Justice.  The purpose of these changes was that, while the Company would remain essentially independent, there would be a somewhat closer liaison with the Government and also, through the new group of shareholders, there would be permanent formal contact <Col N="1801" /> between the directors and a representative circle of supporters of the Theatre whose advice and criticism would help the company to carry on its affairs more successfully.  The Minister for Finance had also allotted to him a block of shares to enable him by proxy to speak and vote at the annual general meetings of the company.</P>
    <P>The general result of these new arrangements is that the directors will act as trustees of a national institution; they will have as shareholders a body of well-informed friends of the theatre and of Irish cultural life generally whose counsel and criticism will be backed by a collective voting power equal to three-quarters of the membership of the board of directors.  The Government will have two directors on the board and the Minister for Finance, can, through his own shareholding, play a balancing role in the case of acute disagreement between the members of the company, should that arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, through his own shareholding and through the two members of the board nominated by him, can, in effect, exercise a measure of control over the board in the event of their not carrying on a policy consistent with the objects set out in the Memorandum of Association.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the present Abbey management.  I understand that very active thought has been given in recent months to where the Abbey is going in the future.  With that objective in mind, an artistic director was appointed.  There was nothing whatever of a sinister nature in the retirement of the artistic director who was appointed.  My information is&mdash;I know this personally as well as officially&mdash; that his resignation was due entirely to domestic reasons.  The Abbey Theatre&mdash;and the shareholders, I understand, are at present in agreement with this&mdash;are actively seeking an artistic director of the same outstanding calibre as the man who has retired&mdash;a director who will be able to achieve a high level of cultural activity and dramatic art production.  Certainly, I have every confidence that the <Col N="1802" /> new board are getting down to the job in hand.  They have given evidence of their faith in this direction by appointing an artistic director, who had to retire for domestic reasons, and they are actively pursuing the appointment of a new artistic director.  It is hoped that all these efforts will result in the attainment of standards worthy of the traditions of the Abbey and, at the same time, produce theatre appropriate to the present and future ages.  I have every confidence in the capacity and ability of the board to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking myself and the Minister, have we power to make changes.  The Minister says that the Minister for Finance can ultimately control policy, and the implication of the Minister's remarks is that the Government do not like to interfere at present, that the Government are satisfied with the new organisation, that the 25 shareholders and two Government directors are adequate to cope with the present situation.  If I shared the Minister's confidence, I should say no more.  But I have been most earnestly assured that that, in fact, is not so.  Ancient authorities referred to the famous Socrates as having the effect of a curious kind of fish which, if you touched it, paralysed you.  It seems to me that there is an analogy to this paralysing effect in a very eminent citizen of Dublin at the moment.  Even in this House a kind of paralysis has <Col N="1803" /> crept over the House.  As far as I can see, there is no one else who is prepared to say that, in the interests of this country, our 77 year old managing director should honourably retire.</P>
      <P>May I amplify that?  It is very greatly to the credit of the present managing director that he has collected this money and that he has had a magnificent new building built.  The reason is that he has had very great experience in managing finance and in extorting money one way or another. But surely this is the great moment in his life.  Surely he should now say: &ldquo;I have given you a fine new theatre, largely through my efforts; now go ahead and run it&rdquo;?  But, if he stays on even for a year, this paralysis, like the dry rot that gets into the very walls of buildings, will get into the Abbey Theatre, and it will take many decades to get it out again.  I am quite certain of this.  I have no personal interest in this.  I admire Dr. Ernest Blythe; he could be an honorary graduate of TCD.  But I feel much more strongly about, and admire much more deeply, the dramatic traditions of this country.  I urge on the Minister that this is a very critical moment.  Unless he takes steps now to put this right, his building will be frustrated for many years.  He has told us that the present system can deal with this by itself.  It cannot.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Technically, it has a power, I agree, but morally and psychologically, it cannot and will not deal with the situation.  The present managing director, if he wants to, will go on for a year, three years or ten years&mdash;Dr. Adenaeur kept going for even longer&mdash;and then what will happen to our three-quarters of a million capital grant?  It will be wasted as far as the higher ideals of drama are concerned. The theatre will keep ticking over.  It will appoint another artistic adviser, if they can get one to work in the present set-up.  May I say there are several very eminent people who will not go into the theatre under the present managing director for the reasons I have given?  There will be stalemate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1804" /> I think part of the reason for this paralysis is that we have very good reasons for accepting that Dr. Ernest Blythe, both in relation to the Irish language and other things, has done excellent work.  But he ceased long ago to do a good task in the Abbey Theatre and he should recognise that now.  If he does not recognise it, he should be told it.  In an interview in the <i>Irish Press</i> last Saturday, he said he did not listen to criticism.  What sort of head of a dynamic new theatre does not listen to criticism?  I appeal to the Minister and, if he does not take the necessary steps now, I will blame him personally in three or five years time.  Is he personally satisfied that the direction of the Abbey Theatre in the past ten years was all that it should have been?  Does he really think there is any chance of a new departure in that magnificent building?  I warn him that, if he does not make this change, he is wasting three-quarters of a million of public funds.</P>

      <P>We have a change of position now.  The position is different from what it was last year. There is a board of directors who will appoint their managing director.  I did not know to whom the Senator was referring on the last occasion.  The fact is we have done, I think, a satisfactory job in producing an Abbey Theatre and we have established the machinery for the provision of a suitable board of directors who will appoint the officials under them.  We have, I think, done a good day's work.  The Minister <Col N="1805" /> said that the Abbey was to produce plays in Irish or English, not in Greek.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">

      <P>Translations, but the Minister says the Abbey is to produce plays in Irish and English.  It is not empowered to produce anything in Greek.  I am quite satisfied with that policy.  The Christmas pantomime, which is produced in Irish, is outstanding. It is appreciated by everybody, even by those who do not understand it completely.  Plays produced in Irish are appreciated.  I am glad this reputation will be maintained.  The location and lay-out of the Queen's Theatre was unsatisfactory and, no matter what play was produced, satisfaction could not be guaranteed.  We should be satisfied with what the Minister has suggested and we should not be criticising a public appointment which is not directly under our control.</P>

      <P>They do not agree with each other on this matter and it is not often that you see this disagreement. It is not the fashion in this country for people to retire at the age of 77.  It is quite a young age by modern standards, and if Dr. Blythe is to take notice of what goes on and follow the precedent established for him by people in very high offices.  I do not think he should be blamed for following the precedent.</P>
      <P>To turn now to a different matter, I must confess that for many years I have not had the time to go to the Abbey Theatre because of pressing engagements, domestic, political and otherwise, and therefore I am not in a position to make any comment on their productions.  I do say, however, that I would have thought that Senator Stanford's attack would have been much more proper and much more in accordance with the practice and procedure of this House if it had been directed not at a particular individual but at the people who have the control and authority over him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister read out this evening that the control and management of the Company is vested in the directors. I do not know who the directors are but the directors are responsible for keeping in office the managing director. If the responsibility is anybody's, it is that of the board of directors of the Abbey Theatre.  If there is any fault to be found with the way the Abbey Theatre is being run, or may be run in future, then the proper authority at which to direct the fire is the board of directors.  The Minister for Finance is responsible for the appointment of two of the directors.  The board of directors have the final say and if they have <Col N="1807" /> delegated, as they are entitled to do, an undue discretion to the manager, then they are at fault in doing that.</P>
    <P>Somebody may say: &ldquo;You cannot run a theatre without delegating a great deal of authority&rdquo;.  If that be so, and if the present general manager is not up to standard, it is hardly for him to get on with the kind of confession or self-condemnation that people indulge in the Supreme Soviet Praesidium where they say that they have erred, that they have done this wrong and that they have done that wrong, and then retire.  As the people charged with responsibility for running the Abbey Theatre, the board of directors are in a much better position to assess the competence or incompetence of those to whom they have delegated responsibility and who may be doing their best.  I do not quite understand why Senator Stanford has directed his fire against the managing director.  I must say I was somewhat surprised that he did so.  Dr. Blythe in his time has given great service to this country.  He has made his mistakes, his political mistakes, for which we still suffer to this day, although, mark you, I always say that if Fianna Fáil had been in Parliament, it might not have happened, so they can share part of the blame, too.  Dr. Blythe has perhaps an undue leaning towards Irish.  I do not know whether that is a cause of complaint with Senator Stanford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that I do not know whether it is a cause of complaint or not.  Dr. Blythe has a very headstrong attitude towards a variety of things.  Indeed, the criticism or appraisal of his merits or demerits will never come to his notice because he is the <i>robur et aes triplex</i>, it will never penetrate him.  Be that as it may, it is a mistake as we had here last week with the Minister for Health, Deputy Flanagan, to bring into the House the faults or failings of individuals who are not in public authority and not directly amenable to the House.  We <Col N="1808" /> ought not get away from the value of the advice that the Minister must take responsibility for his officials.  It is a very bad thing for us in this House to embark on the criticism of people who are, in any event, going to ignore our criticism.  It is a bad principle, and I hope that having said all we have to say about this gentleman, who I suppose in his time criticised other people in this Chamber and in the other Chamber, we will not commit ourselves to the criticism of an individual in this House again.  It is a very bad principle.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Quigley has asked a direct question: why have I directed this attack?  The answer is what I said on the Second Stage and what I said again now.  We are about to give approximately £750,000 to this institution and there is grave public dissatisfaction with the man who is in control and who will control the building which is being built from these funds.  It is widespread, and I am quite sure if the Minister would consult any eminent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have consulted a great many people and I have received quite a few letters and there is complete unanimity that this three-quarters of a million pounds may be wasted.  Senator O'Quigley very rightly asks why do we not leave it to the directors.  The answer is, if we leave it to the directors nothing will be done because there are three directors, headed by Dr. Ernest Blythe, who are unanimous about keeping Dr. Blythe there as long as he wants to stay.  The other two cannot outvote them.  The shareholders, if they were united and worked together in a body, might do something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

So, the situation is simply this in practical <Col N="1809" /> politics, that unless the Minister for Justice, or the Minister for Finance, takes steps to alter the present situation, it will go on.  As I see it, and as a great many people in this country see it, this is virtually a misappropriation of public funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator made an attack on the present managing director of the Abbey Theatre who, despite some failings&mdash;and we all have our failings&mdash;has brought the Abbey Theatre to its present state where we now have, together with the help of a present incumbent of the Seanad, Dr. Ryan, a theatre which can rank as one of the greatest in the world.  In case Senator Stanford thinks that it is only he who knows what should be done as regards the artistic future of the Abbey I will refer to what I said already.  Last year, at the instigation of the then Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, it was decided to have 25 shareholders with 30 shares each, that is, 750 shares and that those people would be selected from the best, by way of cultural and artistic talents, in the country.  Those <Col N="1810" /> people have been appointed.  The Minister for Finance then appointed two directors.</P>
      <P>This leads me to the question asked by Senator Stanford and Senator O'Quigley: what is the present board and what are the shareholders doing in a practical way as regards an artistic director?  One of the first things those directors sought to do was to find a man suitable as an artistic director in the new Abbey.  Such a person would select plays and artists.  He would put on plays not only by Irish and English authors but authors from other countries.  A very excellent choice was made in the selection of Mr. Walter Macken, an outstanding man in the sphere of Irish letters, who resigned for what he said were domestic reasons.  I want to reiterate that here.  This man retired from his post a month ago, although he was being given a completely free hand.  I personally understand, apart from anything I may say as Minister for Justice, that he was very happy in his work.  He was doing a very excellent job and was on very good terms with the managing director.</P>
      <P>I understand that at the present point of time, the board and shareholders are actively concerning themselves with re-organisation of the management and the artistic direction of the Abbey. They are actively engaged in selecting a new artistic director.  I believe that they can succeed in having the Abbey rank as one of the greatest theatres in the world so that it can recapture the position it had before.  The directors are working on the filling of the post of artistic director at the present time.  I know they are seeking a person with the cultural and artistic calibre suitable to fill this post.  When they find such a man, and go through whatever re-organisation is necessary, I am certain we will be proud of the Abbey Theatre in the 1960s and 1970s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that I deplore what has been said about the man who, down through the years, has done so much for the Abbey and who with the aid of the State and, as I said, Senator Dr. Ryan, has brought it to the situation where we have the present board and shareholders.  The present managing director is not there forever. <Col N="1811" /> The board and shareholders are now thinking about the future.  They are much more concerned with the future than has been suggested by Senator Stanford.  It is quite apparent, from the point of view of the artistic direction of the theatre, that quite a lot of thought has already been given to what direction it is to go in the future.  A new artistic director will be appointed as soon as they have made their choice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>The present situation is that we are back where we were a year ago.  We have no artistic director.  The excellent choice which was made, for one reason or another, failed.  My information is that as long as we have the present managing director, several people eminently suitable for this position would not take it.  I can understand their motive. I feel no reassurance whatever when the Minister says that Dr. Blythe will not go on forever.  I drew that inference already from certain <i>a priori</i> principles.  It will not do that he will go some time.  We want some assurance that he will go this year.  May I say that it would be a magnificent thing if he said now: &ldquo;You have a fine theatre.  I did my share for it.  I am now handing it over to you younger men with more progressive ideas.&rdquo;  If he did that, he would become a national saint in the theatre.  If he stays on, he is going to waste money and detract from our reputation.</P>

      <P>May I seek some clarification from the Minister? He seemed to say that the artistic director would have control over the selection and production of plays.  Is this in fact the case?  Did Mr. Walter Macken, as artistic director, have this control?  Is this something which the Board have delegated to him and would they not concern themselves with the production of plays?  This is very important.  If this in fact is the case, then it would get over some of the difficulties which Senator Stanford sees as regards certain people applying for the post and some of the difficulties he sees as regards the present incumbent of the post of managing director, <Col N="1812" /> a matter on which I am not competent to speak.  It is important that the Minister should make it clear that what he seemed to say is what I have said now.</P>

      <P>This is really a matter for the Abbey board.  I am sure the board will have the last say as regard the particular plays selected for production.  This is a matter for working out between the artistic director and the board.  As I understand it, Mr. Walter Macken had such freedom in regard to this matter.  He was certainly quite happy with the arrangements made and relations were excellent between himself and the board.  He was on the board himself as artistic director and the matters were going very well.  He retired, as he said himself, for purely personal reasons.  I know from recent experience that people are always looking for reasons behind the reason given by a person who retires from such a post.  I am certain whoever is selected as artistic director in the future will also work well with the board.</P>

      <P>I am really concerned with what the Minister said earlier that the artistic director would have control over the plays produced. When I pressed the Minister with regard to this, he seemed to hedge behind a smokescreen if I may use the metaphor.  It is important that we should be clear on this.  Either it is or it is not the case.  If it is, some of the points Senator Stanford made are valid and can be partly met.</P>

I have friends in the theatre and I am personally involved to a greater degree than some Senators in this matter.  I am aware of the views that have been expressed.  Apart from that, I am aware that the outgoing artistic director had, and I am sure the future artistic director will have, fairly full control over production, over what is produced and what plays are selected. But, the ultimate control in regard to what play is put on, or is not put on, must, of course, rest with the board <Col N="1813" /> of directors.  The board is there to carry out a policy in accordance with the terms of the Memorandum of Association.  The ultimate vetting of every play put on now is, and certainly will be in the future, if there is a board at all, a matter for the board of directors.</P>

      <P>The Minister may be aware that on the Second Reading I simply asked a question.  He has satisfied me that the answer given me is a true and correct one.  I accept that but I do not accept that it is a sign of wise direction and wise policy that the man chosen is a man who will resign within two or three months. There is a lack of judgment there and it is part of the whole shaky edifice into which we are putting this large sum of money.  I presume the ultimate judgment about Mr. Macken was made by Dr. Blythe and now after all this parturition of the mountain, not even a mouse arrives.  There is nobody to act as artistic director of the Abbey at the moment.  That is part of the general malaise I am complaining about and I say the only cure is what I suggest.</P>

      <P>We have been mentioning a lot of names during the course of this debate and Senator Dr. Ryan's name has been very properly mentioned for his encouragement and support of the Abbey when he was Minister for Finance.  I think when we are mentioning names, we might also couple with Senator Dr. Ryan the name of Deputy Sweetman who as Minister for Finance at the relevant time and a director of the Abbey controlled all the Government's and the State's commitments to provide in due time the necessary funds, or find the necessary funds, for the completion of the new Abbey Theatre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, it seems to me that I should now conclude from what Senator Stanford has been saying that we have got from him very good <Col N="1814" /> reason why he wishes to see this particular change come about, that there are certain people who would apply for the position of artistic director but who will not do so.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should clarify what I said.  I am concerned with the removal of the managing director because I feel his direction is inadequate for this new theatre.  That is the criticism.  On the specific point, the Minister suggested that we will get a good artistic director and therefore the Abbey will be all right.  I say that we will be unlikely to do that under the present management.  What Senator O'Quigley has deduced from my remarks is not true and I want to make it clear that I have no particular choice in mind for this post.  Certain people have written to me.</P>

      <P>I want to clarify the relationship between the Minister for Finance and the new board.  I understood the Minister to say that the Minister for Finance through nominating two directors on to the board will thereby exercise a measure of control over the board.  Now, I understand that the director nominated by the Government would not be reporting back to the Minister for Finance on this or any other company, that he would function there as an independent member of that board and that the only means the Government would have to express dissatisfaction with his work would be when his terms of renewal came up and the Government <Col N="1815" /> might not re-appoint him if they were not satisfied that he did the job properly. But it is fundamental in the whole concept of Government-nominated boards that the directors nominated by the Government should exercise as much independence as possible and there should be no suggestion of their being there as mouthpieces for the Minister and the Government.</P>

      <P>The question has arisen as to whether Dr. Blythe will remain there forever or not.  I think Senator Stanford gave the impression that he is very anxious to remain and that the board are not likely to get rid of him. When I was negotiating with the Abbey Theatre and when we fixed up the giving to them of this money, they suggested that the Minister for Finance should have two nominees on the board instead of one.  It was a board of four at that time and the Minister for Finance nominated one. It was agreed that the Minister for Finance should nominate two and they then said to me that they would like me to keep in mind that they wanted a director who would succeed Dr. Blythe.  At that stage I asked whether they had anybody in mind but they said they had not but that they might be able to suggest somebody to me. After that a general election took place and I was removed instead of Dr. Blythe.</P>

He has control over them as the Minister responsible holding a certain amount of shares.  The shares are roughly in three parts.  The directors hold one block of shares; the shareholders another block between them; and the Minister bolds a block.  The Minister has this control, that if ever there is a contest between the shareholders and the board, he can decide. But, otherwise, he cannot.  If the shareholders agree with the board, then the Minister is powerless, which I think is a fair arrangement.</P>
      <P>My principal object, however, in rising is to say that the board themselves are very anxious to get a good artistic director to succeed Dr. Blythe, and I must say I have no knowledge of anybody refusing the position.</P>

      <P>As explained in the memorandum, the Bill has two objects: first, to increase from £2,000 to £5,000 the deposit which an auctioneer is required to keep in the High Court, and, secondly, to require auctioneers to keep clients' moneys in a special bank account and to keep records of such moneys and of their dealings in them.</P>

    <P>These two proposals are, of course, complementary: both are designed to give greater protection to the client. Both are necessary because neither, by itself, is a sufficient safeguard.  May I say at this point that the Irish Auctioneers and Estate Agents Association not only agree with but have taken the initiative in advocating measures such as these.  I do not mean to imply that the Association necessarily agree with every detail in the Bill&mdash;my discussions with them took place before the text was drafted and it may be that they will have some views to express on this or that provision&mdash;<Col N="1818" /> but the Association certainly support and, in fact, have asked for the proposed increase in the deposit.  They agree also with the principle of separate accounts, which is only to be expected because, of course, the keeping of separate accounts ought to be an elementary precaution for anybody dealing with other people's money and any auctioneer who is not keeping such accounts already is in urgent need of being saved from his own carelessness.</P>
    <P>The present deposit is £2,000.  It has remained at that figure since 1947.  I may say, however, that I am not proposing this increase just on the basis of changes of money values or the increase in property values since 1947. That would, I think, be an inadequate basis because the figure £2,000 in 1947 was necessarily experimental.  I have, therefore, taken into account the available information about defaults of auctioneers in the meantime and also the level of premium which an auctioneer is likely to have to pay to get a guarantee bond which he can lodge as a deposit.</P>
    <P>An immediate difficulty is the lack of complete information.  The criminal records cannot provide adequate information because the great majority of defalcations do not amount to fraud &mdash;or, at all events, do not provide evidence sufficient to justify a prosecution. In fact, only a negligible proportion of cases in which there have been defaults ends in the criminal courts. I think it may safely be assumed too that this is, for the most part, not just a question of lack of evidence&mdash;carelessness and negligence rather than criminal intent can be the cause of the default.</P>
    <P>Again, although we know the number of defaults as reflected in the number of cases in which the deposit is called on to meet unpaid liabilities, there is no way of finding out the extent to which the liabilities exceed the amount of the deposit in those cases where that occurs.  However, it is, of course, common knowledge that there have been some defalcations on a very big scale&mdash;and this immediately brings us to the heart of the problem, which <Col N="1819" /> is that any system of deposit, whether by way of guarantee bond or otherwise, must be a compromise because if it were to be foolproof it would have to consist of an insurance bond without any limit of liability, which of course could not be obtained, or, at the very least, the deposit would have to be fixed at so high a level as to cover even a remote contingency, which would involve payment of a premium so heavy that it would be a serious and possibly insupportable burden on many auctioneers.  So we must look for a compromise and the question is: what is it to be?</P>
    <P>The records show that, on the average, five auctioneers default each year &mdash;that is to say in five cases each year, on average, the deposit is called on to meet liabilities.  However, of these five cases, four are fully covered by the present deposit of £2,000, so that the number of cases in which there is a default in excess of the present limit of £2,000 is one a year, on the average. As I said earlier, we do not know how much the excess is in these cases but, if we bear in mind the pattern of defaults&mdash;that four out of every five come to less than £2,000&mdash;we can be reasonably certain that only very few indeed would exceed £5,000, which is the figure proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In proposing this figure, I naturally had to take account of what it would be likely to involve in terms of premiums.  I should, perhaps, mention that these auctioneers who are members of the Association are able to secure the benefit of a lower &ldquo;group&rdquo; premium than others but I do not think that the Oireachtas can regard this lower &ldquo;group&rdquo; figure as the relevant one&mdash;we must keep in mind what the non-member who negotiates his own bond has to pay.  At the present time, I am informed that the individually-negotiated premium for the £2,000 bond is usually in the range from £10 to £12 per annum.  It is reasonable to assume, of course, that unless there were a change in claims experience&mdash;that is, in the pattern of defaults I referred to earlier&mdash;an increase in the liability from £2,000 to <Col N="1820" /> £5,000 would not cause a proportionate increase in the premium.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that insurance companies do not like giving quotations in a vacuum so to speak and it has not been possible to obtain any firm figure of what would be the immediate effect, on premiums, of an increase in the deposit from £2,000 to any other specified figure.  However, I did succeed in getting an informal estimate that, on present claims experience, a typical premium for an individually-negotiated bond of £5,000 might be around £22, as compared with the present £10 to £12 premium for a bond of £2,000.  It is to be expected that a reduction for a group premium would continue to be available. I may say this figure of £22, as compared with the present figure of £10 to £12, was higher than I had expected but it was not given as a firm estimate but only as a rough guide.</P>
    <P>This increase in the deposit should go a long way towards protecting the interests of clients but, quite obviously, as I have said, it does not protect them fully.  In order to provide fuller protection, therefore, I am proposing in this Bill that auctioneers, like solicitors, should be required to keep clients' money separated from their own.  May I make clear, in passing, that this does not mean that a separate account has to be opened for each client but if an auctioneer wishes to open a special account for a particular client, or for particular transactions with a client, he may do so.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to require auctioneers to keep properly written up such records as are necessary to show their dealings with clients' moneys.  As I mentioned earlier, these are elementary requirements which any auctioneer should observe in his own interests, but no doubt there are some who are careless in these matters and what begins in carelessness can end in fraud.  By requiring these accounts to be kept, the Bill will make it difficult for a person to drift into a situation from which he might find it impossible to recover.  It would be foolish to claim that these provisions will make fraud impossible but we <Col N="1821" /> can reasonably hope that, by legislating against carelessness, we will reduce fraud as well.</P>
    <P>The details in the Bill governing the payment of clients' moneys into the client account and the making of withdrawals follow the general lines of the Solicitor Accounts Regulations made by the Incorporated Law Society under the Solicitors Act, 1954.  There are, however, some differences between the Bill and the Solicitors Accounts Regulations&mdash;in general, one can say that the provisions of the Bill are less elaborate.  It is not necessary to have provisions in relation to auctioneers' accounts that are as elaborate as those relating to solicitors because an auctioneer, doing business as such, does not have to act in so many different ways on behalf of clients as a solicitor does.  For instance, it is not necessary to have special provisions relating expressly to trust accounts or the like.</P>
    <P>A requirement that separate accounts must be kept raises the question of enforcement.  It is possible to envisage some kind of system of official inspection but I do not think such a system would be justified or necessary. Obviously it would involve the appointment of some kind of inspectorate as it is not the kind of job for which the Garda Síochána would be suitable.  The proposal in the Bill is to adopt, with the necessary modifications, the system already incorporated in the Solicitors Act, 1960, for the submission annually of an accountant's certificate.  This certificate would be submitted to the District Court when the annual application for renewal of the auctioneer's certificate of qualification was being made.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that this will involve some cost for auctioneers, but I think it will be generally agreed that the time has come when additional safeguards for clients are essential and, even from the auctioneer's own point of view, this proposal to require production of an accountant's certificate is the most satisfactory way of securing compliance with the law.  It involves the minimum interference with his business and, by reducing the likelihood <Col N="1822" /> of defalcations, it will operate to the benefit of all auctioneers by helping to keep down the premiums which they are required to pay for the guarantee bond.</P>
    <P>The other provisions of the Bill, governing such matters as the distribution of the available money in the event of bankruptcy can, I think, properly be described as matters of detail, though admittedly important detail for persons whose interests the provisions are designed to protect.  Broadly speaking, these provisions follow the lines of the corresponding provisions of the Solicitors Act, though some additions and changes were needed to take account of the difference between the two businesses.  I should like to mention here that I have had the benefit of the expert advice of the Bankruptcy Law Committee on these particular provisions, and I am most grateful to them.</P>
    <P>I think that covers all the main points and it only remains for me to commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, the main objectives of this Bill are to require auctioneers to keep separate bank accounts of their clients' money&mdash;which will benefit not only the clients but the auctioneers as well, inasmuch as it will be a great safeguard for them&mdash;and to increase the bond from £2,000 at which it was fixed in 1947, to £5,000.  Even though the Minister said he was not particularly having regard to the decline in the value of money, the increase to £5,000 will not do much more than make up for that decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 is rather loaded, so to speak, against the small auctioneers in rural Ireland whose main business generally consists of sales of cottages and residences, letting of hay or meadowing, and whose annual turnover is not a very large figure.  It is a little unfair, perhaps, to expect them to keep the same bond as the big auctioneers in the cities with a turnover amounting possibly to millions of pounds.  I thought the Minister would have considered a two-tier system or some other kind of system which <Col N="1823" /> would be more realistic, and which would have regard to the turnover of these auctioneers.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Bill proposes that in future when auctioneers are applying for their licences, they must have a certificate from an accountant would easily provide a figure on which to base the proposed bond.  If the Minister availed of that system, it might be unnecessary to raise the bond to £5,000 in all cases.  It is very important that the public should be able to place their trust in auctioneers.  For that reason we must attract into that profession men of integrity and good standing because if they are to handle and sell people's property, they must be men who can be trusted and relied on.</P>
    <P>One sometimes feels that it is perhaps too easy for people to get auctioneers' licences.  It has happened on a few occasions that individuals took out licences for the sole and only reason of disposing of their own property.  Surely that is distasteful in any profession or in any business.  I knew this legislation was in the offing for a good while and I thought it might contain some guarantees or clause in that connection.</P>
    <P>Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 must be welcomed not only by the public generally but also by the auctioneers themselves.  Section 5 provides for the opening of clients' accounts.  That surely is a welcome provision.  It has happened in the past that when an unfortunate auctioneer or house agent got into financial difficulties and went bankrupt, moneys belonging to clients were also closed on.  That was a most unfortunate situation.  It did not happen very often, but I am glad the Minister has made provisions for such an occurrence in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with deposits of cash in the High Court.  Under the 1947 legislation, many auctioneers who originally took out their guarantees and placed £2,000 in cash in court found when they needed the cash later on that it was impossible for them to replace it by a bond.  Section 3 brings that situation up to date.  It is a section <Col N="1824" /> which will be welcomed by many auctioneers.</P>
    <P>The Bill as presented to us has very sensible provisions because they give very definite safeguards not only to the public who will be disposing of their property in future years, but also to auctioneers themselves by insisting that separate accounts must be kept of all clients' moneys.  We all know of cases of people who found themselves in temporary difficulties and the fact that someone else's money was mixed with their own made the solution of their problems all the more difficult.  In sections 6 and 7 in the case of a bankruptcy, the Minister is certainly guaranteeing the vendor against any loss.  Section 6 even prohibits the Government from making a claim against moneys which are in an account on behalf of a client.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill and I want to say that I am impressed by the manner of its presentation. We had to compliment the same Minister previously on the pains which he usually takes to explain the provisions of Bills in understandable language.  Apart from the explanatory memorandum to this Bill, the Minister seems to have gone out of his way to make clear what is involved in it.  In his speech to the House the Minister went into minute detail in order to explain precisely why it was necessary to increase the figure to £5,000, which I think would have been necessary in any event.  I do not know the year in which the figure was fixed at £2,000 but clearly, having regard to the value of money, an adjustment of that figure was not only necessary but overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the Bill does is to make it necessary for an auctioneer to have his bond increased to £5,000 at an annual cost to him of from £8 to £10.  I do not think anybody could cavil at that.  It is the least that could be asked of people who have undertaken responsibility as auctioneers.  I merely wish to add that if there is criticism of the Bill, it should be that it does not go far enough.  While there may be a strong case for the type of men Senator <Col N="1825" /> McDonald has in mind, men in a small way of business in rural areas, the question of the big men in the city and main towns should be simple enough.  Perhaps the Minister would consider the position of the smaller auctioneers in future legislation.  Apart from that, I think the Bill is commendable and I compliment the Minister on the manner in which it has been presented to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the last speaker's suggestion that the Bill does not go far enough in one respect. I do not think section 2 goes far enough.  If an auctioneer defaults, I think the figure of £5,000 is small because it is a poor farm nowadays that does not make £5,000.  Perhaps the Bill might not do it, but I think the auctioneers themselves, their association, for the benefit of the auctioneering body and for the good name of auctioneers, should be prepared to better the position, possibly by way of joint bond.  The auctioneers by joining together in a common bond, entailing the largest amount they could arrive at reasonably, could ensure that clients do not suffer because of defaulting auctioneers.</P>
      <P>That is the only criticism I have to make.  A bond of £5,000 at a comparatively small premium is not enough. We have auctioneers blossoming up like mushrooms&mdash;perhaps that is not a suitable way of describing it&mdash;in the country and in the cities and their suburbs.  If they are to take on this very reasonable business, they should be prepared to ensure that clients do not suffer.  The Law Society have a fund of their own to meet clients of defaulting members.  In the case of auctioneers, it might not be a matter entirely for the Minister: the auctioneers themselves should have asked to be considered in a Bill of this kind which, as Senator Crowley has said, does not go far enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say about the Bill may be slightly discordant. At the conclusion of his opening remarks, the Minister more or less told us that he drafted this Bill after consulting the Irish Auctioneers Association.  That was a good idea. <Col N="1826" /> Apparently he drafted it, though, without consultations with the auctioneers with whom he had earlier discussed it. That is fair enough, too.  I do not take the same view as some of the previous speakers.  Every man in the country has an equal right to go into any business he wishes in order to earn a livelihood, provided the necessary rules and precautions are complied with.  The Bill proposes to bring the bond up from £2,000 to £5,000.  If any young man, starting out with not much behind him, wishes to go into the auctioneering profession, he cannot do it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all very well to tell somebody he cannot be one thing or another.  The Constitution preserves equal rights&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are provisions in the Bill to protect the public.  There must be separate accounts kept for clients' money to ensure there will not be interference with it.  A person wishing to become an auctioneer now must go to the courts and, if you like, pass a fitness test to get a licence.  That brings him immediately into contact with the provisions of the Auctioneers Act, with the regulations of which he must comply.  One of the regulations is that he must be the holder of a £2,000 bond.</P>
      <P>Take a man who wishes to become an auctioneer&mdash;the son of a small farmer, a small shopkeeper or a small official.  He is not endowed with very much wealth so far, but wishes to earn a livelihood as an auctioneer.  He has to fill out an inquiry form for an insurance company.  After checking back and forth, the insurance company decide that on receiving his premium of £10, they will guarantee him up to £2,000.  The insurance companies are not fools: they will not guarantee a man for £2,000 on payment of a £10 premium unless they find he is very well secured and that he is worth the £2,000 for which they guarantee him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1827" /> It is proposed in this Bill to bring that figure up to £5,000.  In future a small farmer's son must pay a premium of £22 to an insurance company to guarantee him for £5,000. He adopts the same course as formerly: he will fill out an inquiry form, there will be checks and if the insurance company are not satisfied that the man is backed to the extent of £5,000, he will not get a bond from them. Therefore, we cannot dismiss this by saying all a man must do is fill up a form, pay the £22 premium, get a bond and go into business.  It is far more difficult than that for a man to get an auctioneering licence.</P>
    <P>Of course the raising of the bond from £2,000 to £5,000 increases the measure of protection for clients. However, on the Minister's admission, apparently the increase in the bond is not really warranted by experience: he indicated that the average number of defalcations per year is five, but that four of those make good the outstanding amounts, leaving only one defaulter per annum.  Take the number of licensed auctioneers in the country. Senator Cole made a good suggestion when he suggested the auctioneers might establish a fund as the solicitors have done.  That is a very good idea and the Auctioneers Association should give serious consideration to an arrangement such as that operated by solicitors.  If we put the bond up to £5,000 we shall be creating a vested interest.  We shall be leaving the position secure for those who already have licences and have established themselves as auctioneers, and we shall be closing the door to the young man who has not accumulated a measure of wealth and preventing him from going into this enterprise as an auctioneer, and every business is an enterprise.  This Bill affords a great measure of protection, and rightly so, to clients by ensuring a separate bank account for clients' money and an accountant's certificate every year. That is essential and desirable and it is the highlight of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill for the improvements it offers, particularly to the <Col N="1828" /> public.  I know there are auctioneers who would consider that £5,000 is not half enough.  I think it is known that one auctioneer wanted the bond to be £20,000.  Just imagine a person going into an insurance company looking for a bond for £20,000 and trying to put up that kind of security in order to get a licence.  That would immediately cut out a large number of auctioneers.  There are auctioneers who are not members of the Auctioneers Association as well as those who are, and rightly so, because this is a free country and a good measure of freedom should be available to the citizens provided they comply with the ordinary rules of proper business management.  I repeat my objection to the increase from £2,000 to £5,000 because it will prevent the small man from setting up in business.  That is an aspect of the Bill to which I should like the Minister to give further consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly (Longford) Mr. P. O'Reilly (Longford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Longford</i>): I agree with the viewpoint expressed by Senator Cole and I disagree with that expressed by Senator Rooney.  Senator Rooney is sympathetic towards the young man starting off in business, but we are legislating for the general public, not for individuals.  He said we would be creating a vested interest among auctioneers.  It is already a vested interest in that there is an association of auctioneers, a pressure group.  It is my experience that with groups of that nature, the more powerful they become, the more inclined they are to put pressure on everybody, from the Government down.  Five thousand pounds is not a big sum and is not high enough, but I suppose the Minister came down in favour of not being too hard on the young man starting off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all right for Senator Rooney to say that only one auctioneer per annum becomes involved in difficulties.  That is very nice so long as it is not myself or Senator Rooney who is involved on the other side.  There can be quite a lot of suffering and hardship inflicted on families by even one auctioneer getting into difficulties.  I would not agree with Senator Rooney that the <Col N="1829" /> amount of the bond should be reduced. If the vested interests of auctioneers, the Auctioneers Association, even if it meant an amending Bill, would create a fund among themselves which would cushion the public against a defaulting auctioneer, that would be a practical way of dealing with this problem.  No one wants to put an impossible obstacle in the way of the young man starting off, but we have a duty to society.  It is a question of striking a balance between what is reasonably safe, on the one hand, and reasonably easy, on the other.</P>
    <P>Maybe the auctioneers had a hand in drafting this measure, but if they do decide to seek an amendment of it, I hope they will succeed in making a better job of it than the solicitors. Some years ago solicitors had a hand in drafting a Bill to make better provision for their profession.  Under the provisions a court exercising certain functions was to be set up, but when it was contested in the Supreme Court, it was found to be unconstitutional, and the solicitors had to mend their hand.  The Auctioneers Association should create a fund which would protect the public against any members who might come out on the wrong side.  That has not been done, and a bond of £5,000 is not exorbitant in the circumstances.  I, personally, would like to see it higher if it would not create too much hardship, but, having regard to the present value of money, and the ratio of properties to money, I do not think a bond of £5,000 at all adequate, taking the long-term view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate in the Seanad has highlighted the difficulty which I, as Minister for Justice, have had in drafting this legislation.  There is the point of view mentioned by Senator McDonald and Senator Rooney that the measure might be unduly restrictive and that, by imposing further limitations in the form of an increased bond, coupled with the requirements of separate accounts and an accountant's certificate, it might be an undue imposition on young people.  The other point of view put by most Senators is that the public <Col N="1830" /> interest is paramount and that the limitations in the Bill may not go far enough.  I had to strike a middle course between these points of view, not making the business unduly restrictive so that the small man had a chance to go into it and progress in it, and at the same time, protecting the public interest.  The Bill represents the middle road between these points of view.</P>
      <P>I do not regard the increase in the bond from £2,000 to £5,000 as the more important point.  The more important point is the requirement in relation to the keeping of separate accounts&mdash;keeping the auctioneer's private account separate from his client's accounts&mdash;and enforcing that provision through the production every year of an accountant's certificate setting out that the auctioneer had kept the requisite financial and trading accounts, thus spelling out before the court, before the certificate can be renewed, that the trading accounts during the previous 12 months had been properly kept and clients' moneys kept apart.</P>
      <P>Prevention is better than cure.  This new provision imposing these requirements on the auctioneer will undoubtedly redound to the benefit of the public.  Heretofore, an auctioneer could get renewal of his auctioneer's certificate without any evidence as to how he had managed his clients' accounts. This was a most unsatisfactory situation from the point of view of the public.  This aspect is far more important than the aspect of increasing the bond from £2,000 to £5,000.  The new provision will ensure that every year the public is protected through the courts by the production by the auctioneer of evidence that he has kept his trading accounts separate from his personal accounts.  In my view, that is the most important aspect of the Bill rather than the increase from £2,000 to £5,000, which is partly a matter of making allowance for the fall in the value of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McDonald suggested that court should be given to a two-tier system whereby some allowance might be made for a lower bond for the small man as against the big man. <Col N="1831" /> I had looked into that question and, in my view, it is not practical.  An immediate difficulty would be where to draw the line.  I do not regard the increase in regard to the bond of from £12 to £22 a year as being exorbitant for even a small auctioneer to pay.  If a man is going into this business, holding himself out to the public as dealing in matters of thousands of pounds, it is not an undue imposition.  I do not think it could be regarded for even the smallest auctioneer as an undue imposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It takes more than £20 to get a bond.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps he must have other guarantees.  To my mind, the paramount interest is the public interest.  There is no doubt that there have been defalcations on the part of auctioneers&mdash;not too many, I am glad to say&mdash;but there have been some and this is a matter that we, as the Legislature, should seek to remedy.  Even if there is only one case a year, it may be for a substantial amount of money. If this Bill becomes law, the auctioneer's unsound position would <Col N="1832" /> be revealed at an early stage because he would have to present his accounts, duly certified by an accountant, to the court.  The position would be apparent and the district justice would refuse to renew the licence.  That is the position as I see it.  It will prevent a situation arising where an auctioneer might in some way do substantial damage to several members of the public.  We hope that this provision will prevent such a situation arising and that is more important than depending entirely on a cure after the event.</P>
      <P>I will be glad to consider any amendments suggested on Committee Stage.  From the point of view of the public and the point of view of most Members of the Seanad, it seems clear that the Bill, in broad principle, is welcomed and if there are any suggestions for amendments on Committee Stage, I will, as I have said, be glad to consider them.</P>
