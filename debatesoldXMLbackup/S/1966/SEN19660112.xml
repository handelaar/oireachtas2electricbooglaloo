    <Title>Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1965: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will change the basis of registration for electoral purposes of patients in hospitals, homes and similar institutions for persons suffering from mental disability.  It provides that such persons will be registered where they would normally be residing.  Where that place cannot be ascertained by the registration authority, a patient will be registered at his last place of residence.  The proposed change is on much the same lines as that intended under the Electoral Bill, 1965, which was introduced in the Dáil last July as a Private Member's Bill and was withdrawn after being discussed in that House on 1st December, 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Electoral Act, 1923, mental patients were specifically debarred from being registered in the hospitals and other institutions in which they were staying.  As a result, long-stay patients were not registered at all.  The Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad on the Electoral Law, which reported in 1960-61, recommended that persons resident for long periods in county homes and similar institutions should be registered as <Col N="806" /> electors there.  At a later stage in their report, in the context of their consideration of the question of qualifications for membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas the Joint Committee also expressed the opinion that the distinction between physical and mental illness should cease to be a factor in the electoral law.</P>
    <P>The Electoral Act, 1963, which gave effect to many of the recommendations of the Joint Committee, provides in effect that short-term patients or inmates in hospitals, sanatoria, county homes, homes for persons suffering from physical or mental disability or similar institutions shall be registered at their home addresses and that long-stay patients or inmates shall be registered at the hospitals and other institutions in which they are staying.</P>
    <P>Following the 1965 general election, a good deal of criticism was voiced in this House and elsewhere regarding voting at the election by long-stay mental patients at polling booths situated in or adjacent to mental hospitals. The general consensus of opinion expressed by persons engaged in the election seemed to favour a reversion to the arrangements which had operated prior to the 1963 Act.  The Bill now before the Seanad sets out to do this without, however, reimposing what was, in effect, the statutory disfranchisement on long-stay patients which operated under the Electoral Act, 1923.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the provisions of this Bill shall apply to the 1966-67 Register of Electors, which will be used for the forthcoming local elections and which is at present in course of preparation.</P>
    <P>I submit the Bill for the approval of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Members of the Seanad will welcome the Minister's visit to the Seanad so early in the legislative year.  There were some fears that the Minister was falling into the habit almost of coming to the Seanad late in the year with long and complicated measures.  The measure now before the House is short and non-controversial and even <Col N="807" /> if the Seanad did seek, in its wisdom, to amend the one small section that compromises, the Dáil will soon be resuming and would be able to deal with any such amendment.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as the Minister explained, seeks to amend section 5 of the 1963 Act.  It has been brought in, in response to a Private Member's Bill put down by Deputy Clinton.  The Minister's prompt response to Deputy Clinton's initiative is a healthy sign and a welcome move.  There has been comment and controversy since the last Dáil election concerning certain incidents which occurred at booths placed in mental hospitals for the purpose of that election.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the Bill and its subsequent passage through the Dáil seem to indicate that all Parties in the Dáil are agreed that it is undesirable to risk a repetition of the circumstances which did arise during that election. The position in the future is to be that patients from mental hospitals will vote at ordinary polling booths or not at all. This, which is the purpose of the Bill, is one with which the Seanad will agree. The prompt introduction of the Bill by the Minister is to be welcomed in that it will set matters right before the elections which are to take place during the coming year.  It is as well that this should be done, even if it means that the Minister has to postpone any action or any legislative proposals on other matters which have been the subject of controversy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking on the matter in the Dáil on 1st December last, the Minister indicated that he was prepared to look into the question of postal voting by various members of the community and he indicated at that time that he would consider what was the best way of examining this particular problem.  I should like to ask the Minister now whether he has made up his mind about the best way of carrying out this investigation and what he proposes to do in regard to it.  If we read section 5 of the Electoral Act, 1963, the section which we are amending in this Bill, and compare it with the corresponding <Col N="808" /> section of the British Act, the Representation of People Act, 1949, we shall find that we could learn something from this British Act.  I would ask the Minister, when the matter is being examined, to have it examined in a very broad manner.</P>
    <P>If we contrast the provisions of the two codes, the British code under the 1949 Act, and our code under the 1963 Act, we find that in regard to the registration of ordinary voters, we are very much more liberal in this country. A person can be registered under section 5 of the 1963 Act if his residence has been temporarily interrupted, and if he intends to resume up to a period of 18 months, and there need be no great reason for his absence.  In contrast in Britain, a person whose residence has been temporarily interrupted must have the intention of resuming residence in six months and he is only entitled to register during the interrupted residence when his absence is in connection with his job.  As I say, we are much more liberal in this regard.  When we turn to the problem not of residence on the day of registration but of the presence of a person in the constituency on polling day, we find we are a great deal less liberal than they are in Britain.</P>
    <P>If we contrast section 5 of our 1963 Electoral Act with section 14 of the British Act, we find they have gone a good deal further in helping people to exercise the franchise when circumstances make it difficult for them.  We give postal votes to the Army and to the Garda, and the question has arisen, which the Minister dealt with in the Dáil, whether we should also give postal votes to people who by reason of their nature of employment are likely to be absent from their homes on election day.  The Minister should look into the other categories covered in Britain during the past 16 years, including the question of blind voters and those physically unable to attend the polls.  All of us have, on the occasions when we have been active on election day, felt for blind voters, the way in which they are brought in and the embarrassment which attaches to the whole procedure. <Col N="809" /> It does not always happen but it can happen on occasions.  There is also provision in Britain whereby a person is entitled to a postal vote, if, although registered in one place, he is no longer residing in the same electoral division or the same rural district. This is a question which could be examined in the review which the Minister has promised to undertake.</P>
    <P>There is another provision in Britain, that where a person is a candidate in another constituency, he is entitled to a postal vote.  I am delighted to see in this provision that not only the candidate but also the wife, or the husband as the case may be, is so entitled.  I think this encouragement of consorts to take an active part in the political fortunes of the other partner is a good thing.</P>
    <P>There is one other point the Minister might look at in this general review of the postal vote, that is, the position of personating agents.  The present position is that provision is made whereby the presiding officer and polling clerk who are in a booth other than the booth at which they normally vote are able to exercise their vote.  This is not so in the case of the personating agents appointed by the political Parties.  In rural areas this does not give rise to much trouble because in practically all cases the personating agents are from the area covered by the polling booth; but in urban areas a person is frequently acting in a booth other than the one in which he votes.  This is something which could be looked at.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I might in summary say the Bill is a very welcome one. I congratulate the Minister on bringing it in and on the promptness with which he brought it in response to the Private Bill moved in the Dáil.  In regard to the review he has undertaken to make, I would ask him if he would indicate how he proposes to go about this, to make the review as wide as possible, and, indeed, to make it as short as possible.  The Minister mentioned a year as being the minimum time to deal with it.  I would hope he would try to make that year the maximum time for such a review.  We would all welcome in a year's time a further Electoral <Col N="810" /> Amendment Bill which would meet the very real need for the postal vote of a large number of classes of people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short Bill, discussion of which would perhaps be more appropriate on Committee Stage, I welcome it, but there are one or two points I wish to make.  The machinery to be used to operate it rather baffles me.  Take a mental hospital with 700 patients.  When it comes to voting day, 700 patients drawn from an area such as my own county will have to vote. How is the machinery to operate which will allow these patients out of hospital in all directions to vote?  Where will the staff come from?  I assume that a great many of them will not be allowed out by the RMS without supervision.  There may have been rows previously but I can see the RMSs being up to their eyes in trouble because each RMS will have to agree to the patient leaving the hospital. Supposing it happens a number of people are stopped by the RMS.  Some enterprising election agent works out that they belong to his Party and then starts attacking the RMS for using political pressure.  I can see as big a row developing as on the last occasion.</P>
      <P>Where a person is a patient in a mental hospital, his name will now appear on the home register, so to speak, but his present address will also have to be shown.  It has been suggested to me that in many cases this will be rather unfortunate for the family concerned.  I know everyone wants to get away from the old difficulty of regarding mental disease as something extraordinary that must be kept hush-hush.  That is all very well for liberal-minded people, but there are still a great many people who have not got around to this modern way of thinking.  They will be faced with having it pointed out to everyone in the district that so-and-so, a member of their family, is a patient in the mental hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the case of people who are to be registered at their last known address.  In respect of patients who have been in hospital a long time, it can very easily happen&mdash;I know cases where it has happened&mdash;that quite a <Col N="811" /> different family is now living at that address.  I can see objections from that point of view, that someone not connected with them at all gets landed into their address on the register.  I know any liberal-minded person would say that this is the sort of mentality we must get rid of.  I agree, but I think it ought to be done by education and should not be foisted on people by means of this.  I know it is all right to criticise when you cannot suggest anything better.</P>
    <P>I should be glad to hear from the Minister how it is envisaged this is going to work, and in particular, how patients are to be got to the various polling booths.  Some of the mental hospital authority areas are very large and very oddly shaped.  I visited one last week, Carlow-Kildare.  How they are to be got from Carlow, in one constituency, away up to Kildare, I do not know.  Yet, that is a reasonably small hospital.  In Donegal I frankly do not understand how people are to be brought to Inishowen in the north, Ballyshannon in the south and out to the west.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not underestimating the Party machines.  If the RMS would allow patients out in charge of the Party machine, I think it would be most objectionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this Bill.  It is unfortunate that the last election gave rise to criticism in some areas.  It was nice to see that these unfortunate people suffering from mental illness were taken out of the category they shared with prisoners and members of the Garda, the only sections of our community not entitled to vote.  Under the last Act the Garda were rightly given the right to vote.  It is unfortunate that those suffering from mental illness have not been allowed to keep the same privilege, but, in view of the criticisms we have heard over past months, it was only proper that the Minister should have taken this <Col N="812" /> course.  I congratulate him on his prompt action in the matter.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to look into the problem of extending the postal vote to all commercial travellers. It is a pity that so many of our fellow citizens should be inconvenienced to the extent of having to travel hundreds of miles after their day's work if they want to vote.  These people are of sufficient number to be given every facility to have full voting rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I supported the amendment of the 1923 Act, which we dealt with in 1963.  I thought it was a good thing then that we provided this facility of enabling long-term patients in mental hospitals to vote.  I had the feeling that many of those people were in mental hospitals not because of mental illness but because they were simply left there by their relatives.  It was their permanent home. Many of them were quite capable of assessing the position and exercising the vote.  I agree people were exploited by the activities of the political Parties &mdash;the political machines to which Senator O'Quigley referred&mdash;in the last general election and that something needed to be done about that; but I am wondering is this the right way to go about it.  We still have this keenness on the part of the political Parties to get out every elector.  Are we going to have the situation that in their keenness to get votes these people will be taken out of mental hospitals&mdash;with the permission of the RMS, I presume, and he will be brought under considerable pressure&mdash;and brought to various parts of the county and surrounding areas in order to vote?  Again, I am not sure that that is a good thing.</P>
      <P>I am making these points, let it be admitted, without being clear in my mind as to the solution to this problem. We thought we had the solution on the last occasion.  We underestimated the keenness of the political machine.  We agree that what was happening was bad for politics, and, more especially, bad for the patients, the individuals concerned, and we should try to avoid that in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister would try to <Col N="813" /> clarify the position for us and tell us what he expects to happen in this direction under the amendment of the legislation he is proposing here.  Will the RMS in the various mental hospitals be under pressure to release people so that the political Parties can bring them to distant parts to exercise the franchise?  Will this be the position and, if so, what safeguards will there be for the individuals concerned and for the people who have the responsibility of running the mental hospitals?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of this Bill, mainly because it changes the conditions under which mental patients were given an opportunity to vote in the last general election.  It was seen, there, that it was a very great mistake to have the legislation in a manner that permitted the voting machine to operate as it did in that election.  This change, I believe, is not the answer.  I think it is a very great mistake to give the power of voting to mental patients. These people are now being asked to participate in the elections of members of the Dáil and Seanad.  Let us remember that these unfortunate people will not be listened to in a court of law where the laws passed by the Dáil and Seanad are put into effect.  Take a mental patient out of any of these institutions and bring him down to a court of law and it is obvious that any evidence he gives or statements he makes will be contested and will not be accepted.  Similarly, if any of these people make a will, or are given the opportunity to make a will, it will be contested.</P>
      <P>Take the mental patient who has spasms and who may be very ill mentally for a couple of days, weeks or months and quite sane for another time.  That is the type of patient who, during his time of sanity, ought to be entitled to make a will when he is able to make clear decisions which will be acceptable.  But, once he is in a mental institution, the power of a patient to make a will is not likely to be contested because it just does not exist. I feel, therefore, it is a great mistake to bring the legislation so far as to permit mental patients to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Possibly the RMS will have some say <Col N="814" /> in this matter.  He will be in a position to certify whether the patient is going through one of these stormy mental periods or whether, on the day of the election and the days approaching it, he is sane and able to make a sane decision, to make a sane choice.  There is a lot in what Senator Sheldon has said in relation to the address at which the patient will be registered. It is most important to examine the points made by Senator Sheldon.  The question of where you will put the people on the register is very important and I think this Bill is not the answer.</P>
    <P>With the democratic outlook that prevails in this country and the very fair outlook that there is amongst our people, there is the danger that we can go too far in being fair.  The Civic Guards were deprived of the right to exercise the franchise and, after all, these people are mentally balanced. They are doing a very important job in the community.  They are affected by the laws of the country, the same as every other citizen, and, still, that body of people were not permitted to cast their votes and take part in the elections. If Civic Guards are not permitted to vote, there is a very weak case in favour of allowing mental patients to vote.</P>
    <P>I do not think there has been agitation or pressure by mental patients for the right to exercise the franchise.  I do not think any number of them felt they had a grievance because they could not vote and could not participate in the elections.  In accordance with our democratic outlook, we have decided to give these people a right and a facility which they did not ask for.  Everybody must look at this in a humane manner and agree that we must be fair to these people.  We must respect the fact that they are suffering from a mental illness but this is an illness that deprives them of the power to make a decision&mdash;at least that is the view of sane people.  Sane people believe that mentally ill people cannot make a sane decision and yet here they are being given an opportunity to participate in the election of Members of the Dáil and Seanad.  That is why I think this Bill is a mistake and that what we are doing today is not the answer to the <Col N="815" /> problem, and that if we are anxious to give votes to these people, it is because they are aged over 21 years and are in good physical health.  We decide, then, to give them a vote.  I think it is not the answer because there are different degrees and different types of mental illness.</P>
    <P>It will be difficult for the RMS to decide, on the day of a general election, that, when the patient is marking the ballot paper, he is sane.  He might or might not be sane on the day he was marking the ballot paper.  Therefore, the RMS will have a very big job in this matter, apart from deciding whether or not he can release patients from the institution in order to vote from various addresses.  Senator Sheldon has made very effective points in that connection that should carefully be considered by the Minister and his officials.  I am very unhappy about the proposal to give these voting powers to mental patients.  When we were quite satisfied to leave the Civic Guards without the right to vote, being sane persons, there is no reason to worry too much about ensuring that people who are physically fit and mentally ill will have a right to vote in these elections.</P>
    <P>I feel, too, that this Bill does not go far enough in the matter of postal voting.  I hope that this is only a temporary measure and that the Minister will bring in a new Electoral Bill to meet modern conditions and modern circumstances.  Travel is very easy at the present time and we know if an election occurs during the holiday time when people are likely not alone to be away from their ordinary addresses here in this country but to be away on continental holidays and elsewhere, they do not get an opportunity to vote. Those people are away from the country for a matter of a few weeks only and when they come back, they are subject to the laws and participate in the various forms of taxation imposed upon them as citizens.  Still, just because they were away on holiday on election day, they do not get an opportunity to vote for or against a particular policy in the light of their own opinions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> People who find it necessary to be away on the election day, whether it be on holiday or for business purposes&mdash; commercial travellers and various other classes of people&mdash;should not be deprived of the right to vote because they are unable to be present at the booth for the purpose of marking the ballot paper in the area in which they are normally resident.  The Minister might consider, for instance, the possibility of giving those people proxy votes; in other words, that they could instruct members of their family to cast the vote for them.  Possibly they could give a member of their family a document which could be brought to the booth and which would enable that person to cast the vote for them.  I feel it is a great mistake in this day of easy travel, where people can be long distances from their normal residences on the day of the general election, that those people are deprived of the right to cast their votes.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned in relation to mental patients, that a number of them are quite sane and have been left in institutions by their families.  Surely it is up to the RMS of a mental hospital to certify that a person is not mentally ill and he should then be removed from the mental institution to some other type of home for sick people.  Surely it is not right to keep in a mental hospital a person whom the RMS is in a position to certify as not being mentally ill.  With regard to this point about sane people being left in institutions by their relatives&mdash; if it is a fact&mdash;I feel there is a job there for the Minister for Health, to ensure that that practice will be discontinued and that those people will be put into a proper place and not detained in mental institutions if they are not mentally ill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very minor Bill and is more notable for what is omitted from it than for what is included in it.  The Minister has, on a number of occasions, sought to suggest in the other House that he was interested in widening the scope of legislation to enable the majority of our citizens to decide the Government of the day.  The last Bill which came <Col N="817" /> before the Houses was not, in my opinion, a true reflection of the Report which the Minister had from the Special Committee which had been set up some time before that.  As a member of that Committee, I happen to be aware that a great deal of pressure was exercised to prevent recommendations which would give many of our citizens the right to vote who are deprived of that right.  I refer specifically to what is omitted from this Bill when I mention our emigrants, or migrants, whichever you like to call them for the purposes of this type of discussion.  The Minister, rightly, is anxious to ensure that people who have been long resident in our mental institutions and who have their senses about them should be entitled to vote. But I am puzzled by the priorities that seem to establish themselves in the Minister's mind when he decides he will give priority in legislation to those people over and above the able-bodied Irish men and women who are resident in Britain on a temporary basis, through no fault of their own.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to explain to me now why it is, for instance in France, that a French citizen resident in Ireland, on application, will be entitled to cast a vote in the French elections.  I put that question specifically to the Minister because we find so many Irish people who have been forced to go to England through economic circumstances deprived by legislation of their right to decide the type of Government in Ireland&mdash; perhaps a Government who would look with greater sympathy on their point of view and on the necessity for altering the economic system in operation to ensure that a living in Ireland will be made available to the people who now have to leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government in office at the moment are straining at the leash to get into Europe, so that, when I make a comparison with France, I hope we will not be told that we are not interested in what the French do.  We are showing a great deal of interest in Europe at the moment, at least on the surface.  If we are serious about admission there, I see no reason why we should not adopt that very sensible and <Col N="818" /> sane approach which the French have as far as their citizens are concerned. What would be wrong with giving Irish people in London, Manchester, Liverpool and all those other centres, who wish to vote, the right to do so over there?  Is it because we have so many of them over there?  Is it because the Government are shivering in their boots about what the results would be?  This is only a little closed society, composed on the one part of old people and on the other of the very young.  The life's blood who should have a decision as to how that nation's affairs are conducted are outside the State and deprived of this right and of an opportunity of making a living in the country.  To me the deprivation of the right of those people to vote is a crime against the Irish people.  We hear very little talk these days&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I may say this to the Chair, that in this Bill, which I accept is a limited one, we are amending section 5&mdash;that is the purpose&mdash;and section 5, if I may refer the Chair to it, deals with the franchise and I should like to quote it.  Section 5 (1) says:</P>
      <P>A person shall be entitled to register as a Dáil elector in a constituency if he has reached the age of 21 years and was, on the qualifying date, (a) a citizen of Ireland, and (b) ordinarily resident in that constituency.</P>
      <P>We are amending that section, or portion of it, in this Bill and I submit I am entitled, on Second Reading, to refer to that section on the ground that I feel the Minister is not going far enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Chair has the final decision on what is a full scale discussion and I do not intend to try the patience of the Chair on this matter. I referred to the qualifying age but I have made no statement so far on the question of age, whether it should be 21, as it is under section 5, or whether I should be entitled, with your permission, to suggest that it is a pity that the Minister has not in this Bill sought to bring the age limit down to 18 years of age.  I do not propose to give the reasons in any detailed fashion as to why that should be done.  Commonsense should make it apparent that a person of 18 years of age is just as mature as perhaps any member of the House, or even the respected holder of the Chair himself.  I am sorry the Minister has not seen fit to take the necessary steps on this occasion and all I can say, in conclusion, is that the two matters to which I have referred, the extension of the franchise to people at <Col N="820" /> present outside the State, due to the failure of the Government to provide them with the means of getting a livelihood at home, and the age at which voting begins, are matters the Minister should bear in mind for immediate attention.  In particular, I hope that in the near future he will, having given sympathetic consideration to this point of view, bring in legislation which will enable these suggestions to be carried out.  I look forward with the greatest interest to seeing such amending legislation in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one comment to make.  Certain members expressed concern about the availability of nursing staff on election day to accompany patients to the polls.  I think there is no need for such concern.  It is common practice with mental hospitals throughout Ireland for the better patients to be allowed out in the hospital grounds or allowed to visit nearby towns without nurses accompanying them.  I believe this is the type of patient the RMS will allow out to vote and any others, of course, can have nurses with them.  For that reason I do not think the RMS will be subject to pressure from political Parties.</P>
      <P>Senator Rooney also referred to the point that patients did not ask for the vote and did not want it.  I disagree very strongly with this.  I live quite near a mental hospital and meet the patients from time to time, and I must say that patients in that mental hospital at least looked forward to casting their votes on the last occasion.  I hear that only four of them voted for Fine Gael which goes to prove that they were not so crazy after all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  It is designed to meet the points made by Deputy Clinton in the Bill which he introduced in the Dáil and subsequently withdrew. On that occasion Deputy Clinton quoted from a report of an election agent, as reported in the Official Report in volume 219, column 776:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the foregoing you will see that there were grave abuses.  Since <Col N="821" /> the total vote in the hospital could have no significant effect in the result of the then General Election I am now taking no further steps in this matter as Election Agent for the Election now past.</P>
    <P>The Minister saw the point of that and agreed that if he were to concern himself with the abuses on general election day, he would not be concerned with very much, but he said that there was a matter of importance and stated at column 787 of the same volume of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>There is, however, a matter of importance, that is, with regard to the election of local authorities, particularly urban councils.  This has not been mentioned here but the extraordinary situation can arise in connection with the register for certain of our smaller urban councils, and some of them that are not so small, that the total number of mental patients and staffs, if they all voted and voted <i>en bloc</i>, would be sufficient to gain complete control of a number of our urban councils.</P>
    <P>Not alone that but they would be sufficient to win seats in county councils. I think the Minister has met the point.  The abuses that occurred, on the last occasion, while serious in themselves, had little effect on the result of the general election, at least in the case of the mental hospital with which I am connected.  In the forthcoming local elections, however, it could have very serious effects and if even some of the patients voted, they could influence the results very seriously. The Minister is to be congratulated on appreciating that position and on introducing the Bill which allows patients to be registered either in their known place of abode or their last known place of abode.  If these patients are physically and mentally well enough, they will be allowed to vote just as they are allowed out to work on farms and in hotels and with local shopkeepers.</P>
    <P>Senator McGlinchey, I think, suggested that where they want to vote, they should be accompanied by nurses. I do not think the mental nurse has <Col N="822" /> any business accompanying a patient to vote.  The duty of the mental nurse is to look after these patients in hospital: if the patient wishes to vote and is able to do so, then the medical officer will allow the patient to vote but I do not see that if a mental patient expresses a wish to vote but cannot be allowed to travel unaccompanied, he should be accompanied and furnished with what in effect is private nursing attention.  If any member of the general body of ratepayers is sick or unwell but still wants to vote, he will not be furnished by the county council with a nursing attendant to accompany him.  I do not see why the general body of patients for whom the ratepayers are paying in order that they may be looked after should be provided with this private attention.</P>
    <P>In the city of Dublin there are many hundreds of patients from rural areas and if they want to vote on election day, they will not be accompanied from Dublin by nurses.  If they can go without nurses and the doctor says that they will be all right, that is perfectly in order, but when I hear Senators and other people saying that these people can be accompanied by nurses, I wonder if we are getting back to the old position.  Will the intention of the Bill be frustrated again?  If there is a considerable body of patients who require nursing attention on the way to vote they can be influenced. I am not saying that they will be influenced, but they can be.  The Minister or his colleague, the Minister for Health, should make it quite clear that nurses should not be allowed to travel outside a mental hospital with patients who have expressed a desire to vote but who are unabe to proceed to vote without medical or nursing attention.  The Minister should advert to that point when he is concluding. I would like again to congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill.  He has met very fairly the case made by Deputy Clinton.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Seán Ó Donnabháin Seán Ó Donnabháin">
      <NameTxt>Seán Ó Donnabháin</NameTxt>
      <P>A few questions arise from the discussion that has taken place on this Bill.  I have no <Col N="823" /> experience of seeing mental hospital patients voting.  I have a great deal of experience of seeing blind persons and illiterate persons voting.  Facilities are provided for such persons whereby they can be accompanied into the polling booth.  I am not sure if the same provisions apply in the case of mental hospital patients.  I do not know whether or not they can be assisted in voting by a person of a political Party. There must be in mental hospitals patients who are not in a position to vote, even with the assistance of a person accompanying them.</P>
      <P>The local authority in each area deal with the compilation of the register.  There are at present nightly appeals on television to voters to see that their names are on the register. At the time the local authority are compiling the register for, say, a mental hospital in Dublin, the resident medical superintendent should help by determining that a certain number of patients in the hospital are physically and mentally capable of registering their votes.  There must be people in mental hospitals who would not be physically or mentally capable of voting.</P>
      <P>There is another question on which I should like clarification.  What is the difference between a patient and an inmate of a mental hospital?  The clause says &ldquo;where on the qualification date a person is a patient or inmate in any hospital.&rdquo;  I should like to know what is the difference between a patient and an inmate of a mental hospital.  Apparently, there has been misinterpretation by Senators who have spoken and I should like the Minister to clarify the position.</P>
      <P>As I have said, when the local authority are compiling the register, the resident medical superintendent of the hospital should be in a position to say that such an inmate or such a patient&mdash;if there is a difference&mdash;is physically capable of voting and should be on the register.  It is not on the day of the election that the RMS should be called upon to make that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dooge referred to the position of persons in hospitals for the blind and illiterate persons and <Col N="824" /> physically incapacitated persons, who can be accompanied to the booth and assisted to vote.  Would the same apply to persons in mental hospitals?  Some Senators seem to think that they should not be assisted to vote.  In my view, there must be in mental hospitals persons who should not be allowed outside the institution.  If they can be allowed out, they should not be in a mental hospital.  There are indications that there are many persons in mental hospitals who need not be there.  They may have a mental incapacity of some kind but that does not mean that they could not be accommodated in suitable hospitals other than what could be described as mental hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the content of the Bill is concerned, I do not think there is very much on which to comment but in regard to the few matters that have been raised that are related to the Bill, I shall try to elucidate what is intended.</P>
      <P>The question has been raised by Senator Ó Donnabháin as to the difference between a patient and an inmate.  I could not say.  I am not worried.  This is imported from the 1923 Act and, indeed, from an earlier British Act and its use at the moment is to ensure that we are leaving nobody out rather than trying to define the difference between the two terms.  It is always best to follow precedents established in previous Acts in case some bright spark might decide that the description was not fitting and might try to upset the provision.  &ldquo;Inmate or patient&rdquo; would cover all that it is intended to cover and that is the purpose behind the use of these two words in the section.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Donnabháin also suggested that the RMS should predetermine who might vote at a forthcoming election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Seán Ó Donnabháin Seán Ó Donnabháin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole effort to extend the franchise to inmates or patients of mental hospitals is based largely on the fact that these people are not always in a mental condition <Col N="825" /> such as would preclude them from exercising a sane judgment and therefore an attempt by a resident medical superintendent or any other learned person to predetermine who should be on the register, even a week before an election, would be at variance with the general spirit and purpose underlying our efforts to give these people the franchise which up to the advent of the 1963 Act they did not enjoy.</P>
      <P>I should have said at the beginning that I am probably in the Seanad on a basis which I am seldom on, that is, that I do not agree with the sentiments of the Bill.  I do not see a great deal of purpose in it.  Admitting that the majority is normally right and the clamour for change being so great, I was not so convinced or convicted in my mind that I could not change.  I have the Bill before the House.  Quite honestly, I have no stomach for it. I believe that a great number of inmates or patients of mental hospitals are capable of making judgments far more sane and reasonable than have been made by persons, allegedly sane, outside mental hospitals.  Senator McGlinchey made reference to that. There is a great deal in what he said. We cannot get away from the fact that we are and have been over the years continuing to regard persons who are mentally ill as persons who should be locked away, as being different from everyone else and who should be denied civic rights.  It was because of this that I felt it was a real advance when, in the 1963 Act, we gave those people for the first time the right to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather sorry that we are taking that right away, even to the degree that we are doing, in this Bill but at least, as salvage from the sentiments that brought about the change in 1963, we have preserved for those who on an election day are regarded as fit to go outside to vote, the right to do so. I do not think that all the worry that has been expressed as to whether these people should be accompanied by attendants or nurses need arise.  As I see it, the patient who on election day requires, in the judgment of the RMS, to be escorted by an attendant is not <Col N="826" /> really entitled to this jaunt out to vote at all.  If he is not well enough to go in more normal circumstances, if he has to have an attendant to look after him, then he should not be allowed out to vote.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the RMS will exercise his discretion in this matter as he exercises it in other matters relevant to the patient's welfare and wellbeing. Whether the patient will vote one way or another, or whether there is pressure put on him by any political Party or its agents, will not enter into consideration at all.  It will be the duty of the RMS to have, as he has now, a care for his patients.  That will be of paramount importance in his mind when he comes to determine what patients are entitled to vote or what patients he will be prepared to allow out to vote.  Whether the polling station is situated near to or far from the hospital will also have a bearing.</P>
    <P>Senator McQuillan criticised the 1963 Act and criticised also the shortcomings of this amendment.  The odd thing is that he did not speak once in the Dáil when the 1963 Act was before the House.</P>

      <P>The proposal to reduce the age from 21 to 18 would, of course, require a referendum.  It might be of interest to Senators who are thinking along these lines to learn that the British Speaker's Conference is this week considering this very matter, amongst others, in relation to British electoral law.  It is as well, however, in this connection to have regard to the fact that we do not require slavishly to follow Britain. Indeed, our electoral law is in many respects well in advance of Britain. The Speaker's Conference is only now beginning to consider some of the changes we have already made here since 1963 in our electoral laws.</P>

      <P>Senator Murphy referred to the undesirability of the wholesale emptying out of mental hospitals on election day.  I do not anticipate that is how the arrangements will work.  The RMS will be responsible on that day just as he is responsible on every other day in the year.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to postal voting. This matter was discussed by the Dáil in relation to commercial travellers.  I said then that I did not think we should change for one particular category; there were other categories to be considered, amongst them our migrants and our emigrants.  This country is not really so large as to prohibit anyone who wants to vote from voting.  It would be very interesting to find out what percentage travel long distances and at some personal inconvenience in order to vote.  I should think the percentage would be good as compared with that of those who, though living within easy voting distance, do not bother to come out and vote.  Invariably 20 per cent to 25 per cent do not vote.  It is the old story: what one has one does not appreciate and what one cannot attain one desires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said I shall have an investigation into this matter of postal voting. I have not yet determined the form of <Col N="828" /> that investigation.

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question.  There is an obligation now on those responsible for compiling the register to ascertain, if possible, the home addresses of the mental patients concerned.  How does the Minister envisage this will be done?  To what extent should this attempt be made?  I know their answer would be that every reasonable effort would be made to find out but I should like to ask the Minister if the idea would be that the person responsible for the register would ask the mental hospital for the address and if it was not there to leave it at that.  Is that what the Minister has in mind in subparagraphs (a) and (b)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Without tying it down to that, I would feel that that information for the purpose of the register would be kept in the mental hospital, and in most cases an inquiry would prove adequate.  In cases where it is not adequate, it is difficult to say at this stage what further investigation might be followed.  The Senator probably would be interested in the fact that we have already prepared a circular in relation to registration of mental patients for electoral purposes, and that we have given certain broad outline instructions that should be followed. The first paragraph of that circular says that if the registration <Col N="829" /> authority cannot ascertain where he would have been resident such a patient or inmate shall be regarded as resident at the place where he last resided.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with the question on the basis that the RMS may facilitate their voting not with the question of his restraining patients.  It is the other way round. The question of the fitness of the person to go out is within the competence of the RMS to decide.</P>

      <P>My sympathy would be entirely with the RMS in this business. I agree that this would be exercised properly by the RMS but it would not be the first time he did things properly that other people would be prepared to say he was not doing them properly.  On the question of a person's ability to make a wise decision in voting, there are types of mental illness which would not leave a person's judgment impaired in regard to the election of candidates, but such people could not be allowed to go on public transport without someone in charge.  It is not a question of their having to receive medical care while they are out but of somebody accompanying them to make sure that no injury occurs to them.</P>

      <P>The Senator seems to indicate that the job of the RMS is to determine whether a patient, on election day, is in a state in which one would expect him to be capable of making a reasonable and sane decision. That is not what the RMS has to decide. He will be operating in the interest of his patients.  What he has <Col N="832" /> to decide is whether a patient may go out on a certain day, bearing in mind the distance to the polling station and so forth.  His regard will be for the patient's welfare, not for the patient's ability to make a sane decision.  That is really the basis on which the RMS will be operating.  The question of whether the patient is capable of making a sane decision on the day does not arise.  What does arise is whether it is in the interest of the patient that he should be allowed out to the polling station.</P>

      <P>I agree, but is it clear from the Bill that this is the position?  Is it clear no one will be allowed out who should not be out on his own?  One hospital may do it one way and another the other way. One RMS may say he has so much staff that he can let so many patients out while another may say he has not got enough staff.  I can foresee administrative rows.  It should apply where the patient can go out under his own steam without a nurse.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. O'Malley) Donogh O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to make some adjustments in the categories of persons who are entitled under the Health Acts to avail themselves of general and mental hospital services and of the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme.  I should explain that there are three categories of persons who, with their dependants, are entitled to use these services.  These are:</P>
      <P>(i)  Persons insured under the Social Welfare Acts; (ii)  other persons over 16 years of age whose yearly means, as defined in the Health Acts, is less than £800, and their dependants; and (iii)  farmers where the rateable valuation of the land and the buildings thereon is £50 or less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before going on to discuss the changes made recently, or now proposed, in these categories, I should mention, to complete the picture, that a person who is not in any of them can still be regarded as entitled to the <Col N="834" /> services if he can show that it would cause him undue hardship to make private arrangements for the necessary medical care.</P>
    <P>In regard to the first category of persons I have mentioned, those insured under the Social Welfare Acts, under section 6 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1965, which came into effect on 6th September last, the income limit for the inclusion of non-manual workers in the social insurance scheme was raised from £800 to £1,200 a year.  Therefore, except for some categories exempted by the nature of their employment from social welfare insurance, as well as all manual employees, irrespective of income, all non-manual employees up to the new limit of £1,200 a year are, with their dependants, entitled to use the health services which I have mentioned.  This change was a direct consequence of last year's amendment of the Social Welfare Acts and no supplemental health legislation was necessary to give effect to this change.  Therefore, the Bill now before the House does not purport to deal in any way with the change in eligibility for health services for insured persons.  It is concerned solely with the other categories of eligible persons which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The second category can conveniently, if perhaps a little inaccurately, be described as the self-employed.  In it are included persons, other than farmers, not insured under the Social Welfare Acts with yearly means under £800.  Seeing that the corresponding limit for employees is now £1,200 a year, it is clearly equitable that the limit for the self-employed should be raised to the same figure.  This is all the more justifiable, seeing that the formula for assessing eligibility for the self-employed is considerably more comprehensive than for the insured.</P>
    <P>In assessing whether a self-employed person comes within the prescribed limit under the Health Acts, there is taken into account not only the yearly means of the person concerned but also the means of the husband or wife and subject to some deductions, the mean of any unmarried sons or daughters <Col N="835" /> resident in the household.  It is proposed, by subsection (3) of section 1 of the Bill, to change this, so that, in future, only the means of the applicant and of the husband or wife, if any, will be taken into account.  This change was particularly welcomed in the Dáil and I am sure this House will agree that it is more realistic to accept that most unmarried sons and daughters do not, for reasons which are often very sound, contribute their entire income, or most of it, to the household budget.</P>
    <P>The changes, then, for the self-employed are that the limit will be raised from £800 to £1,200 a year, so as to bring that category back into line with the insured persons, and that this desirable easing will be made in the formula for assessing their eligibility. These changes, coupled with the extension of the social welfare limit, which, as I have mentioned, has already become effective, will restore entitlement to these health services to a considerable number of people who have lost it through betterment of their incomes and will confer such entitlement on a number who did not previously have it. I shall later discuss the justification for this extension of eligibility.</P>
    <P>First, however, I should like to explain its implications for the third category mentioned, that is, the farmers, and what it is proposed to do for them in the Bill.  The valuation limit of £50 for farmers has been the same since 1953, when this way of defining eligibility for health services was first introduced. In 1958, the income limit for the other categories was raised from £600 to £800 a year, but no change was then thought necessary for the farmers as the change in the income levels was such as merely to make a rough compensation for the fall in the value of money between 1953 and 1958.  The present Bill goes somewhat further than this. If the income limit were to be raised only to a figure sufficient to compensate for the fall in the value of money since 1958, this figure would be £1,000 a year.  Therefore, the change to £1,200 a year represents an increase, as against 1958, of about 20 per cent in the real value of the limit and to keep the farmers <Col N="836" /> in line, an increase of 20 per cent in their limit, that is from £50 to £60 valuation, is justifiable.  Hence, section 1 of the Bill provides for this increase.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that we cannot calculate exactly what the effect of this Bill will be on the numbers eligible for these services, but it is thought that, coupled with the change already made as respects insured persons, the proportion eligible for the hospital services and the maternity and infant care services will be raised from about 85 per cent to something over 90 per cent of the population. This may seem a considerable increase but I should point out that, as the general level of incomes changes, so does this percentage.  Therefore, each change in the prescribed limits for eligibility brings the percentage to a peak from which, in the normal course, it falls over the years as more people become better off and ineligible for the services.</P>
    <P>This factor does not apply directly to farmers as valuations do not change with improving incomes.  However, with the diminution in the numbers of small farms, the long-term tendency is for the proportion of farmers eligible for these services to decrease. Thus, in 1951 about 87.5 per cent of all the farmers in the country were under the £50 valuation limit.  The 1961 census shows, however, that in that year only 85 per cent of all the farmers in the country were under this limit.  The number, according to that Census, under the new limit of £60 was about 89 per cent.  The net effect, therefore, of the changes since 1953 in relation to the farmers is that, instead of 87.5 per cent being eligible, 89 per cent will be eligible under the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union, with which I have discussed the Bill, are opposed to the extension of eligibility to the figure of £1,200 a year and to the change in the farmers' limit.  The Irish Medical Association asked me to bring its views on this matter before the Dáil and I did so.  I think it desirable that I should repeat in this House what I said in the Dáil.  This was:</P>
    <P>The Irish Medical Association has <Col N="837" /> told me that it was opposed to a comprehensive medical service on the principle that the profession would be expected to give free service to individuals who are capable of making provision for themselves without significant hardship and that this opposition applies equally to the extension as now proposed.  It is as well that this statement of the policy of the Association should be on the records of the House.  I agree with the views of the Association in regard to the giving of free service to those able to provide it for themselves without hardship, but I disagree with them that this principle is violated by the changing of the income limits proposed in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>To supplement this statement which I made in the Dáil, I should mention that the Irish Medical Association had earlier suggested to me that the income limit should be raised from £800 to £1,000 a year, so that the net point of difference between the Association and myself is the further increase to £1,200 a year, in the form proposed in the Bill, and the proposed raising of the limit for farmers.  I should say, too, that in discussion with the Association, I conceded that if, as a consequence of the operation of the new Bill, they can show that any of their members suffer financially to a substantial extent, I will be prepared to consider some compensation by way of adjustment in their remuneration from public funds.</P>
    <P>The objections of the representatives of the medical profession are based on the fact that the proposals go further than merely compensating for the fall in the value in money.  The reason why it is proposed to go further than this and make some increase in the real limits for eligibility is that the cost of hospital services has in recent years increased very substantially.  For example, while six guineas a week was charged for a bed in a public ward in a Dublin teaching hospital in 1961, £17 10s. a week is now charged for such a bed.  I am satisfied that these increases have meant that only a comparatively small percentage of the population have the resources to <Col N="838" /> arrange hospital services privately, either directly or through Voluntary Health Insurance.  Therefore the changes poposed by this Bill do not represent an unnecessary extension of the scope of eligibility for these services, or an unnecessary intrusion by public authorities on the private practice of the doctors.  I commend the Bill to the House for Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister for the wisdom he has shown in consulting the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union. However, I shall have more to say about that later.  I regret to say that the people who have to bear the brunt of the operation of the medical services are not satisfied with what the Minister is doing now but perhaps the Minister may be able to give some further information on that at a later stage.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in so far as it brings the existing health services to a wider number of people but it is very regrettable, at this stage, that the health services which cost as much as they do are so unsatisfactory.  This represents another small accretion of people within the ambit of the health services.  I hope the Minister, with the passage of time, will find himself in the position to provide a comprehensive health service for the entire community.</P>

      <P>It is time we had health services based on the principle that when people are well, they should have to pay for ill-health and that when they are ill, they should not have to pay for ill-health.  That principle would be much better than the present principle.  It is a sad reflection on the capacity of our administrators and the Minister that, at this stage and in this day and generation, when a man gets sick, say, a labourer or a self-employed person such as myself, who is eligible for the health services, and goes into hospital he is annoyed by questions about what he is earning, not when he is ill, but when he was well. There is no consideration given to the fact that he has no income when he is <Col N="839" /> ill, and in fact, may be unemployed. This is a completely wrong principle and the sooner the Minister does something about it the better.</P>
      <P>I must confess I am disappointed that the Minister in his speech had no word whatever to say about the White Paper which was promised before Christmas.  In fact, in the Dáil the Minister said he was dreaming of this White Paper.  I gathered from that it would be a pleasant kind of thing which he intended to publish, even though a White Paper is a long way from the necessary legislation and the reorganisation of the health services. The Minister had no word at all about this White Paper.  This has been going on for far too long.</P>
      <P>The Minister's predecessor was not satisfied with the health services.  It was some concession on his part that the health services were not all they should be.  A Select Committee was established by the Dáil to inquire into the health services but nothing at all was done and no report was made by the Minister.  A proposal was made by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins to the Committee but before they got time to consider it, the Committee wound up for one reason or another.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Bill contains the limitations of £1,200 per annum and the £60 valuation.  When people are sick in hospital, they cannot understand when almoners and nurses come around prying into their private affairs.  They inquire from a woman what is her husband's income.  When people are ill, they should not be concerned with that kind of thing.  They should be concerned only with getting better.  It is most regrettable that our health services are based on that kind of annoyance to people who are sick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has ever been very ill.  If he has, he would know that women who are ill are not in the mood to have people coming around checking on what her husband is doing, what his income is, how many children are earning, what are their ages and things of that kind. That is what is being continued in this Bill.  The average person who has not <Col N="840" /> been in hospital becomes very shocked when he has to go into hospital.  He finds that what he has to pay is based on whatever rates, not exceeding 10/-per day, the county manager decides. It seems to me to be a hopeless way of financing the health services to say that when you are ill and have no income, a calculation is made, and you are asked to pay perhaps 10/- a day.  That is a hopeless system, and the sooner it is got away from the better. It seems to me that the only way that system can be got away from is by having a system based upon some form of insurance, under which you pay for when you are ill when you are earning, not when you are not earning.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us&mdash;and I welcome it&mdash;that this measure will bring the number of persons within the scope of the Health Acts from 80 per cent of the population to 90 per cent.  That is all right from the point of view of the health services, and from the point of view of the people who will benefit from them, but we must also consider &mdash;and I do not know what view or what information the Minister will have on this&mdash;what effect it will have upon the rates.  When we talk about the rates, we should remember that, unlike income tax or any other tax related to income and earning capacity, the rates hit people irrespective of their income. There may be the case of a widow with a house valued at £20 in the suburbs, who is now supporting seven or eight children on a small income, and she pays exactly the same amount of rates as her next door neighbour with an income of £1,500 a year.  Every increase in rates imposed upon a person like her is an additional and unbearable burden, and she cannot get rid of it.  If she does not pay, the sheriff will be in on her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were an insurance scheme, she is the kind of person who would not be called upon to pay any insurance.  That could be decided beforehand.  This is the kind of thing that is increasing the rates, and the sooner it is taken off the rates, the better it will be for that kind of person, <Col N="841" /> and for the old age pensioners and people in those categories.  The value of an insurance scheme is that these matters are dealt with beforehand, and those who cannot pay anything will be automatically insured and be within the scheme.  Our health services being such as they are&mdash;and apparently as they are likely to continue for some time&mdash;I should like the Minister to direct his mind towards making some improvements in the existing services within the limitations imposed by law.</P>
      <P>One constantly regrets the interminable delays which unfortunate people who have to attend outpatients' departments have to undergo.  There seems to be no reason, financial or otherwise, why people who have to attend outpatients' departments should not attend at different hours.  I have had the experience of attending at one of the children's hospitals in Dublin, and I know that if you are not in by 9 o'clock, you can stay out.  Everyone must be in by 9 o'clock, and inevitably some people will not be reached until 1 o'clock.  I can see no reason why a busy housewife who has to attend to her household duties, to get dinner for her husband, or be home to collect the other young children, must be in the outpatients' department at 9 o'clock and sit there hour after hour until 1 o'clock.  This involves no cost, and the Minister should take it up with the hospitals concerned.  The same thing applies to X-ray departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often felt a great deal of sympathy for these people.  I have had the experience of attending the outpatients' department of a children's hospital and I thought it was quite absurd that people should have to sit in those places.  I would not mind if the places where these people have to sit were comfortable&mdash;and this applies not only to the children's hospitals but to the general hospitals also&mdash;but they are supplied with straightbacked chairs, and they are asked to sit on them for three or four hours.  These people are ill.  It is time we woke up and had some regard to the fact that people who are ill are entitled to more consideration than being asked to sit on the straightbacked, hardbottomed chairs which are to be found in the <Col N="842" /> outpatients' departments of quite a number of our hospitals.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of criticism and agitation in one of the Sunday papers about our ambulance services. It is all very well for the county managers who are the judges in their own cause to say that they have investigated all the complaints, and everything is in order.  The truth is that our health services, in my experience, do not provide proper ambulance services.  I once sent for an ambulance for an unfortunate person who was involved in a motor accident in one of the suburbs.  The ambulance came to the area but the people in it did not know the road.  That was partly the responsibility of the local authority who had not put a name on the road, and partly the responsibility of the ambulance service whose business it should be to know precisely where the roads are, and to have them marked on a map.  It is altogether too regrettable that people who are injured, and in urgent need of being brought to hospital, should be placed in that position. To my mind, that is a matter which calls for organisation and for the proper use of the resources we have.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not going beyond the scope of the Bill, but I should like to say that in legislation of this kind something ought to be done to provide the necessary money to inaugurate some kind of a crash course in firstaid treatment for people involved in road accidents.  I read recently that a great number of people who die while being brought to hospital die from suffocation, perhaps due to the way they are put into a car.  Whatever the cause, if some fundamental rules were known to people who want to help in the case of accidents, perhaps these deaths could be avoided.  I appeal to the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Local Government and the Road Safety Organisation, to institute some kind of crash course&mdash; if I may use that expression&mdash;in first-aid treatment for victims of road accidents.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I think cries out for attention.  In my experience, there is far too little communication <Col N="843" /> between the hospital authorities and the next-of-kin of patients.  My experience is&mdash;I do not know whether it is shared by other Senators&mdash;that country people very often are diffident about asking nurses or doctors or matrons what progress their next-of-kin is making, and my experience is that a lot of people just do not know what is wrong with their relatives.  When they ask, they are given very little information and are left in a state of doubt and anxiety. They get a reply from the nurse which is as vague as the nurse thinks suitable to give, a nurse who, perhaps, has not sufficient authority to communicate to the relatives the condition of the patient.  You have unfortunate people in the country ringing up the county hospital to find out how the patient is and told that he is doing nicely today, or is as comfortable as can be expected, or doing as well as can be expected. These unfortunate people may have travelled two or three miles, perhaps on a bicycle, to the local post office and this is the only information they can get.</P>
    <P>I heard of a case recently of a child of two or three years of age who was in a hospital in Dublin, which I do not wish to identify, and the only information the parents ever got concerning the child's progress was what they could get from people who went in to see the child.  If a person hands over the custody of a child to a hospital, there should be somebody there who will write to the parents once a week or once a fortnight, or perhaps once a month&mdash;this particular child was in hospital for months&mdash;to say how the child is progressing.  If we are paying millions of pounds per annum from public funds, and people are paying 10/- a day, we are entitled to much better services than those being provided.  Once inside the hospital doors, people do not become prisoners in a concentration camp.  They are people whose next-of-kin, whether a husband or wife, or a father or mother, are entitled to know what is going on and to know that with as much precision as possible.  Now that apparently he Minister for some time to come <Col N="844" /> will not have enough money to inaugurate the type of amendment and improvement that he would wish in our health services, this is the kind of thing that I should like to see tackled.  I should like to see this kind of thing being done as a prelude to the better things which we hope will come at some stage.</P>
    <P>The people who are being brought in under this Bill will of course be liable to pay hospital maintenance up to a maximum of 10/- per day.  As I say, it is an utterly hopeless situation that when people are sick, that is the time they are called upon to make these payments.  I am particularly concerned about people in mental hospitals, the people we were dealing with on the Electoral Bill.  In my experience, these people are liable to pay some proportion of the 10/- per day for maintenance, which I think is an extremely heavy impost when taken over a whole year or over a period of years.  The health authorities, certainly in the case of patients who are wards of court, never determine the amount to be charged until the patient is dead and then automatically the full 10/- is charged and the whole lot comes out of the estate.  I venture to suggest that that is not the law.  The law requires that the rate be charged from day to day.  The local authority, when the patient goes into hospital, should make inquiries as to his means and then fix the amount.  Having done that, that is the amount the patient is liable to pay, in the same way as if the patient in the mental hospital were a patient in the county hospital.  There should be no distinction between the two types of patient.</P>
    <P>In the case of patients who are wards of court, they have a committee to argue and if a charge of 10/- per day is made, they can say that that is impossible as the patient has only such and such property and that such a sum is all the patient should be liable to pay.  In the same way the person going into an ordinary surgical hospital can get a Deputy or a county councillor to make representations to the hospital authorities, very often with success, to reduce an unwarranted charge.  The same should be done in relation to mental hospital <Col N="845" /> patients but that is not what is being done.  I have never heard of a case where, when the patient has died, the charge has been less than 10/- a day. That is quite unfair to the patient's next-of-kin.  The law as it stands requires the health authorities to measure the proportion of 10/- which the health service recipient, whether in a mental hospital or an ordinary medical hospital, is able to pay and that charge is payable from day to day.  This is something which the Minister by an administrative act should correct and he should take up this matter with the health authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated in this Bill that the means of an unmarried son or daughter resident in a household are not to be taken into account in computing the sum up to £1,200.  I agree entirely with that.  The Minister is quite right when he says that, for good reasons or bad reasons, there are quite a number of sons or daughters who do not make any contribution and who sometimes are not in a position to make a contribution&mdash;they may perhaps be engaged in a business venture &mdash;and it is far better in the case of the husband and wife that the contributions of unmarried sons and daughters should not be taken into account.</P>
    <P>A matter which has always aroused my interest is the position of the wife of an old age pensioner living with a married son.  This matter was raised in the Dáil with the Minister, I gathered from the newspapers, but I did not observe what reply was given.  I do not know whether this particular problem was raised but in relation to the medical card to which these people would be entitled in the ordinary course of events under this Bill, I wonder whether or not the wife of an old age pensioner living on a farm which is within the £60 rateable valuation is automatically entitled to a medical card.  It seems to me that such a person should be considered.  Very often in the case of a young married couple, who have their own difficulties and responsibilities&mdash;and the Minister by increasing the limit from £50 to £60 recognises what is happening to the incomes on farms&mdash;and who are looking <Col N="846" /> after a mother and a father, who might be entitled to the old age pension, it seems to me that this is one of the reliefs that would make for the elimination of a cause of friction.</P>
    <P>If the old couple in the case I mention had free medical services, it would mean that very often the straw that breaks the camel's back would be removed because often such old people will require regular domiciliary attention by the dispensary doctor and having to pay out that money could constitute the straw that breaks the camel's back.  It seems to me that this would eliminate a cause of friction between old people and in-laws if it were quite clear that the wife of the old age pensioner and the old age pensioner himself were entitled to medical cards.</P>
    <P>With regard to the objection made by the Medical Association to the proposed increase, I have a good deal of sympathy with the position of people who are constantly giving free services to the public in the course of earning their ordinary livelihood.  There are only two sets of people I know of in this country who in the ordinary course of their daily business are constantly giving free services to the people.  They are the doctors and, whether you believe it or not, the lawyers.</P>

      <P>I just wanted to clear my interest.  I have a fellow-feeling with doctors in the habit of giving free service to the public when they find themselves in this position. What interests me enormously is how the average price of a hospital bed in a public ward has risen from £6 6s. in 1961 to £17 10s.  I have no doubt that £17 10s. is a correct figure.  Those of us who are members of the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme are aware that the premiums have been raised because of the increase in the cost of hospital maintenance.  Perhaps the Minister might indicate how this has happened.  I hope, if the medical profession suffer financially from the proposals contained in the Bill, they will be given some compensation by way of adjustment of their remuneration from public funds.  I do not know whether the Minister can indicate at this stage whether he has indicated to the Medical Association how that will be done.</P>

      <P>On the whole, I must agree with the content of subsection (3) under which the Minister will now consider only the income of the husband and spouse, not taking into account the income of sons and daughters living with them.  However, I think county councillors may be complaining the other way.  We have had many complaints about young people living in a house whose income is taken into account.  At the same time, we must think of this from the point of view of the ratepayers.  You could have a council house with three or four sons and daughters bringing in £10 a week each.  I have heard of a case where £70 a week was going into a council house.  Now, apparently, the father and mother will be entitled to treatment at the lower income group rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amending Bill will gradually bring us nearer a comprehensive health service.  I am not quite sure, however, it is going to be a final answer to the health controversy.  Subsection (2) of section 1 deals with a subject I have <Col N="848" /> spoken about elsewhere.  I do not know how a valuation of £50 can be equated with an income of £800.  But now we come to the present figures and get a figure of £1,200 income&mdash;an increase of £400&mdash;equated with an increase of £10 in valuation.  I fail to see where any statistics could be obtained to substantiate that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>Or any other way.  The difference between the income of a farmer of £50 valuation and £60 valuation is supposed to be £400.  I do not think any figures we have could possibly substantiate that.  I would point out to the Minister that £60 valuation represents an enormous difference in income in different parts of the country.  Figures were given in the National Farm Survey a few years back.  At that time the difference between the family farm income of the 30 to 50 acre farm in the southern area and in the north and north-west was £230.  The figure for the southern area&mdash;Munster, and the better lands down there&mdash;was an average income of £570, while in the northern area it was £338.  In the 50 to 100 acre farm category, there was a difference of £270 between the southern area and the northern and north-western areas.  That is a matter that should be taken into account when dealing with the income of farmers in regard to paying hospital bills and so on.  It appears that the poorer the people, the more of them in the north and north-west have to pay more for hospital treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot expect the Minister to look into these points on this Bill, but I hope he will bear them in mind in relation to future Bills.  I would ask him particularly to consider this matter of equating £60 valuation with £1,200 income.  This is considering actual income only and not taking into account the number of hours worked. On that basis, it should be a great deal more.  In Cavan County Council, we estimated it should be £75 and £800, and that is a county council which is not 50 per cent farmers.  It is <Col N="849" /> a matter that should be examined more fully.  It is unfair treatment of farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>This appears to be a very simple and straightforward Bill and very praiseworthy in some ways. I must say I think the removal of married sons and daughters from the means test part is particularly good. As this Bill works in tandem with the Social Welfare Bill, I do not think there is any doubt about its going through.  Otherwise, we would have the injustice of two neighbours, both earning the same amount, one self-employed and one employed, one of whom would be able to get free treatment and the other unable to get it, so I do not think there is any doubt about its going through; but, on the other hand, it must be thought about a bit because, under this present scheme, we shall have 93 per cent of the population of Ireland under a State medical service and this perhaps is very close to the percentage in England who use the English health services.  Therefore, we are entering an era of complete socialised medicine, one might say, because the remaining seven per cent are unlikely, in any event, to use it.  Furthermore, not only are we entering this era but we are attempting to do it on the present medical framework.  This is the point that worries me.</P>
      <P>There are some questions which we shall have to think about.  The first question we must ask ourselves is whether the country needs it and wants it.  If we want socialised medicine, is this the kind of medical service we want?  Is this framework good enough or will this Bill look better on paper than in practice?  Lastly, we must ask ourselves if this framework is sufficiently good to take another 200,000 people.  I think this latter question is the important one because there is no use in building on an insecure foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present moment, we are spending 2.9 per cent of our gross national product on health.  Since 1953, no other country in Western Europe has been spending less than 3.6 per cent.  We are spending £27 million and, <Col N="850" /> on this calculation, it looks as if we should be somewhere around £35 million at the least.  I do not think we are that smart in this country that we can be saving that amount of money and doing a good job.  Are there any comparisons nearer home that would bring this out?</P>
    <P>The hospital service in Northern Ireland is spending £19½ million on 1.4 million people whereas we are spending £19 million&mdash;a shade less&mdash;on 2.8 million people.  So, on that count, we are spending a little less for twice as many people.  Now, this may not be a true comparison because nobody is quite sure of the Imperial contribution to Northern Ireland and how much the subsidy there is.  Let us take Scotland, where conditions are very similar to those in Ireland.  They are spending £73 million each year on their hospital services for 5 million people.  Even allowing, at the present moment, for only 86 per cent under State benefit, it looks, once again, as if we should be spending around £35 million a year on our hospitals.  So, on a comparison with other countries, it looks as if we shall have to accept that a lot more money must be contributed to be used on health purposes.</P>
    <P>But even this is not the key point. How do we fare with this distribution? This Bill deals with specialist services and, in this country, if one excludes the 1,800 medical and surgical beds in the district hospitals which give competent but not specialist medical services, we have approximately 7,300 beds devoted to acute medical and surgical cases of a specialist type.  Of these, 3,800 are in the voluntary hospitals and the remainder under the local authorities.  So it will be seen that we have, give and take, roughly half and half because some hospitals seem to be under almost a mixed type of control.</P>
    <P>The voluntary hospitals are almost entirely confined to Dublin, Cork and Limerick and these are looking after 1¼ million people in their areas&mdash;so they have approximately half again of the population to deal with.  But, in 1963, which is the last year for which I can get accurate figures, 45,000 people came in from outside these <Col N="851" /> counties as patients to the voluntary hospitals in these counties.  That means that 45,000, out of a total of 130,000 patients, were dealt with by these voluntary hospitals so that one patient in three in the voluntary hospitals in Dublin, Cork and Limerick came from outside the borders of these counties. Now, they had plenty to look after already in their own areas so what I really mean is that I do not think any patients came in because of overcrowding in the local authority hospitals in the other counties.</P>
    <P>Some small percentage may have been sent up as requiring super-specialist care but it boils down to the fact that the 45,000 people were sent to the voluntary hospitals, either because they or their doctors thought that the care they received in the local authority hospital was not adequate or else because treatment in the local authority hospital had failed.  This is worrying and it gets more worrying when we consider that seven years earlier there were 13,000 fewer cases coming into the voluntary hospitals. In the years 1958 to 1963, more patients than ever were coming away from the local authority hospitals into the voluntary hospitals.  I feel that the Minister will not know that the local authority hospitals are reaching an adequate standard of treatment unless and until that tendency is reversed.</P>
    <P>If we look at some of the statistics concerning local authority hospitals, we come across some things that are rather disturbing.  I have a note of some of them here.  We see that Mayo has a population of 123,000 people and has specialist surgical and medical beds to the number of 135.  Monaghan, with 47,000 people, has specialist surgical and medical beds to the number of 151.  Tipperary, with a population of 109,000 people, has 266 beds in the same category and Waterford, with 28,000 people, has 282 such beds. Therefore, we have Mayo with roughly one bed per 1,000 of the population while Waterford has one bed per 100 of the population and we cannot even credit Waterford with draining the neighbouring counties <Col N="852" /> because Kilkenny, Wexford and Cork have very good services of their own.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there are two counties without county surgeons, three counties without county physicians, four counties without radiologists and I cannot trace more than two full-time paediatricians under local authority employment in the whole country and, as members of the Seanad know, Ireland has a very high child population. Over and above that, there is quite a shortage of ancillary medical staff at the house officer and registrar levels in the local authority hospitals. This is a very uneconomic state of affairs because county surgeons and county physicians are doing work that would normally be left to minor medical personnel and it is very much as if you employed a general manager and gave him the duties of the office boy.</P>
    <P>Therefore we suspect that the voluntary hospitals are carrying a very big load.  I went into this and I have taken North Dublin to illustrate it because it is the area I know best, but I can assure the Seanad that pretty much the same conditions exist everywhere. In North Dublin, there are three general voluntary hospitals, one children's hospital and one maternity hospital.  In the three general voluntary hospitals 11 beds have been added between 1958 and 1963.  At the same time, we have very big housing schemes opening up in Finglas, a huge one in Coolock and Ballymun on its way.  If this Bill becomes law, as I know it will, we will have a further 25,000 potential patients coming into this area. What will be the result of this?  The result is indicated by the fact that the out-patients of these three general hospitals the outpatients' session of the years 1958 and 1963.  In one of them alone, it increased by 15,000 in 1964 and the 1965 figures look like going up correspondingly.  It is just not possible to cope with these numbers.</P>
    <P>At the present moment in these hospitals the out-patients' session of three and a half hours may cover up to 80 patients, all of whom, under the terms of the Act, are entitled to see the consultant.  More than that, it is the Minister's wish and the consultants <Col N="853" /> agree, that these patients should not only be treated well but courteously and kindly.  Senator O'Quigley was looking for an appointments system. We have this in operation but it does not work out that way.  You cannot say to a patient: &ldquo;Come in at 9.03&rdquo; or &ldquo;You must come in at 9.06&rdquo;, because at the present moment these are the figures we are trying to cope with.  After allowing for four new patients per session, the average for a three and a half hour session should be 18 to 20 patients.</P>
    <P>Now on the in-patient side, it is pretty grim as well.  These three general hospitals turned over 2,000 more cases in 1963 than in 1958.  The numbers are still increasing.  Their bed occupancy increased to 91 per cent of the available beds and this is rather above the level recommended in the USA.  In concrete terms, this can mean there might be a two-year wait for a tonsillectomy, one year for a squint operation and a two-year wait for a gynaecological operation.  If the condition becomes acute, this could always be hurried and the patient can be got in, but we have no means of knowing how many cases of children awaiting a tonsils operation develop rheumatic fever during this waiting period and whether any heart damage can be attributed to it.  Nor does the fact that a gynaecological operation is not a lifesaving procedure mean that someone will not have any difficulty waiting for her turn to come. We have operating theatres built 25 years ago which coped with 1,000 patients in 1955 and which in 1965 had to cope with 4,500 patients.  I might mention in passing that there is a maternity hospital in Dublin whose bed occupancy runs at 108 per cent, that is, 14 or 15 stretcher beds every night to cope with the situation.</P>
    <P>It is a rather frightening set of figures which does, I assure you, make for bad medicine, for a considerable amount of diagnostic error and not the best type of treatment one could wish for.  One of the problems of this country is that Ireland has on paper a very high percentage of hospital beds. This gives a rather wrong impression. A hospital bed which is occupied by a chronically ill geriatric patient is of <Col N="854" /> no use for the acute medical or surgical case.  Equally so a bed which is empty is no good unless there is adequate medical and para-medical services to back it up.  It is indeed rather worrying, and I speak for my profession at the present moment, as we are wondering where we are going from here.  I realise, as does every doctor, the difficulties of dealing with the medical profession and services.  I know the Department of Health has many factors to deal with: there is the public; there are the doctors, there is the matter of finance; and there are small groups who ride hobby horses&mdash;they are rather vested interests.  All these lead to a system for which nobody really is to be blamed but it can go a little off the right track.  The present worry is where are we going to put these 200,000 people, where are we making provision for them and where are we making provision financially to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Because of the value of money decreasing and the increasing cost of hospitalisation, something will have to be done but I do not think we are going the right way about it.  Is it possible to improve these services?  I think it is.  I think it is perhaps easier to improve the local authority hospital services than the voluntary hospital services because they are more unified and easier to deal with.  A number of very highly qualified specialists have come home over the past few years from abroad and have taken up appointments here.  Initially, they took up these appointments at very low salaries but their salaries have been revised since then as a result of an agreement negotiated, and their new salaries are much more in keeping with their positions. But one snag is that they come back from where they have been working, in high-class units, and suddenly discover that they have not got all the facilities they need or the facilities they are used to and in some ways they feel like fish out of water trying to do a lot of small jobs with deficiencies in medical staff, equipment, diagnostic facilities, and, in general, without most of those components which go to make up a highly efficient unit.  I think this could be helped relatively easily.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> Recently a very worrying case came to my notice.  In fact it was only a few days ago.  It concerned a young man who came back from England to take up a job as an assistant pathologist in a local authority hospital.  He was very highly qualified, holding his M.D., M.Sc., and M.D. in pathology.  He and his family were anxious to come back to Ireland to live and, consequently, he took the position at a salary of £1,600, rising to £1,800.  Even though this salary was less than could be paid to a registrar in Ireland after four years' experience, he relinquished a consultant's post in England which was bringing him in £2,900 per year. A condition of his employment was that if he got a job in a nearby university, his salary scale could be from £2,000 to £2,200.  He was appointed to the university&mdash;indeed, they were very glad to get him&mdash;and he has now been made a statutory lecturer.</P>
    <P>When he was first appointed, he received a salary of £730 per annum, whereupon the county council abated his hospital salary, so that the total salary was £2,000.  That was fair enough because they were losing his services for a certain amount of time each day.  The next thing that happened was the university raised his salary to £970, whereupon the county council abated his salary again so that it was again reduced to their standards.  Now, no more time than before was taken from the county council and it seems difficult to believe that this should warrant a further abatement.  Now it has reached the stage when the university is only too anxious to pay him a full lecturer's salary but sees no purpose in so doing as it would mean further abatements. This certainly does not make for good relationships.</P>
    <P>With the voluntary hospitals, the story is quite different and it may be a very much more difficult situation. Unfortunately, previous Ministers for Health never permitted themselves to realise that this country is dependent on the voluntary hospitals as the backbone of its specialist services.  The policy, therefore, has always been to build up other units.  The policy in fact has always been to build up local authority <Col N="856" /> units.  I do not think this is wrong; I think the idea was understandable. They were building up their own units under their own control and they hoped to make these very good and important units.  In some cases they have succeeded and there are some such very important units throughout the country but the trouble is that in most cases the same factors that I have already mentioned have upset the units &mdash;they could not get co-operation with staff such as teaching staff and university staff and they could not get what is necessary to make a unit really great. Many of these units never really paid off in the terms they were designed for and for which everybody gave them full credit.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, this trend to build up these good departmental units had the effect that the voluntary hospitals gradually began to be treated like poor relations.  A teaching hospital I know has in the last five years put out £100,000 on units it thought necessary and which have since worked up and become very important.  This £100,000 was collected in shillings throughout Ireland.  I know that these voluntary hospitals are difficult; they are independent, sort of irresponsible and hard to control but nevertheless these are the factors that have kept them important. It is in these that the tradition is that the patient is more important than rules and regulations and consequently they have always done their best by the patients.</P>
    <P>Really, they must get more support and there must be a different orientation in future towards the relative places of voluntary hospitals and local hospitals.  It is quite a tragedy so far as medical students are concerned&mdash; and these are the important people of the future&mdash;that neither the Department of Health, the universities nor the Department of Education will accept responsibility for their teaching and recreational facilities in a teaching hospital.  None of these bodies will accept responsibility and who is to do so? The voluntary hospitals of this country have a great tradition.  Originally, they were charitable institutions and the doctors there gave their services free <Col N="857" /> and in return they got experience and a connection which afterwards gave them paying patients.  You treated rich and poor, paying and free, and you averaged out.  This freely-given voluntary service plays an important part in present problems.  The implementation of the Health Act in 1956 changed all that.  Many patients who by those standards could pay were then made free and were in the 86 per cent who were taken into the State scheme.  At that time the Minister said that because of a possible loss of income to the doctors he was prepared to pay compensation and amounts were fixed for intern and extern patients and, in almost the same words the present Minister used, the consultants were told that the Minister did not think they would be out of pocket but if they were adjustments would be made in the future and frequent consultations would be held and furthermore no change would be made in the level at which free hospital service would be available to the population without full discussion with the IMA.</P>
    <P>This story did not work out so well. Frictions developed; frequent consultations were not held and the adjustments were minimal.  In the whole ten years with the cost of in-patients rising from four guineas to about £17 10s the consultants got an extra 2/4d per day per patient.  As late as last night Dublin Corporation were trying to work out their new rate and told that £330,000 was the increase due to health.  Of course, under this new rise which we got recently about £30,000 will go to the consultants and of that only £20,000 will be paid by Dublin Corporation; the remainder is coming from corporations and county councils throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The real snag in the system, however, is that consultants were put on a scheme whereby they were getting compensation and not salary and this means no pension rights, no holiday pay, no sick pay, no study leave pay, no cost of living rises and nothing like that.  In 1956 the situation was very critical.  There were then only 400,000 people left in the country to provide patients who would maintain <Col N="858" /> the consultant services.  A very wonderful organisation started, the Voluntary Health Insurance, and this literally came to the rescue.  It spread the load and over the years provided the increases necessary truly to compensate the consultants for their low incomes under the Health Acts.  The Minister was literally steeped in luck.  He had 400,000 people who, under the Voluntary Health Scheme, kept the corps of consultants going so that these consultants could keep the Health Act going and further keep it going and be paid cheaply for it.  In actual fact, the present payment is about 25 per cent of what consultants get in similar conditions in England.  Can I drive this point home by saying that in 1963, the entire corps of consultants attached to the voluntary general hospitals in this country looked after 3,800 beds for seven days and nights every week of the year for a little more than twice the total yearly remuneration of Senators?</P>
    <P>But the balance was very tight and as the load in the voluntary hospitals increased, a peculiar situation arose which I would like to illustrate for you.  I asked two surgeons of about 40 years of age, one in each of the two main voluntary hospitals in Dublin what income they were getting from the public services and how much time they were spending on this work. I picked surgeons because they are the better paid.  In each case, the figure was around £1,000 per year and the work was about 30 hours a week.  Now, at the present moment £1,000 per year would not even pay for their consulting rooms and their secretary&mdash;so that these men having worked 30 hours a week have not even cleared their basic expenses and have literally not commenced to earn money for themselves and their dependants.</P>
    <P>Their car and phone, their rates and taxes, their postage and equipment expenses have all yet to be met and they have used up 30 hours of their working week.  It was self-evident that they could not spend any more time doing hospital work or dealing with this increasing load of patients.  Otherwise, they would be left without an adequate number of hours for private patients from whom they must earn <Col N="859" /> their living.  In fact, it would pay them better to give up their out-patients sessions and only a strong sense of duty compels them to continue.</P>
    <P>As far as inpatients are concerned, we are in a rather similar position.  The consultant staff of a hospital are paid by the number of beds occupied.  This means that you cannot increase the income of your hospital as long as the payment per patient per day remains the same.  Over the past ten years a line of new specialists has arisen.  A lot of bright young men have been away being trained.  These are brought back and we put them on our staffs. What happens?  The more you take on, the further the income must be divided and the less there is for each. Although there has been this increase of 2/4d per patient per day, the average income of consultants has increased, not to the estimated extent, but by very much less because of new young consultants taken on.</P>
    <P>The situation is aggravated by two factors.  First of all, one would have thought that these new consultants would take on extra outpatients' sessions and shed the load a little but this is not all the time possible because the health authorities are rather against new outpatients' sessions and have been tending to restrict them. There is a maternity hospital in Dublin which, for three years, has been looking for a psychiatric session because it maintains that the strains of pregnancy and the first few months after a birth are very likely to produce psychiatric trouble and, for this reason, the hospital felt that they needed one psychiatric session a week. So far, this has not been allowed.</P>
    <P>The other aggravating factor, which is an even more frustrating one, is that it is very annoying to be on an out-patients' session and, depending on the number of patients, getting perhaps a few shillings&mdash;perhaps 1/- to 5/&mdash;a patient and finding, when you get a patient coming to Dublin from, say, Kildare, that the Dublin Health Authority are getting £1 1s 0d for this patient and are paying the consultant who sees him only one-fourth or one-tenth <Col N="860" /> of the amount they are receiving in respect of the patient.  It is galling because you know that there are clinics operating in the city which are almost paying for themselves by reason of the number of patients coming from outside the county.</P>
    <P>We feel that there will have to be a revision of the present scheme.  As I said before, the voluntary hospitals are doing over 60 per cent of the specialist work in the country and over 90 per cent of the super-specialities.  They will have to be given a very considerate hand in every way.  Young consultants who have come back will have to be properly paid and not forced out into the realm of competitive practice at a stage when they are very active and very energetic and could spend a lot of time working in the hospitals, to the ultimate good of the public patients. The poor compensation for hospital work forces them out of the hospitals into competitive private practice.</P>
    <P>Our worry then is: is this new expansion really necessary?  That is the core of the Bill as before us.  There is no doubt that for persons up to £1,000 income per annum, it is necessary because of the devaluation of money. For persons whose incomes are from £1,000 to £1,200 help is also needed because the charge for hospital beds has gone up to £17 10s a week.  There is no doubt that persons on these incomes must have some help or they could not cope with these expenses. They had a very efficient organisation in the Voluntary Health Insurance, which was dealing very well with them. A married man with four or five children could for £16 a year completely cover the £17 10s per week in the hospital.  If looking for the lap of luxury, he could do it for £30 a year, which is roughly equivalent to the new social welfare contribution.</P>
    <P>There is, I admit, a group of people who are in a very bad way.  These are people with long-standing and recurrent illness, people above the age of 65, those who have had a lot of illness or who for one reason or another are uninsurable.  There is no doubt that these people need help. They are caught.  They cannot pay for <Col N="861" /> Voluntary Health Insurance.  They cannot be accepted by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  These should be covered by the Minister's hardship clause.  Furthermore, this hardship clause should apply to a much higher income level than £1,200. Indeed, any person up to £2,000 a year should never have to pay out more than ten per cent of his yearly income on drugs, hospitalisation or doctors.  This clause should be applied.</P>
    <P>One of the snags in this hardship clause is&mdash;and I think the Minister is in equal difficulty about this&mdash;that it varies from county to county.  Even the assessment of 10/- a day seems to vary and it is not possible to get the tables on which the assessment is calculated or why the decisions are made.  There are some counties, I am afraid, where you would want to be on the ground on a stretcher before you would be a hardship case whereas other counties are very soft.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that none of the political Parties are approaching the Health Bill in the right way for the future.  That may sound very presumptuous but I do not think that we are a rich enough country to adopt a fully socialised medical service which would cost about £60 million.  This cannot be done. Furthermore, I feel that our present gently increasing socialisation is financially very attractive; you just creep into it; but, it is very dangerous &mdash;by its very economy it ultimately defeats its own purpose.  So you cannot live too cheaply either.  I feel convinced that a free service with compulsory insurance above a certain level, associated with State aid for those patients who are uninsurable by virtue of prolonged illness or age, must be the ideal.  It will spread the load.  It will not impose too much of a financial burden on the country but it will give adequate service.  It will also allow the State to step in in case of need. The hardship rules should be very definitely laid down in the form of a Bill and there should be no room for individual interpretation in different counties.</P>
    <P>We know this Bill will go through. Then 200,000 people will be removed from this group of 400,000 who are <Col N="862" /> maintaining the consultant corps in this country.  This leaves just seven per cent of the population to maintain the doctors who are going to look after the rest.  Even more frightening is the fact that the 200,000 who are being removed constitute the major portion of the contributors to the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme because it is reasonable to suppose that the more wealthy people will have least interest in taking out this insurance.  Therefore, the very organisation which has kept the ball rolling up to now will be put in a very unsound financial position.</P>
    <P>The Minister's hopes that some will carry on the voluntary health insurance as well as being in the social service scheme may not work out.  If my income were about £1,200 a year, I would think twice before I would pay the rates for the social service scheme and pay for voluntary health insurance at the same time. Farmers are forever grousing about the amounts they pay in rates for the roads.  If they get a bit of health treatment, they will be up like a shot; they will not join the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  I cannot see anything to compensate for the fact that the pool that supports the consultants will be reduced.  I would strongly appeal to the Minister, who is very energetic, to ensure that the State will grow up and regard itself as a business organisation. The time has passed when services like health and education can be run on a charitable basis.</P>

      <P>We can no longer go on depending on religious orders to subsidise our schools and hospitals and on the vocations of doctors, teachers and professional men to run them for a mere pittance, for smaller sums than they would normally command in the world outside.  Few people know that in this day and age a large number of nuns who run our voluntary hospitals, and who hold posts as executives, matrons, ward sisters, secretaries and technicians, never draw the full salaries to which they are entitled.  They take <Col N="863" /> a sum of only about £100 a year to keep them in food and clothing.  This represents a saving of some £25,000 to £30,000 annually to the State.  When, however, these orders apply for help in the building of theatres or new units I am afraid this saving is not very often taken into account.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister is very anxious to do his best.  I know he has the drive and energy to accomplish a great deal.  I know that the Irish Medical Association are very anxious to create an efficient and satisfactory health service.  I know they are anxious to play their part in doing that.  I also know that the Minister is willing to meet the Irish Medical Association at any time and I know that they are anxious to have discussions.  I should like to ask the Minister now to remember that the State as an employer, is subject to the same moral obligations as are other employers&mdash;the State even more so, perhaps, because it has recently been giving recommendations to other employers with a view to improving industrial relations.  Anything that smacks of a unilateral cancellation of agreements, anything that shows a failure to discuss new projects with those who will implement them, is bad business.  It gives rise to a suspicion that all is not well with the project.  In any plan which calls for the co-operation of a body there must be a readiness to accept that the body has certain views, which may be worthwhile, even though the body may to some degree be trying to look after its own interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are very much at a crossroads in regard to health.  I do not think the path we are travelling at the moment is the right one.  A great deal of rethinking will have to be done.  We should not, I think, follow the path of our nearest neighbour.  We cannot afford a scheme which has proved so very wasteful and which has been only partly efficient.  I refer to the health scheme in Britain.  A combination of free health services for the lower income groups with a compulsory insurance helped out, where necessary, by the State, for our better off citizens <Col N="864" /> seems to me to be the most likely ground work for an efficient health service.  It is one which would not cost too much and it would spread the load satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>I agree with one point Senator O'Quigley made, that is, that public relations in the hospitals could be improved.  We are, I think, all agreed on that.  He was on sound ground there, but otherwise, I think he was travelling in reverse.  This is a very dangerous thing to do, even within the precincts of this House.  It seemed to me that, on the case he made, the answer was a comprehensive medical scheme, but, as it turned out, the arguments he had been putting seemed to him to lead to a less comprehensive scheme than the present one.  He talked about the unpleasantness, for instance, of prying into incomes and so on.  This is only necessary, of course, because we have a means test, and there is no question that a great amount&mdash;I should not like to guess what proportion, but the Minister may be able to&mdash;of the administrative cost of working our present scheme resides in trying to find out the means of the patient.  I remember at one time &mdash;I do not know how many questions there are now on the questionnaire&mdash; that before they got the benefit of the scheme, over half the questions asked of patients dealt with their income and not their malady.  I suggest that a great deal of the administrative cost in the application of our present scheme derives from the retention of a means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="865" /> Senator O'Quigley talked, too, about the widow, etc., who would apparently not be included in his insurance scheme, or would not be asked to pay, unless she wished to; but she, too, would be subject to a means test presumably, because there are wealthy widows as well as poor ones.  Therefore, I feel, the retention of the means test is a bad thing and I am glad to see that the Minister is in this Bill moving towards a more fully comprehensive scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator Cole dwelt on valuation and so on.  Quite clearly this whole question would be greatly simplified if we had a comprehensive scheme.  I remember Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, when he was Minister for Health, introducing his Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme, and he boasted that only one-sixth of the population was left uncovered, which meant that the scheme then covered about 83 per cent.  He claimed that we Irish are rugged individualists and love paying medical bills, and that more than 17 per cent, therefore, would feel aggrieved if brought in.  I am glad the present Minister does not suffer from that superstition and has gone beyond the 90 per cent mark.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to Senator Alton's excellent speech.  He made a balanced critique of the situation.  He mentioned the fact that there has been a great increase in the number of patients. I think the reason should be pointed out: in the past five, six or ten years, perhaps, it has been financially easier for the average patient to get access to the necessary medical attention. The number of cases has, therefore, increased.</P>
    <P>The Minister is fully aware of the fact that the answer to most of our problems is finance.  He is also, I think, fully capable of fighting for the finance he requires.  Senator Alton made the point, very judiciously, I think, and well.  I think, however, he is a bit afraid of free medical services. Now I do not think they should be referred to as such.  If you have a State comprehensive scheme, the services are, in fact, paid for by the community according to the community's capacity to pay, and they are placed at the disposal <Col N="866" /> of patients according to their medical needs.  This is in fact a principle applied by the vast majority of private doctors to their patients.  They treat them according to their needs and they charge them according to their capacity to pay.  That is an excellent socialist principle: from each according to his capacity, to each according to his need.</P>
    <P>What about the consultants then whom Senator Alton mentioned?  It is easy to make fun of consultants.  Some are doing very well.  I feel that their trade union is as strong as any other, and I am sure they would be well able to fight their corner.  We should not forget that the consultant's connection with a hospital is part of his prestige and part even of his sales value in the market.  The fact that he is attached to a hospital is certainly part of his sales value.  If he gains less from his hospital work, as is quite possible under the present system, than might theoretically be his due, I do not think very many could, if one applied a means test to them, prove that they were actually suffering from hardship. What is required, in my opinion, is more money equitably applied.  The Minister is moving now in the right direction towards a full, comprehensive scheme.  This Bill constitutes a big advance towards that happy state.  It is a step forward towards that particular goal, and I say to the Minister: good work, keep it up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Bill the Minister has made very far-reaching changes, much more far-reaching than would appear at first glance.  All members of the agricultural community will, when this Bill comes into force, if their poor law valuation does not exceed £60, be entitled to free institutional treatment both in the ordinary hospitals and in mental homes, free specialist services, free maternity medical attention and free children care.  In my view, that would cover approximately 90 per cent of the agricultural community. Already everyone engaged in manual labour, irrespective of his income, is entitled, free of charge, to those services. <Col N="867" /> Under the Bill, by reason of the new social service scheme, all persons engaged in non-manual labour whose income does not exceed £1,200 will be affected, as also will all self-employed people whose income does not exceed £1,200.</P>
      <P>In introducing the provision that the incomes of children living in the house will not be added to the incomes of the parents, the Minister has very much extended the scope of free medical services.  Heretofore, if, for example, a clerk, married, earning £700 had with him a son or daughter who was earning £300 or £400, he was not entitled to the free institutional and specialist services now provided.</P>
      <P>Senator Alton explained the services which are being given to this country by the voluntary hospitals and by specialists attending those voluntary hospitals.  The religious orders running those hospitals are entitled to the greatest credit.  To them nursing is not a service but a vocation.  To many of the specialists attending those hospitals also their work is a vocation. They work with their heads and their hearts but primarily with their hearts. The Minister, therefore, was faced with finding a happy medium whereby he could give to the country a medical service which, on the one hand, would not entail a severe impost on anyone who was ill and, on the other hand, would reasonably meet the views of the medical profession.  He has told us of his interview with the Irish Medical Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley indicated that the Bill should go much further and that it should include everybody, irrespective of income and irrespective of poor law valuation.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington said likewise.  I believe that the Minister's approach of in-between is by far the most satisfactory one.  However, it may impose a very big burden on the rates.  At present 50 per cent of the health services are paid out of the rates.  The people for whom I have most sympathy in the payment of those rates are not the agricultural community, because already they have various <Col N="868" /> allowances, various credits, not the wealthy businesses and factories, because they get back practically 50 per cent of what they pay in rates by way of allowances in income tax&mdash; their rates go down as the business expands; between income tax and corporation tax they are re-allowed 9/4d. in the £.  The persons for whom I have the greatest sympathy if their rates are to be increased by reason of extra medical services are the ordinary middle income groups in our villages and towns and cities.</P>
    <P>As Senator Alton pointed out, this Bill brings into the category of free institutional and specialist services approximately 200,000 of our population. I realise from statements the Minister made in the Dáil, and repeatedly in the public Press, that this is only the first part of a much wider programme which, quite obviously, the Minister has in mind.  I can visualise that if 50 per cent of the extra increased expenditure has to be met by the ordinary ratepayers, the ordinary middle income group living in houses with poor law valuations of between £15 and £25, it will impose on them a burden which they will find very hard to meet.</P>
    <P>Many of those people who married eight, nine or ten years ago and built their houses, until now had the benefit of rate remission.  Many of them today are perhaps buying houses already built.  Not only will they have to pay the higher interest rates charged by building societies and county councils on loans for houses but if this Bill and these medical services mean a higher impost on the rates, they will have to meet these imposts.  I can sympathise with members of local authorities who will be faced with the task of collecting those rates.  If, however&mdash;I do not know how it will be possible&mdash;some method could be devised whereby these extra imposts because of medical services would not increase the rates, if the Minister, young, intelligent and enthusiastic, can persuade the Government to introduce some scheme, some method whereby he could marry his ideals in respect of improved medical services to some form of expenditure that would not increase the impost on <Col N="869" /> these people, then he would produce a child which all of us could take to our hearts.</P>
    <P>I realise that is a herculean task. Senator Alton pointed out the difficulties in no uncertain terms.  If the Minister could do this he would ensure to some extent that those middle income groups already paying voluntary health insurance will not, in addition, have to pay again in their rates the entire cost of the scheme.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he and the Government have anything in mind which will enable this to be done.  If he has, then he has produced a Bill we can all welcome with open arms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this Bill, which provides an improvement on existing services, is a stopgap measure, an extension of the existing services while we await comprehensive medical services.  I believe this is the last step towards the comprehensive medical services which have been pressed on the Minister and his Government for so long.  It is obvious this extension has become necessary because of the substantially increased cost of living and the drop in money values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One dramatic example has been the fact revealed by the Minister that one hospital which charged less than £7 per week only a few years ago now finds it necessary to charge £17 per week for the services provided.  It is obvious also that this extension of the health services will increase the rates by about 3/- in the £ all over the country.  Already the ratepayers are complaining about the heavy burden of the health services.  Health service charges are now the highest item chargeable on local rates, having displaced the road charges.  Three shillings in the £ is a very substantial increase for many people, particularly the farming community who already find it difficult to pay their rates.  We have seen rates agitation, we have heard farmers say they find it difficult to bear the burdens and we have had statistics comparing farmers' incomes with those of other sections of the community.  The painful part is that many of the people who pay very high <Col N="870" /> rates cannot benefit from the health services towards which they contribute so substantially.</P>
    <P>When the Minister announced some months ago that he proposed to publish a White Paper on health services, we believed it was the final move towards comprehensive health services.  The Minister said he was dreaming of a White Paper and it gladdened the hearts of people who felt the Minister had grasped the nettle and was dealing with the burning question of health services, a live issue at all times with not alone those who were paying for them but with those who expect to benefit under a health service scheme which they complained is piecemeal or lacking altogether at the moment.</P>
    <P>Whether this Bill extends the health services to an increased number of people, let us not forget that the charge of 10/- per day still remains.  The Minister knows that in many cases this charge of 10/- per day can cause great hardship.  The charge is applied after people have answered many questions in relation to means.  It is charged during the time a person is in hospital. He may come out to find he is unemployed, he will get a bill from the hospital and a letter later threatening action for the recovery of the charge of 10/- per day.  There is a lot to be said against application of the means test while a person is in hospital.</P>
    <P>In moving towards comprehensive medical services, the Minister will find it necessary to ensure that the conditions in which the dispensary services are being provided will be improved.  Any of us who has experience of the dispensary services knows how unfortunate people are crowded into cold rooms with bad atmospheres to sit on hard chairs until their turn comes.  They are people who are going there for some kind of medical treatment in the course of getting the medical services to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>With regard to hospital costs, I think the time has come when hospital costs should be broken down in order to see whether the very high cost of a bed at £17 per week could be reduced. I know that the average is somewhere about £15 or more.  It should be <Col N="871" /> possible, at this stage, to break down the cost of that bed, to put these costs and charges under the miscroscope, first of all, in order to assure the public that it is not possible to provide the services for less than £15 per bed per week and, secondly, with a view to co-ordinating and improving the services which go into the provision of this bed service in the form of medical treatment for people in hospital.  I know that, owing to the financial condition of the country at the present time, it is not possible for the Minister to implement a fully comprehensive medical service.  I feel that even at this stage he should set about planning it and publishing it.  If he publishes it a considerable time before it is implemented, he will have the benefit of the views of various organisations likely to be affected.  He will also have the benefit of advice in relation to the various services which will be operated and co-ordinated within the scheme.</P>
    <P>The day has come when the Minister should cease to look to the ratepayers to make such a substantial contribution towards the operation of this scheme.  He should find a scheme which will encourage people to value their health and make a contribution towards it, particularly in the days when they are enjoying good health. They should realise that they have a personal responsibility to themselves to ensure, by contributing during their days of good health, that, in the event of sudden illness or eventual bad health, they will have provided for themselves, instead of looking to one section or another of the community to do so.</P>
    <P>The costs at the moment are divided, first of all, amongst the ratepayers, and secondly, the taxpayers, and in some cases by contributions from their own pockets.  The citizens, in general, should be encouraged to contribute towards their own health services so far as they can.  A contributory scheme of one kind or another should be brought in.  I know that the Labour policy is to have this scheme financed from the Central Fund, probably from general taxation.  However, that might <Col N="872" /> not be a satisfactory way to finance our medical services in the long run.  It might be better to have some kind of contributory scheme which would make the citizens realise that they are making a contribution towards their own health services.  Nobody will dispute that, in these modern times, having regard to the high standard of living which people enjoy, and expect to enjoy, and having regard to the high standard of medical services which they also expect and demand, they should be encouraged to make a substantial contribution towards the services, in the ordinary way, while they can, and so far as they can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are deeply indebted in discussing this measure to Senator Alton for the very comprehensive survey he has given.  We all look forward to reading it in print and to seeing the difficulties of the medical profession as explained by one of their most eminent members.  It will do a good deal to clarify thinking on this issue.</P>
      <P>The difficulties in medicine are just like the difficulties in education and everywhere else.  They all seem to come back to more money.  We are acutely aware of the difficulties of producing comprehensive health services but we should at least try to make the best use we can of our available resources.  The Minister seems to be adopting the right approach in this matter in trying to get the best possible teamwork out of our existing system, combining the voluntary hospitals and the local authority hospitals.  Of course, that has to be the foundation because as a nation we owe a tremendous amount to voluntary effort and, in the medical field, to the work done by the voluntary hospitals. No tribute would be too great to pay to the self-sacrificing work they have done at all times for the sick. Any comprehensive system will have to be based firmly and squarely on a recognition of the vital and essential role of the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in this regard might look at some European practices where you have the parallel system, with the State doing some work, through its own organisations, and with voluntary <Col N="873" /> bodies doing like work in competition. You will find, especially in Holland, where that has been most successful, that the State is always very scrupulous in estimating the cost of doing a particular service through its own organition. The State is fair minded enough to pay others doing that job on that basis.  I know that, if that were put into practice here, the voluntary hospitals would certainly have their incomes quadrupled and quintupled if they were paid on the basis of what it costs the State to do the work.</P>
    <P>I believe any system will have to recognise the fact that the voluntary hospitals will have to get greater support than they have got in the past. Senator Alton mentioned the real problem about staff, their scarcity and so on.  We all recognise that but the Government must take a great deal of the blame for the way in which the medical schools have been left.  If we contrast the treatment given to the veterinary college for animals with that given to our medical schools, we find, in the current Estimates, on page 187, that the total provision for the training of veterinary surgeons in the Veterinary College is £102,000, in University College, Dublin, £102,000, and in Trinity College, £46,000, making a total of £250,000.  Speaking for the college which I know best, University College, Cork, I can say that on a grant which is only about ten per cent of that, we are expected to provide for six times the number of students in the Veterinary College.  In fact, out of our resources, we are expected to man a medical faculty that has a greater number than are at present in the Veterinary College; yet all we can afford to allocate from our resources to that is about one quarter of the total given for the training of veterinary surgeons.  In other words, it costs four times as much to train a veterinary surgeon as it does to train a medical doctor.  There is something wrong when we see those figures.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Senator Cole advert to the still highly exaggerated notion that prevails about what farmers can afford.  We find that a farmer with a £60 valuation is being equated in this Bill with a man with <Col N="874" /> an income of £1,200 per annum.  That is not a proper equation in any sense, because if you take the average gross output as somewhere in the region of £18 per acre of reasonably good land, the average type of land has a value of the order of £1 per acre.  So, taking the national figure, the output of a farm with a valuation of £60 certainly would not exceed £1,200 gross, and the amount which would remain with the farmer, on average, for all his labour on the 60 acres would be about 60 per cent, or £700.  That is the measure of his income, so obviously this is not giving fair play to the small farmer or the medium farmer, compared with the worker with a salary of £1,200.  In fact, to have £1,200 left for family income the farmer would need an income of at least £2,000 gross, and that would be very difficult to produce today on a valuation of £60.</P>
    <P>I was taken by the figure given by Senator Alton.  He said that 93 per cent of the population will now be brought within the ambit of the services provided, mainly free, by this Bill, leaving seven per cent to pay for their medical services and for specialist services.  This is an amazing burden on that seven per cent, and that seven per cent should be entitled at least to consideration for remission of income tax on medical bills over a certain amount, because £1,200 is not a princely salary today.  Many persons earning above that salary have to incur heavy medical bills which should be allowed for income tax.</P>
    <P>It seems that any service that will provide medical services on the scale regarded as necessary today will have to expect a contribution from the individual concerned.  I think we have gone too far with the idea of non-contributory services.  The people themselves would value the services much more, and be much more selective in their use, if they had to make a small contribution.  On the one hand, it would ease the burden on the rates and on the Exchequer, and on the other, would ensure that our medical practitioners are not called out unnecessarily. We must realise that we are a small country with financial difficulties <Col N="875" /> and with a relatively low national income, so, in planning for these services we must expect some contribution from individuals.</P>
    <P>I should like to say how gratified I am at the better relations that now prevail between the Minister and the Irish Medical Association.  We are all glad of that, and we may say that perhaps an engineer has brought conciliation and arbitration into what looked to be a very difficult field.  We wish the Minister well in his task, and we hope he will continue to expand the area of co-operation and consultation between the profession and himself and his Department.  If he does, the medical profession, like any other profession, will not be found wanting&mdash;when they are treated as they should be treated by a Minister who realises the dignity of the profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the improvement in this Bill. The increases in income and rateable valuation are welcome, but I agree with Senator Quinlan when he points out the injustice of equating a poor law valuation of £60 with an income of £1,200 per year, taking present farm prices into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many inadequacies in the present health services, and it is difficult to visualise a vast improvement in a small measure of this kind.  In our local authorities the greatest cause of discontent seems to be the allocation of medical cards.  It is extraordinary that the same Health Act can be interpreted in so many different ways as between one county and another. It is regrettable that while some families can apparently succeed in gaining registration on the general medical services register, we still find people, especially old age pensioners. without medical cards.  Amongst the older members of our community, we find people who have enjoyed a certain amount of independence all their lives, who very often deny themselves services to which they are entitled because they feel that if they applied for a medical card they would be turned down.  That is very wrong.  The <Col N="876" /> Minister should insist that the Health Act is administered uniformly in every county in the State.</P>
    <P>I should like to support Senator O'Quigley's plea that there should be an improvement in the system in regard to patients waiting at clinics and X-ray departments.  Surely it is unnecessary to expect people to be in at 9 o'clock or 10 o'clock in the morning and to wait for several hours for attention. Surely there could easily be some form of appointments system that would take some hours off the time some patients have to wait.  I find in my county, Laois, that patients who have to come in their own mode of conveyance are perhaps kept waiting for hours.  That may be all right for some but I think that with a little thought and a little bit of extra work, many of these difficulties could be ironed out. Our voluntary hospitals and the people working in them merit well-earned praise for the great work they have been doing down through the years and I feel that the State should be fairer to them.  In many parts of the country improvements are needed and the Department should lead the way in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister some time ago promised a White Paper on Health and all of us who are interested in this, such as members of county councils and those interested in health treatment generally, have been eagerly awaiting this White Paper.  We find that the cost of maintaining patients in extern hospitals, by the county councils, has been increasing every year for the past few years and it is now very expensive. There should be a more economic way of providing the specialist services we need and of making them available in the country.  There should be a better way of organising the transport of patients.  In by own county, which is pretty convenient to Dublin, the transport of patients cost up to £10,000 last year&mdash;an enormous sum for a comparatively small county.  If we had more centralised services we could perhaps provide centres in the midlands where some of the specialists could attend and thereby save having to transport the patients to Dublin.  This would be easier on the patients themselves <Col N="877" /> and would be cheaper on the ratepayers.  I do not advocate that we should tackle this problem from a completely economic point of view but, at the same time, with the services as they are we should explore every avenue in order to endeavour to meet the situation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to comment on the increase in hospital charges over the past year.  They are a definite burden on quite a large section of our people and I hope when the Minister is bringing in his new Bill he will bear in mind people in the middle income group.  I have in mind particularly the farmer who is up to the £75 valuation and who has a very heavy outlay on rates.  The number of such people is very small; they are caught here.  I feel that the increase in valuation up to £60 is not a just figure in view of the fact that the Minister has allowed other sections an income limit of £1,200 a year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a simple Bill and I thought it would go through the Seanad easily and quickly.  Quite frankly, I am interested in it going through quickly because I think we are all agreed that it is a good Bill in that it provides an extension which perhaps is not very much but is still a good thing.  The Bill will come into operation when the Minister appoints by order and, therefore, the quicker the Bill goes through the sooner, we hope, will the Minister make the necessary order.  When he is replying to the debate, I hope he will give us some indication as to what he has in mind about making the order for the operation of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, it is a relatively simple Bill but we seem to be having a debate on a White Paper which has not appeared.  I do not propose to follow in any great detail that sort of debate. I would much prefer to see the White Paper before we attempt to debate it. I hope we will see the White Paper pretty soon and I also hope the Minister will take his courage in his hands and propose the introduction of a comprehensive health service for the whole community.  I know that when you mention a comprehensive health <Col N="878" /> service people raise the bogey of the cost.  Quite frankly, I can never understand this argument because I think we have to regard not merely the existing cost and what we pay in rates and what we pay from central funds, but what we as individuals also pay.  If we say that a comprehensive health service, free to the whole community, will cost much more than the sum total of what we as a community spend at present, that means in effect that we are not providing a proper service, that we are depriving sections of the community of a proper health service. That seems to me to be the sort of argument that we cannot afford to do it, that we cannot afford to treat a section of our community in a proper way.  The people who have the money can have a proper health service and a section who cannot afford it must have it doled out to them&mdash;I was going to say meagrely, but that would not be quite just in view of what the Minister is doing&mdash;cannot have what is appropriate or just for them.  As I said, I want to see this Bill going through as quickly as possible but I do suggest to the Minister that he should take his courage in his hands and propose the introduction of a comprehensive medical scheme for the whole community. It would be a fitting monument, in 1966, to the patriots who died 50 years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill which I think is a step in the right direction although we in the Labour Party were really looking for a health scheme on an insurance basis.  The fact that it covers 90 per cent of our people is gratifying, and it should not take much more to cover the whole population.  I believe there will have to be an insurance scheme before we can reach that stage.  If we take the increase in the numbers covered, most of it came from persons insured under the Social Welfare Acts. One of the other two categories is self-employed people.  Any member of a local authority has a fair idea how self-employed people get on under the Health Act.  They have not been doing too badly.  It is rather difficult to assess the income of self-employed <Col N="879" /> persons.  Small shopkeepers or contractors do not keep audited accounts and books.  Then, there are cattle dealers and various other people.  It is impossible to assess their income.  When they get sick, they get the benefit of the Health Act as it stands.</P>
      <P>The number of people in the second category&mdash;self-employed people&mdash;who will be included will be very small indeed. I would be surprised if the number is as much as a half per cent of the population.  I am very interested in the third category, farmers under £50 valuation.  I always considered that the £50 valuation was too low.  Other people whose incomes had gone up to £800 were included, but a man with a valuation of £50 would find it hard to make £800 a year.  I do not think the Minister has gone far enough in increasing the valuation figure from £50 to £60.  He is now calculating that a man earns £20 per £1 valuation.  That does not include land valuation alone but the value of the whole holding, including buildings.</P>
      <P>If you went into a county manager under the old Act in connection with hospital beds, he would take this down on his bit of paper and multiply by 16. He is encouraged by what the Minister has done now to multiply by 20.  The Minister could have gone to over £70 to put these people on a par with people earning £1,200 a year.  I do not think the number of extra people included in respect of self-employed people and farmers under £60 valuation will make any difference whatever in the rates in any county.  A number of these people are already covered under the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme and they are hardly likely to withdraw from it.  If they withdrew, they would have to get into the queue to see a specialist or would have to go into a public ward.  By continuing to pay their Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme contributions, they would have the advantage of going into a private or semi-private ward, according to the number of units they have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister has done something for hardship cases.  He mentioned <Col N="880" /> hardship cases in his statement here today.  However, there is very little he can do.  How hardship cases are treated is in the hands of the county managers. Some of them are quite good; some are not.  It is laid down in the Health Act that the manager can give only certain concessions as far as hardship is concerned. A person may be in hospital for three months paying full fees.  The manager may put him on threequarters of the rate.  If the illness is prolonged, the manager has power to allow a person off at half the rate.  But I think that is the greatest concession I have seen given.  I have seen some grave cases of hardship with people barely over the £50 mark.</P>
    <P>The doctors seem to be worried that the inclusion of this 1.5 per cent of the population will seriously interfere with their incomes.  It will not take a penny from the pockets of the dispensary doctors, because not one person in the two categories dealt with here&mdash;self-employed people up to £1,200 and farmers up to £60 valuation &mdash;has the slightest chance of getting a medical card.  Therefore, it is obvious that the dispensary doctors will lose no income because of their inclusion. Consultants, surgeons and so on may possibly lose.  I do not know how the Minister could compensate them if they could show they had lost income as a result of the Act.  They are not tied up in the same way as dispensary doctors and doctors attached to local authorities.  In that case the Minister could easily see whether they were losing income and deal with them.  But he would not find it so easy dealing with the incomes of people in private practice.</P>

      <P>It was as a result of a statement made by the Minister in the House.  I do not know who brought it about.  I would be glad to compliment Deputy T.F. O'Higgins if he got the Minister to make that statement.  However, the Minister made the statement and, more important, implemented it.  It was very much appreciated by the people in the country. I do not think old age pensioners should be annoyed by people trying to find out what their sons and daughters earn.  I compliment the Minister on following the same principle here.  The head of the house is the person who will be answerable for the income of the house, and his son or daughter cannot be approached to find out how much they are contributing towards the maintenance of the people in the house.  That is a move in the right direction, a move to stop lies and everything else.  It only brought about lies told to try to avoid hospital bills, which really hit people hard.</P>
      <P>It is gratifying that 90 per cent of the people are covered by the Health Act and it should not be too difficult to get a scheme, contributory or otherwise, to cover the full 100 per cent. The sooner this is done, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to speak, but the Minister looked so invitingly at me when I entered the Chamber that I could not resist it; although in fairness I shall not keep him more than a few minutes.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator Murphy that it is inappropriate for us to take this opportunity of adverting to some general principles in regard to the health services which may be of some value to the Minister in guiding him in the preparation of the White Paper, the delay in the issue of which is perhaps not entirely his fault.  I should like to suggest tentatively a few principles which I think should be borne in mind in devising any radical review of the health services, such as is overdue and as the Minister is contemplating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I am convinced that the present system of financing the health services is the wrong method of financing <Col N="882" /> them and is an inadequate method.  Any system of finance that depends for half of the finance on a tax as unjust as rates and for the other half, on general taxation, where there is always pressure on the Government, is one which is bound to lead to an unstable and inadequate service.  Our difficulties in regard to health services derive in large degree from this and from the persistent reluctance of the Government to face up to the need for drawing on the alternative method of raising money for this purpose which is used elsewhere and which is appropriate for this purpose, namely, some form of contributions from the people concerned &mdash; insurance contributions or whatever you may like to call them.</P>
    <P>As it happens, in this country, the burden of such contributions on employees is relatively light, compared with its incidence in other countries, even though there have been significant increases in the social contributions in recent years.  However, the burden of other taxes is by no means so light. While our income tax is not so very high, it still is by no means low and increases in it are liable to have a disincentive effect.  This is not true of the kind of insurance contribution we talk about.  Until the Government are prepared to draw on this additional source of finance, we shall not have adequate health services here.</P>
    <P>One almost regrets that Fine Gael introduced a scheme with this proposal of insurance contributions because though there are many other Fine Gael policies which the Government adopted with remarkable celerity after the last elections, this one became controversial and the Government almost committed themselves not to accept it.  I hope they will not persist in that attitude.  I hope that the Minister will take a broader view because this is a matter of fundamental importance to any radical improvements.</P>
    <P>Secondly, all patients should be treated equally and that is something which does not apply under the present system.  There is a marked disparity in the application of criteria in the different counties for medical card holders.</P>
    <P>I think that in any new system all the <Col N="883" /> patients should be on the same footing with the doctor.  The doctor should not be in a position to distinguish between the man paying for himself and the man being paid for by the taxpayer through some social mechanism or other.  How the patient pays for it is a matter between the patient and the public authority.  The doctor should not be in a position to distinguish between patients or faced with distinctions of that kind</P>
    <P>In determining the method of contribution, it seems to me that some form of contribution to provide a supplementary source of finance is important. That type of contribution is one from which it would be proper to exempt people of straitened means. We must try to avoid the means test which, in its historical application here, has been unfortunate.  As far as possible, the exemption of such people should be based on some categorisation &mdash; those in receipt of social benefits or social assistance at the time and perhaps other special classes such as widows.  It should be possible to avoid a scheme based on asking people to disclose their income because it gives rise to abuses, to controversy and to the general unpleasantness associated with the actual application of a means test in this country&mdash;not that the means test principle is unsound.  It is proper that the poor should benefit and that the rich should pay the full cost but the application of the means test here should be such as to try to move away from the methods applied heretofore.</P>
    <P>Another point the Minister should consider seriously is that the contribution payable under any insurance scheme or whatever it is called&mdash;the Minister might find it more tactful to describe it as something else as the expression &ldquo;insurance scheme&rdquo; is associated with the Fine Gael Party&mdash;should, I think, be creditable towards voluntary health insurance. If a man is paying out £10 or £15 a year in compulsory contributions of some kind or another, he should be permitted to have that money credited to the voluntary health insurance scheme, or part of it as may <Col N="884" /> be appropriate, as part of his contribution so that he is not faced with the choice that has just been mentioned of opting out of the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme for a less favourable arrangement.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which the Minister has agreed in principle is that doctors should not suffer financially by the introduction of any scheme. Some, at least, of the opposition of many doctors to State medicine derives, I think it is fair to say, from very long and bitter experience in dealing with the Department of Health and the kind of treatment they have received, which has not led them to believe that they would be treated generously or even fairly in any State system and they fear being dependent for their entire livelihood on the State, which has shown itself, in this area, a consistently bad employer.  The Minister has shown a willingness to make a fresh start and we must encourage him on that course.  He has an opportunity to gain the confidence of doctors and, without such confidence, it would be difficult adequately to reform the health services.</P>
    <P>Another point&mdash;it is hardly a principle but it is something to consider&mdash; is the present system under which general practitioners in many cases are subjected to the strain of a 24 hour, 7 day week service which they have to provide and anything that can be done to alleviate that situation will be good. The general practitioner service should not be overlooked.  There is a tendency to leave it out of any system because the cost to the ordinary household is not great but it should be brought in and consideration should be given to methods of ensuring through the operation of panel arrangements of some kind or another that the burden and strain on general practitioners, which in many cases is intolerable, would be alleviated.</P>
    <P>In devising any scheme, I would hope that the Minister, before producing the scheme and in preparing it, would endeavour to make it as good as possible by consulting the different parties involved. There are difficulties here because <Col N="885" /> of the historical relationship and the well-known antipathy of many doctors to State medicine.  Although it is not proper for the Minister to go cap in hand to the doctors and ask: &ldquo;What will you accept?&rdquo;&mdash;that is not the job of a Minister of State&mdash;his job is to determine the aims he wants to achieve&mdash;but, having stated them, it is proper for him to go to the medical profession and other interested parties and say: &ldquo;I am going to bring in a scheme to introduce these provisions. You may not like it.  However, I want your assistance in telling me how to do it in the way which will cause the least disruption to you, <i>inter alia</i>, while providing the greatest benefit to the public.&rdquo;  An approach of that kind, even to people ideologically opposed to the proposal, can produce the response and help required in devising a means of achieving an aim which personally they may find distasteful. The good start the Minister has made by way of consultation makes it possible for him to take such a step and to approach the problem in that way.</P>
    <P>A final point I should like to put to the Minister is an appeal to look at the question of hospital catering.  This is a much neglected matter.  It is extremely difficult to provide good, hot food to people in a large institution. It is not insuperable but nearly so, and nothing has been done in this country to overcome the problem.  I have some little personal knowledge of this.  About three years ago I had to look into this question for a particular reason and I had very constructive discussions with the Departments of Health and Education, with the vocational education authorities, some of the hospital authorities and with the Hospitals Commission.  I discovered an interest and a willingness on the part of all these bodies in relation to this problem. I also discovered a total unwillingness on the part of any of them to take any initiative and a rigid belief on the part of each that the initiative must lie somewhere else.  They were not by any means disinterested.  They welcomed any initiative in the matter: they would be glad to co-operate but each thought it was somebody else's job to start the <Col N="886" /> ball rolling.  There is a document somewhere in the Minister's Department containing some practical suggestions arising out of the consultations I had, because his Department, knowing I was making these inquiries, said they would be very glad to know the result and what conclusions I came to.  This is something that could well be looked at.  That is the only other point I wanted to make and I am sorry for detaining the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to thank the Senators for the very constructive points they have made during this debate.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley who was the first speaker suggested that people who go into hospital were assessed on what they &ldquo;were&rdquo; earning, not what they &ldquo;are&rdquo; earning at the time they are in hospital.  That is not so, of course. Such persons should be entitled to have no charge levied on them for the hospital costs.  I should be very interested indeed&mdash;if the Senator is aware of such cases&mdash;if he would let me know, but there must be some misunderstanding.</P>
      <P>The debate, of course, covered a much wider field than I had anticipated. It was like a speech on my Estimate in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Senator Alton went to the greatest trouble in preparing his speech and I should like to congratulate him on it.  I will take heed of suggestions he has made and bear them in mind, as indeed I will consider all the proposals of the other Senators.  I could not possibly reply to all the points made by Senator Alton but there were some I did jot down when he was speaking. He spoke of the increase in population in North Dublin but remember, nobody has had to be refused a hospital bed there.  I am not aware of any complaints and perhaps one explanation is that in 1964 the average stay in a hospital was 17.6 days, as compared with 20.1 days in 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Alton is worried about the 200,000 people who will be brought in under this Bill, who will be a loss to the specialist and who will create extra work.  I fail to see the logic of that. In the past any of these people who went into hospital had to pay out of <Col N="887" /> their own pockets and now public funds will carry the burden so I would respectfully suggest that the Senator's argument is based on a fundamental fallacy.  But it is an interesting argument and perhaps he might develop it further on another occasion.</P>
    <P>Senator Alton then criticised the hospital position as far as Mayo was concerned and compared Mayo with Monaghan and Waterford.  I think he said that in Mayo there was one hospital bed for every thousand persons. But he forgot to say that there are three district hospitals, besides the county hospital, in Mayo and in these three district hospitals combined, there must be over 100 beds.  In fairness, I think the Senator will agree on that. There is no district hospital in Monaghan and I think he should compare like with like.  He said that the population of Waterford was 28,000 and mentioned the county hospital in Ardkeen but when he is making his comparison, he should also bear in mind that, while the population of Waterford City is 28,000, the combined populations of the city and county of Waterford total 70,000. That would change his comparisons very substantially.</P>
    <P>Senator Alton also said that under the Bill 93 per cent of the population will be enjoying State medicine.  The present position is, of course, that 30 per cent of our population&mdash;without any cost to themselves&mdash;are entitled to free medicines and drugs, a full general practitioner service and hospital treatment. The total population eligible after this Bill becomes law for hospital and specialist services will not be 93 per cent, although it will be over 90 per cent.  The IMA was prepared&mdash; during a discussion and a meeting with me&mdash;to accept a limit of £1,000. Remember the figure was £800.  I have increased it to £1,200 and the IMA was agreeable to £1,000.  The IMA agreement to £1,000 would put the percentage up to about 89 per cent of the population, but it is misleading for someone to say&mdash;as was said by Senator Alton&mdash;that the State medical service is coming close to the English system.  Nothing could be further from <Col N="888" /> the truth, with all due respect to Senator McQuillan and the other Senators.  People are talking here today, in the Dáil, and everywhere I go, about a comprehensive health service but I bet you there are few people who know what a comprehensive health service is.  I want to give my philosophy and opinion on it.  I think it would be a damnable day for this country were we to have no charge levied on any of our citizens.  We know what happened in a country not far removed from us.  The practice of medicine there is now held, to a certain extent, in odium and people who are entitled to free medical care from the cradle to the grave are now actually going to private practitioners even though they are entitled to State medicine&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have no objection to examining exhaustively this system of insurance contributions whereby the State would contribute possibly one-third, the insured person one-third, and the employer one-third.  It appears to me to be unjust that an insured worker with, say, £8 a week should pay exactly the same contribution, whether that is 1/-, 2/- or 3/-, as a person with £1,100.</P>

      <P>I think many things but I am talking only about Health now.  I do not see the justice of this. Senator Quinlan very wisely said that we must make the best possible use of our resources.  In doing that, the first category of people we must think of are the poor.  They come first with us; they cannot help themselves.  The next category are what I might call the middle income group, those earning up to £1,200, the extended limit under the new Act.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy asked me about the commencement date of the Act.  I shall have to make regulations which must first be referred to the National Health Council but the date I have in mind is April 1st next.</P>

    <P>Reference was also made to the White Paper which, I should say, is with the printers and will be published immediately printing is completed, which will not take very long.  In regard to the point made by Senator Fitzgerald and other Senators, I shall <Col N="890" /> certainly have discussions with all interested parties when this White Paper is published.  It will not be published as a <i>fait accompli:</i> it will be made clear in the White Paper that I will welcome discussions with all interested parties, including representatives of the doctors and of analogous professions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the preparation of this White Paper I was particularly concerned with the difficulties in financing the services which have arisen in recent years.  Now, any reasonable person will admit that in the past the State has been generous to the local authorities in contributing to the cost of developing the services to their present stage.  I take the year 1947, the year in which the Department of Health was set up.  In 1947-48 the local authorities had to meet from their own resources 84 per cent of their expenditure on health; the State grants then amounted to only 16 per cent of the total.  The Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, changed this, so that the State's contribution now amounts to half of the total health expenditure, the local authorities meeting the other half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this is so, it has become increasingly evident that local rates are not a suitable source from which to meet in the future, to the same extent as in the past, the burden of the rising cost of the health services.  Since 1959-60 the cost has almost doubled: it has risen from £16.6 millions then to over £30 millions in the present financial year.  The Exchequer and the <Col N="891" /> local authorities have jointly borne this increase, but, having myself been a member of a local authority, I can the better appreciate how heavily the local share of this substantial and rapidly increasing burden has fallen on the local ratepayer.</P>
    <P>There is no reason to believe that health expenditure will remain static in the future.  Apart from ordinary increases in cost, there will be new expenditure on developments which are outlined in the White Paper.  I am glad to be able to say, in the Seanad, therefore, that the Government do not intend that the local rates should meet any part of the cost of the proposed extensions of the services and, furthermore, that arrangements will be made to ensure that the total cost of the health services falling on the local rates in respect of the financial year 1966-67 will not exceed the cost in respect of the present financial year.</P>

      <P>I had paused here.  I have a little note on my brief.  I thought certain Senators would burst into applause.  Apparently that is not allowed.  I have made an announcement on a matter on which I have been pressed in both Houses and all over the country.  What does a Labour Party Member, with a Fine Gael mentality, say?  He says this is the first blow in the local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This decision will mean that, except to the extent that rises in the rates may be needed in some areas to <Col N="892" /> liquidate debit balances or to cover inadequate provisions in respect of this year, the local authorities will not have to budget for any increased health expenditure next year.</P>
    <P>I am sure that what I have announced will be welcomed by all Senators who are members of local authorities, and who are all ratepayers.  I might say, too, particularly in reply to Senator FitzGerald, that methods of financing the health services are being examined in the long-term.  It is a very difficult problem.  There is no easy solution.  But, seeing that this is the time of the year when next year's level of local taxation is being considered, I have thought it well to state now what the Government's proposals are for that year.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of rates, I may say that I do not share the views expressed in certain quarters that some considerable new sources of local income, other than the rates, can easily be found.  I just do not know.  Other countries have had the same problem.</P>
    <P>I think I should say, too, that the Government are not happy that the local share of the cost of the health services is equitably distributed between the different health authorities. There are injustices and there are anomalies.  Therefore, the Government have accepted in principle that the distribution of the total cost to local authorities of the health services as between health authorities will be determined on the basis of a formula which will make for a more equitable distribution of the cost.  I have been and still am discussing with the Minister for Local Government, with our respective officials, the working out of such a formula.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, did the Minister say that the total burden on the rates overall would not be increased and that it would be redistributed, or that the burden of the rates in each individual county would not be increased and that it would be redistributed?  I was not clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that the Government decision is that each <Col N="893" /> health authority will establish what their actual expenditure was in 1965-66. Say a local authority struck last year a health rate of 20/- in the £.  Let us say, for the sake of argument, that the actual expenditure up to 31st March of this year required a rate of 21/-.  That would mean that that local authority, to arrive at the fixed figure, in view of the Government's undertaking, would have to levy a health rate of 22/- to make up the shortfall of a shilling in the current year.</P>
      <P>To take the converse case: if a local authority levied a health rate of 13/-when 12/- would have sufficed.  In that case the health rate for 1966-67 would be 11/-.  In other words, that local authority, which took a shilling too much in the £ for health from the ratepayers this year will give it back to them next year.</P>

      <P>I cannot say that. All I can say is that we accept that the local burden cannot continue to rise as it has been doing.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I am examining with the Minister for Local Government the whole question of financing.  It is only fair to tell the House that the new services contemplated in the White Paper could be very costly.  I have given the House the assurance that extensions of existing services will put no burden on local taxation.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley mentioned the point of mental hospitals' claims of up to 10/- per day, on estates.  I am sure he has had professional experience of this.  I had a couple of these cases.  If an inmate of a mental hospital dies and leaves a substantial amount of money, surely it is only equitable that some contribution should be levied?</P>

      <P>Senator Alton referred to 45,000 patients in the voluntary hospitals and said the figure was up by 13,000 on 1958.  He suggested that this showed a drift from the county hospitals to the voluntary hospitals.  That is not so.  Admissions to all kinds of hospitals have been going up.  In 1957, the total number of patients admitted to all acute hospitals was 219,390.  In 1964, it was 282,931.  I admit Senator Garret FitzGerald may make a point of this and say that after the Coalition went out of office and we came in more have had to go into hospital!</P>

      <P>This Bill contains a number of provisions related to the programme for the development of tourism.  It provides for the registration of caravan sites and camping sites, the continuation of the scheme of Ministerial guarantees in respect of loans raised for the construction or improvement of holiday accommodation and the provision of resort amenities and continued arrangements for the financing <Col N="896" /> of the various activities of Bord Fáilte Éireann.</P>
      <P>There is already in existence a scheme for the registration by Bord Fáilte of hotels, guest houses, holiday hostels, youth hostels, holiday camps and motor hotels or motels.  The effect of the registration system is that no person may describe or hold out any premises as an hotel, guesthouse, etc., unless the premises are registered in the appropriate category with Bord Fáilte.  To secure registration, premises must comply with standards prescribed by Bord Fáilte with my consent and proprietors must file with the Board a statement of maximum prices. Registered premises benefit from inclusion in the Official Guide published annually by Bord Fáilte and also from various schemes of financial assistance for works of improvement and extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the expansion of tourist traffic, caravans are playing an increasingly important part in holiday-making and Bord Fáilte say that the present patronage for caravans is predominantly for static caravans for hire on site.  The patrons are mainly family groups and include many families who for financial or other reasons could not take a holiday in hotels.  Caravan sites do not always present an attractive appearance and close control over this form of development is essential to ensure the safeguarding of scenic and other natural amenities.  The Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, provides for the control of certain aspects of caravan site development and general standards for such development have been laid down by the Minister for Local Government.  These powers are operative only in areas to which they have been applied by Order of the Minister for Local Government.  In addition, the use of land for the purpose of caravanning is subject to the approval of the local planning authority under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963. Local Government legislation in the matter of caravan sites, however, relates mainly to standards for physical planning and covers such matters as the layout and location of <Col N="897" /> the sites, density of caravans per acre, the provision of water supply and sewerage facilities and disposal of litter.  Bord Fáilte, however, are anxious to encourage higher operational standards also.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a system of inspection and grading is an essential step in the provision of caravan sites to a standard comparable to the best sites in Britain and on the Continent. Bord Fáilte intend also to attract camping visitors from European countries where camping holidays are very popular and it is proposed, therefore, that the registration system should extend also to camping sites.  Provision has accordingly been included in the Bill for the registration of caravan sites and camping sites by Bord Fáilte in accordance with regulations made with the consent of the Minister for Transport and Power after consultation with the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for certain minor amendments of the scheme of guaranteed loans for the provision of holiday accommodation and tourist amenities, which is operated by my Department under section 17 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952.  Under this scheme the private developer raises a loan from a bank or other lending institution and the repayment of capital and the payment of interest is guaranteed by the Minister.  All loans guaranteed to date have been in sterling and there is some doubt whether the existing legislation would enable a guarantee to be given in other currencies.  This doubt is being removed under the Bill by making it clear that guarantees can be given in currencies other than the currency of the State.</P>
    <P>The 1952 Act restricted guarantees for loans raised for the provision of amenities and services to works related to particular tourist resorts.  With the creation of the Regional Tourism Organisations, and the growing popularity of motoring tourism, initiative in tourism is now growing in places other than those which are traditionally regarded as resorts and it is considered desirable that guaranteed loans should be available for worthwhile <Col N="898" /> tourist enterprises, even though they may not be in a recognised tourist resort or associated with a particular hotel.  This is being effected by a modification of the scope of the scheme as set out in the 1952 Act.</P>
    <P>The 1952 Act limited the operation of the scheme of guaranteed loans to a period of five years from the date of the passing of that Act.  This period was extended by two further periods of five years by the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1957 and 1961, so that the present scheme is due to expire in 1967.  The Bill provides for a further extension of five years which would have the effect of authorising the continuation of the scheme until 1972.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains provisions for the future financing of the various statutory functions of Bord Fáilte. These functions are paid for out of funds voted annually by Dáil Éireann in the form of grants-in-aid to the Board.  There are statutory limits on the aggregate amounts that may be issued to the Board for specified purposes and accordingly it is necessary from time to time according as these statutory limits are reached, to ask the Oireachtas to enact enabling legislation to permit the voting of further funds so as to provide for the continuation of the Board's activities.  It so happens that we are at present nearing the statutory limits applicable to the three main divisions of the Board's activities, namely, the major resort development scheme, the scheme of cash grants for the development of holiday accommodation and the general function of increasing tourism in Ireland.  Accordingly, the Bill contains enabling financial provisions relating to all three functions.</P>
    <P>The resort development scheme was inaugurated under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1959, which provided for the payment to Bord Fáilte within a ten year period of sums not exceeding in the aggregate £1 million for the giving of grants for major tourist resorts.  From this fund a grant scheme has been operated by the Board to enable such essential schemes as basic site development, provision of promenades, parks and other recreational activities to be undertaken.  The major resorts and resort <Col N="899" /> areas selected by Bord Fáilte for development were: Galway/Salthill, Killarney, Bray, Dún Laoghaire, Tramore, Skerries, Kilkee, Youghal, Ballybunion, Lahinch, Arklow, Greystones, West Cork, County Donegal, Achill Island, Dingle Peninsula, River Shannon and Lakes.  The scheme is carried out by Bord Fáilte in consultation with the local authorities and other local interests.  One of the main conditions of the scheme is that there should be a minimum local contribution of 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The progress of the scheme in the first four years was slow in terms of physical work but a great deal of work was undertaken in the form of discussions with local interests, formulation of proposals and drafting of plans, the acquisition of land and so on.  With the acceleration of actual development work in the last couple of years, grant payments have increased and we are now reaching the £1 million limit.  The scheme was the first comprehensive programme of its kind and the initial plans and estimates were necessarily of a tentative nature and were subject to modification as the scheme progressed and experience was gained.  The work programme for some resorts had to be varied because of local conditions, resulting in the abandonment of some items and the substitution of others.</P>
    <P>Overall, Bord Fáilte have found it necessary to adopt a more extensive programme to ensure that a significant impact was made and that moneys would not be wasted through inadequate scale or incomplete planning. Costs have risen considerably since the first estimates were prepared so that, even to finance the original proposals, additional moneys would have been needed.  A further factor is that the Shannon waterway was not originally included among the areas to be developed and the subsequent addition of the Shannon has absorbed some of the initial fund.  It will be clear from all this that the original £1 million provision is now inadequate. It is estimated that by the time the complete programme of works at the seventeen resorts and resort areas <Col N="900" /> has been carried through the total cost will amount to £2.5 million.  The rate at which the work can proceed will, of course, depend on the availability of capital.  The provision of funds for this purpose will be covered in the usual way in the annual Vote for my Department.</P>
    <P>This is an opportune time to look ahead and to consider what form resort and amenity development should take to meet the requirements and the tastes of the tourists of the future.  All the areas selected for development under the original scheme, with the exception of Killarney and the Shannon waterway, are coastal and the basic attraction in each case is proximity to the sea.  With the development of additional early-season and late-season traffic it is clearly necessary to consider other types of amenities also, as coastal resorts have diminished attraction outside the main summer season.</P>
    <P>Visitors outside the peak season are increasingly of the &ldquo;special interest&rdquo; type, seeking active sporting holidays such as game-shooting, pony trekking, hunting, angling and golf, as well as national monuments and places of historic interest, and they can thus be attracted to inland as well as coastal tourist centres.  A major increase is expected in motoring tourists from Britain during the next few years as a result of the improvements in the cross-channel services.  The motoring tourist will circulate extensively and will expect to find inland places to visit for interest sake.  I am, therefore, asking Bord Fáilte to undertake the planning of a new resort programme with these criteria in mind.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a new scheme involving new centres would obviously involve the provision of additional funds.  It is not possible to make any precise estimate at this stage of what funds would ultimately be required but I am proposing to make provision for a sum of £750,000.  Expenditure from this fund will be authorised annually in the light of the availability of capital moneys.  Should the financial position permit relatively early exhaustion of this fund, the Oireachtas will be asked to increase it in due course.  The Bill, therefore, provides for the raising of the existing limit <Col N="901" /> on the resort development fund from £1 million to £3.25 million&mdash;an increase of £2.25 million, of which £1.5 million is in respect of the completion of the present programme and £0.75 million to provide for a second resort programme.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the raising of the limit of the amount which may be provided in the form of grants for the development of holiday accommodation. Provision was made in the Tourist Traffic Act, 1959, for the payment to Bord Fáilte of amounts not exceeding in the aggregate £500,000 for this purpose and this limit was increased to £1.5 million by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1963.  From these funds grants have been provided by Bord Fáilte for the construction of additional holiday accommodation, the improvement of existing accommodation, the provision of indoor and outdoor entertainment facilities for visitors and the provision of staff accommodation.</P>
    <P>The grants, which amount generally to 20 per cent of the cost of the works subject to certain maxima, have stimulated a considerable amount of hotel development involving a total investment of approximately £10 million, including the grants, over the past five years.  The scheme of grants was revised in February, 1964, to provide for increased assistance for new accommodation in resort areas and the grants were extended to include guesthouses providing at least ten guest bedrooms. Provision was also made for assistance for youth hostels and other categories of visitor accommodation such as colleges or other institutions catering for groups of visitors during the holiday period.</P>
    <P>The amount issued to Bord Fáilte at 31st March, 1965, out of the existing £1½ million fund for holiday accommodation was £1.166 million and the sum voted for the current year is £225,000.  The position at the end of the current year will, therefore, be that £1.42 million will have been expended, leaving a balance of only £79,000.  It is, accordingly, necessary to raise the limit of the existing grant fund in order to provide for the continued financing of accommodation development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" /> Despite the expansion of accommodation that has taken place, it is clear that further expansion is necessary to accommodate the increasing number of visitors that are being attracted to Ireland each year in accordance with the Second Programme target of doubling 1960 tourist income at constant values by 1970.  In recent years we have been recording an annual increase of 500 to 600 registered rooms, not counting rooms in supplementary accommodation such as boarding houses, private houses. etc., but a recent assessment of the position carried out by Bord Fáilte following detailed investigation, revealed that a far greater rate of increase will be necessary if the 1970 target is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>We must, therefore, continue the scheme of grants for a further period. It is impossible to make firm estimates of what grant commitments will amount to as this will depend on the rate of investment by the hotel industry itself.  The proposal in the Bill is to raise the limit on the amount which may be provided for holiday accommodation grants from £1.5 million to £3 million.  This provision, like the provision about resort development grants, is of an enabling nature.  The amounts to be provided in any year will fall to be voted by the Dáil in the normal way under the Vote for my Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the special funds for accommodation grants and for the development of major tourist resorts, the cost of administration and general activities of Bord Fáilte are met from an annual grant-in-aid.  From this grant-in-aid the Board are required to meet the cost of overseas publicity and advertising and a wide range of activities, including improvement works at minor resorts, access works and other improvements at places of historic or other special interest, assistance towards developing angling tourism and other sporting attractions, assistance to hotel staff training schemes, grants to meet interest on loans for accommodation and resort development and promotional work in connection with festivals and international conferences.</P>
    <P>Up to 1961, this grant-in-aid was <Col N="903" /> subject to a limit of £500,000 in any year but this limit was removed by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1961, and replaced by the provision of a global sum of £5 million, the intention being that for a limited period the level of State expenditure on the development and promotion of tourism would be substantially increased.  It was indicated at the time that, on the basis of annual provisions related to the then current requirements, the sum of £5 million might be expected to meet requirements for a period of seven years.</P>
    <P>Circumstances have since made it necessary to modify the objective of allocating the £5 million over a seven-year period.  Increased interest grant commitments, resulting from the increased rate of investment by the hotel industry in the development of holiday accommodation, made it necessary initially to reduce the period to six years and the annual grants-in-aid to Bord Fáilte up to and including the financial year 1963-64 were allocated on the basis of a six-year period.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid for 1964-65 was, however, increased very substantially to allow Bord Fáilte to initiate a programme of increased activity, particularly in overseas publicity and in marketing.  This was necessary because of the growing competition in international tourism, because of the great importance of tourist income in the national economy and particularly because of the formidable target set for tourism in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  At the beginning of the current financial year the amounts issued to Bord Fáilte were just in excess of £3.5 million and the sum of £1,847,000 voted for this year will bring expenditure above the £5 million limit.  This renders it necessary to enact new legislative provisions to cover the Board's future activities. The fact that the statutory limit is expected to be reached very shortly makes the enactment of the present Bill a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult to work out in advance a rigid programme of expenditure on tourism.  The amount to be provided in any year will depend on <Col N="904" /> the progress made towards the achievement of the 1970 target and also, of course, on the availability of resources. I am proposing, therefore, to depart from the concept of any fixed limit. Accordingly, the Bill provides for the deletion of the existing limit of £5 million contained in the Tourist Traffic Act, 1961 and does not substitute any new limit.  The position then will be that in accordance with section 2 of the 1961 Act the amount to be provided to Bord Fáilte in any year will be determined by the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Finance and will be included in the annual Estimates.  There will be no diminution of the degree of Parliamentary control as the money will form part of the Estimates for my Department which will have to be voted annually in the usual way.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> aims at doubling income from tourism between 1960 and 1970, in terms of constant 1960 prices.  This is a formidable target and represents an average annual increase of 7.2 per cent compound over the ten year period.  When the Second Programme was adopted in 1963 this rate of increase had not been achieved and consequently the actual rate required from 1963 onwards to double the 1960 income was in fact 7.8 per cent.  It was recognised that competition from other countries was increasing, that the target could not be regarded as an automatic projection of a previous trend and that active promotion and the provision of adequate Exchequer assistance would be necessary during the period of the Second Programme if the target was to be achieved.</P>
    <P>The actual income from tourism, including income earned by Irish carriers, in 1960 was £44.2 million. Senators will have seen from the Bord Fáilte Annual Report for the year ended 31st March, 1965, that the income for the year 1964 amounted to £68 million which in terms of 1960 values represented £57.4 million.  A tentative estimate for the year 1965 indicates that the income for that year was in excess of £77 million and Bord Fáilte anticipate that the income for <Col N="905" /> 1966 should reach £85 million approximately.</P>
    <P>These figures show that the increased promotional activities of recent years have been successful and that if the present rate of increase can be maintained the 1970 target will be achieved.  There are no grounds for complacency, however, and continued efforts will be necessary in the shape of promotional activities, resort development and provision of accommodation to maintain and provide for the required increase in tourist traffic. With the increase in the number of visitors to the country the services provided at local level and the interest and enthusiasm of local enterprise take on great importance.</P>
    <P>The new Regional Companies have provided a new impetus for local and regional activities and I would like to take this opportunity of saying how valuable is the contribution of the Regional Companies&mdash;the officers and members and all who co-operate with them&mdash;and I have no doubt that we can look forward to the continued growth of this excellent work.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry makes a very important contribution to the country's economy.  In about half the countries of Western Europe tourist receipts account for three to six per cent of total external receipts and the average is just under six per cent.  In Ireland by contrast the income from tourism is about 16 per cent of total external receipts which is almost three times the European average and only in Spain, Austria and Greece is a higher percentage attained.  Income from tourism accounts for nearly 50 per cent of invisible exports.  It exceeded the income from exports of live animals in 1964 by more than £1 million.  An important feature of the tourist industry is that it is primarily based on domestic resources, involving little dependence on imported goods.  Because of the decentralised character of the industry its benefits extend to all parts of the country and it is an important factor in assisting the less developed areas of the west and south.</P>
    <P>I am confident that as a result of the increased promotional activities of recent years and the improvement in <Col N="906" /> travel facilities, the upward trend in tourist traffic to this country can be maintained, provided the necessary resources and facilities are made available. The principal purpose of this Bill is to enable these resources to be provided and I accordingly recommend the Bill for the approval of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say the Minister is in a very flaithiúl mood this evening.  I had thought I would get in after Senator Garret FitzGerald and that I would have an opportunity of totting up millions the Minister proposes to make available for tourism, in sharp contrast to his attitude to the workers in CIE.  However, let that be for the moment.  All of us agree that the tourist industry is a very important one and that we must all co-operate in making it as successful as we possibly can.  If I have any criticisms to make in my contribution to the debate, I would ask the House to accept them as not intended to be unhelpful but rather to try to direct attention to some shortcomings in the hope that we can correct them and thereby get further revenue from tourism and so help to develop the economy.</P>
      <P>We all agree that the development of hotels in recent years has been largely directed towards improving the grade A hotels, making more bedrooms available.  Great progress has been achieved in that direction.  We have now more bedrooms with private baths attached.  We have largely geared ourselves for the American market in that respect.  A fair measure of success has been achieved.  Reference has been made to encouraging more American tourists to visit this country.  I have already said that progress has been made in that direction but I want to contrast that with what I regard as lack of progress in the development of B grade hotels.  I refer particularly to B grade hotels because these are largely the hotels favoured by British tourists.  We have next door to us one of the biggest tourist markets.  This could provide a lot more income for the tourist industry of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been looking through the <Col N="907" /> register of hotels and it seems to me that we have 183 grade B hotels registered, with 8,000 odd beds.  Most of them are twin-bedded rooms and that seems to work out that we have about 25 bedrooms on an average in a grade B hotel.  I want to suggest that that is an uneconomic size for the operation of hotels.  One of the results of this is that the rates charged for the type of accommodation available in those hotels is relatively too high. Miss Elizabeth Nicholas expressed the same point of view.  She said for the style of hotel, the charge was somewhat excessive for the size and standard offered.  We all agree that the British tourist is inclined to be price-conscious to a certain extent.  It is noteworthy that there was an increase in the number of British tourists last year but there is no corresponding increase shown in the revenue from hotels. Therefore, there seems to be a tendency for the British tourist to find unregistered accommodation.  That seems to me to point to the inadequacy of grade B hotels and also to their relatively high cost.</P>
    <P>People who know more about this business than I do have expressed the view that a more economic unit would be a 60 bedroom and upwards hotel. There is a very serious need for this type of hotel if we are to expand the tourist industry and cater adequately for the British market. We should encourage the building of more hotels of this type, the larger grade B hotel instead, of gearing ourselves to the American market.  This is being catered for adequately.  We should instead be gearing ourselves for the British market which is available to us.  I do not know whether the Minister would agree, in view of the shortcomings in this direction, that it would be desirable to provide larger grants from Bord Fáilte to encourage the building of this type of accommodation.</P>
    <P>I remember when the Minister was dealing with a subsidiary company, Córas Iompair Éireann, it was hinted that this would enable that subsidiary company to expand and promote the hotel industry.  I wonder has any consideration <Col N="908" /> been given to that because that subsidiary company have been very successful in providing grade A accommodation.  Would it not be desirable in the national interest that the enterprise available in that organisation should be directed towards the provision, around the country, of more grade B hotels of a larger size than exist at the present time?</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of the tourist industry is trying to even off the peak, trying to get more tourists to visit the country in what we regard as the off-season.  We have been making efforts in that direction but I believe the degree of success has not been very marked.  The season is still too short and this tends to be reflected in hotel costs.  It has an effect on the availability of trained staff.  I am sure the Minister and Bord Fáilte are conscious of the need to do everything possible to encourage off-peak tourists.  I notice that in many English resorts, they go to a great deal of trouble to get people to visit them during the off season.  I notice that these resorts, in May, particularly, are crowded with old age pensioners.  They go out of their way to provide accommodation for old age pensioners.  They extend the season by doing this.  They give those people special facilities and special rates.  Perhaps we could explore the possibility of doing the same thing here to try to extend the tourist season, keep hotels occupied for a longer period and thereby keep trained staff in employment. This would affect the overall cost and the economy of the hotel industry as such.</P>
    <P>I have already said I thought the British tourists were price-conscious. Perhaps people will not agree with this. In connection with that, may I say that I deplore the introduction by the shipping companies of the 5/- charge for sailing tickets for the 1966 season. Up to now people coming from England were required to make a deposit of 10/- for their sailing ticket and when they purchased their travel ticket that 10/- was reckoned against the cost.  In other words, there was no extra charge, because it was regarded as a deposit.  Now it is proposed that there will be a charge of 5/-, in addition <Col N="909" /> to the price of the ticket.  I wonder if the Minister has anything to say about this, in view of his policy of price control?  I consider it is an unnecessary irritant.  It is the Minister's responsibility because now we are not simply dealing with British Railways. The same applies to the B. and I., which concern is under the control of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned British Railways. We have often been critical of them in previous years in relation to tourists. I would like to say, having travelled recently on British Railways, on the mail steamer and on their trains, that I would commend them for the very great improvements they have made. Certainly the accommodation is very much improved from the days when we in this House criticised them for the service they gave to the tourist industry here.  I am sure the Minister would like to compliment them, because we, as I said, have often been very critical of them in the past.</P>
    <P>There is another unnecessary irritant, the airport charge.  This is under the control of the Minister.  Up to now there has been a 7/6d airport fee charge. I read in the papers today that that is to be increased to 10/- and that it will be effective from this year.  It will be effective on tours which have already been booked.  This means that the tourist agents will apparently be at the loss of this money.  I know the charge is small but it will be an irritant to them.  They will resent it. We spend a lot of money trying to encourage these people to channel tourists to this country.  I do not know whether the Minister, in his reply to this debate, will clarify the issue as to whether, in fact, this 10/- will apply this year, and to tours already booked.</P>
    <P>On the subject of air travel, another criticism that is made is that this country is the only one in Europe that lacks the benefit of inclusive tour fares by air on week-ends during the summer.  I am told this discourages foreign tour operators from selling inclusive tours to this country when week-end travel is involved.  We are increasingly entering an age when individuals do not themselves decide: &ldquo;I will go to a particular country; I will visit a particular place; I will plan my own <Col N="910" /> travel arrangements.&rdquo;  Now they go to a tourist agency and are sold a package tour.  It is essential to have the goodwill of the person behind the counter, the person selling the tours.  I believe that in every other European country a concession is given to these tour operators by way of reduced fares, but Aer Lingus will not allow reduced fares for week-end travel during the summer, so these operators will avoid selling tours to Ireland and will try to direct the traffic elsewhere.  I know there is a very good reason for this. I know there is an excessive demand on the seats by air during the week-ends in summer.  I know it is very good business for Aer Lingus not to make any concession during that peak period but I suggest it may not be very good business for the tourist industry as such.  I wonder would the Minister let us know what he thinks about this: whether this campaign is worth the candle, whether the gain to Aer Lingus is worth the possible loss to our very important tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the grade B hotels and their importance to the British market. I was rather alarmed recently to read in the <i>Belfast Newsletter</i> an article which was headed: &ldquo;Éire Misses the Holiday Boom&rdquo;.  When you read the Belfast and the Dublin papers, you sometimes get the impression that the papers in the North will report something bad about the South, and <i>vice versa</i>.  I thought this might be another one of that type of article, but I found that in fact they were quoting from the publication <i>Retail Business</i>.  I do not know the importance of this publication, but apparently it is a British publication. The article stated that between 1961 and 1964 the number of Britons going abroad increased by only two per cent but their expenditure abroad increased by 34 per cent, that during the four years the amount spent on holidays in Britain had fallen, but that Éire had suffered worse.  I quote:</P>
    <P>There has been a rapid decline in the popularity of Southern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister will agree with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I do not agree with it.  I think it is contrary to what we have seen.  We have increasing numbers coming from Britain. I wonder if our publicity on the other side is adequate and whether this sort of publication could be told the truth, because it appears to give a bad picture, and a picture that I do not think is correct.</P>
      <P>May I say a word now on the grading system, a difficult, thorny and vexed question, I am afraid?  I suggest this system requires re-examination.  To a great extent it seems to be historical. If a hotel gets into a particular grade, it tends to stay in that grade, and I am afraid account is not taken of occasions when its standard drops.  I also think the grading system is directed to physical considerations, improvements in the hotels, the size of the rooms, the number of bathrooms and lounges, etc., but no account is taken of the quality of the service and the administration of the hotel.  I think these are important. You can have much greater enjoyment in a hotel where the administration is right and the service particularly good, even though it may not have the same number of bathrooms or lounges as another hotel in which the atmosphere is cold and quite impersonal, and where you cannot feel very welcome.</P>
      <P>I am wondering also why an A star hotel in Killarney has that particular rating.  I believe it has not got central heating in all the rooms, and I thought that was a minimum requirement for an A star rating.  I also understand that the same hotel is not opening until 1st June this year.  We know that Killarney has a very important part to play in the tourist industry.  It is a great target for our American visitors who tend to go there during the summer.  I believe there is congestion in, and a shortage of, the A star hotel accommodation which they require in Killarney in May because of the attitude of this hotel in not opening until 1st June.  I am raising this because I think a lot of State money was invested in this hotel.  As it got a grant from the State, I am sure the Minister has some responsibility in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other point I want to deal with very briefly is the question of student <Col N="912" /> travel.  Perhaps students do not spend a good deal of money, but they make an important contribution to our tourist industry.  If they have been made to feel welcome and if they have enjoyed themselves, we can only hope that they will come back again when they have more money to spend.  Up to now these students have been accommodated almost exclusively in private houses.  I am not saying anything against the accommodation provided. I am sure it is very good, but I know that in Britain many of the residential schools provide accommodation for foreign students during the summer holidays.  In those schools they can provide classes and amusements which would probably make the stay of the students more enjoyable than when they are scattered in houses all around the city and trying to meet other foreign students to chat in their own language&mdash;as they invariably do.  I wonder would the Minister and Bord Fáilte consider encouraging our schools to make such accommodation available? I know there is at least one school in Dublin that does make its accommodation available to foreign students during the summer, but the majority of the schools do not.  This is a shortcoming because these students contribute something to our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>As I said, this is a very important industry and we should explore every avenue in order to encourage more people to visit Ireland, and in particular to enjoy their visit.</P>
