    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal purpose of this Bill is to give legislative effect to Financial Resolutions passed by the Dáil on 9th March and 14th June.  The Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the text of the Bill as introduced in Dáil Éireann sets out the broad scope of the various sections.  A number of amendments were made in the Bill during its passage through the Dáil, notably those relating to the increases in taxation which I announced in that House on 14th June.  I shall draw the attention of the Seanad to these important amendments.</P>
      <P>As usual, Part I of the Bill deals with income tax.  Section 1 raises the rate of income tax from 6/4 to 7/- in the £ and continues the existing rate of sur-tax.  The second section increases from £120 to £150 the income tax allowance in respect of a qualified child over eleven years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 provides that where a company submits its accounts and other appropriate information for any year <Col N="1160" /> to the Special Commissioners of Income Tax, the Commissioners are required to indicate within a specified period whether the company will be called upon to account for sur-tax on its undistributed profits.</P>
    <P>Sections 4, 5, 6, 21 and 22, which arise from the introduction of the British Corporation Tax, may be considered together.  Section 4 provides that British Corporation Tax paid on the British profits of Irish companies will be allowed as a credit against Irish corporation profits tax and income tax.  This is necessary because the British corporation tax, at 40 per cent, is higher than our corporation profits tax and, therefore, without this provision, Irish companies would be unable to get credit for the full amount of British tax paid.  The allowance of this &ldquo;overspill&rdquo; of British tax against Irish income tax will involve a loss of revenue.  To offset this, it is proposed in section 21 to increase the rates of Irish Corporation Profits Tax from 5 per cent to 7 per cent on the first £2,500 of profits and from 15 per cent to 23 per cent on the balance in excess of £2,500.  However, Irish companies carrying on business in this country will suffer no additional tax as a result of this increase because under section 5 of the Bill corporation profits tax will be allowable as a deduction in computing profits for income tax purposes. In the case of British companies operating here the increased Irish corporation profits tax which they will pay will be allowed as a credit against British corporation tax.  Section 6 is consequential on section 5 and section 22 amends the rules for granting credit in respect of British tax to take account of the new British corporation tax.</P>
    <P>In Sections 7 and 28 provision is made for the granting of tax allowances in respect of commercial glasshouses. Section 28 secures that capital expenditure incurred on or after 30th September, 1956 on buildings used for the purposes of growing produce in the course of a trade of market gardening will qualify for initial and annual allowances at the rate of 10 <Col N="1161" /> per cent.  Section 7 provides for a &ldquo;repairs&rdquo; allowance of one-third of the annual value in respect of similar expenditure incurred prior to 30th September, 1956.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with customs and excise, and implements the increases in duties on beer, spirits, hydrocarbon oils, tobacco, table waters, firearm certificate and motor vehicles announced on 9th March and 14th June. This part of the Bill also provides, in the case of tobacco, table waters, Irish wines and motor vehicles, for the commencement of the process of eliminating the protective elements in the duties on these items in pursuance of the Free Trade Area Agreement.  I might also mention that section 17 implements the budget proposal that the proceeds of the increase in motor vehicle duties should be used for general Exchequer purposes and not paid into the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with death duties.  Section 18 makes liable death benefits which are paid under the provisions of superannuation schemes or arrangements but in relation to which no enforceable right at law exists.  Payments under the Superannuation Acts come within the scope of this provision. The section also repeals section 5 of the Finance Act, 1945, which exempted from duty, in connection with the death of a member of the Defence Forces, certain deferred pay and gratuities granted in respect of his services.</P>
    <P>Section 19 extends the relief from estate duty provided by the Finance Act, 1965, in the case of benefits passing to the widow or dependent children of the deceased.  The limit on the value of estates within which the relief operates is being advanced from £15,000 to £25,000, with appropriate marginal relief.  The amount of the abatement of duty, in the case of a widow, is being increased from £250 to £350 and, in the case of each dependent child from £150 to £250.  It will be noted that these improved reliefs will take effect as from the passing of the Finance Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>Part IV, which contains only one section, is concerned with stamp duties. Its purpose is to permit of the compounding <Col N="1162" /> of the stamp duties on certain foreign bills and notes.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the provisions of Part V of the Bill which deals with corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>Part VI contains four sections relating to turnover tax.</P>
    <P>Section 23 imposes a 10 per cent rate of tax, with effect from 1st May; 1966, on payments made for or in connection with admissions to dances, and lays certain obligations on promoters of dances and proprietors of dance halls to ensure that adequate notification of dances is given to the Revenue Commissioners.  The increased rate of tax will not apply to a dance where the price of admission does not exceed four shillings and attendance is limited to one hundred.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of this part of the Bill relate to the administration of the tax.  Their purpose is to align procedures for turnover tax as closely as possible with those already in operation for income tax.  The powers of the Revenue Commissioners to make estimates of turnover tax are extended and there is a corresponding extension of the taxpayer's right of appeal to the Special Commissioners of Income Tax and to the courts.  Provision is also made to control the admission of late appeals and to facilitate the collection of tax from corporate and unincorporated bodies.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill deals with miscellaneous items.  Section 27 contains the customary provision with regard to the Capital Services Redemption Account.  It provides for the charging annually on the Central Fund of the sums necessary to redeem borrowings and pay the interest thereon.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to section 28 which provides for the granting of capital allowances to the commercial glasshouse industry.</P>
    <P>Section 29 extends the scope of &ldquo;exports&rdquo; relief to cover profits arising to an Irish company from processing goods on behalf of a foreign owner where the materials are imported into the State for processing and the finished goods exported.</P>
    <P>The registers of certain Government securities are now held by the Central Bank of Ireland.  It is, therefore, <Col N="1163" /> necessary to extend to that institution certain of the existing statutory provisions relating to the management of Government stocks and securities.  Section 30 does this.</P>
    <P>I have now dealt in general terms with the main provisions of this Bill. Detailed explanation and discussion is more appropriate to the Committee Stage when I shall be glad to deal with any queries.</P>
    <P>I understand that it is proposed to discuss, in conjunction with this Bill, two motions on the Order Paper regarding the NIEC Report on the Economic Situation.  Senators will, no doubt, be familiar with the opinions I expressed in the Dáil on a motion dealing with the Report and I do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by repeating them here at this stage.  I would prefer to hear the views of the proposers of these motions and to deal with them in my reply to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the terms of the motion come within the ambit of this debate.  The motion reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann notes the Report of the National Industrial Economic Council on the Economic Situation and calls on the Government to elaborate on their statement thereon and to indicate the practical steps they intend to take to implement the Council's recommendations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The speech which the Minister for Finance has delivered on this particular Bill is, I suppose, necessarily a very dry speech with very little meat in it.  The Minister says he hopes to give us more details about the terms of the Bill on the Committee Stage.  At this point I want to note that notwithstanding the new arrangements made for the purpose of transacting the financial business of the State earlier this year we are in exactly the same position now on this Finance Bill as if we had not dealt with the other Bill regarding the ordering of financial business earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> It passes my comprehension how we can be asked to pass a Bill designed to enable the Dáil and Seanad to discuss these various measures at some length.  We find today that we have fewer than ten days in which to discuss in this House the financial business and the economic condition of the country.  I do not suppose the Minister for Finance is entirely to blame for that; I suppose that is part of the way in which the Government transact business. However, notwithstanding the arrangements made, we find ourselves in the same position as we were last year and in preceding years.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister expects there will be many people, even on his own side of the House, who will congratulate him on this Bill or, to use the normal terminology, who will welcome its introduction.  There is nothing to be pleased about in a Bill that imposes more taxation and, in the redistribution of that taxation, we do not find any substantial part being diverted to social welfare benefits for the needy members of the community.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one thing in the Bill about which I should like to extend warm congratulations.  It is the part dealing with estate duty.  Last year, certain improvements by way of limiting the duty extractable from widows and orphans were introduced in section 29 of the Finance Bill.  I cannot be entirely complimentary on that action because it has been found necessary to repeal certain provisions of section 29 and replace them with others which are clearer and which, of course, are more generous, but it is well for the House to note, and the Minister is to be congratulated on it, that certain beneficial provisions have been applied retrospectively.  The Minister is being more generous in the remission of estate duty payable by widows and by children of deceased persons.  It is something we must note with particular pleasure and congratulate the Minister on.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I should like to stress that that is probably the only useful part of the Bill from the point of view of the taxpayers.  Otherwise, it is a measure which increases taxation all round.  One has at this time, and <Col N="1165" /> the country has as well, a certain feeling of disappointment and doubt at the way things have gone during the past 12 to 18 months.  As far as I can see, nothing has been said or done by the Government to relieve the general despondency which has settled down over the people.  The prospect of appointing a Minister for Labour holds out some hope but I do not think the appointment of the same person as Minister for Labour who had charge and responsibility for industrial relations up to now will make any substantial difference in the condition of industrial unrest which is so marked a feature of life in this country.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the new Minister for Labour, when he sheds the other responsibilities, has only to concentrate on one issue and that something beneficial will result from that concentration of thought and responsibility. I rather think that will be over the long term rather than the short term.  I do not see at the present time any real indication that matters will improve as rapidly as we all wish them to.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about the economy, in the Dáil and among the public generally, during the past few months.  So far I have not heard any Minister indicate what has brought about the present position. Why is it that there is no money in the country for ordinary private industry, no money for loans for local authorities?  Why is it that grants have been cut down so much?  I have not heard any explanation as to why that has happened.  Where is the money that should be available for financing the public services?  What has happened that it is not there?  If we were given some sort of authoritative diagnosis by the Government, people would take heart at the fact that at least the Government had diagnosed the causes and that they might be able to apply the cures.</P>
    <P>It is all right to blame the weather. We have always had bad weather. We have had a share of industrial unrest from time to time and other causes have contributed in greater or less degree to our present situation. <Col N="1166" /> I should like to hear the Minister, when he concludes the Second Stage, give us his opinion of what the causes are of the present discontent and then prescribe what he believes and the Government believe are the appropriate remedies.  The Government have the duty to do that and people are looking to the Government and to Parliament for some indication of when we are likely to get out of our present difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is easy to fall into the temptation of going back on the pre-election promises of the present Government. We all know that people were led into the belief that all they had to do was elect a Fianna Fáil Government and all would be well.  I shall not go to the trouble of taking out the numerous statements by Ministers saying how vitally necessary it was that there should be no change of Government. The Taoiseach urged the people that it was essential to elect another Fianna Fáil Government to keep the Second Programme going strongly. The people have elected a Fianna Fáil Government and the Second Programme is not going strongly and the people have not been told yet what has happened that there has been such a freezing-up of credit and a slowing down of economic development generally.</P>
    <P>I suggest there is something fundamentally wrong with the Government of this country not only during the past 12 months but for quite some time past.  I believe that the Taoiseach does not understand what the difficulty is.  He said the other afternoon in the Dáil on the Ministers and Secretaries Bill that he had urged his Ministers to get out and go to dinners, openings of garages, openings of race tracks, and parties of one kind or another, in order to keep in touch with public opinion.  He thought it was a vital part of the functions and duties of Ministers that they should keep in touch with public opinion.</P>
    <P>I think the best way in which members of the Government could reestablish contact with public opinion would be to go into Opposition for a while.  They would meet a great many people who have complaints.  When <Col N="1167" /> the Minister for Finance goes to a party, or a dinner, or the opening of some garage or race track, or something of that kind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about why Ministers fail to keep in touch with public opinion.  They are going to these types of gatherings where they cannot get the criticisims the Taoiseach thinks they will get.  The fact of the matter is that they do not, and they have lost touch with public opinion.</P>
      <P>Members of the Opposition are receptacles for all the complaints, wails, discontent, and justified grouses and grievances the people have against the Government.  We hear them all, and we are very much in touch with public opinion.  Indeed, it may have surprised some people that there has been such a favourable reaction generally in the community to our Irish language policy.  Everyone knew that certain interests would cry out against what is being done, but one gets a very favourable reaction from the community in general.  The Government have lost touch with people on that aspect of life in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we have to do is look over the record.  They brought in a Succession Bill during the previous session and I do not believe that there was one person in the country, apart from the <Col N="1168" /> people who drafted it, who agreed with the provisions of that Bill.  They were so bad that the Government had to take the very unusual course of withdrawing the Bill completely, and introducing a new Part IX and Part X which saved face and, at the same time, went a considerable distance to meet the clamant public opinion about that Bill.  The fact that that happened clearly shows that at that time the Government did not know what the people were thinking about.</P>
    <P>We have the same position at present in relation to the Fisheries Bill and it was the same Minister who introduced both the Succession Bill and the Fisheries Bill.  One can confidently anticipate that he will be leaving the Department of Agriculture for that reason.  He has brought in a Fisheries Bill, and no one agrees with the sections dealing with licences for ordinary fishing.  To my mind, this indicates that the Minister has lost touch with public opinion, and this is a Minister who one would have thought would be well in touch with public opinion judging by the many social contacts he makes it his business to keep.</P>
    <P>We have had the dreadful sections in the Land Bill, and we have had what to my mind is much more relevant to a debate of this kind, the nefarious sections in the Finance Act, 1963, and the Finance Act of last year which again showed a miscalculation on the part of the Government.  I am referring to the provision in the Finance Act, 1963, which involves disclosure of the deposits of citizens of this country in the banks.  I am told most reliably&mdash; and one hears it said not infrequently by bank managers and others&mdash;that a great deal of money left the country when that provision was introduced. The Minister may have some statistics to show that is not so, or that the outflow was not as great as people think, but we do not know what amount of money did not go on deposit for the future because of this new provision.</P>
    <P>I am told by bank managers that loans of £1,500, £1,800 or £3,000 for buying a piece of land or for putting an addition on to a house, or something of that nature, to farmers or people in small towns, were usually <Col N="1169" /> made with money regularly on deposit with the banks and that they have never been able to make those loans since.  It was a ghastly error on the part of the Government to put that section in the Bill and I am greatly surprised that they have not removed it.</P>
    <P>In the Finance Bill last year there was a new provision in relation to the aggregation of married women's property with policy moneys in the estate of the deceased upon his death.  To my mind that measure was the grossest breach of faith which the Government could be guilty of towards the thrifty section of the community.  It was the last shot in the armoury of an insurance inspector who was trying to persuade someone to take out one of these policies that upon the death of the person the policy would be liable to a lower rate of duty than the rest.  It was a great incentive to people to take out these policies, and it is a provision that has been in the Finance Act for as long as estate duty has been levied. It has been there for 50 or 60 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am subject to correction on that, but it has been in vogue for a long time.  The fact is that people now have no faith in savings of any kind because they feel that if they do save their efforts may be negatived by a section in a Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister for his serious consideration that we live in a free society.  We believe in private enterprise.  I know my colleagues in the Labour benches would not agree that anyone in a case of this kind should be entitled to beat the Revenue Commissioners because he is able to get round the law.  We have a private enterprise economy where we believe in private enterprise and the right of the individual within the law so to <Col N="1170" /> order his affairs that he does not bear the same kind of burden as if he did not know the law and made different provision.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable&mdash;and it has always been so&mdash;that where there are penal provisions in a statute, clever people, people who set their minds to it, will try to get around the rigours of that statute.  What is happening in this country is that in order to catch the few, many small estates have been penalised.  It is extremely regrettable that confidence in the continued existence of a particular statutory provision should be abolished, in that way creating a disincentive to savings.</P>
    <P>However, as I say, I do appreciate and I am very glad the Minister on the death duties under a will has on this occasion made some amends and, indeed, I should like to pay tribute here, which I have been unable to do on a previous occasion, to Senator Dr. Ryan for the liberality he showed in earlier Finance Acts in raising the estate duty allowance from £2,000 to £5,000.</P>
    <P>The present Bill follows the same format as all previous Bills in relation to income tax, customs and excise, death duties, stamp duties, corporation profits tax and turnover tax.  The Minister has made no attempt to try to devise new methods of raising finance to meet the commitments which it is recognised have to be met. Indeed, it occurs to me that there is nothing in this Finance Bill to provide any kind of a stimulus to the economy nor do I see that any of the moneys raised here will be used in any way so as to have an appreciable effect on the welfare of the community.</P>
    <P>The payroll tax was recently introduced in England.  I only mention that because of the bad effect, I think, that payroll tax will have on this community. It is clear that people who were of a mind in England to invest their money in the various services there will no longer do so but that they will try to find many outlets here for the money which they would otherwise have invested in those services but for the payroll tax.  I can see a situation developing in this country in <Col N="1171" /> which those people will in increasing numbers and with increasing amounts of money invest here the money they cannot use in England for investing in the various kinds of services there to which the payroll tax would apply.  I believe the time has come for the Minister for Finance to take note of that and of the fact that much too much foreign money is coming into this country and being used for no other purposes than to buy out and establish large retail businesses in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not think the economy benefits by one halfpenny if a businessman comes in here and buys out a retail store.  What happens then is that thereafter all the profits made by Irish companies and Irish concerns go across the water to England.  The net result is that there is less employment very frequently for Irish boys and girls and men and women in the retail trade, certainly in the upper echelons of the retail trade.  The profits which would otherwise be distributed and largely spent in this country are siphoned over the water to England.  The time has come to investigate this phenomenon before it gets too late because those big supermarkets are doing nothing to increase wealth in this country.  They are doing nothing for economic development, as far as I can see, nor do I think that they are doing a single thing to bring down prices or keep the cost of living stable.  It is in that kind of context that the Minister for Finance, if we are not captured by free trade in Britain, should begin to think in terms of a form of tax that would arrest the growth of profitless investment in this country.  When I say &ldquo;profitless&rdquo; I mean that the net result is that profits go out of the country.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have some regard to the fact that a great many small business people, chemists, grocers, traders and the like, are in grave danger and in great uncertainty because of the development of these useless supermarkets from an economic point of view.  I know that in the area in which I live such a large organisation is about to take over and, of <Col N="1172" /> course, one sees businesses already closing down in advance and other small businesses, which have been giving quite good services and providing the goods as cheaply as the bigger ones, will probably have to face eventual destruction.  This is a matter about which the Government should be concerned and it is a matter which perhaps might be dealt with by an appropriate fiscal policy.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the great need at the present time is to introduce some kind of harmony into the relationship between labour and management and, on the other hand, to harness that harmony to the kind of economic projects which the Government want to see realised in their Second Programme for Economic Expansion. To date, I do not see any indication on the part of the Government taking a lead to organise the resources of the community in the kind of way that will inspire confidence between management and labour and between management and Government and bring about the necessary expansion in the development of industry and trade generally.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that at this late stage, only the other day, the Taoiseach in the Dáil referred to the prices and incomes policy with this comment &ldquo;whatever that may mean&rdquo;.  This is something that has been well thought out by the NIEC, has been the subject of a very learned and lengthy report by them and has the advantage of having the blessing of management, labour and other interests.  Nonetheless, we had the Taoiseach speaking of a prices and incomes policy in terms of &ldquo;whatever that may mean&rdquo;.  Of course, part of the difficulty the Taoiseach finds himself in at the present time is that he does not like the military exercise of &ldquo;about turn&rdquo;.  He has had to do that far too often in the recent past and he is getting tired of it.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that a prices and incomes policy almost on the same lines as that indicated in the NIEC report was adumbrated in the Fine Gael policy <i>Towards a Just Society,</i> and, of course, the Taoiseach at the height of the election campaign dismissed <Col N="1173" /> the whole document as being as unnecessary as the fifth wheel on a motor car.  Then he went on in a speech in Mullingar which the Minister is tired of hearing about to say that he would have nothing to do with a prices and incomes policy.  &ldquo;If we are in Government we shall not implement it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and if in opposition we shall oppose it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Nonetheless he makes an about turn last November and gets up at a meeting of some group out in Skerries and proceeds to tell the country what is involved in a prices and incomes policy. Evidently he was reading from a prepared script at that time, because his latest indication is that he does not know what a prices and incomes policy is.  It seems to me that a departure such as the introduction of a worthwhile and practical prices and incomes policy would be of the greatest benefit to the country.  It would give some assurance to the workers of participation in an increased national product, and would also enable industrialists who have to compete with outsiders to cost in advance with some certainty the prices of their products.</P>
    <P>I have had the experience of meeting recently a large industrialist who complained bitterly of the present Government&mdash;and he is a supporter of the present Government&mdash;because he had lost one order for £200,000 and another for £300,000 because he could not possibly fulfil them because of the increased wages.  He was moaning into his glass of beer and asking us why we did not do something about it.  That is not the kind of thing, I think, that the Taoiseach's Ministers hear, apparently, at the various functions which the Taoiseach exhorts them to attend, or if they do they do not do anything about it.  I believe that a prices and incomes policy would go a great distance to eliminate this uncertainty from which both labour and management suffer at present.  The only authority that can bring both these parties together is the Government.  I believe that that should be a function of either the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Taoiseach or some other Minister.  That is one of the things <Col N="1174" /> that is contained in the NIEC report, and notwithstanding all that has been said about that by the Minister in the Dáil and by the Taoiseach it does not seem from the Taoiseach's latest acquaintanceship with this idea that we are any nearer to establishing a prices and incomes policy in this country.</P>
    <P>We all know the basic reason for the present unrest in the country.  It was a gross error on the part of the Taoiseach to think that he could get a wages agreement lasting for two and half years.  The trade unions had no doubt at all that it was not going to last for two and half years, because the ink was scarcely dry on the agreement when there were rows as to what was intended by certain sections in it. The Taoiseach was very prominent in the negotiations which culminated in this great national agreement, but I have not seen any activity on the part of the Taoiseach in the last twelve months in trying to bring about industrial peace.  Nothing has been done by him.</P>
    <P>He is going to remain in office until June, 1970, we are told, and he does not have to busy himself about these things.  I would have thought that even before this wretched Electricity Supply Bill was introduced the Taoiseach would have done something to try to bring the parties together, but he has not done that.  It was a fundamental flaw, and showed a great lack of understanding of how the trade unions work and how the people who pay contributions to the trade unions work, to think that the secretaries, presidents and officials of the various trade unions, who are in receipt of reasonably good salaries, were to sit back for two and a half years and make no demand upon the employers. The thing was quite absurd from the start.  There has been no recognition of that fact even to this date.  I think that the sooner that the Ministers, instead of going to social gatherings&mdash; and I intend to discuss this point on the Ministers and Secretaries Bill&mdash; should get themselves invited to meetings with trade unionists and find out what way trade unions react and how <Col N="1175" /> various things come before executive committees, branch meetings, and general meetings of the unions, and get some kind of inkling into the demands, hopes and aspirations of the people who work in industry.  When they get that there will be less criticism of an idea from the NIEC of a prices and incomes policy of the kind we have had from the Taoiseach in his sneering remark &ldquo;Whatever that may be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am no expert on agriculture.  That, I suppose, could go without saying, but I cannot but be surprised at the wholesale resignations from the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  I had heard that these were going to take place, and I do not understand what the Minister for Agriculture is doing in order to bring about a situation where, if we carry on an intensive advertising campaign for the sale of bacon in Britain, we can put the people who carry on that advertising campaign in a position to meet the demands made on them as a result of it.  The Minister for Agriculture went on one of those trips abroad, to Germany, I think it was in Cologne, and when he came back from Cologne, he said that there were unlimited markets for Irish agricultural produce abroad, or words to that effect.</P>
    <P>When Senator Dr. Ryan was Minister for Finance in the first Budget he introduced he set aside a certain sum of money for adaptation of industry and as I understood it at that time for the exploitation of foreign markets and their development for our industry and agriculture.  I must say that I do not know what efforts have been made or any great success that has attended these efforts, but I do know that the Minister for Agriculture told us that there were markets abroad and that we should go and get them.  At the same time, when apparently we are able to sell bacon to Britain we are not able to fill the orders that are made.  That is only symptomatic of what is going on, and it is profoundly disturbing to think that the lives of the rural population and the future of agriculture in this country are dependent upon people who have that knowledge of what is <Col N="1176" /> available and do nothing to make that available to the Irish farmer.</P>
    <P>The NIEC report also deals with the building industry, and indeed the Finance Act, 1965, had something to say about the building industry.  I am greatly disappointed that the Minister for Finance has done nothing in this Bill to bring some clarity into the provisions of Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965, which dealt with the development of land.  I can tell the Minister that there are no two lawyers in this country who will agree as to what is the interpretation of many of the provisions of Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965.  I very much doubt if those who drafted it, the people who gave out the subheads to the Parliamentary Draftsman, knew what they wanted to achieve and knew the kind of exceptions they wanted to make.  It is something which has caused a great deal of heart-searching in the building industry.  At a time when the building industry requires a stimulus rather than the reverse, it would seem to me that it would have been better to repeal the whole of Part VII and substitute it by something more intelligible and workable.</P>
    <P>Indeed, a comment that applies to most legislation dealing with taxation is that the only people who really understand what is contained in the legislation are those who administer it because most of them administer a few sections at a time and become experts on it.  They understand it for the simple reason that it is what they say is the interpretation, unless an unfortunate taxpayer decides he will go to court and, in most of the cases as we know, the taxpayer can only go to court after he has first of all lodged the money in court&mdash;maybe £13,000, £15,000 or, perhaps, £18,000 as we have seen recently in a particular case&mdash;and then waits his chance for a judicial interpretation with no certainty because there never can be any certainty that he will succeed.  It seems to me that there is a great deal of injustice done to people and a great deal of duty paid that they probably are not liable to pay in those less clear sections of the Revenue Acts because of the utterly impossible way in which those sections are worded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> It is a strange commentary upon section 29 of the Finance Act, 1965, that what should have been perfectly clear if people wanted to say: &ldquo;a widow shall be entitled to an abatement of so much&rdquo;, &ldquo;a child shall be entitled to an abatement of so much&rdquo; that that could not be said in a way that anybody reading it would be able to say&mdash;&ldquo;That is what it means and it cannot mean anything else&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The building industry, from what I know of it, has been greatly perturbed about the provisions of Part VII.  It is not affecting the people who are, in fact, making the money and whom the section was designed to catch but it has become quite impossible for the ordinary builders to know where they stand because of the complicated provisions of this particular Act.  At a time when the NIEC report expresses some concern about the slowing down of the building industry, it is altogether regrettable that they should find themselves harassed by the provisions of Part VIII, well intentioned though these provisions may have been.</P>
    <P>As I understand the position, we are within a few days of the application of the Free Trade Area between this country and Great Britain.  I do not know of anything substantial being done in order to prepare industry and the people who derive their livelihood from it for the competition about to come upon them.  I do not know of anything the Minister has in mind, any financial provisions, which are available in order to help industry.  I gather that, indeed, the financial provisions which were available to industry up to now were not that readily taken up by industry in order to fit themselves for the rigours of the time to come.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Government in the coming months, after they have taken the usual summer rest, will get down to a very full examination of the needs of industry.  When I say the Government, I mean the Government themselves; not doing it by their civil servants. I believe that until our Ministers spend more time thinking about the problems which confront the <Col N="1178" /> country, discussing day in and day out with their advisers ways and means of resolving them, we will never have the kind of firm and uniform direction of policy this country needs at this time more than anything else.  If the Government, for whatever length of time they continue in office, spend more of their time discussing the problems with which we are confronted, examining them, teasing them, being advised about them, getting further information and so on, we can hope that, even if they do not adopt the kind of policies which the NIEC recommend or even the policies which have been advocated by the Opposition in this House and in the Dáil, even their own policies, thought out by themselves and properly co-ordinated, they will confer a greater benefit on the community than has resulted from the sporadic and unco-ordinated efforts up to the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this Bill the Government are in the dock on many counts.  There is a long list of their failures and shortcomings now in the minds of the people of the country, and before us in this Bill.  It all arises from the trick which was played on the people in the April, 1965, general election when they appealed to the people to &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On&rdquo;, that there were great prospects for the country, that they did not know how to avail of the opportunities quickly enough in order to take advantage of the prosperity which was offering.  They dangled the Second Programme for Economic Expansion before the people, quoted estimates and figures from it, tried to impress the people and get their support for it.  They told the people that they never had it so good, the country was prospering and that they should keep Fianna Fáil in office in order to avail of the advantages coming from the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.  This was an artificial temporary period of prosperity, deliberately created for the purpose of winning the general election.  But it was the taxpayers' money and the national finances that were used for the purpose of creating that temporary prosperity which resulted in the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1179" /> Party winning the election by a margin of a few seats in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>But now the chickens have come home to roost.  We find that, in fact, the general election was a massive confidence trick and that the opportunities which the Government pretended were there for expansion and prosperity, in fact, did not exist.  We have a situation now that the country is almost £750 million in debt and that is a lot of money considering that the country was not one penny in debt in 1922 when we took over our own responsibilities here for the management of our own affairs.  But worse still&mdash; it is costing the taxpayers over £50 million to pay interest on this national debt and this £50 million has to be paid in hard cash.  It is collected from the people in the form of taxation of various kinds, direct and indirect, and rich and poor alike must subscribe towards payment of this interest of £50 million per year on a national debt of something of the order of £750 million now chalked up by the Fianna Fáil Party.  We have now reached a situation in which the Government have found it necessary to seek loans outside this country&mdash;loans which would enable the country to pay for capital projects and special schemes which have been embarked on, which have not yet been completed and which must be completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already this year we have had two Budgets.  We had the Budget of the 9th March, about six weeks before the normal time, because the Government were so badly off for money that they had to bring in an early Budget to make ends meet and keep things going. Then, when the Government found themselves in this position we discovered that the Electricity Supply Board were able to float a loan and get £7 million in less than an hour from the citizens of this country.  They were able to fill that loan because the people had confidence in the administration there.  They were not afraid to invest their money in the ESB.  As soon as the ESB got the money the Government had to take it from them, on loan, of course, for the purpose of meeting the Government's commitments <Col N="1180" /> in relation to the salaries of civil servants, other public servants and also for special projects at that time.</P>
    <P>Since then it was necessary for the Government to bring in a second Budget on the 14th June.  That Budget was introduced, it was said, to pay for some of the benefits which they decided to make available to the farming community. While the farming community had to fight hard for higher returns they were watching everybody else about to get an increase of £50 per person per year.  There was no prospect for the farmers to get an increase although they were able to show that their costs had risen considerably by reason of the Government's action with regard to increased taxation and higher prices.  We had this Budget brought in at that time.  Would it be possible for the Minister, when he is replying, to say if he intends to bring in an autumn Budget in addition to the two Budgets he has already brought in this year?  In his Budget statement on 9th March he indicated that he might come back with another one in the autumn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he did not say that.  The only thing I can say is that he indicated in the course of his speech that he might find it necessary to come back again in the autumn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we have the assurance I wanted from the Minister. He says that he came back on 14th June with his second Budget.  It is hard to know why the Minister, when he realised that he was not making ends meet, as the Minister for Finance is supposed to do, did not do so in his first Budget.  He may offer the excuse that he did not know how much he was going to pay the farmers but the farmers were not the only people provided for in the Budget of the 14th June.  The Minister must have known about that but apparently he did not budget for it.  He may have decided that things were bad enough and that <Col N="1181" /> he did not want to impose greater taxation before the Presidential election. That is what happens with Fianna Fáil Governments all the time. They operate their policies for Party political purposes and for the benefit of the Fianna Fáil Party and those who stand to benefit from the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>The Second Programme for Economic Expansion, which was used so much in the general election campaign of 1965, has not even got off the ground and there is very little prospect that it will at this stage.  It has failed in several respects in spite of the fact that the Taoiseach said that the aims set out in that programme would be achieved by the end of the period for which it was designed.  If the aims are likely to be achieved by that time the Taoiseach has certainly a few problems to tackle.  First of all, there are 44,000 fewer people employed now than was envisaged in the programme for this time.  Apart from that, let us remember that there are 167,000 fewer people employed now than there were ten years ago.  The number is still falling.</P>
      <P>There is a stampede from the land. Every year anything from 15,000 to 20,000 fly from the land.  Apparently the Government have no policy to arrest that stampede and to encourage people to work and live on the land. If there was a living for them there I have no doubt that people would stay in their own localities and live in their own homes instead of locking the door, emigrating to England and coming back at Christmas and maybe for the summer holidays to air the house or get a neighbour to do so. That is the trend in many parts of the country at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing campaign has as good as collapsed.  A very small percentage of houses are being built now compared with the number of houses built during either period of the inter-Party Government, particularly in the years 1956 and 1957.  The number of houses built in those two years was far greater than the number under way at the present time.  In Swords people are living in converted farm sheds, shacks, overcrowded dwellings, caravans and any <Col N="1182" /> kind of shelter they can get.  Arrangements were made to provide 150 cottages as quickly as possible.  That programme was held up for months and then a year.  Now we find the situation is that finance will be made available only for approximately one-third of those houses this year.  There is no assurance that, in fact, the finance will be given for those houses at that time.  A contract has been passed by the county council.  It has been approved by the Department of Local Government but the finance is not available.</P>
    <P>But before the last general election, Fianna Fáil candidates went around to those unfortunates in the shacks, caravans and converted farm sheds telling them to let Lemass lead on and they would be in new houses sooner than they had hoped.  That is the prospect for the people of Swords.  The picture is the same in every other part of the country.  I do not accuse Ministers of accommodating their own areas in regard to housing.  I presume the provision of finance for housing is as bad in the area of the Minister for Finance as it is in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>Every other year, the Government have gone to the people for a national loan, the last one being for £25 million. By a certain method of fiddling, if you like so to describe it, they pretended that loan was oversubscribed.  Then the credit situation got so bad that the Government had to seek loans outside the country.  It began with the American loan application which we failed to get.  Then the Germans, beaten flat in the last war, came to the rescue. Then the World Bank provided a small loan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>A number of factory projects collapsed despite very substantial grants being approved and sanctioned for them.  Some of them did not even get off the ground.  On top of that we have this colossal bill, the highest ever required to be subscribed by fewer than 3 million people &mdash; if I count the able-bodied people, fit to work, fit to earn wages, salaries, profits, the number would be fewer than 1½ million.  We are a great little country when one thinks of the heavy taxation per head being demanded of us.  I should be interested to hear from the Minister the taxation per head of the able-bodied people of this country. It must be very high in relation to other countries.  Part of this money is being provided for the Department of the Gaeltacht and in passing I should like to mention that it was Fine Gael who established that Department and appointed a Minister for the Gaeltacht in spite of bitter opposition from Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If Fianna Fáil were men of principle and were prepared to stand over what they had said about the Department's establishment they should have abolished that Department. Instead, the present Minister for Finance took it over and to his credit he did a good job there.  I mention this because a lot of people do not realise it was Fine Gael who set up this Department under a separate Minister.  At the moment it is thought a Department of Labour is required having regard to the circumstances of the time.  Nobody will dispute it.  We are all interested in seeing who the Government will appoint and, generally speaking, what the terms of reference of that Department will be.  It is needed as badly as the Department of the Gaeltacht was when Fine Gael set it up.  It is necessary to deal here with several of the improvements carried out by the Department of the Gaeltacht in Fíor-Ghaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the difficult situation to which Fianna Fáil has led the country, the Road Fund is being raided and the people who subscribed to the Road Fund, motor vehicle owners, owners of 20-ton and 30-ton trucks who pay fabulous taxes, make up this huge Road Fund.  We see people being killed on roads which are incapable of taking the volume of traffic because the money subscribed to the Road Fund is not being spent on road-making and road-mending.  Let me return to housing.  It is difficult now for people to obtain loans towards the building of private dwellings.  Before the general election, outside financiers were helping the position and there was a very good trade in these house-purchase loans.  One result of the collapse of this type of building is that the number of people employed in the building industry has fallen by approximately one-third and it is <Col N="1185" /> likely to fall further if finance cannot be made available.</P>
    <P>In the past we often heard the Government criticising their opponents, when they were in Government, for a small rise in the cost of living, but the rise in the cost of living, according to the recent figures, has been very steep and it has a very widespread effect on the citizens in general.  They all have to contribute towards it.  The cost of living is bound up with the general system of taxation.  The increased prices and costs that follow from taxation deliberately imposed by the Government put a very heavy charge on wages and earnings when people have to meet those higher costs particularly for essentials such as food, clothing and rents.</P>
    <P>As a result of the bungling of the Government there are 40,000 tenants of Corporation houses in the city of Dublin who will be required to pay rents higher than the economic cost of the house itself.  There are people who went into those houses on a rent of less than £2 a week which was calculated to be the all-in economic cost of providing those houses in which they are living.  Now, as a result of the difficult financial situation, those people have been notified that a new system of charges is to be applied.  They are to be charged per room, and the net result is that many people who were paying £2 a week maximum, or less, will have their rents increased to £4 10s a week, although they are living in houses the economic cost of which would bring a rent of far less than that.  In all spheres of our activity we now find people who are contributing towards the cost of Government mismanagement. We are in such a position now that there seems to be no way out except the imposition of very heavy taxes, but the imposition of those taxes brings higher costs and makes conditions still more difficult for the people.</P>
    <P>In this Budget I see that it is proposed to apply a dance tax of ten per cent on the profits of dancehall proprietors. Apparently they have no further political prestige so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned.  We remember the famous letter: &ldquo;Dear <Col N="1186" /> Miss Morris,&rdquo; from the Taoiseach, telling her that the dance tax at that time was deplorable, and that if elected the Fianna Fáil Party would remove it. Now a tax of ten per cent is to be imposed because, apparently, their votes are either no longer available to, or no longer required by, the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>All these costs have also put up the local rates, the rates being paid on agricultural land, on commercial premises and on private houses.  Who could ever have imagined in the past that people would be paying rates of £3 in the £ in respect of their property, and I believe they are up to £4 in the £ in some areas down the country?  That is a fabulous tax.</P>
    <P>These very high rates include the cost of a number of services, and the most costly service at present is the health service.  We all remember that when Senator Dr. Ryan was Minister for Finance and he was bringing in the health services, he gave an undertaking and advanced the argument that the health service which he proposed to bring in would not involve more than 1/6 in the £.  Instead of that there are very few ratepayers who are now paying less than 30/- in the £ towards the cost of the health services. All this adds up to political twisting by the Government.  They change from one thing to another, not for the benefit of the nation, but for the benefit of the Party.  They have dropped policies and they have adopted policies, all the time keeping an eye on whether the Party would benefit from those policies and whether they would get extra votes from those policies.</P>
    <P>Last year we were to have had local elections but it did not suit Fianna Fáil to have them so they were postponed.  This year it did not suit Fianna Fáil to have the local elections and they were postponed again.  Now we understand that the Minister for Local Government is bringing in a Bill which will compel himself and his Party to have county council and corporation elections next year.  These corporations and county councils are so long in operation now <Col N="1187" /> that many people have forgotten when the last local elections took place.</P>
    <P>It is this kind of manipulation to which the Fianna Fáil Party have lent themselves for so long that has brought the country to the stage where there is now a complete lack of confidence in the minds of the people, where there is a gloomy outlook, and where we can see no prospect of remedying the situation.  We are told that if we suffer on and bear it until 1968 there may be a turn for the better.  Then, again, of course, Fianna Fáil will be getting ready for another general election.  In the meantime it is difficult to understand why the Fianna Fáil Party will not realise that there is more at stake than their Party, that the nation is at stake at present, and the citizens of the country.</P>
    <P>We have a bank strike in progress at the moment which has caused a good deal of inconvenience to the commercial community.  Apparently no effort has been made by the Government to bring about a settlement one way or the other.  They have just left the proprietors and the staffs of the banks to fight it out between themselves. Surely a banking service must be regarded as a national service. There is no State bank in this country in which the people could have accounts and conduct their business. There are State banks in some other countries and people have an account in a commercial bank and in the State bank.  People here have no option but to transact business with the commercial banks and, realising that, the Government should have taken action to ensure that a banking service would be available to the people.  Instead, apparently, the Government carried on as if there were no bank strike in progress or that it did not mean anything to the people of the country.</P>
    <P>It is causing considerable losses in some businesses.  Business in certain large commercial concerns in Dublin has dropped considerably, and that can be traced directly to the inaction of the Government in relation to the bank strike which is in progress and also in relation to a number of other <Col N="1188" /> stoppages which exist at the present time.  They are causing great hardship to families who are involved in these stoppages, considerable hardships, and they are leaving some of the businesses actually in jeopardy which, of course, will result in the long run in a further drop in the number of employed people here.  If we do have a drop in the number of employed people we can expect that it will be necessary for the Minister for Finance to increase taxation and take from the people a greater proportion of their earnings than they are subscribing at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish at the outset to refer to the motion standing in my name and that of Senator Brosnahan.  This was an effort by us to get this highly important report discussed calmly and objectively in Seanad Éireann, and discussed while it was yet relevant and fresh in the minds of the people.  While I must, indeed, pay tribute to the handling of business by Seanad Éireann during this term&mdash;more time was made available for debates and for motions&mdash;it is a pity that it was not possible to get as far as this highly important motion until now.</P>
      <P>A great deal of what is in the report has changed somewhat, or its prognostications have not really been borne out, unfortunately.  However, it is better late than never, so we can get to this report, and, in getting to it, we must pay tribute to the great work done by the NIEC.  But it is fantasic to think that in a country in which our whole livelihood and future depend on agriculture such a body is without a solitary representative of the agricultural organisations.  Indeed, not one of the members, as far as I can make out, is in any way associated with agriculture or its problems.  That is a shocking condemnation of the lopsided manner in which this highly important committee is allowed to function and continue to function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, if we do nothing else in this debate, to impress on the Government the urgency of ensuring that members are added to this body representing the agricultural <Col N="1189" /> point of view.  At the same time, they should ensure that experts in the field of agriculture are added to it.  I should like to see a man like the Secretary of An Bord Bainne on such a body. Indeed, one would think that he should be <i>ex officio</i> a member of such a body. We have some very celebrated economists in the country who are devoted to what is regarded as the cinderella of economics, the economics of agriculture.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants the names of these men I shall be glad to give them. They know the problems of the industry and know the contribution they could make to our welfare, and it is high time they were put on this body.</P>

      <P>The Minister might also bear in mind that the Secretary of An Bord Bainne makes an important contribution to the economy. He does so with such distinction that his addition to this body would increase its effectiveness.  This Committee has made a great impact on the Government and on the public.  In fact, I think Deputy Declan Costello quite rightly pointed out last week in his speech that the centre of power and discussion is moving out of the Dáil and the Seanad into such bodies.  That is unfortunate.  It is something that should be remedied and at a later stage in my contribution I hope to return to the dire position in which we find ourselves at present.  I appeal to the Minister to modernise both Houses of the Oireachtas and the committee system so that we can make our contribution towards solving some of the present difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that most Members have <Col N="1190" /> studied the report fairly extensively and are familiar with the many newspaper articles and other comments that have been made on it.  Suffice it to say that the report does diagnose what happened here since 1960.  It shows that we are becoming increasingly less competitive, and each section has been trying to get more and more of the national cake rather than concentrate on enlarging the national cake.  Personal expenditure is increasing at a faster rate than our individual output.  Consequently, our products are becoming less and less competitive and the balance of trade, as the figures given show, is forecast at £50 million for 1965.</P>
    <P>There is some ground for hoping that that may be a slight overestimation. It is an alarming figure. Alarming as well is the figure given for the fall in our external reserves which are going down faster.  Then, again, personal savings are falling. While we are conscious of the work done by the Savings Committee, we are also conscious of the fact that there has been no real novel approach to savings in this country over the past 10 years.</P>
    <P>It is always the same exhortation and there is no new thinking on the part of the Government to tap additional sources of savings.  Above all, there is no new thinking on tapping the savings of the younger people in the age group, say, between 17 and marriage age, 25 years.  No real appeal is made to that group and no real incentive given to them to save and thereby lay aside a deposit on their future homes.  I do not want to go into that at length here, because I went into many aspects of it in the debate on the Housing Bill, but I would refer the Minister to some suggestions on that which largely follow from what is functioning successfully in Germany at present.</P>
    <P>We have the reason given for this&mdash; the British surcharge.  Yes, but on the other hand that has sparked off the Buy Irish Campaign, which has had a fair amount of success, and to that extent the surcharge was something of a blessing in disguise.  I should, indeed, like to have seen that campaign having <Col N="1191" /> more success, especially heading as we are, with the British Agreement and later on, as we hope, in the European Economic Community, to a time that is running out on us to get the people aware of the necessity to buy Irish.  I should like to see it driven home to our people that the article you may buy may be what keeps your children at home, and especially I should like to see the trade union movement play a much greater part in this Buy Irish Campaign, because, after all, it should be brought home to everyone that the most certain means of keeping their own employment going is to leave as much as possible of their earnings at home at work in the country, in other words, to buy Irish.</P>
    <P>We have the unfortunate fact referred to here of the deficit and the necessity for foreign loans to tide over this.  Personally, I cannot see any satisfactory explanation for the extraordinary difficulty we seem to be experiencing in raising what are relatively small loans internationally. On the other hand, I know an industry in Cork which raised in New York a sum which was almost comparable with what the Government were seeking.  That firm got it and our Government did not.  That is a serious question, and if we had proper committees in this House we would like to know the reasons for it.  It is one that it is not too easy to debate in public.  We do not want to raise too many conjectures on it, but if we had a finance committee attached to this Chamber it is one problem they should really keep at until they finally got the reasons for the extraordinary situation we are in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Conjecture is not necessary.  There is a full statement on the records of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen that but it did not carry conviction to me. I cannot see on the face of it why it is difficult for a country in our position to raise a loan of that kind of just £7 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have the fact that investments have decreased considerably.  In <Col N="1192" /> 1964 we had a rather extraordinary run of investments and, unfortunately, these seem to have decreased considerably in the present year.  Unfortunately, too, our very unhappy public relations and our many strikes at the moment have done a good deal to deter investment here.  One of our best assets was the stability that we were able to offer. Now, unfortunately, that seems to have deteriorated very markedly, and it is a number one essential to put that right before we can ever again hope to get the volume of outside investment that we had over the last couple of years.</P>
    <P>In the NIEC Report they go on to the principles that are necessary to prevent a recurrence of the present recession. Foremost among those they place an incomes policy and the necessity to get public agreement on that and on the differentials between various groups. have dissatisfaction with existing That is really an almost insoluble question, because surely we shall always differentials and efforts to change that, and, while we should strive, I am very doubtful of reaching very much success in this.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the necessity for getting down to industrial relations on an all-Party basis.  If we value the future of the country and are concerned about it we should take industrial relations out of politics and set up a Joint Committee of both Houses to advise the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the new Minister for Labour in his proposed or projected legislation on industrial relations&mdash;advise and help him, and do that on an all-Party basis, because above all in industrial relations you might say that the best is the enemy of the good, as whatever emerges will have to be something that is reasonably certain of widespread acceptance.  I would appeal to the Minister to take this out of the arena of Party politics.</P>
    <P>One very important principle here, No. 19, is that the decisions about the current level of support for agricultural incomes should be taken and recognised as an integral part of the decisions concerning non-agricultural things.  Yet that very important recommendation was violated within the <Col N="1193" /> first three months after the report was issued, in that it was obvious to everyone that the agricultural community, and especially the milk producers, had to be given some part in the general increase.  It would have been far better if that had been done at Budget time rather than being brought in as a second Budget, and then in a way in which it is likely to create class dissension, in that we had a statement by the Government that the additional taxes on cigarettes and petrol, and especially on cigarettes, were being put on to provide this additional increase for the farming community despite the fact there were many other provisions in the Budget.</P>
    <P>In any case, I think it is wrong that tax should be directly associated with taking from one group and giving to the other, unless the tax happens to be one for increased social benefits&mdash;in other words an increase in old age pensions or such social benefits.  Then, it would be a right and proper gesture that the tax that would actually be contributed should and could be identified to the general public because surely that is the type of contribution which no person able to contribute would hesitate about.</P>
    <P>The NIEC Report goes on then to the necessity for getting proper priorities for capital expenditure and for social investment.  That goes without saying.  We all recognise the need for this.  It is merely a question, in all cases, of how the priorities can be arranged.  Finally, the report says that action is necessary in the field of credit policy.  We have had such action over the past six months.  Some of it may have been a little over-drastic but it has shown the necessity for a credit policy which will act as a deflationary measure.  That has been achieved to some extent.</P>
    <P>Before passing on from the credit policy&mdash;to which I shall come back later&mdash;I want to say that by and large the whole impact of this report lacks spirit.  Perhaps the spirit may not be for this committee to provide but certainly it is the duty of the Government and public leaders in general to try to provide this spirit because when we <Col N="1194" /> examine the events of the past four years we find that our present difficulties are largely due to a great deal of exaggerated accounts, promises and so on, especially from Government Ministers. In other words, intoxicated by the success of the First Programme for Economic Expansion, the many spokesmen&mdash;not necessarily Ministers, there were many spokesmen from organisations and so on &mdash; allowed simple arithmetic to run away with them.  They thought that all you needed for planning and success was simply to get the figures done.  Once you had the figures done, you set a course at four per cent expansion in gross national income and that the future almost took care of itself.  In fact, I can recall one speaker who really allowed his fancy to run away with him.  He projected the straight line of economic expansion so far that he felt that in 1976 we would draw level with England and in 1978 draw level with the United States.  That is the kind of nonsensical use of statistics and planning which brings both of these into disrepute.</P>
    <P>All during that period the emphasis shifted completely to this question of gross national product and no longer were you to talk about employment figures or emigration.  I found myself on many occasions pointing out the failure to increase employment numbers and found I was regarded as being out of step with the modern approach to the period.  The modern approach was that employment and all the rest will look after themselves; all you have got to do is get up the gross national product.  By that means, we focussed everything on the material, on the individual, what he was going to get and not what he was providing for his brothers or the new jobs he was helping to create in the country. No, it was purely selfish and I believe it is that spirit that has left us where we are today.  It was a spirit which was totally out of tune with our national spirit which always responded best when called upon for sacrifice. Here what was being appealed to was just pure greed&mdash;the individual and not the community.  If you look back over the past four years or so you will <Col N="1195" /> find that is correct; that in no case was there an appeal to genuine patriotism or to do something for somebody else. It was all so that you got your four per cent and &ldquo;I am all right, Jack, let the others take care of themselves.&rdquo; If we can profit by this lesson and return again to the traditional Irish leadership and the traditional Irish approach to patriotism and to national development then, perhaps, we may be able to resume our onward march.</P>
    <P>At one stage one felt it meant that the economists had taken over completely. I have a high regard for the work done by economists and the great guidance they can give, but economics, like everything else, should be kept in its place.  It is only a part of the whole man, and in fact, a small part of that man.  Our greatness here could never be measured in economic terms.  The contribution of our nation and our people to the world is not capable of being measured in economic terms.  It is a contribution to the spirit and uplift of the world and that is what we need also because we have got to return to value the non-material things we have completely disregarded over the past four or five years.</P>
    <P>This was brought home very forcibly again to me during a recent visit to the United States when, in New York, you see the struggle for existence. It is not an existence.  The people there in all walks of life, whether workers, professional people or whatever they are, get much more real wages than we get here but you have got to take the whole life into account. Surely wages are for the purpose of enabling you to live a full life.  But when you see people, whether workers, professionals or others, in New York crowded like cattle into trains for at least an hour's travel morning and evening to and from their place of employment you begin to value what we have got here where none of our people are called upon to travel more than an average of ten to fifteen minutes either way.  Yet, at no time in any comparison, have we taken account of these advantages.  Again, you must take the whole picture.  Our seaside resorts are practically all within an <Col N="1196" /> hour's easy run whereas in the industrial centres of England as well as America to get to such beaches is a luxury which costs real money.  What is the fresh air of our countryside worth compared with the smog-laden air of the large industrial cities?  I suggest that there is a need to stress those values very much so that our people should become aware of them. In other words, money is not everything.</P>
    <P>When it comes to rearing a family and being responsible for that family I consider they should grow up as proper citizens.  It is necessary to contrast the difficulties of rearing a family in England or the USA with rearing a family here.  Anybody who has experience of that or knows anything about it would certainly not voluntarily take a family out of their environment here and try to raise that family in England or America.  Those are the advantages we have got here and those are the things which are completely ignored.</P>
    <P>We talk about the Second Programme, straight line projects, the GNP and what have you.  I suggest we must return to those real values and to a realisation that what is wrong with this country at the moment is simply a lack of work.  That goes in practically all circles.  If you could get a 10 per cent increase in output from everyone in the country things would be vastly improved in four to five years.  It has become rather old-fashioned in the last few years of moderism to appeal to such virtues or to ask for increased work.  The general attitude seems to be that we should be able to plan and develop the country without work.</P>
    <P>I suggest that a lead should be given by the Government to its Parliamentary committees.  It is high time the Government decided that the archaic nineteenth-century type of institution which we get here is not fit for the twentieth century.  It is high time it was recognised as being an intermediary between the people and their Civil Service and that we can no longer tolerate the situation in which the Minister has to stand between the people and the civil servants.  There will have to be discussions across the table and by that <Col N="1197" /> means the Dáil and the Seanad can forge a very vital link and exercise a vital interest in the course of our affairs. In this context, at the present time, we should try to get away from playing politics on the national situation.  It is far too serious for that.  There is a crisis and I should like to see as many aspects of that crisis as possible met on an all-Party basis, recognising that we all have our part to play.  I cannot but be struck by some of the comments on both sides of the House which tend to suggest that we are in a situation broadly the same as that of 1957.  Our Minister for Finance today is doing the best he can to cope with this situation. He is fully advised by the best advice which the Civil Service can give him. This advice is exactly the same type of advice as the Minister for Finance in 1957 got from the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I need not go further into the Report of the NIEC except again to stress that to my knowledge not one signatory of that report would himself claim to have any real knowledge of agriculture and its problems.  That, of course, must make any effort to plan the whole economy almost farcical. Within limitations, a good deal has been done, but surely, outside cloud cuckoo-land, no Government would plan on such a basis.  It needs at least the voice of six members fully specialised in agriculture and its problems. Some of such members may be representatives of farmers' organisations but others should be added for their absolute specialist knowledge of agriculture and its problems and the contribution agriculture can make to our economy.</P>
    <P>To return to the Finance Bill in general, particularly to the Minister's plea when he was asked in the Dáil and this House what went wrong in a period of less than a year.  We have gone from glowing reports that everything was wonderful, that everything was directly on target, to the present position.  I have already given some views on the un-Irish attitude to the whole question of national development in the sense of absolute concentration on economic gain and appeals to the individual greed of our <Col N="1198" /> citizens rather than asking them to make contributions so that their children or their neighbour's might be able to find employment here rather than take the emigrant ship.</P>
    <P>I suggest we should return to a line that will appeal to the patriotism of our people and get sacrifice and self-denial from them to encourage them to work for the nation.  What has gone wrong, in so far as the items can be listed?  I put at the head of all this the status increases.  It is probably true that certain salaries had got out of line but it is unfortunate that it has boomeranged.  This is one of the greatest factors in our present situation of unrest.</P>
    <P>The second factor is the failure of the Government, and successive Governments, to control these creations&mdash; our semi-State bodies&mdash;because now the country runs for them rather than their running for the country.  They are absolutely out of control at the moment, and were never really subject to any type of effective Parliamentary control.  It seems very strange to find a situation developing in the recent ESB business, where you have a semi-State body which is supposed to belong to the people&mdash;with no wicked capitalist in any way associated with it; purely of the State and of the people&mdash;and yet the right to strike against them is conceded.  That has been fundamentally wrong from the start.</P>
    <P>If bodies are of the State and of the people they should hold that status and like the Civil Service they should have their arbitration machinery and the findings should be binding on both sides.  In the long run&mdash;and you need not take such a long run at it&mdash; both sides in this type of dispute lose, both the workers and the employers. Who are the employers?  The State are, we are.  We all lose.  Therefore, this is a nonsensical situation which should not be allowed to exist and which calls for immediate remedy. How can it be done quickly?  This situation which has developed should have been foreseen from the start.</P>
    <P>We appoint boards to run these semi-State bodies.  I have been on some of them and I can speak with <Col N="1199" /> authority.  There is not the same sense of personal involvement as there is in the case of directors of firms because if you are acting on a State board anything you give is not coming out of your own pocket.  Therefore, the whole approach is, give, give, give.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that why the semi-State undertakings have been so generous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why they have been so ineffective.  I am criticising the whole system.  Control of the semi-State bodies has broken down.  It needs to be co-ordinated very closely and kept in step by means of an effective Parliamentary committee. The Minister has not had sufficient co-ordination.  We have had perfect proof of that.  This could probably be the most important committee associated with the Oireachtas&mdash;a committee which would ensure that these undertakings of the people and belonging to the people functioned together according to a pattern that would be for the general welfare, and that there would be no question of leap-frogging or playing off one against the other, which is the situation we have been led into with increasing frequency in recent times.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the technicians versus the white collar workers and so on.  I can see a great deal of merit in a claim which was made recently.</P>
      <P>My contention is that there should be machinery to prevent the necessity for strikes.  In that way they would not be there.  Undoubtedly, I can see a case.  I think, by and large, the gap between the white collar worker and the technician is greater here than in any other country.  That is something the new Minister for Labour would want to take as top priority and, indeed, the Government as well should get the actual facts and figures on this from other countries and adopt a policy on it.  In fact, it will be the keystone in relation to any incomes policy that is adopted.  An incomes policy that does not resolve that in accordance with modern development is not worthy to be called an incomes policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> It seems to me that there is a great deal of misplaced sympathy or, shall I say, thinking in regard to this question of equality of educational opportunities, in so far as it is felt that if a young person has the ability to become a white collar worker it is somehow wrong if he does not go on that line and stays in a line which develops his hands and his skill, in other words, develops along the lines of the technician. That thinking is all wrong. What is wrong is that educational opportunities are being confused with financial opportunities.  In the case of young men who, whether by way of academic studies or by way of technical education and apprenticeship, devote their lives up to the age of say, 20 or 21, to training for future jobs, there should be equal opportunities.</P>
    <P>That is what is missing here and what is creating a great deal of difficulty. Also, our whole industrial development is being slowed down by the absence of technicians.  The Engineers Association have been crying out about this problem for the past ten years, pointing out that compared with other countries we have a great scarcity of technicians and, indeed, one of the leaders of the Shannon Industrial Estate made very forthright comments on that, and the Director of EI made strong comment on this particular shortage a year ago when addressing the Engineers Association and his address was conveyed to the Government for action.  So far, there does not seem to have been any action taken by the Government.  It was found we had, comparatively speaking, a fair number of technologists but to get the full benefit from our technologists we had not the accompanying technicians to work in a team with the technologists.  The result is that many of our technologists, the people with degrees, and members of some of the institutions of technology, are not being used to full advantage in our industrial complexes.  They are doing work that could be done at least as effectively by people less highly trained&mdash; people in the technician grade.  I commend to the Minister that part of our failure rests there.</P>
    <P>Another great neglect is our failure <Col N="1201" /> to modernise social conditions in agriculture. In fact, this is the root cause of the flight from the land.  I have condemned the Second Programme again and again in this House for its absolutely suicidal acceptance of a flight of 6,500 a year from the land when we have fewer agricultural workers per thousand arable acres than any country in Western Europe. Yet, our planning has been based on the acceptance of this flight of 6,500 people and at present it is up to 10,000.  Consequently, a burden has been thrown on our industrial expansion which it has shown it is completely unable to carry.  It has the burden of taking up the loss from agriculture as well as providing additional jobs.  Indeed, what is happening is that industry is not even capable of taking up the losses from agriculture.</P>
    <P>If we are to progress, the losses from agriculture have to be stopped and jobs have to be found in agriculture. There is no need to quote statistics to show that our output is small compared with Denmark but, equally, the number of our workers per thousand acres is small compared with Denmark. In other words, our agriculture is a relatively unworked factory and what is missing is the need to modernise the social conditions on the land.  It is not increased prices.  In fact, I do not think that increased prices will put any extra number on the land or will cut the flight from the land in any way. What is needed is a modernisation of the social conditions.  That is simple. All it means is that the farmer and his workers are now seeking what everyone in the city regards as his inalienable rights.  In other words, he is not to go out to work when he is ill.</P>
    <P>If you are a worker or a professional person in a factory you do not expect to be sent out when you are ill.  Yet, that is precisely what faces every worker on the land.  The cows have to be milked whether the farmer has the flu or not.  Again, there is the question of getting a day off or a night off.  Who will milk the cows?  It is within the power of the Government to deal with that easily.  Use could be made of the co-operative creameries where they are available; they cover most of the <Col N="1202" /> country.  Attached to each co-operative centre should be a relief work force with which you could get in touch and arrange for them to come down and milk the cows for a day, a week or a fortnight.  Where a farmer is growing old and is no longer able to cope with the problem of milking, he can simply contract with the co-operative to have the milking done. Surely that is a simple matter and a very elementary need of the farming community.  There may be no practical experience in this line but all my people are on the land and I have been in close touch with them and I feel that what I have pointed out is the greatest single deterrent to increased production.</P>
    <P>It is also responsible for the chopping and changing, people moving in and out of cows and what not.  All this shows in a reduction in production. The Minister need only kick this off with an element of subsidy for the first couple of years and after that the scheme should be more self-sufficient. The scheme would provide employment at those centres for men at wages that would be more in line with what they could earn in industry.  It seems so simple.  Why is it not being done?  I think that that is the greatest single necessity at the moment.</P>
    <P>Then we have this question of less work and more pay.  The Minister has found himself this year in a very unenviable position.  He has his commitments and he has to find the money. Everybody is looking for more than he is given, and it is just ordinary simple arithmetic: that the Minister has to put on these increased taxes to find the money.  Now it seems to me that there is a complete lack of imagination in the approach to this.  It is an approach that does not strive to make the economy buoyant, to provide more work and by that means get more revenue to foot the Minister's bill.  I believe that the Minister should try to get those idle factories working again at least on Saturday morning if not on Saturday afternoon.  That could be done quite simply by giving a certain amount of tax relief on money earned on overtime in certain categories.</P>

Therefore, if the Minister enabled a factory to operate on an overtime rate of time and a quarter and he gave certain tax concessions, not many, he would get some taxes. Such a scheme would be attractive to the workers and would enable them to earn the increased taxes they have to pay.  The result would be more production. If the people concerned worked an additional half day their personal consumption requirements would not go up.  They would not eat any more because of this, but this is the type of marginal contribution that really makes a difference to an economy.</P>
      <P>In this regard the Minister might expect the Civil Service to set a headline by lengthening their working hours on the same basis.  Let there be no mistake about this.  There is one, and only one, thing that will get our economy back on the rails and that is increased work by everybody.  When I speak of increased work I am in a fairly strong position because our universities can, in one sense, take a legitimate pride in that they are doing twice the job their corresponding numbers in Northern Ireland or in Great Britain do.  It takes twice as many staff members to turn out 100 graduates in Northern Ireland or in England as it takes here; yet our graduates are capable, and compare with the best anywhere.  That is a situation that we have been trying to remedy, that we do need increased numbers, yet it does show that at least as a section of the community&mdash;no doubt there are many others&mdash;we are pulling our weight judged by the only standard you can use, the international standard of achievement and production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> I know that the Minister and his colleagues are certainly pulling their weight, but I do think that a lead needs to be given by the Civil Service as a whole.  We in the universities are being forced to adopt a five day week, but we are resisting it as long as we can because we cannot afford to sacrifice the time, the four hours from nine to one on Saturday mornings, that would be available for lectures and other work.  Let us get back to work. In making this appeal to get back to work I do so in the knowledge of the political climate as I see it here.  I see this as an Indepedent, not that I claim any merit whatsoever for being an Independent.  It just happens to be the position in which I look at it from here.  When I look to the next election I can only see a national government emerging from it.  Therefore, why not get down to the job immediately and do as many things as possible on a national basis?</P>
    <P>We come then to another difficulty that I have already touched on&mdash;our failure in industrial relations.  This is highlighted by the absolute inactivity of the Government in the question of the bank strike.  The Government acted with commendable swiftness in the case of the Electricity Supply Board stoppage, but their inactivity in the present crisis is equally conspicuous.  I say a plague on both their houses, both the officials and the Joint Standing Committee of the banks, for holding the whole country up to ransom while they go along at their own leisurely seventeenth century pace of negotiations, meeting about twice a week and apparently giving time to cool off in between. I believe that the country cannot afford this type of leisurely approach and that there should be legislation that would penalise both sides in this dispute.  I should like to see some of the tax reliefs available to the banks in the form of corporation profits tax being hit, and hit heavily, when they are on a strike for more than two weeks in any one year.  Likewise, I should like to see the employees through earned income allowances being heavily hit in the same way.  If there are going to be strikes we at least have to ensure that the negotiators <Col N="1205" /> work over the week-end and that they do not adjourn from Tuesday to Thursday in their quest for a solution. There should be some penalty to ensure that they get on with the job urgently. As it is untold damage has been done to the economy by this business.  It brings home to us the frightful monopoly we have created by recently adding the National Bank of Ireland to the Bank of Ireland so that one bank virtually controls the whole country.  We have one monopoly meeting another monopoly, and we, the ordinary citizens, suffer in such a conflict.  It is about time that the Government took courage and showed that they can deal with a bank strike just as efficiently and as quickly as they dealt with the other case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to remove the prohibition imposed by the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, on the importation of instant tea and to make the importation of instant tea subject to the same controls as leaf, tea, namely, that it must be purchased in and imported from the country of origin either by Tea Importers Limited or by a registered tea trader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a public demand for instant tea for use, principally in tea dispensing machines and for some <Col N="1206" /> time I have had representations to have the prohibition on its importation removed.  In addition to that, arising out of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, it is necessary to remove, with effect from the 1st July, 1966, restrictions on the importation of instant tea manufactured in Britain. Instant tea manufactured in Britain will be free from restrictions.  The importation of leaf tea from Britain will continue to be prohibited.</P>
    <P>If that is not clear I shall try to explain it again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFConlon" hpid="Mr. Conlan Mr. Conlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that when I first saw this Bill and heard it had something to do with instant tea I was amazed because I always thought all tea was instant.  In my own home the teapot is nearly always on the hob and we have always instant tea.  I only hope that the tea which will be imported will not be of inferior quality but I think we can rely on the good judgment of the Irish people because, next to barley, tea is our national beverage.  Irish people are connoisseurs in the matter of tea, so much so, that the tea wholesalers and blenders have to blend tea to suit various areas.  Also in that connection they have to have samples of water from the various areas to mix with the tea in those particular areas.</P>
      <P>We have no objection to the Bill. This may be of benefit to some of our institutions, such as hospitals and homes where people who would like a cup of tea in between meals will be able to have this cup of tea from vending machines.</P>

      <P>A total prohibition existed under the 1876 Act on the importation of essences under which instant tea would come.  For the Free Trade Area Agreement instant tea is regarded as a manufacture and therefore, has to be free.  We are, therefore, <Col N="1207" /> removing this total prohibition so as to allow instant tea as a manufacture to be imported from Britain.  At the same time, we want to give countries which produce tea the same benefits of sending instant tea into this country. Therefore, we bring instant tea in line with leaf tea and this control follows the same lines as leaf tea and it will be imported from the country of origin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be helpful to say why they were banned.  If they were banned there must be some good reason for banning them.  The wording of the Bill seems odd.  In order to ban the importation of those essences it starts off by saying:</P>
      <P>No person except the Company shall import any extract, essence or concentration of tea.</P>
      <P>Then, if I understand the Minister correctly, Britain is allowed to send the tea here.  If somebody imports through other countries it must be imported by the Company which does not put other countries on a par with Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not put them on a par.  We have to regard Britain <Col N="1208" /> as different under the Free Trade Agreement.  There are a number of countries producing leaf tea.  We import leaf tea from them.  Those countries now produce instant tea.  Unless there was a restriction in regard to them they could send instant tea into this country as leaf tea is sent in.  We are giving Britain only the right to send instant tea into this country.</P>

      <P>If there was no reason for it why is the Minister introducing it in this Bill?  This deals with prohibition.  If there is no reason for the prohibition, then the sensible thing to do would be to get rid of it. We should not introduce a restriction whereby the tea can only be imported by one country.  Senator Ryan is quite right when he says I had not heard of this Act before now.  If the Minister could clarify what the whole thing is about it would help us to understand the Bill and to deal with it.</P>

      <P>The Act of 1876 was a Customs Act.  It included sheep, cattle and other animals.  I do not think the question of instant tea arose until recently.  Under the Free Trade Agreement we discovered that instant tea, being a manufacture, must be free from this prohibition.  Under the Free Trade Agreement we must free it.  The other Act dealing with tea was the 1958 one.  During the war, when this country was dependent on Britain for tea and had not a claim on the country of origin, our experience told us that it was necessary to establish a quota for ourselves and the 1958 Act was brought into being for that purpose.  We still think this should continue in force and that we should bring instant tea into line with leaf tea so that our supplies of instant tea from the country of production would be established in the same way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is due to the 1958 Act which protects our quota of tea. This merely brings instant tea into line with leaf tea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I now understand what is happening.  I had never been happy about the 1958 Act in regard to the importation of tea. The Minister's explanation now is a rational one which I had not heard. It seems that the question of the importation of tea was dealt with in the background of past experience with little relevance to the future.  The 1958 measure was like the direction of Irish Shipping tonnage of 250,000 tons of dry shipping because somebody thought it up as being the tonnage required based on experience in the last war.  When that was investigated it was discovered what shipping tonnage would be required in an atomic war which destroyed the whole northern hemisphere except Ireland&mdash;30 per cent of the tonnage of the previous war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for this ban on the importation of tea was an unhappy experience in the last war when the Taoiseach felt he was badly treated by the tea merchants of London and he introduced this restrictive legislation. Has it, however, any relevance to the present or to the future?  It forbade us buying tea from the London <Col N="1211" /> tea market partly because of an experience which left a searing mark in the Taoiseach's consciousness.  It seems that the 250,000 tons level for Irish Shipping was also laid down arbitrarily by the Taoiseach.  That, too, is something that needs to be looked at again.  To carry on this restrictive legislation seems to be rather absurd and to introduce a Bill of this extraordinary roundabout character, banning the importation of instant tea except by one company, is an anachronism at this stage.  The Bill does something that has to be done but I suggest the Minister might look, in the latter part of the 1960s, at the extraordinary legislation this Bill amends and give further consideration as to whether it should be continued at this stage in our history.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point I have not covered is whether we should continue legislation because of an experience we have had.  It was not a light experience.  The London tea suppliers failed to honour their commitments and we suffered.  We shall not suffer anything by changing this legislation. We are ensuring our quota and it is not a great hardship to have this, even though it is a seemingly complicated piece of legislation.  We shall have a claim on the producing country and nobody can say that will not be relevant in the future except somebody who can see what the future holds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was puzzled by the Minister's statement that it is not a hardship to have the 1958 Act on the Statute Book.  The only purpose for that is that we might be able to purchase tea from London because it would be cheaper.  I cannot <Col N="1212" /> see any other reason for having it. If, in fact, there is no hardship that means we can get tea just as cheaply or cheaper by the present method, in which case the Act is unnecessary. If the Act is necessary it means that in its absence we could buy tea from London at a cheaper cost.  I cannot follow the Minister's statement that the Act imposes no hardship.  If it imposes no hardship there is no need for the Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is not an established fact.  I do not know what the trade would find.  I have not got any figures of the competitive price because there is no competition.  What we are doing is protecting our supplies.  We cannot foresee the future and we cannot say there will not be people who will not honour their commitments.  I think the Government would be failing in their duty if we waited to be bitten a second time, and bitten by not having enough tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct in saying that we cannot foresee the future, but there are people who assume it will be the same as the past.  What kind of war the Government are preparing for, in which there will be a London and a tea market which will not honour their commitments, and in which we will be in a position to import tea from other countries, it is hard to see.  Apparently it will be a war like the last war and there is no question of technological changes making any difference.  That seems to me to be an unwarranted assumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am raising on the section is a different point.  The Minister said that there would be no hardship in having this Act on the Statute Book. I can see that there is a case for having the Act for the reason the Minister gave, but this is based on the assumption that the future will be like the past and no one has thought about what kind of war we are preparing <Col N="1213" /> for, I find it hard to accept the Minister's statement that it imposes no hardship.  If so, it can only be because of the fact that the tea we are buying direct is cheaper than the tea we could buy from London.  If we can buy tea cheaper from London the Act would be necessary to prevent people availing themselves of that cheaper tea, and so endangering the security of our supplies in time of war.  I do not think the Minister can get away with the suggestion that there is no hardship unless he is saying that the Act is completely unnecessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Has Senator FitzGerald figures to show that it would be cheaper to buy tea direct from London than to buy tea from the producing countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Senator FitzGerald was most careful to make no such suggestion.  I said that in the Minister's statement that there is no hardship in having the Act on the Statute Book there is an assumption that tea can be bought cheaper from the other countries.  The Minister's statement implies that it does not cost us any more to buy tea from the other countries.  If it does not the Act is superfluous because in the absence of the Act people would go on buying tea more cheaply directly.  The reason why the Act is on the Statute Book is that the Minister feels that under certain circumstances tea could be bought more cheaply in London and in order to prevent this being done we have the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the assumption that it is cheaper to buy tea in London will not stand up.  I have not the figures, but it is a natural assumption that if you buy tea from the producing countries instead of from someone who has already bought it you will get it as cheap at least, if not cheaper. This legislation is not based on the assumption that it is cheaper to buy tea in London.  It was the tradition of London controlling our tea that made this legislation necessary.  That is the tradition which had to be changed and which has been changed.  I do not see why the Senator is so worried.</P>

      <P>It may be because it is instant tea.  Here we are dealing with amendments of the Customs Consolidation Act, and the Tea (Purchase and Importation) Act, 1958.  This Bill was introduced in Dáil Éireann on 14th June, a fortnight ago.  It surpasses my comprehension how a miserable, unimportant, and inconsequential Bill of this character requires a special resolution of the Oireachtas setting aside a provision of the Constitution. I spoke earlier this evening about the fuss and bother that now surrounds the current Finance Bill.  We passed legislation earlier in the year for the purpose of enabling the Seanad to have more time for debating the Finance Bill and we decided we would not debate the Appropriation Bill until September.  That does not change the situation a bit.  We are here and we have not 21 days to debate the Finance Bill.  We have this miserable Bill forced upon us and we are asked to concur that the President sign it earlier than the fifth day.  It passes my comprehension that, with all the great paraphernalia of Government, the great Civil Service, the numerous officers who are at the beck and call of the Minister, the Government cannot bring in a Bill of this kind in time to enable the Dáil and Seanad to take it at their leisure, sip it, taste it and see how they like it and then, having done that, deliberate upon it. It beats me, and it reflects no credit on the efficiency of the Minister's Department that throws the Oireachtas into this kind of position.  I would <Col N="1216" /> have thought we should get some explanation from the mover of the motion.</P>

      <P>I am asking the Seanad for this early signing and I think Senators deserve an explanation.  There has been quite a bit of consequential legislation on the Free Trade Area Agreement and whatever the Senator's opinion on the different parts is, there are quite a number of bits and pieces arising out of it.  We have dealt with some and will be dealing with more. The fact is that all that started after Christmas with the signing of the Agreement and put quite a strain on the machinery available for the drafting of this legislation and the preparation before drafting.  It is just an unusual pressure of work that has arisen out of the Agreement made before Christmas.  All these consequential enactments came along together and put pressure on our resources, which normally would not have been put on them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 3, lines 13 and 14, to delete &ldquo;CERTAIN OTHER ENACTMENTS&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;THE FRIENDLY SOCIETIES ACT, <Col N="1217" /> 1896 AND THE INSURANCE ACT, 1936&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think it was generally agreed the other night that if we are going to make amendments to Acts which are quite unrelated to the subject of the principal Act we ought to refer to the fact in the Long Title of the Bill. Therefore, since we are amending the Friendly Societies Act of 1896 and the Insurance Act of 1936 it seems to me proper that we ought to refer to this, in order to alert those who may have to look up the law at any time, that these particular enactments contained in the Schedule have, in fact, been amended by this particular Bill.  Perhaps, I could also move amendments Nos, 2, 3 and 4.  They are all relevant.</P>

      <P>What I was saying is that as a consequence of highlighting the fact that the enactments contained in the Schedule were being amended, the operative part of the Bill, which is section 37, should be transposed before section 2 so that anybody taking up this Bill would, first of all, see the ordinary definition of the Bill and see clearly that it is a Bill amending the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, and the Insurance Act of 1936.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of doing that, amendment No. 2 becomes necessary because it is desirable to divide the Bill into two parts, first of all the part which gives definition to the Bill with repeals and amendments, and then the rest of the Bill, which is concerned with credit unions.  That would be an improvement in the drafting of the Bill.  I move that this amendment be accepted.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  It very definitely improves the clarity of the Bill.  I had an experience a few years ago working with a Government draftsman on a private Bill, and was very deeply impressed by the care which the draftsman took in drafting this Bill.  In fact, it came into my mind that a good draftsman takes as much <Col N="1218" /> trouble in choosing his words and arranging his sections as a great poet, such as W.B. Yeats or William Shakespeare, took in choosing their words and arranging their lines.  It is extraordinary the care and precision these men employ and in many ways the draftsmen are as dedicated as the poets.  However, even competent and highly skilled poets occasionally wrote a poem that could be improved and I suggest the Bill can be improved by small, almost mechanical, changes. Looking up these enactments involves hard work for lawyers.  I accordingly support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I undertook last week to go into this matter and I wrote at considerable length to the Parliamentary Draftsman in regard to the points raised.  I did so in the light of my own remarks here last week to the effect that it is generally undesirable and makes life difficult for the practitioner to have amendments on seemingly unrelated Acts included in a Bill of this kind.</P>
      <P>I shall deal first with the matter of the Long Title.  The Parliamentary Draftsman is very strongly against an amendment on the lines suggested in the first amendment we are considering, and he says that it is not, or never has been, the intention that the Long Title of a Bill should be exhaustive.  It is intended to be a general indication of what the Bill is about.  This Long Title does generally set out the aims of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also point out that the amendment as it stands might not be accepted because of the deletion of the words in the Long Title &ldquo;to amend certain other enactments&rdquo;.  These must remain because, apart from the Friendly Societies Act of 1896 and the Insurance Act of 1936, there is reference made to the Moneylenders Acts and the Central Bank Act in sections 28 and 29.  It remains then for the House to decide whether or not there is <Col N="1219" /> substance in the view that it would not be a good precedent to try to make the Long Title of the Bill exhaustive, and I am inclined to weigh in with that point of view, having given a good deal of consideration to it, much from the lawyer's rather than the parliamentarian's point of view.</P>
    <P>I might also add that the legal practitioner is expected to read the whole of a Bill, and he cannot, therefore, be regarded as being taken by surprise if he finds, as in the light of our history here he can expect to find, certain unrelated enactments referred to and amended by legislation which on the face of it would not appear to relate.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other amendments 2, 3, 4, and 9, the draftsman also objects to the amendments designed to effect structural alterations at this stage.  In that I suppose the House will have sympathy with him. I agree with Senator Stanford that the draftsman does use great care and great precision, and I also suspect that from time to time even with the greatest care and precision certain things creep into a draft which may be undesirable.  Let us assume then, for the sake of argument, that the mechanical structure of this Bill could be better than it is.  The Parliamentary Draftsman points out that this is a matter which surely relates not merely to this particular Bill but to legislation in general and, therefore, is one which should be taken up, not at a very later stage in the Seanad in regard to this particular Bill, but in a general way in some other more suitable place with a view to achieving what might very well be the desired result of a better presentation of legislation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the transposition of sections 37, 38 and 39 to an earlier part of the Bill I have had a look at recent legislation and in the main with small Bills these provisions occur at the end rather than at the beginning. If we rearrange the Bill now those who are responsible for seeing that the Bill goes through in final form as it was passed by the Oireachtas would be faced with very considerable and very difficult work in ensuring after <Col N="1220" /> the reprinting that, in fact, the Bill as passed by the Oireachtas had been accurately reproduced in print.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I would not recommend to the House the acceptance of these amendments.  In regard to the division of the Bill into parts I would point out that in the past ten years, only in two enactments, was this particular <i>modus operandi</i> used, i.e. dividing a short Bill into two Parts.  With long Bills such as the Companies Act, there are special reasons, the complexity of the legislation involved being such as that it has to be divided into several parts.  The draftsman's office is not in favour of dividing a Bill into parts unless more than two parts appear to be necessary.</P>
    <P>I must say that I have sympathy with the point of view that this is a very late stage at which to ask for a mechanical amendment to the Bill, and accordingly, subject to the House's agreement, I would propose to let the Bill stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>While I see the point about it being a late stage I am unhappy with that particular reaction in some respects.  First of all, it was raised at a rather late stage because the sense of these sections and the repeals involved only emerged on the Committee Stage and there is no evidence that in their passage through the Dáil their significance was appreciated either.  Certainly in this House as soon as it was appreciated we raised the matter at the earliest stage possible. I am appalled by the Parliamentary Draftsman's suggestion, if it is correctly conveyed, as I am sure it is, that apart from this question being raised at a late stage this House is not an appropriate place for it to be raised, and that it should be raised somewhere else.  It seems that the Parliamentary Draftsman is suggesting that the House should not concern itself with matters of legislation.  That is the point of view, which I may have misunderstood perhaps, but if that were his point of view, it is not one that we could readily accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other point made about the Long Title I would be sympathetic.  I must say, with the draftsman's feeling <Col N="1221" /> that it is undesirable to establish a precedent to the effect that every Act named in a Bill must be in the Long Title.  This would make the Long Title terribly cumbersome, but that was not the point.  The point that we were making was that the Long Title down to &ldquo;The Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1936&rdquo; deals with one part of the Bill and that the Long Title contains no reference to the quite different part of the Bill dealing with quite different matters.  I see no reason, for example, for including reference in the Long Title to the Central Bank or Moneylenders Acts which can appropriately be included in the heading &ldquo;Certain Other Enactments&rdquo;.  They do certainly arise out of the main body of the Act and do not raise either new or different issues.  This is not the case with regard to the Acts which we seek to name in the Long Title, Acts which deal with something completely different.  While the Long Title need not be required to mention all the Acts amended or to mention everything in the Bill it should not be of such a character as positively to mislead the ordinary person reading the Long Title who I think can reasonably assume that the words &ldquo;to amend certain other enactments and to provide for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid&rdquo;&mdash;here there seems to be an ambiguity in the grammar.  In the absence of any commas the words &ldquo;connected with the matters aforesaid&rdquo; could be held to cover &ldquo;certain other enactments&rdquo; as well as covering &ldquo;to provide for other matters&rdquo;.  My reading of it, in fact, was that this was a Bill to do various things, to amend certain other enactments connected with the matters aforesaid, and to provide for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>
    <P>That seems to me, in the absence of any commas, to be a very reasonable reading.  I would not, indeed, be surprised to hear a court decide that it was the correct reading.  That being so, the Long Title is at its best ambiguous and at its worst misleading and is of such a character as is possible to invalidate the legislation.  It seems to me, therefore, we must require that some reference be made in this Long Title <Col N="1222" /> to these two Acts we are amending, which have nothing to do with credit unions.  We know they are properly included within the general words at the end of the Long Title.  I think we ought to press for the inclusion of the other two and then leave these two out.  In that way we are meeting the Parliamentary draftsman's point and his objections by suggesting that the Title should include all enactments.</P>
    <P>The case is a very strong one and it would seem to be unwise and temerarious not to include them in the light of the possible reading of the Long Title, as I have indicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard what, I think, is a remarkable speech by the Parliamentary Secretary.  It was remarkable for the reason that he has had the frankness, for which he is well noted, in telling the House all that the Parliamentary draftsmen told him. One could straight away flay the Parliamentary draftsmen and cause a certain amount of discomfort to the Chair by discussing public servants who are not in a position to defend themselves.  We might very well be entitled to do that because they have been brought in here and paraded before us.  Therefore, I think we are entitled to comment upon what they have said, done and advised.  However, I do not propose to pursue that in the particular way one might be tempted to do.</P>
      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary first came into this House on the motion on Man Power Policy I warned him to remain himself, to be himself and that if he were himself he would be a great parliamentarian. Further, when he is convinced of anything himself and having received advice, he should make up his mind and not be over-burdened or too guided by the caution with which he would be weighed down, the ballast that will be added to prevent him sinking by the Civil Servants&mdash;as they have done&mdash;who advise him day in and day out.  The Parliamentary Secretary's own disposition of mind is to go the way I suggested in this amendment. That is quite clear from what he says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary then, <Col N="1223" /> very properly, had recourse to the Parliamentary Draftsman for advice and, of course, what will the Parliamentary Draftsman do but justify all he has done in the Bill?  If the Parliamentary Secretary ever finds himself in any difficulty and he wants to get out of it, then he should always have recourse to the Civil Service advisers for not alone will they give him one excuse but a variety of excuses and he can pick and choose which one he likes.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that, because the Civil Service are a very highly skilled and intelligent group of people who see things from all angles and who will say: &ldquo;Well, of course, Parliamentary Secretary, this course or that course can be adopted&rdquo; in the excuses they are looking for for not doing something because that is the great reputation of the Civil Service.  The Parliamentary Secretary can be certain of getting this in abundance and of getting arguments of the highest qualities and most convincing as to why something ought not to be done.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with what the Parliamentary Draftsman has to offer to this House by way of a reason for not adopting this amendment.  What has been said in relation to what may and may not be contained in the Long Title of a Bill is perfectly true.  We all know that in a matter of interpretation the rule adopted by the courts is that the Long Title is merely a mention of the general intentions and is not exhaustive of the main purpose of the Bill.  That is so, and that would be perfectly all right if this was a Bill dealing with credit unions and the Principal Act&mdash;the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts of 1893 to 1936. But here is where I take issue with the Parliamentary Secretary and his advisers.  When a Bill which has nothing whatever to do with the Insurance Act of 1936 and has only the most tenuous connection with the Friendly Societies Act of 1896 is introduced then that should be clearly set forth in the Long Title to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The amendment contained in Part III of the Schedule as I understood the explanation of the Parliamentary Secretary the other night&mdash;which I do <Col N="1224" /> not think was all that forthcoming because the Parliamentary Secretary was somewhat abashed by the fact that the Insurance Act of 1936 was in it&mdash;is not related to the general tenor of the Bill which deals with credit unions.  Once you take sections 2 to section 37 you are dealing entirely with credit unions and one would not expect to find an amendment of the Insurance Act of 1936 or, indeed, of the Friendly Societies Act of 1896, in a Bill of this kind.  Having said what is to be said about the Long Title in order then to buttress up this argument we are told: &ldquo;Oh, well, you could not do that because you cannot leave out certain other enactments,&rdquo; because, in fact, we are not amending, we are restricting the application of the Moneylenders Acts of 1900 and 1933 and restricting the application of the Central Bank Act 1942 in sections 28 and 29.  I suppose, if one wishes to take it that way, we are amending these two Acts in that particular way but if there was any desire to meet the legitimate objections of this House to being misled &mdash; now I use the word which I said I did not want to use&mdash; by the manner in which this Bill was brought in and drafted; if there was any attempt at all to meet the legitimate objections of this House, we would not get that kind of stuff.  We would have been told: &ldquo;We could meet this by leaving in &lsquo;certain other enactments&rsquo; and put in before that &lsquo;The Friendly Societies Act of 1896 and the Insurance Act of 1936&rsquo;&rdquo;, but the attitude that sections 28 and 29 are being amended and giving that as an excuse as to why it cannot be done, frankly, annoys me.</P>
    <P>I remember well the committee which sat on Electoral Law Reform and we had officials from the Department of Local Government.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary was a member of the committee.  Our advisers decided that we would amend the law so as to put on the Ballot Paper, opposite each candidate's name, the political Party to which the candidate belonged and the officials in the Department of Local Government said it could not be done.  On the third occasion that it came up they wanted <Col N="1225" /> to persuade us that the committee had decided not to deal further with the matter.  I merely say this to illustrate the <i>non possumus</i> attitude which the Parliamentary Secretary is up against and with which he must deal.  This is the <i>non possumus</i> attitude we have here in this Bill which, frankly, annoys me.  Of course, it can be done.  When we were here the other night I wished to give the Parliamentary Secretary all Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We were very pleased, and we still are pleased with the approach of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Bill. Now we are told because we wished to be accommodating that we are too late in raising the matter at this stage. I approach the Parliamentary Secretary's argument on that in the same way as Senator FitzGerald.  I feel that the Parliamentary Secretary disagrees with me but I do not think under the rules of the House that he would be entitled to reply at this stage.  I certainly would waive that.</P>
    <P>It is certainly the purpose of this Chamber to amend legislation.  It is only as I said at a very late stage that I saw the reference to the Insurance Act of 1936 in the Credit Union Bill. It was at that stage that I decided to put down this amendment, which I considered a reasonable one.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary would like to clarify this and I am prepared to give way to him.</P>

      <P>I think Senator O'Quigley has totally misunderstood this discussion.  Indeed, I am inclined by his attitude to force through what the Parliamentary Draftsman wants.  I did not say that I was totally against the acceptance of amendment No. 1.  I pointed out, as dispassionately as I could, the objections that had been raised by the Parliamentary Draftsman <Col N="1226" /> against their inclusion but I did not commit myself at all.  In fact, In am prepared to accept amendment No. 1, much though I resent Senator O'Quigley's attitude and, indeed, some of the statements he has made.</P>
      <P>I should also like to clarify a misunderstanding which appears to be common to both Senator O'Quigley and Senator FitzGerald in regard to one statement that was made by the Parliamentary Draftsman, with which I said I agreed, that is that in regard to amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 9.  Those amendments raise an issue of a general nature which would have related, not merely to this legislation, but to the whole question of the proper presentation of legislation.  It is, therefore, a very wide issue and one which may be quite properly raised at this or any other stage by the Seanad and which could be quite properly raised by any other Senator or any Member of the other House.  It is a general question of procedure to be adopted in relation to legislation which might be raised more appropriately in some other context.</P>

      <P>I must say I am prepared to accept either version of these amendments, the Government amendments or the one in the names of Senators O'Quigley and FitzGerald, if acceptable to the Seanad.  There was a similar amendment put down by the same Senators on the Committee Stage.  I indicated that I agreed with the point of principle involved, namely, that the law should not be substantially changed by regulation otherwise than with the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is not a great deal of difference between the two amendments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When I got this amendment sheet I was absolutely delighted with the approach adopted by the Parliamentary Secretary on this matter.  That has been my feeling about the Parliamentary Secretary's whole approach to this Bill from the very start and, indeed, here this evening.  I take this early opportunity of tendering my apology for my misinterpretation of what he said earlier.  It was because I felt I had misinterpreted him that I gave way to him when I was making my concluding speech on the last amendment.  The Parliamentary Secretary wants to bring within the ambit of the law the regulatitons which must receive the approval of the Oireachtas before the regulations are made. Naturally, generosity of this nature, which is so rare, should be encouraged wherever it seems to bud and I am pleased to support the Government amendment and withdraw mine.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary has slight preference for his amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not wish that the Parliamentary Secretary, who received and deserved such warm commendation&mdash;I am sure he does not mind whether he gets it&mdash;should leave the House feeling that, notwithstanding the slight misunderstanding we had, <Col N="1229" /> he does not deserve great credit for the manner in which he met the wishes of the Seanad on these amendments.  I regret that the statements the Parliamentary Secretary made on amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9 did not come across to this side with the clarity which one, in retrospect, would have wished.  However, I hope that in the implementation of the Bill the Parliamentary Secretary, if he finds there are any lacunae that have not been dealt with, will come back to the House with amendments when he can be assured of a speedy passage for any such amendments.  I hope the credit unions, which will now have a more definite place in the life of the country, will thrive, and I trust that in future, legislation of this kind will not involve extraneous and unrelated matters.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator.  It is not the first time that lawyers have disagreed and it is not likely to be the last.  I am happy the disagreement in this case was not on the main theme.  I should like to take this opportunity of saying two things. First of all, I have considerable hope, as regards the west of Ireland, in which I have a special interest, in the future of the credit union movement for the purpose of harnessing for parochial, communal and county development projects, funds which at the present time are lying idle or are of a nature which are not attracted by existing forms of investment.  I recommend most heartily the credit union system to the people of the west of Ireland in particular and, of course, I recommend it to the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I should like to take the opportunity of expressing my sincere appreciation of the work done by Miss Nora Herlihy, of the great efforts she has made in fostering interest in the credit union movement.  I take great pleasure in paying this public tribute to Miss Herlihy.  I know she is very pleased that her enthusiasm and energy have helped to make the passage of this Bill possible.  I cannot let the opportunity pass without congratulating the officials responsible for the preparation of this detailed piece of legislation.  I thank them for the <Col N="1230" /> assistance they have given me.  I wish to assure Senator O'Quigley and the House that for the reasons I have mentioned I shall keep a very watchfull eye on the development of the credit union movement and that I shall not be slow to come back to the Oireachtas if improvements in the legislation are required.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Local Government (Reduction of Valuation)" RHead="Bill, 1966: Second and Subsequent Stages">
    <Title>Local Government (Reduction of Valuation) Bill, 1966: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has a two-fold purpose.  Section 1 proposes to extend to the 31st March, 1969, the period in which buildings may be erected, reconstructed or improved in order to qualify for the rates remission under the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Act, 1954. Section 2 will continue indefinitely the exemption from rating of farm buildings newly erected or rebuilt.</P>
      <P>The 1954 Act, as extended by amending Acts passed in 1956, 1960 and 1963, provided for a two-thirds remission of rates for seven years on the valuation of new buildings and on the increased valuation of existing buildings which were reconstructed or improved, where the work of erection, reconstruction or improvement was completed not later than 31st March, 1966.  The remission applies to buildings such as factories, offices, shops, hotels, houses and so on which do not qualify for a remission under any other Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular form of rating relief has now existed in local government legislation for almost half a century. The effects of the great number and variety of such concessions on the effectiveness of our valuation and rating system as an equitable means of distributing local taxation are being examined in the course of current investigations into the whole system of local finance and taxation.  Considerable progress has been made with the investigations and the outcome may include the emergence of general <Col N="1231" /> principles to govern rate remissions for the future.  In the meantime, I feel that the existing concessions provided under the 1954 Act should be continued, on a purely temporary basis, up to 1969.</P>
    <P>An exemption from rates for seven years was given by section 14 of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, for newly erected or reconstructed farm outbuildings.  The period of this exemption was extended from seven to 20 years by the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Act, 1960, in the case of farm buildings built, enlarged or improved between 1st April, 1960, and 31st March, 1963. The completion date was extended to 31st March, 1966, by the amending Act of 1963.</P>
    <P>It has been represented to me that the prospect of new or improved farm buildings eventually becoming liable to be rated has a disincentive effect on investment in such buildings by the farming community.  Proper outoffice buildings are essential in view of the upward trend in the numbers and the acceptable standards of livestock.  The prospect of eventual rating may genuinely tend to detract from the incentive value of the Farm Buildings Scheme.  I feel it is desirable to remove any misgivings which may exist in this regard.  Accordingly, section 2 of the Bill proposes that the valuation of any farm holding will not be increased in the future because of the provision or improvement of farm buildings.  As farm buildings completed since 1st March, 1959, have so far been temporarily exempt from rating, they too will qualify for the proposed indefinite exemption.</P>
    <P>The fact that the rating remission in respect of new or improved farm buildings will thus be continued on an indefinite basis, instead of the present temporary basis, will not, of course, preclude me in due course from reviewing that remission in the light of the general principles emerging from my current consideration of the whole question of rating concessions.  I recommended the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome <Col N="1232" /> this Bill as I feel that it is very necessary.  The Title of the Bill is an Act to amend and extend the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Acts, and it is not only welcome but necessary.  For the past few months many farmers and others have been rather anxious as to whether this legislation was to be continued.</P>
      <P>The fact that this Bill is now introduced, and the fact that it is necessary, are indications that our entire rating system should get a new look and should certainly be overhauled.  Grants for building, extending or improving living accommodation, farm buildings, or factories, are not achieving the results they achieved when they were first introduced.  They were not increased and, therefore, they have not kept pace with costs of production.</P>
      <P>People in general should be encouraged to improve their living accommodation, to extend their business premises, and to improve their conditions in general.  For that reason the Bill is very welcome.  It is not a general review of our rating system which is very old and very iniquitous.  The big drawback in our rating system is that it takes no account of the ability of the ratepayers to meet the ever increasing bill for rates.  The system is completely outmoded but it did serve a very useful purpose down through the years. The fact that it is a difficult problem should not deter us from tackling it and endeavouring to find a solution which would be fair and just to all.</P>
      <P>There are so many new ways of gathering taxes that surely it is within the competence of the Government and the Civil Service to devise a more just scheme.  There are very many instances throughout the country of economic holdings with small dwellings and little or no outoffices paying less rates than uneconomic holdings with big houses or dwellings and a considerable number of outoffices. This is something that should be gone into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present rating system is completely inflexible.  Cottiers pay their rates on the same valuation when their families are small and being reared as <Col N="1233" /> when there are five or six of the family earning wages and bringing wage packets into the cottage every week. In the same way when the family have all gone from the home and the parents are living on a small pension the bill for rates is still there.  The time must come when the present inflexible system will be changed and then there will be a completely new look at this problem.</P>
    <P>The same applies to urban dwellers in our cities and towns.  It is extraordinary to find people not only in the cities but in our rural towns paying up to £50, £60, £70 and £80 a year in rates, and it is extremely difficult to effect a reduction in valuation.  With the ever increasing ways that are being found to get alternative methods of taxation, surely someone could take a look at our rating system and devise a more just form of this means of local taxation.</P>
    <P>The rating system is mainly responsible for the regrettable demolition of many of our big houses on estates and farms throughout the country.  These are big mansions or Victorian houses which would cost perhaps £30,000, £40,000 or £50,000 to build today. I know they are of little use to the present occupier if his occupation is solely agriculture or farming, but most of these big houses are in a fair state of repair and they are being demolished solely because the people cannot afford any more to pay the rates on them.  Therefore, they must go.  Even though these residences or mansions were built in a period which we do not particularly like in our history, if they are in good repair people should be encouraged to keep them because surely they could be put to better use than just destroying them.</P>
    <P>The people who find themselves in possession of these big houses are also the victims when it comes to the bimensal charges fixed by the ESB. The ESB levy their charges on the floor area and do not take into account either the cost of connecting the current or how much, if any, will be used.</P>
    <P>The main objection I have, in common with most people, is that the <Col N="1234" /> rate collector does not care two hoots where the ratepayers find the money so long as he gets it.  Perhaps there has been a slight improvement over the past few years when in most counties the rate collectors were changed from poundage to salaries. Of course, this has been most beneficial to the rate collectors but in most cases they have grown a little more sympathetic.  It is to the credit of the Irish people in general that they are very honourable and in the vast majority of cases they pay the rates, especially when they have the money. It is good to know that our rate collection in most counties is over 90 per cent.  That shows that the people will, if at all possible, endeavour to meet their commitments in this regard. I certainly would like to see a very definite effort being made to tackle this very vexed problem because we now find that the rates are increasing year in and year out and even though there Is this redemption on increases in the valuation the rates still present a very formidable bill.</P>
    <P>This measure, as introduced in the Seanad tonight is, I think, a Bill that any Minister likes to introduce because it does not cost the Exchequer or the central authority anything because the valuations that are reduced or exempted are really spread over the rest of the ratepaying community as rates are struck on the effective valuations and, so, while some people are getting reductions in valuation the reductions they get are made up by them and the rest of the ratepaying community.</P>
    <P>My Party's policy on rates announced last year was to completely derate all the farms which had a total valuation of £25 or under.  We came to that conclusion because we believe, and we see, that the owners of uneconomic holdings are being forced to pay rates on their property and on their building without any regard for their ability to pay.  That is in contrast to the workers or people living in the urban community who are subject to income tax.  Lots of people find it distasteful to pay income tax but at least those paying income tax have an income from which to pay, but the ratepayers are not in the same position. <Col N="1235" /> They pay rates irrespective of whether they show a profit or a loss or whether they make any money throughout the year or not.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will not be impressed by any Senator who advocates a greater reduction in rates, but I feel that this is a problem that must be met sooner or later.  The great fear in rural Ireland at the present time is that people who are just about able to make ends meet are endeavouring, at all costs, to keep their overheads down, and the only possible way people can do that is to keep an eye to their rates and their rate bills and if the cost of administering our counties increases by leaps and bounds each year this is indeed becoming a very tough problem.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Government to give very serious thought to this problem.  I saw where the Minister said that if we were to abolish rates we would also abolish the local authorities but I could not agree with that point of view.  I would only advocate that the rating system should be changed, inasmuch as it would be a little more flexible for people who could not pay rates, or for people who find themselves in the cycle of life, either starting off with high expenses or retired on fixed incomes or pensions. They should have some body or machinery to apply to to have their effective valuations reduced into line with their earnings.</P>
    <P>I feel that if people knew that their rent or their rates or their income tax was going to be at a set percentage of their income there would be no objection to it.  I cannot understand in a small country why we must have so many methods, so many means and so many different bodies collecting rates and taxes from us.  I think that if we could devise a system of having only one body collecting both rates and taxes together it would be much more economic in the long run.</P>
    <P>I feel that this is a very comprehensive problem and while the temporary measure before the House tonight is welcome, I am disappointed that it is only proposed as a stop-gap <Col N="1236" /> or temporary provision, and I would urge on the Minister and the Government to do all in their power to bring in wider legislation which will give to the people of Ireland, the people in both town and country, a more flexible system whereby those who are hard-pressed or down in their luck can appeal to somebody and we should not still be retaining the services of the sheriff who I feel has not left very happy memories for many an Irish family.  I wish to welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to welcome the Bill and I think it comes perhaps a little too late.  Having taken an interest in people who have been looking for grants from the Department of Local Government, I found many people who were terrified to make use of these grants, when we had them as we have not supplementary grants now.  They were afraid to proceed with the work of improving any farm buildings or their own private houses just because they were terrified of the new valuations that were likely to arise as a result of the improvements.  I know people in towns who are still terrified to improve their dwellings and their shops.</P>
      <P>I had occasion a very few years ago to meet a person from Mullingar who had improved the front of his shop. His valuation was greatly increased and he had to go to the circuit court and that cost him £30.  He got a reduction of £1 in the valuation as a result of the circuit court proceedings, and he said it would have been much better for him to hand the increased rates to the county council as it would have been of some use to the county instead of giving it to a junior counsel who tried to get a reduction in the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McDonald said he would like to see a new rating system.  I really do not know what Senator McDonald wants if he is looking for a new rating system.  The people he represents are the farming community and they at the present time have really no fault to find with the present rating system.  Seventy-five per cent of the holdings in Westmeath are under £20 valuation.  That might surprise people <Col N="1237" /> here.  I should like to know what the valuations are in, say, Donegal, Leitrim and Cavan and counties which are supposed to be poorer.  They pay one-tenth of the rate.  If it is 50/- in the £1 their rates should be £50 if there was no remission.  They pay £5 on the first £25. If anyone wants a new system of rates I would say that they should have their heads examined, because if they come into the income tax code quite a number of people who are getting away with murder in the farming community today will be much more hit by any new system which might come in.  If we scrap the rating system we have as regards rural Ireland then we are going into some sort of tax on property or income tax or some other type of tax which will hit the people much harder than they have been hit for quite a long time.</P>
    <P>He also speaks about the big house and the valuation of the big house. Most of the people are demolishing these big houses, and I am not too sorry to see quite a number of them demolished, because we tried on a few occasions to make other use of them and found that we could not. When we tried to deal with them to make a home for retarded children, turn them into a vocational school on a temporary basis, or something of that kind they were totally out of date as regards converting them into any useful purpose.  I have no regrets that these big old mansions with basements and everything of that kind are going.</P>
    <P>Nobody wants them no matter how much land they have, because everywhere in the country there is the question of domestic help and you will not get anyone to come into huge barracks of houses and work in them and do the cleaning that would be expected in a house of that nature.</P>
    <P>In the Housing Act the Minister would not go beyond 1,500 square feet.  I hold that he was absolutely wrong in not going beyond that size of house, because it is easy to cod the Department and the Minister.  All you have to do is put an office next to the house, leaving a door, and when you get the grant you can go out and <Col N="1238" /> live in it.  Every man should be allowed to build a house according to his needs. I do not think that anyone in the country will build a villa that he does not require.  He will just build a house that will accommodate his family at the time he builds it.</P>
    <P>There is something here that I do not exactly like about the Bill, and it is the last paragraph in the Minister's statement, the fact that in the rate remission in respect of new or improved farm buildings, while it is to be continued on an indefinite basis instead of on the present temporary basis, this will not preclude him in due course from reviewing that remission in the light of general principles. In other words, though the Minister gives encouragement under this Bill to get people to go ahead and make their improvements, put up farm buildings and everything else, will he at a future date come out and say: &ldquo;I have you where I want you.  I will do a job on your building and put on the rate accordingly&rdquo;?  I can see that happening if the Minister is short of money.  It would be a wonderful way of collecting more money by saying to the people: &ldquo;No increase in rates now&rdquo;, but in a few years time after the people have taken him at his word and gone ahead with building that they would never have done otherwise, if there was an increase in rates, to come back at some future date and collect according to the particular buildings that have been erected.  I do not like this paragraph.  The Minister covers himself there.  He can say in ten years time: &ldquo;When I passed that Bill I told you that I did not make you any promise about the future&rdquo;.  It is for that reason that I would like to ask the Minister to make a definite statement that people who modernise their buildings during the next ten years will get the benefit of the present Act though there may be something in store for others who come in at a later period.  I do not like that last paragraph in the Minister's statement, because I believe that if people are led up the garden and make improvements during the next few years he may then step in, increase their valuations and collect his taxes.</P>
    <Col N="1239" />
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome particularly section 2 of the Bill, because in a county like Clare, as in most of the western counties, 78 per cent of the total valuations are under £20.  Notwithstanding the generous grants which the Minister did provide to aid people to reconstruct their houses or provide new houses for themselves there is still required from them a certain amount of borrowing. The idea of being faced with the repayment of loan plus an increased rate was an absolute deterrent to taking any steps to modernise their housing conditions.  I think that section 2 of this Bill will at least remove one of these conditions and will add an extra incentive to do something positive now.  In any small holding of under £20 every little economy is vital.  I have no doubt that even now the knowledge that they can build a new house or reconstruct their present one and have no fear of a visitation from the valuation office will be an incentive to them and I am sure will accelerate the reconstruction and building programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the rates question is concerned, if somebody could devise a scheme under which we did not have to pay any rates I would be delighted, like everybody else, but I do not think that for the small farmers, particularly under £20, the rate is a serious problem. Farmers have expressed the opinion to me on several occasions that if they got services something approximating to what they have in the urban areas, if they had good roads, water supplies and fuel and other things reasonably available, they are really not deterred by the rate.  It may be that in the bigger places where the farms are larger there might be a case for a change in the system, but I think that in the interest of the small farmers, as Senator McDonald has said, there is nothing wrong with the present rating system.  In all the schemes that I have seen projected I see no more equitable way of dividing the rural bill amongst those who live in the community than the present rating system.  There may, of course, be cases like Senator McDonald said where you have a house that you should not <Col N="1240" /> have.  If it does not take in the holding that will create a hardship.  Generally, I believe that the farmers themselves realise that the cure might be worse than the disease, and they are prepared to go along with the present system.  The Minister is providing good service in this connection, and I am sure that it will bring rewards in the house building and reconstruction programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a run over the housing grants, ESB tariffs and so forth, and I do not intend to follow on the same lines but to get back a little more to the matter at issue, which is the question of the valuation remission Bill we have before us and to say in regard to it that what we are doing here is, to a large degree, a continuation of what we have been enjoying for some considerable time, as I outlined in my opening statement here, at the same time going a little further in so far as remissions on farm buildings are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fears expressed by Senator McAuliffe about the let-out I have given myself at the tailend of my introductory speech that I am likely to come along ten years from now&mdash; the assumption for which I am very glad is that I will be here ten years from now&mdash;are unfounded.  If there is to be a change that change would be done by legislation taken into both Houses for discussion.  I would be amazed that whoever might bring in such a change would call a halt to the indefinite period or that this would in any way curb the remission already earned by those who will have built within the period of the currency of this particular Act, or until it is amended or repealed.  If there was to be a change I would think that that would be a termination of the date and that those there after that particular termination date would no longer be entitled to the benefits of this remission.  This, I think, would be the reasonable approach by whoever might be around to do that ten or 20 years from now.  But the reason for it, as the House may be aware, is that quite a wide investigation is going on for a considerable time now <Col N="1241" /> into this whole matter of local finance and taxation.  Indeed, I feel at times rather annoyed that we have not reached a point where we could, as a Government and I as a Minister, have something more positive to say as to what the future holds in regard to this particular matter, as to whether we are to have a new system of local taxation or whether we are to amend the system we already have with the inequities which are in it, wipe them out and have correct and proper action taken to streamline the system which, over the years, has stood the fair test of time.</P>
    <P>The committee set up by me some considerable time ago reported by way of first interim report.  A summary of that report was published by way of a White Paper or a release of some kind or another.  The sole purpose was to bring to the notice of the public as a whole and to those immediately interested in rating the difficult problem of the rates system and local taxation as a whole and that there was no ready alternative solution to raising moneys locally than that in some way or another based on valuation, not saying that the present system is absolutely the last word in that regard. But we had it published for this purpose&mdash;to bring to the knowledge of the public the difficulties of the situation and, at the same time, in the hope that it would provoke, by its publication, discussion and, arising from that public discussion, some worthwhile suggestions as to an alternative or improvement.  The sad fact is that while it was last October or November that publication was issued and publicised, not one single proposal as to an alternative or improvement has since been forwarded to my Department or indeed, to any other Department, in so far as I am aware.</P>

      <P>I am rather sad that it should have happened but possibly I am not surprised either because I have had quite an interest in rates for many years before I came into the Department of Local Government.  I have long since reached certain conclusions <Col N="1242" /> in my own mind and those who may have had close contact with me in my days in local authority public life may well know my views but I do not intend to express them at this particular juncture for the simple reason that I do not want in any way to appear to be prejudicing the conclusions of the committee which I set up to report on this matter. Therefore, what views I have about this&mdash;and I have had quite strong views about this for a long time&mdash;I do not intend to give here this evening.</P>
      <P>Let me come back then again to the real issue in this whole matter and to invite here, as I have invited in the Dáil, from members of this House any proposals they may have to remedy any of the anomalies which exist in the present system or to suggest an alternative which might be workable. I will welcome any such proposals from any of you at any time in the not too distant future.  They will be carefully examined and considered and will, if found useful, without doubt be incorporated in any new changes we propose to make.  As I have said, these proposals or suggestions will be carefully considered from any source regardless of what that source may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Fine Gael policy of derating the first £25 valuation of land, this, of course, is a very easy thing to do&mdash;make promises when, in fact, you are not in a position to have to foot the bill for them.  Let us look at the position and realise that when Fine Gael had a majority at certain times the situation in regard to local taxation was based on the same system as we are operating now.  One might ask is this a new-found policy or did they not see any fault or anything wrong with the system that they had and did nothing about?  One could even go further and remind them of the situation in 1955-56 when the total amount of agricultural grant which went to the relief of land rates was £5.2 million which meant, at that time, 46 per cent of the rates on land and that in the year 1966-67 this grant will have risen to £13.32 million, representing 63 per cent of the rates on land.  This is what we are doing while, at the same time, we are in many ways being castigated for <Col N="1243" /> not doing it quickly enough and for not doing much more.  Indeed, I should add that over the 11-year period the net rates on land have remained almost static and that in a period of 11 years when money values have continued to depreciate and costs continued to rise. This, I think, is a fair indication that while we have not found the answer or the alternative to the present complaints about our rating system as a source of local taxation, nevertheless we have not sat and done nothing whatsoever about the situation.  We have contributed quite considerably in this particular regard and I would further say to the Senator who has made this point, and to Fine Gael in general, that at this present juncture we are abating 80 per cent of the first £20 of all land valuations in this country at the moment.  I may as well give the House the statistics in my own county and tell you that 89 per cent of all the farms in my county are under £10 valuation.  I heard somebody say that 75 per cent of theirs were under £20.  Eighty-nine per cent of all the farms in my county are under £10 valuation.  Therefore, only 20 per cent really falls to be abated. This applies in varying degrees right down the west and across the country, to a lesser degree as the farms increase in size and the valuations increase proportionately; indeed, in many cases they increase more than proportionately relating to the value of the land as we move across the Midlands and down to the east coast.</P>
    <P>Rates have increased.  There is no question about that.  Nobody tries to hide that fact.  They have increased fivefold since 1939.  This is not the most striking feature.  At the same time, in the same period, moneys by way of State grants have increased ninefold.  We find that rates netted 52 per cent of local expenditure in 1938/39.  In 1959/60 they netted 40 per cent but they are only 32 per cent this year.  On the reverse side State grants for those same years were 39 per cent, 43 per cent and this year 51 per cent of the local revenue expenditure.  Somebody may ask where the difference comes if you add those <Col N="1244" /> figures for the same years.  Those figures are related to the expenditure from the local authority.</P>
    <P>When you talk about the problem of increasing rates those are things which should be kept in mind.  We should realise that a great deal is being done in this regard despite the fact that no final solution has been reached by the Government nor has it emerged in theory from anybody else.  I only hope we could have the experience of all those people who see the faults which are there at present but very few of those people come forward with concrete solutions. Taking all round, this is only a very small and temporary measure in the sense that it is related to temporary valuations from 1954 to 1963.  It has been criticised on the basis that it is temporary.  This is something which cannot be taken too seriously for the reason that it was never intended to be anything other than temporary.  I hope that we will get to the point when we can emerge from this and that we will find a remedy for the situation.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have some conclusions from the committee now investigating this matter from which we may find a remedy to improve the situation. I sincerely believe that the position in regard to the inequities of the present application of the rating system can be improved.  This is the least that can be said at the present time.  If this and nothing else can be done, I hope that all those who complain about the inequities at the present time, will support legislation brought in to change them and that they will agree that those who pay less at the present time will have to pay more in the future.  It is all very well to say that certain people are paying too much at the present time and nothing is being done about it.  It must be realised that there are other people who are paying too little at the present time and that they will likely have to pay more at some future date.</P>
    <P>It has been said that our present rating system is lagging behind present day costs.  It is quite true that it is lagging behind present day costs and <Col N="1245" /> modern values and there are now glaring variations in property valuations of one kind or another.  If we are to deal with this on a proper basis we must be prepared not only to reduce those who are paying more than their share but to seek an increase from those who are paying less than their share at the present time.  I hope that those who at present criticise the fact that some people are paying too much and tell us what is wrong with our present system will not criticise us if we ask those who are paying too little at the present time to pay more.  I hope we will receive support from those people when that time comes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave some figures and I should just like to point out that the agricultural grant is only part of the agricultural rate.  It is a misconception to think that agricultural rates have been static since 1951 when the rates the farming community pay have been increasing yearly.  As well as that, the incomes of farmers have not increased very much since then.  As a matter of fact, if you take <Col N="1246" /> barley, it was 50/- then as compared with 45/- last year.  The very fact that the Government give 80 per cent remission on the first £20 valuation of rates is an indication that there is a serious problem there.  In my opinion this section of the community should be completely relieved of this taxation which does not take into account their ability to pay it.</P>
