      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned I was making a case that the extension of the Social Welfare Acts does not meet modern requirements. It improves the benefits that existed more than ten years ago.  It is now only changing the scale in relation to wage levels, higher living costs and higher standard of living.</P>
      <P>The proposed scheme will impose a burden of an extra £3 to £4 million on employers and that still will not relieve them of the major liability which exists in connection with workmen's compensation, that being, of course, the common law liability portion of the indemnity which is required for an employee.  The extra charge per stamp will amount to more than £5 per man per year and more than £4 per woman per year in addition to the heavy cost of the social welfare card at the moment jointly borne by employers and employees.  I should like to know from the Minister, when he is replying, whether the State will be making any contribution towards the scheme for the payment of compensation or whether it is purely and simply being financed by the employers' contributions, amounting to something around £3 million per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that although he gave, if you like, rough and round figures, he has indicated that, in fact, this scheme will be reviewed. <Col N="322" /> He must have the feeling that, in fact, the extra £5 per man and £4 per woman will not be sufficient to pay the proposed scale of benefits under this extension of the Social Welfare Scheme.</P>
    <P>Now this all comes at a time when we have in this country the lowest number of wage and salary earners in recorded history.  This small number of people will come in for this benefit and it is a set benefit, not related to the wage levels or earning capacity of the workers involved.  Under this scheme apparently no lump sum settlement is envisaged and workers will not have the option of seeking a lump sum settlement as they had under the existing legislation.  They were able to sue for a settlement on a lump sum basis after the expiration of a certain period of incapacity.  Now they have no opportunity to seek a lump sum settlement in relation to loss and incapacity resulting from an accident.</P>
    <P>This lump sum settlement was of great advantage to certain classes of employees particularly if they were practical enterprising people who might be able to invest the money in worthwhile projects and provide employment for others.  This imposition on employers is a double burden so far as insurance is concerned because when they have paid £5 per man on the insurance card for their employees they will still be required, so far as prudence is concerned, to go to an insurance company and pay a premium which will cover their common law liability and, in fact, the common law liability is a major portion of the risk so far as employers are concerned.</P>
    <P>Many employers would not insure themselves against workmen's compensation if they had only to pay weekly compensation.  They usually pay insurance premiums to cover themselves, their property and their interests against a heavy claim brought against them under the common law.  They have not been relieved of that liability under this scheme.  The Government have not taken over this portion of the liability for employers and the result is that when a small deduction is made from the premiums, where <Col N="323" /> weekly compensation is concerned, they will be required to pay premiums now to cover their common law liability of almost 75 per cent and I should like to think of the premiums they are now paying as covering all their liabilities.</P>
    <P>In addition to paying 75 per cent on the premium which they have normally paid, they will be required now to pay £5 per man and £4 per woman per annum under this extension.  It is stated according to statistics that this scheme will actually withdraw from the insurance companies a premium income of almost £3 million.  That is a considerable withdrawal when we remember that insurance companies have supported the State very handsomely throughout the year by making substantial contributions towards various national loans which were designed for our economic development and expansion.  This £3 million per annum will be withdrawn now from the insurance companies in spite of the fact that they have made a major contribution to the building up of our industrial economy.  I was disappointed not to see in the Minister's statement that any compensation for insurance companies was envisaged.  He must know losses will result from this transfer of premium income.  Staffs which were employed on the administration of the employers' liability insurance will become redundant, except in so far as the common law liability section of insurance is concerned.  There is nothing in the Bill to say that compensation will be paid to employees who may lose their employment with insurance companies, possibly after a long number of years' service owing to the fact that this £3 million per year will be withdrawn from the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister whether any suggestion has been submitted to him from the insurance companies regarding the question of compensation, and whether he has considered the number of persons who will be left without employment in the commercial insurance companies as a result of the withdrawal of this annual premium income of approximately £3 <Col N="324" /> million.  It is bound to have repercussions. With the shrinking number of people in employment we can only assume it will be compensated by an increased number of civil servants in the Department of Social Welfare who will be required to administer the weekly compensation section.</P>
    <P>When this scheme is not prepared to give lump sum settlements to employees, it is most unfair to have the provision that a deduction will be made from common law damages if they are received by an employee having taken his case to court and won it.  Now if he wins his case the Department apparently will have the first claim on the amount of damages awarded to the injured man and his damages will be reduced by the amount of weekly compensation or other benefits paid to him in the meantime, up to a maximum of 5 years. There, again, we could calculate what a heavy loss it would be to an injured workman if five years' compensation paid to him by the Department of Social Welfare is deducted now from the common law damages which he receives independently of the Department, through the courts, having made a successful case for recovery of damages resulting from an accident.</P>
    <P>These aspects of the changes should be made known to us.  Possibly it will arise on Committee Stage of this Bill but there will be repercussions which are not immediately envisaged in this extension of the social welfare code. It is a major change in so far as workmen's compensation is concerned. We will now have the injured man dealing with Departments in the usual red-tape manner, rather than the more personal manner of dealing with him which exists under the present system of employers' liability insurance where he is immediately in contact with his doctor, his employer, his solicitor and, through him of course, with the insurance officials.  I am sure we can expect that this scheme will be administered on much the same basis as the other social welfare schemes at the present time.  As has been mentioned by a Senator, it frequently becomes necessary for these employees, or recipients, to contact their local TD or Senator <Col N="325" /> regarding delays in the Department. Very often the delay is not the fault of the Department but the man does not understand that and he finds it necessary to consult the TD or Senator who immediately finds out the reason for the delay.  That is because dealings with the Department are less personal than with his insurance company, his employers, local doctors, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>Possibly this scheme will also encourage malingering because it has a flat scale of benefits and there are circumstances where, in fact, if the benefits were added up, taking into consideration the wife, dependant children and others, the total amount to which a man would be entitled could be more than his actual wage level.  He will not get more than he was earning in the ordinary way.  It says the compensation he is to receive will not exceed his weekly earnings.  In other words, the man on the lower scale of wages or salary will now be as well off receiving compensation under the social welfare scheme as if he were working.  There was always the arrangement whereby the compensation was something less than the actual wages received in the course of employment. That was, of course, to encourage the man to go back to work as soon as he was fit to do so but if a man is receiving compensation equal to his normal weekly wage, or near it, I have no doubt there will be very little anxiety on the part of that man to return quickly to his employment, whereas under the present scheme, the injured man is always anxious to get back to work as soon as he has recovered from his injuries and is certified fit for work.</P>
    <P>It will need to be a very carefully operated scheme if, all over the country, the condition of injured persons is to be kept up to date on the files in the Department.  It is possible they will be overlooked for a number of weeks or months and will be receiving compensation from the Department of Social Welfare equal to the wages they would normally be earning if they had not qualified for the payment of the weekly compensation.  It may be suggested that employees are honest, and, of course, they are.  The point I <Col N="326" /> am making is that an injured employee will probably convalesce for a longer period after the injury if his wages are about the same as the amount of compensation to which he is entitled, whereas the ordinary man is anxious to get back to work as soon as he is certified fit to begin work again.</P>
    <P>I feel this arrangement is a stopgap measure only.  It is designed only to improve the benefits which were decided in 1955.  Of course, it is time that those benefits were brought up to date in relation to wage levels and costs, and the increased cost of living and higher standard of living. So, in fact, the Minister is merely effecting a remedy which is long overdue. It has been overdue for ten years, because costs have increased considerably during that time, and the compensation payable to injured employees should have kept pace with them, but no legislation was brought in to ensure that that was the case.</P>
    <P>It must be said that the system of compensation for injured employees so far as administration is concerned was probably satisfactory.  As it stood, the worker had the right to go to court. His case could be heard in the open, and it could be seen that he was fairly treated.  Under this Bill an injured person has no right to take the Minister for Social Welfare to court, and to fight his case in court.  Apparently he is bound by regulations, and that is the answer he will get.  He is now purely and simply a cog in the wheel, and one of a list of persons to be treated in a certain manner under certain regulations. The human aspect never comes into it when it comes to enforcing regulations or determining regulations.  That is the difference between the situation in which the injured man will now find himself, and the situation he was in before when all these things could be taken into consideration in open court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill which is undoubtedly a great advance on anything we have had previously.  It is in <Col N="327" /> line with the humane and progressive attitude which the Minister has adopted since he became Minister for Social Welfare.  This is obviously an advance on the workmen's compensation system we have at present.  It is also a considerable advance, in many respects, on the proposals set out in the Majority Report of the Commission.</P>
      <P>The most obvious improvement is the one which is welcomed by everyone, the increased benefits which will be payable under this Bill.  We also have new schemes such as the provision covering loss of faculty and the provision for rehabilitation.  This also ends the system of lump sum payment and that is a very satisfactory part of the Bill.  There have been some complaints, but I think on the whole that there is very little doubt that that was a bad system.  It was a bad system in that these payments could be commuted into lump sums without the sanction of the worker.  It is an extraordinary proposition&mdash;and it is surprising that it should have existed for so long&mdash;that a worker's payments could be ended in exchange for a lump sum without his sanction, or even against his wish.</P>
      <P>I know there are some cases where a lump sum could be very useful. I know of one case where a small farmer who was working for the county council was injured.  He was paid a lump sum and he made, and is continuing to make, extremely good use of it.  It is obvious that in the vast majority of cases a worker would not be fitted to deal with sums of this kind.  He would not know how to go about it.  The lump sum would be frittered away on non-essentials, or put into some form of business activity for which he might not be fitted, and the result could be that in a very short time the money would be gone and he would be left without anything.  I think it is very satisfactory that lump sums have been done away with under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question which has exercised people a great deal, and particularly lawyers on both sides of the House, is the question of the removal of <Col N="328" /> workmen's compensation from the courts.  I think a great deal of unnecessary excitement has been caused by this.  It seems to me that this is a case where no real matter of principle is involved.  The only thing to be considered is how will this work. We have been told by several people that 99 per cent of workmen's compensation cases do not go to court. Such cases as do go to court hang on questions of fact.  The real question is whether the officials of the Department of Social Welfare or the courts should decide questions of fact. That seems to be purely a matter of convenience and I do not see that there is any real question of principle involved.</P>
    <P>I think Senator O'Kennedy rather minimised the fees payable in workmen's compensation cases.  I agree that workmen's compensation cases are not by any means the most remunerative part of the activities of barristers or solicitors and they will not really lose anything by this Bill.  I accept that they are not worrying about fees, but I feel that lawyers have an attitude about the courts which perhaps is not shared by the average layman.  Lawyers appear in court very frequently and I do not think they realise that to the ordinary man in the street, and particularly to less well educated people, appearing in court is an ordeal to be avoided at all costs.  People look on the courts with dread, and I do not think lawyers understand that.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan said yesterday that he felt there was a tendency in recent years for the State to whittle away the matters that go to court and that things which were formerly decided in court were no longer so decided.  He said this was a bad thing.  There has been this tendency, but I think he is going about it the wrong way by complaining about it.  Rather than complaining that arrangements have been made so that certain matters need no longer be referred to the courts, he should consider how our present courts system could best be reformed so that there will not be this general public dread of going to court, and particularly that there will not be this general <Col N="329" /> feeling that the courts are extremely slow and extremely expensive.  This general attitude has led to the introduction of this Bill.  The trade union community on the whole feel very strongly that workmen's compensation should be taken away from the courts and dealt with by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>It is entirely a matter of convenience. It is entirely a matter of how best the business can be done.  The trade unionists have been doing it for a number of years.  They feel apparently very strongly that by and large leaving those matters to the Department is a more reliable way of doing things and much quicker although there would always be individual cases which could not be dealt with in this way.  That is the feeling of the workers and, as they are the people who will be affected by this Bill, it is unrealistic for people to say that this will in some way deprive the workers of their rights.</P>
    <P>This is purely a matter of convenience. It is undoubtedly more convenient to deal with those questions through this system than through the courts.  When 99 per cent of those cases are already settled out of court surely this is the best way to do it.  The feeling of the workers is that they will get on better with the officials of the Department of Social Welfare than being left to the mercy of insurance companies to deal with those things.  It is better that this particular aspect of the matter is taken away from the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of criticisms have been made of my proposed solution to this problem with which I have to deal. Senator FitzGerald, predictably, started off, first of all, to convict me of the unspeakable crime of having replied in Irish to a Parliamentary question addressed to me in that language by a Deputy.  As I say that was a predictable thing.  I knew that would be his approach.  Apparently, his belief was that having first of all established me as a transgressor in this regard, that is as a non-conformist with Senator FitzGerald's standard of behaviour, it <Col N="330" /> would then be easier for him to demolish the Bill.</P>
      <P>Apparently it is a crime for me to reply in Irish to a question addressed to me in Irish.  Senator FitzGerald does not like it.  I did not have to wait until I came here yesterday to learn Senator FitzGerald's feelings with regard to the Irish language. I am well aware of them but Senator FitzGerald assumes tacitly that because he does not like the Irish language, therefore it must be universally accepted that it is wrong to use it. Unfortunately, there are people who do not accept that that is necessarily so.  It is quite obvious from his remarks on this subject that he confidently expected that I would beat my breast and say &ldquo;<i>mea culpa</i>, I will not do it again&rdquo;.  That appears to be his whole attitude, not only with regard to Irish, but with regard to every subject.  Once he has spoken the matter is ended, the matter is decided.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Senator will have to face up to the situation that there are awkward and unreasonable people like trade union leaders and Fianna Fáil Ministers who do not accept his modest assessment of himself as the ultimate authority on every subject under the sun.  Those people exist and Senator FitzGerald cannot just will them out of existence.  As I say, I did not have to wait until yesterday to learn what the Senator's attitude was with regard to the national language.  But the Constitution is there.  The Constitution is there admittedly against his wishes and against the wishes of his Party.</P>

      <P>It might be no harm if Senator FitzGerald remembered that even at the time when the situation which he desires to bring about was there, when it was officially a crime to utilise Irish for public purposes, there were people even then who were prepared to incur penalties for using it.  With regard to the question that this answering of a question in Irish was a subterfuge, that this was an effort to make an announcement and not make it at the same time&mdash;it passes my comprehension why anybody should want to do that&mdash;anybody can verify this fact by looking through the Dáil debates at the time and they will find that since the date of the submission of the Commission's Report to me roughly on an average of once per month some Deputy of the Labour Party put a question as to what was the Government's intention in regard to the question of workmen's compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil session was coming to an end.  Surely I had no reason to suppose that the Labour Party representatives in the Dáil would let the session end without asking another question.  I had had a series of questions from Deputy Corish, Deputy Kyne and Deputy Tully, all people who had a genuine interest in this question of workmen's compensation.  I do not know how they happened to let the session come to an end without putting down a further question, particularly in view of the fact that I had indicated to them that <Col N="332" /> it was coming near the stage when I would be able to make a decision in principle on the matter.  I was not particularly anxious to make an announcement since all I had at the time was a decision in principle.</P>
    <P>It was purely a matter of luck that there was not a question down in English before that particular Dáil session ended.  I suppose it is unfortunate that the use of Irish by Deputies should so offend and outrage Senator FitzGerald. Unfortunately, this is a matter which is likely to happen again.  He will have to try to live with the position that there are some people who are prepared to incur his wrath by the use of the Irish language.  In fact, so far as I am personally concerned, he may as well know that so far from feeling regret in regard to this matter, I get some personal satisfaction from the knowledge that this incident aroused his fury.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, in dealing with this Bill, Senator FitzGerald was continuing his wrangling with the trade union representatives which apparently took place during the Commission's consideration of this matter. It was quite obvious he was carrying that a stage further here in this forum where the trade union representatives on that Commission were not present to contest his description of the attitude they took up in regard to this matter. They again dared to disagree with the oracle and they have been suitably chastised here and admonished as to their future behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They may feel that their years of experience in dealing with workers' affairs give them some particular authoritativeness in expressing the workers' point of view and looking after their interests, but they have been told and, indeed, in no uncertain terms, that this attitude displeases Senator FitzGerald, and the implication apparently <Col N="333" /> is that they should now decide to cast aside their attitudes and beliefs which have arisen from their years of experience and learn their job anew from the master.  It is nothing new for Fianna Fáil Ministers to have the opposition of Fine Gael for any measure for the improvement of social welfare.  Fianna Fáil Governments have introduced every expansion in our social welfare services since the British days here, and always in the teeth of Fine Gael opposition.  We have had this experience on every social welfare scheme with the exception of the noncontributory old age pensions and the rudimentary form of unemployment benefit which was in existence in British times.  The fact of the matter is that Fine Gael were always wrong regarding social welfare, and the reason is that they do not really believe in it. If I did not face Fine Gael opposition I would be inclined to doubt if I was on the right lines at all.</P>
    <P>Do thug an Seanadóir MacGearailt fúm, freisin, toisc go ndúirt mé gur chéim mhór ar aghaidh an Bille seo i gcúrsaí leasa shóisialaigh.  Deirim arís é.

Anois. béimíd ar cheann de na náisiúin is fearr maidir leis an gné seo de chúrsaí leasa shóisialaigh, ach ní aontaíonn Fine Gael go mbaineann cúiteamh do lucht oibre le leas sóisalaigh ar chor ar bith.  Sin í an dhifríocht mhór atá eadrainn.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the delay in bringing in this Bill and making this change in workmen's compensation, I do not agree that there has been any excessive delay on my part.  It is a fact that the Commission sat for a period of six years before producing these two Reports to me on the 19th February, 1962.  The present Bill was introduced in the Dáil in July 1965, and it is alleged that this was an excessive delay.  This was quite a bulky Report containing a great deal of information and a great deal of argument on one side and the other, and when this was received it was studied thoroughly in my Department. There is also a certain Cabinet procedure that has to be gone through <Col N="334" /> in regard to the initiation of new measures.</P>
    <P>This document had to be printed first of all and circulated to other Government Departments for their observations. When the matter had been thoroughly examined in my Department the question of what decision we should make had to be considered, and eventually I decided that it would be right for me to make a recommendation to the Government to make the type of change I am proposing in this Bill.  This was a radical change that I was proposing should be made. I had then to prepare a submission to my colleagues giving the reasons why I thought this change should be made, and again it took some considerable time to have this dealt with.  At this stage I had not prepared a detailed Bill.  I first of all put forward the reasons as to why this change should be made and obtained a decision in principle, and only after that the question of the detailed proposals arose. It was only when these had been submitted in the normal way to the Government that the drafting of the Bill could be undertaken.  The Bill was eventually introduced in July, 1965.  I do not accept any responsibility for the preliminary six years taken by the Commission in dealing with the matter, and I think that subsequent to that the Bill was introduced in a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>We have the question of what Senator FitzGerald describes as the four vital features of a workmen's compensation or occupational injuries scheme. Here, again, there is no question of saying that in his opinion these are the four essential features.  He just says that these are four essential features and apparently that is that.  His brief says so, so we must all click our heels and agree.  In fact I do not agree that they are.  There are arguments for and against risk-rating, and I think the arguments against the principle are more convincing than those in favour of it.  I deliberately took the decision to eliminate risk-rating and to spread the load.  Of course, the Fine Gael attitude is that this is not a matter for social welfare insurance at all, that it is not social welfare legislation.  That is <Col N="335" /> where we disagree.  That is the fundamental disagreement.  I believe that it is.  It was later admitted by one of the Fine Gael speakers that agriculture was, for instance, one of the more highly risk-rated occupations in this country, and the view was expressed that this risk was a fairly serious load on that important industry in the country, so that if we were to continue with the idea of risk-rating the load on our primary industry of agriculture would be excessive.  I think it is a good and justifiable principle to spread this overhead for insurance against occupational injury or disease over the whole economy rather than that some of our more vital industries should have to bear an excessive overhead in regard to this matter which is a liability created by legislation.</P>
    <P>We then have the principle of wage relation.  I agree that wage relation is desirable subject to the provision of minimum basic compensation to be available to any injured worker, and that it is not by any means impossible to have that.  There is, however, a certain amount of difficulty attached to it. My proposal is to make this matter of occupational injury and disease part of the social welfare code and I should prefer to consider this question of wage relation in the context of the whole of our social welfare code rather than in one isolated instance.  Apart from that, the two sections of the Commission who reported&mdash;the Majority and the Minority&mdash;had apparently roughly the same idea as to the total load which it was feasible and reasonable to put on the economy in relation to this question of insurance against occupational injury.</P>
    <P>Working roughly within that amount, I think the benefits that are provided within this Bill are about as good as we could do.  If we were to have a clearly wage related scheme, utilising the same amount of money, obviously we could only give more to those who had higher incomes when they were at work at the expense of those who had low incomes, so that while I do not preclude the possibility of wage relation being introduced at some future time when it appears to be <Col N="336" /> feasible, working with the amount of money which I decided it would be reasonable to ask the economy to provide, I do not think it is feasible to provide an adequate basic amount for everybody at the same time in a scheme involving wage relation.</P>
    <P>One of the most frequent epithets used by Senator FitzGerald in his attack on me, on the Bill and on the Department of Social Welfare was the word &ldquo;spurious&rdquo;.  If the word &ldquo;spurious&rdquo; can be applied to anything, it is to the so-called wage related scheme Senator FitzGerald submitted to me in the Report of the Commission on Workmen's Compensation.  If ever there was a spuriously wage related scheme it was that.  The recommendations in that document were that for people earning up to £4 per week the benefit should be at the rate of 80 per cent of their wages; for people earning between £4 and £6 per week, the rate should be 75 per cent of their wages; and people earning more than £6 per week should get 60 per cent, but subject to a maximum of 140/- per week.  Now, £7 is 60 per cent of £11.13.4.  Senator FitzGerald spoke here about the inadequate provision made for the decline in the standard of living of all who earn higher wages, but his idea of wage relation for people earning higher wages was equated in this document to 60 per cent of a wage of £11.13.4. That was his submission to me.</P>

      <P>In regard to his proposal that for those who were earning £6 per week the benefit provided should be at the rate of 60 per cent of their wages, it might be no harm to point out that this was a deliberate proposal made by Senator FitzGerald after long and intensive study of the matter which failed to measure up to the relevant recommendations of the International Labour Organisation which was to the effect that benefits should be at least 66? per cent of workers' wages if they were provided in this way.  I realise very definitely that there is a good case for the provision of benefits in proportion to wages but I certainly cannot <Col N="337" /> agree that Senator FitzGerald's proposal comes anywhere near to that.</P>

      <P>I shall reply to this debate in my own way.  The Senator made his speech without interruption by me and I shall make mine as I see fit.  I wish to make some comparison between the benefits I am proposing in the Bill and the benefits Senator FitzGerald would like to give.  Senator O'Quigley alleged that the benefits I propose to provide in the Bill are not as good as would be an increase in the present maximum of £4 10s. per week proportionate to the cost of living, which he said would require an increase of £6 10s. per week.  Senator FitzGerald went beyond that and recommended there should be an increase to a maximum of £7 per week.</P>

I am well aware of the fact that during his speech on Second Reading of this Bill he made vague references to other things that might have been done, but his considered opinion after a long study of the matter, when he had to be serious and responsible, is here in this Report of the Commission on Workmen's Compensation.  He can be as wild and irresponsible as he likes now when he is merely a Fine Gael Senator.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but he gave <Col N="338" /> further reasons as to why these recommendations should be accepted.  With regard to a maximum of £7 per week for every man, whether married or single, no matter what wages he had in the past, with the benefits that are being proposed in the Bill a single man who suffers a severe disability but is still able to go back to his employment and earn his full wages, will get a weekly payment of £5 15s.  If, in addition to suffering this disability he is also unable to earn his living, he will get £8 7s. 6d per week, a figure which exceeds Senator FitzGerald's recommendation by 27/6d a week&mdash; the figure the Senator gave as the absolute maximum for anybody, irrespective of family commitments or previous wages.</P>

      <P>Yes, for a single man.  While, with the amount of money <Col N="339" /> I felt it was feasible to ask the employers generally to contribute, it has not been feasible to introduce wage relation, we have been able to introduce a scheme which bears some relationship to need as reckoned by family commitments. The proposals submitted to me by Senator FitzGerald are wage related in theory only but in actual fact the degree of wage relationship is just illusory.</P>
      <P>The next question was that of appeals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister withdrawing his misleading statement in the Dáil that the Commission recommended a flat rate benefit instead of wage related benefits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What I intended to say was that there was this difficulty in arriving at pre-accident earnings which led the Commission to seriously consider it but they did, in fact, recommend wage relationship.  It would be a desirable thing, and nobody would claim that it is impossible to do it, but it is a difficult thing and at the rate of imposition on industry that was proposed was just not feasible to do and at the same time ensure that even a lowly paid worker would get adequate compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question of appeals, there seems to me here to be a determination to try to ensure that some of the income into this occupational injuries fund will be swallowed up in legal costs.  What Senators do not seem to have grasped is that there will not be any need for these legal battles in future.  The question of whether an accident, injury or disease arises out of employment, and in the course of employment, is clarified in this Bill and that question will no longer depend on the relative degrees of skill and knowledge of the matter displayed by the counsel for the injured workman, and for the employer or for the insurance company, as the case may be.  The type of matter that will fall to be decided by Deciding Officers will be similar to the type of question they have to decide at present.  That, I take it, <Col N="340" /> is why the workers' representatives on the Commission were satisfied that this type of decision and appeals machinery would be the best type to recommend.  The type of case, for instance, which Senator O'Quigley referred to, where the injury was due to &ldquo;skylarking&rdquo; is now clearly within the scope of the legislation and it will not be necessary in a case like that in the future for the workman to depend on the employers' or insurance companies' case not being adequately put to the court.</P>
    <P>A judge may, and I am sure normally was, predisposed in favour of the workman, but still in this contest between the two teams of legal men he had to score the contest in accordance with the rules.  However much he would favour one side there would not be much a judge could do about it if the case against the workman were established.</P>
    <P>A lot has been made about this suggestion that it is wrong that the appeal should be from one civil servant to another civil servant.  I do not see that there is anything particularly outrageous about that. If you were to have an adjudication by the courts the appeal will be from one judge to another judge and it is a fact that in existing social welfare schemes Appeals Officers do in quite a reasonable number of cases vary decisions given by Deciding Officers and the proportion would be just as high as the proportion of decisions of lower courts which are reversed on appeal to higher courts.</P>
    <P>This Bill I am introducing here is a proposal to amend and extend the existing social welfare Acts, so that when Senators argue for the introduction of the courts procedure into the decision and appeals machinery of this particular aspect of social welfare, it would have to be brought in for the whole social welfare code. While I accept that fees in general were not by any means excessive in regard to workmen's compensation cases, it is a fact that the only tangible result of doing this would be to fritter away some, at least, of the occupational injuries Fund so far as this Bill is concerned and the social <Col N="341" /> insurance Fund in so far as the other benefits are concerned in legal costs.</P>
    <P>Of course, nobody whose appeal is rejected is ever satisfied and the fact that his appeal would be rejected by a judge rather than by a civil servant would not sweeten the pill for the applicant and, particularly, it would not be sweetened by the fact that he got the rejection of his appeal at some cost to himself.  I think we are entitled to accept the opinion of the workers' representatives that by and large the decision and appeals machinery of the Department of Social Welfare has worked well up to now and there is no case for now handing over this to the courts with the inevitable expense that would be involved and thereby not alone eating into some of the money at present available for benefits but also making it more difficult in future to effect further improvements in social welfare.</P>
    <P>My Department and I have been assailed for not having more imagination in regard to social welfare.  In so far as this particular issue of workmen's compensation or occupational injuries is concerned, I have a proposal here before the Seanad for the employers of this country to provide a Fund with an annual income of £2.5 million.  There is no point in my imagining that I have more money than that in order to do this job, or that I can do anything better and provide higher benefits without increasing the load on industry.  Both the Majority and the Minority Reports had roughly the same idea of the total amount of the load which it was reasonable to impose on industry.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael Senators have been adopting the traditional Fine Gael line of expecting the people to believe that better benefits for everybody can be provided at the same cost.  I know people are capable of realising that if an existing definite sum of money is re-allocated in a different way and if some people get more, then others will get less.  This is the old unsuccessful Fine Gael confidence trick to try to pretend that every social welfare recipient's position can be improved with no extra expense if only the Department <Col N="342" /> of Social Welfare officials and Government Ministers had this supreme quality which Fine Gael have in such abundance&mdash;imagination.  Unfortunately, I have to pay for any benefits I provide and there is no use my imagining I have the money if I have not.</P>
    <P>I was asked, rather surprisingly, about this Convention of the International Labour Conference, to which I referred.  Apparently Senator FitzGerald had not heard of it, despite all the research into this question he would ask us to believe he has conducted. This was Convention No. 121, a Convention concerning benefits in the case of employment injury.  I cannot undertake to give the Seanad any great idea of what it contains now.  There are 39 Articles, two Schedules and an Annexe but it is available for anybody who wants to study it.  As regards the standing of this Convention, which was adopted by the International Labour Organisation in 1964, it lays down the highest standards to date in respect of provisions for employment injury and disease by Conventions of this organisation.  The ratification of the Conventions of this body represents a more far-reaching net-work of international obligations than have been created in any field of economic or social welfare policy.  The provisions of the convention and recommendations of the International Labour Conference are in the international labour code.  The standards of policy embodied in the code have the unique prestige of having been approved by a two-thirds majority of a world industrial Parliament in which governments, employers and workers are all represented, so the fact that this Bill enables us, if we so decide, to ratify this Convention is something which entitles me to describe this Bill as being a major advance in social welfare.</P>

      <P>Indeed we are not. If Senator FitzGerald would look at the Report which he signed&mdash;this Commission's Report&mdash;he would see that what I said in my opening statement on this Bill was correct in regard to the then existing Convention of the International Labour Organisation, which provided for much lower standards in regard to this matter, and we were not in a position to sign them in regard to workmen's compensation. The recommendations Senator FitzGerald made to me in this respect, which were so inadequate that no Minister for Social Welfare except possibly, a Fine Gael one, would accept them would not enable us to sign this Convention now.</P>

      <P>Senators have been talking about EEC standards as if there was some definite EEC system of social welfare. Of course, there are very diverse systems in the EEC countries and there is no question of our deciding to adopt the EEC system.  There is no such thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>To finish the key points I mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason either to suggest there is anything particularly desirable in the EEC systems as distinct from the system we have here.  Admittedly, there is need to increase the standards in a number of our schemes and that is being done in so far as it is possible for the economy of the country to support those improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> The question of small farmers was raised here.  It was suggested that they should be admitted as voluntary contributors to this scheme, which is so deficient and so unfavourable to the insured people!  I have under consideration the possibility of making some parts of the social insurance scheme available on a voluntary basis to people other than those who are compulsorily insurable at present.  The question as to whether this particular aspect of the social insurance scheme could be made available in that way will be considered also.  In the meantime the self-employed people have available to them what some Senators here have claimed to be greatly superior compensation for this hazard which is provided by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>It was alleged here that, in this Bill, we were taking from the insurance companies a sum, which was variably expressed from £3 million to £4 million.  The Majority Report of the Commission&mdash;and this was not disputed by the Minority&mdash;estimated that the amount of premium income of insurance companies from common law liability was £657,000 and from workmen's compensation £1,534,000, which is a total of £2,191,000 of which, of course, only the workmen's compensation element will no longer be available.  One insurance company representative estimated there would be an increase of 25 per cent in the common law premiums, so there is no question of taking £3 million or £4 million from the insurance companies. But it is a fact that, as a result of this decision, there will be some diminution in insurance companies' turn-over.  That, I agree, is a regrettable feature of it.</P>
    <P>I think that is a decision which the Government were entitled to make in view of the fact that this is social welfare legislation.  This liability was created in the first instance in the interests of the workers and with the development of the concept of social welfare and social insurance over the years, I think it was inevitable that this would eventually come within the scope of social insurance.</P>
    <P>While I am on this question I think Senator Rooney was one of those <Col N="345" /> Senators who made the allegation that I was taking £3 million from the insurance companies.  He also said last night that this Bill was imposing an extra load of between £2½ million and £3 million on the employers.  By this morning that sum had grown from between £2½ million and £3 million, to between £3 million and £4 million.  In actual fact, the total liability on the employers for workers' compensation insurance will be £2½ million.  As I said, the Majority Report gave £1,534,000 as the figure for the inadequate rate of benefits provided at present, so the extra imposition for the much greater benefits which are being provided in this Bill is something less than £1 million.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy wanted to know the proposed date for the operation of this scheme.  Well, the delay will be only so long as it takes to make the necessary administrative arrangements. I cannot give a definite undertaking as to when it will come into operation, but I have in mind the beginning of the contribution year, January of next year.</P>
    <P>Both Senator Alton and Senator Jessop referred to the fact that Deciding Officers can make mistakes in regard to the assessment of medical evidence.  Of course, that is quite true. That can happen and has happened in the past in regard to disability benefits, but the thing about the proposed method of dealing with decisions and appeals is that matters like this can always be re-opened.  There will never be such a definite irrevocable type of decision as would result from a court decision in this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of rehabilitation facilities, I am asking for power in this Bill to make contributions out of the fund towards rehabilitation services, and possibly also for research into the cause of accidents. I am satisfied that the Department of Health is the appropriate Department to organise rehabilitation services.  I propose to utilise this fund to assist in the provision of such facilities.  Also in regard to research into the cause of accidents and diseases, I do not think my Department would be the most suitable Department to do this.  I agree that in the organisation of any such research it would be necessary to get <Col N="346" /> the services of experts of the kind mentioned by Senator Jessop.  I should imagine that either the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Department of Education would be the more appropriate Department to deal with this.</P>
    <P>Some Senators seem to think it is a retrograde step not to have lump sum settlements still available.  That is a point of view but, in my opinion, and in the opinion of the Government, these lump sum settlements are not desirable.  It is becoming increasingly difficult for the individual to provide himself with an adequate income for the rest of his life from a lump sum. I think it would be a retrograde step not to eliminate these lump sums and provide a weekly income instead, which is what is generally required by a person who meets with this type of misfortune.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I need say.  As I said before, I think this is a significant advance in social welfare legislation in this country, and I have no hesitation in recommending it to Seanad Éireann.</P>

    <Title>White Paper on the Health Services: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BryanAlton" hpid="Dr. Alton Dr. Alton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the proposals contained in the White Paper on the Health Services and their Further Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In proposing this motion I do so because I think the White Paper contains very many important improvements, and very many important ideas, which are worthy of the full and free discussion which the Minister requested. Mind you, while the Minister's intentions show up very well and clearly through the maze of Departmental caution, and while I think he deserves great credit for this courageous effort to improve the health services, he has really opened a Pandora's box, and it will take a lot of tact, diplomacy, goodwill and co-operation between the Department of Health, the medical <Col N="347" /> profession, and the various political Parties, to bring this issue to a successful and fruitful conclusion.</P>
    <P>There are so many facets of this White Paper that I propose to deal only with the more important ones, and especially those dealing with personnel. The Minister has an antipathy to the southern hemisphere and so, when making comparisons with other countries, I propose to stick to the Northern European countries outside the Iron Curtain.  Some of those, particularly the Scandinavian countries, have some points of great similarity with ours in that they have a few centres of very dense population and large areas of difficult terrain and sparse population.  When one compares the medical statistics of Ireland with those countries the first thing that becomes obvious is that it is really time we pulled our socks up.</P>
    <P>We are the second shortest living people in Northern Europe.  From the geriatric point of view that may be gratifying to the Minister but, nevertheless, it is a fact that we are short-living compared with the rest of Northern Europe.  Our infant mortality rate is the second highest. This is a worrying point in view of the fact that we have a natural wish to increase our population.  Our ratio of doctors per head of the population is good, while our ratio of dentists per head of the population is very bad. The infant mortality graph which is on page 20 of the White Paper and which looks so impressive is really a bit disturbing because from 1960 on it does not show the continuing decrease one would hope.</P>
    <P>We know we have very good maternity hospitals in this country.  A lot of our midwifery is done in the hospitals but, nevertheless, the Netherlands, who do most of their maternity work on a domiciliary basis, has only approximately half of our infant mortality rate.  Sometimes this is blamed on the itinerant problem but I do not think this would account for it.  This is a sphere in which we should have a large improvement in both medical and lay approach, especially in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> From the point of view of infectious diseases the Department have done very well.  Their polio scheme over the past couple of years has been an excellent one and I hope it bears the fruit which we all expect from it.  With the rapid introduction of new screening tests especially for phenyketonuria, muscoviscidosis and carcinoma of the cervix, the situation will be very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>From the medical point of view, the division of this country into three groups of people on income is quite a reasonable one.  The lower income group have all their services free of direct charge, the middle income group have hospitalisation either free of charge or at a nominal rate and will in future have help with regard to drugs.  This is an excellent arrangement. Then we have the higher income group who must look after themselves. The present level in the middle income group is perhaps a bit on the high side but no doubt time will take care of that.  The Minister must watch in the future that provision is made for all groups and that people in the middle income group will still be able to get private or semi-private accommodation if they so desire or if they wish to pay for it.  In other words, I do not think that the Minister would ever intend, or should ever intend, to minimise the private facilities of the country.</P>
    <P>One of the best points in the White Paper is the intention of the Minister to very clearly outline the limits of those groups and to give them wide publication.  In the past we have had too wide diversification where rich counties, such as Carlow, had 47 per cent of their population on their general medical register, while poor counties, such as Leitrim and Donegal, had only approximately half that number.  This was very obviously unfair and depended on local private interpretation.  There appears to be no collaboration by the various counties in this matter.  There was a lot of chaos and a lot of upset in this matter. The idea that the Minister would appoint a man in each county who would have his own private office and his own private telephone and that his <Col N="349" /> job would be to explain to people just what were the benefits which they could expect is an excellent one, too, and I only hope that, when this starts, the Minister will give this official instructions that he is to be a kind of ombudsman whose bias would be towards the people rather than towards the Department.</P>
    <P>The real trouble about all this appears to be the means test.  This only seems to arouse a lot of discussion and a lot of discord.  I can never really understand this because through all our lives whether we are looking for a loan from the bank to buy a house or getting a car on hire purchase there is always the means test, no matter what class one belongs to. Therefore, the very real grievance which the poor people have about the means test must have something to do with the questionnaire which the assistance officer has to fill up.  Perhaps it is the way he goes about the questions or perhaps it is the general approach.  It may well be that a few words of explanation to those people beforehand as to why the questions are being asked or perhaps a course in public relations for those officials might go a long way towards solving this difficulty.</P>
    <P>The provision of drugs, which is promised in the White Paper, is a very good innovation.  It refers to persons in the middle income group as and when their outlay on drugs becomes too expensive for their income.  This is a very wonderful advance because more and more the cost of modern medication is getting out of control.  However, I would like to take issue with the wording in paragraph 55.  It seems to me that if we have to wait for a person to exceed a certain sum in drug expenditure, then we are allowing hardship to develop before we are doing anything about it.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the using of a fixed sum does not seem equitable because you may have a father of a large family with a moderate income and he may be hit more hardily by this fixed sum than would a bechelor earning around £1,200 a year.  Therefore, aid should be given when drugs expenditure exceeds <Col N="350" /> a certain percentage of the weekly or monthly income of the family and this help should always be given promptly and should, in many cases, be retrospective to the date of application. There is a great danger in delays occurring as the person concerned might incur further expenditure while awaiting a reply from the Department.  I hope the Minister will include a hardship clause in this section because it occurs to me that there are many people whose incomes are over £1,200 a year who in certain cases need help in this respect and might, in fact, be more in need of it than people in the middle income group.</P>
    <P>This provision will mean a national formulary and almost certainly bulk purchasing.  I hope that when the national formulary is being prepared as well as academic people in the pharmacological line there will also be general practitioners and working hospital doctors on this board, because very often what is ideal in theory is not half so much in practice.  When the purchasing board is formed I hope there will be members of the medical profession on it, because the primary consideration of this board should be quality, with price as the secondary consideration.  We have had worrying instances of this in the past, and any drug which is going to be purchased should carry with it a certificate of activity and this certificate should come either from a State-sponsored laboratory or, alternatively, from an outside and independent concern.</P>
    <P>We now come to the first of the worrying points about the new legislation. This is to do with the district medical officers.  These are going to present, I am afraid, a rather major problem.  At the present moment they are a very worried and apprehensive group of men.  They just do not know where they stand, and they have the worry that their lives will be turned topsy-turvy.  When one looks at their problem one cannot really blame them, because quite a few of them have accepted a rather quiet dull life in the country in return for expected retirement on pension and the security it gives.  Many of them have spent years doing a lot of training to get their <Col N="351" /> degrees and diplomas and the experience which was necessary to get them their appointments as dispensary doctors.  Quite a few of them have built their houses.  Some of them have houses at a low rent from the Department. Others are only in their present post as a stepping stone.  They hope to get better areas in the future.  These are a very worried group of men because they see themselves frozen into their areas forever and wondering what they will do about the education of their children in the future.  DMOs in the country are wondering whether the DMOs in the city will do much better out of this than they are. Many of them feel that they will not be able to adjust to this change-over. They will, therefore, look for some kind of settlement and to get out of the scheme.</P>
    <P>They are worrying about this compensation. They are worried about whether it will be a just and equitable one, who will arrange it, whether it will be paid in cash or on some kind of never never system that pertained in England when the practices were taken over.  Because of these worries this is a very distressed group at the moment, and even though they have accepted the Minister's assurance &mdash;and I do not think they would accept anybody else's&mdash;that they will not have any financial loss in this change-over still they are not too happy.  They have seen the consultants who have had over the past few years to take on a lot of extra work with what is called compensation, and they have seen recently another 200,000 people being put on to the consultants without any increase in remuneration, and they worry very much about this point.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have always felt that in Ireland there are only two big factors that can really cause a stir up in politics.  I have said many times that only milk and medicine can stir up things in Ireland.  The milk is rather curdled at the present moment, and the medicine, I hope, will not be too unpalatable. There is a kind of spirit of 1916 abroad at the present moment, and DMOs are very acutely sensitive to the vulnerability of their position, <Col N="352" /> worried about pressure coming on them from the Department, and liable to react very violently if they have anything put upon them which they feel to be unjust.</P>
    <P>We now come to the nub of this whole problem, and that is the mode of remuneration and the amount of remuneration which the doctors will receive from it.  This arises out of this admirable sentiment in paragraph 42, which says: &ldquo;this proposal involves the substitution for the dispensary service of a service with the greatest practicable choice of doctor and the least practicable distinction between private patients and those availing themselves of the service.&rdquo;  This all comes from the Minister's decision, which I believe to be the right one, that he is anxious to give a choice of doctor to the people of this country.  At the beginning this seemed very good, because we were told that details of the service would be discussed with representatives of the medical profession before any final decisions were taken.</P>
    <P>We were a little bit put off then to discover that certain succeeding sentences in the White Paper suggested that a very definite trend was in the mind of the Department, and that their intentions were already focussed on one particular type of scheme.  We were told that any eligible person would have the right to be attended by any doctor participating in the scheme who was living within a reasonable distance, who was willing to take him on as a patient, and who had not already a full list of patients. This was still pretty reasonable, but then we were told that a capitation scheme seemed the most practicable. &ldquo;Practicable&rdquo; is a worrying word because it is very hard to interpret.  You are not sure whether it means the best or the cheapest or the easiest to administer, and the point about the doctor participating in the scheme resolves this same sentence later into the fact that not all the doctors would be participating in the scheme, that if a capitation scheme went through as envisaged only a certain number of doctors would be able to participate because of the need to get and keep <Col N="353" /> worthwhile panels of patients.  This changed choice of doctor immediately into choice of Department's doctor.  It looked as if a patient who was eligible might never be able to get the doctor of his or her choice.</P>
    <P>All this was worrying.  It led to uncertainty as to where we were going because apparently we were following the path first trodden by Lloyd George in England in 1911 and perpetuated by Aneurin Bevan in 1948 against the wishes of the Labour Party, who wanted a salaried service scheme but were prepared, in their haste to get overall national legislation, to accept a capitation service.</P>
    <P>I shall now deal with the three types of service available to us.  The salaried service is an excellent system and has worked very well but it has the disadvantage that choice of patient is not practicable in it.  The other two services are fee-per-service and capitation.  Fee-per-service gives a choice of any doctor. It is basically simple.  The doctor is paid for the work he does.  He gets so much for a house call, so much for a surgery consultation and the fee varies between night and day work.  It is as straightforward as that.  The point behind it is that the work done is paid for.</P>
    <P>Capitation, on the other hand, means the State gives a certain amount per person.  They give their cards to the doctor who draws the money for all the cards he handles.  He gets paid for this group of people whether sick or not and whether he looks after them or not and whether they are in hospital or under his care.  Most important, no matter how much service he gives them he gets only the same amount so that the tendency is towards a minimal service.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to state at this point that of different countries in northern Europe&mdash;France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Holland and England &mdash; only England has the capitation system.  Holland and Denmark have it to a slight degree.  The remainder favour a fee-per-service and since 1948 all these countries have been going away from capitation mainly towards fee-per-service, though one <Col N="354" /> tiny section has favoured salaries. From the general trend point of view, if we were to move to capitation we would be moving against the trend in northern Europe and it seems unlikely that they could be so much wrong and we so much right that this would be the right answer for us.</P>
    <P>In any new scheme of health services that is being brought forward, the Department of Health are obviously expected to provide certain things. First, they should provide a choice of doctor.  Secondly, there should be adequate coverage of the people concerned and the medical services provided should be efficient.  Thirdly, the service should be reasonable, predictable and reasonably easy to administer. This is what the Department could expect. The profession, on the other hand, could expect certain things as well. They could expect that patients should have a choice of doctor and that it should be the doctor of their choice. We should be able to expect that the profession would receive adequate remuneration and that remuneration would bear a relationship to the work done and to other factors of that nature.  We could expect that there would be no interference with the doctor&mdash;patient relationship, and nowadays we can expect that a norm will be set down for what is the ordinary working week of the doctor&mdash;that once and for all we can decide how many hours in the week a doctor is expected to work and that beyond that he need only work if he wishes and if there is no medical coverage available for accident or emergency.  Finally, I think the profession are entitled in doing State work to have reasonable consideration given for holiday leave, sick leave and study leave.</P>
    <P>They are the two sides of the coin. The point on which there is the most likely disagreement will be on the mode of remuneration and on the amount ultimately.  The mode of remuneration, I am afraid, will be the important issue.  Capitation is obviously a very easy solution for the Department.  It is easy to administer and it is predictable. It makes certain that the Department know from year to year just how things are going and they can <Col N="355" /> always work out in advance just what their liabilities will be next year.  That is an important point in favour of capitation.</P>
    <P>Fee-per-service, however, causes worries in Departmental ears because the Department feel there will be no predictability of expenses and that there is great danger of doctors over-visiting their patients and thereby running up expenses.  I do not think this is a valid argument because it can be very easily controlled.  These things tend to scare the Department away from any notion of fee-per-service.  The medical profession, however, by a very great majority in this country, are anxious for fee-per-service.  Many of their members have worked under capitation in England and they know its troubles.  They know it certainly does not lead to good work, there is no incentive to work and there is a great tendency for abuse of the doctors.</P>
    <P>A survey was taken a couple of years ago in England and on a straight questionnaire it was shown that nine per cent of the population went to doctors for no good medical reasons, five per cent went to get value for their money and four per cent did not know why they went.  One in ten went because the system was there.  Furthermore, we know that under the scheme envisaged for this country only approximately 45 per cent of the people will be under the capitation service. Now, one of the objects of this White Paper is to get rid of the second class citizen&mdash;the one who gets poorer service&mdash;yet we are about to create a new group of cardholders who will perpetuate this inferiority complex and the snob value system which have caused so much friction in the health services in the past.</P>
    <P>It was not so bad in England where everybody, 100 per cent of the population were put on the capitation system.  Here, however, we propose to put only 45 per cent under the system and we shall thereby immediately create this second group again. Furthermore, this 45 per cent will be the poor people, the large families with poor incomes, the elderly whom <Col N="356" /> nobody is anxious to take on because of their tendency to illness.  The next point that dawns is that the system will have to be selective of the doctors who will be eligible to go on the scheme. I can foresee this leading to all kinds of trouble.  In some areas the most popular doctors may not want to go on it because they are going into the low class, high risk group.  No doctor may want to go on it and all doctors may want to go on it.  Who will decide? Who will decide who is to take a group of doctors in a town or a city and say: &ldquo;You and you go on it?&rdquo;  This will lead to the most serious friction.  I have no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>If the number of doctors to whom patients may go is restricted, a monopoly will be created.  The panels will be full, the patients cannot move, there are minimal chances of their moving from one doctor to another.  Group practices will be encouraged and the funny thing about them is that they will be the one thing that will tend to limit choice of doctor because in a group practice you will get the doctor who is on duty, not the one you want. What will happen now is they will be frozen.  It will be harder than ever to place doctors in the rural areas.  Look at the situation in the Rhonnda Valley in Wales which is an unpopular area where there are 100,000 patients.  There are 38 doctors, nine of whom are between 60 and 70 years of age, one of 77 years and another of 92 years.  So, you have 25 doctors catering for 100,000 people and one doctor for 4,000 people. This is an appalling figure.  This is because of the reluctance of people to settle down just anywhere.</P>
    <P>Under capitation you will have all the friction that arises in England, like that over capitation culminating last year in the Birmingham upset where the Minister was forced to plug the gap with Commonwealth doctors to each of whom he had to guarantee a salary of £4,000 per year.  He had to plug the gap where other doctors would not work.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the capitation scheme favours and encourages hospitalisation. The Nuffield report shows that 27,500 patients were unnecessarily admitted to the major hospitals in England in <Col N="357" /> the year in question.  This is understandable because doctors do not lose anything if the patient goes to hospital. In fact, the doctor gains.  He cuts down on his work regarding a patient he goes to see every day.  If he has a dubious or troublesome patient he is no worse off.  He gets rid of responsibility; he gets paid and he is very happy to enforce hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>Now, what about the fee-per-service system today.  There are disadvantages. First of all, more paper work will be involved and secondly, they may be asked in the future why they visited patients so often.  I think that is not unfair.  In the past they may have been asked why they did not visit patients; they may have had to explain perhaps why they did not visit patients, and so on.  These objections would be well out-weighed by the points in their favour.  There is an incentive to work; there is a minimal tendency to hospitalise; all doctors may participate and young doctors can set up&mdash;these are usually the enthusiastic doers&mdash; whereas under the capitation scheme doctors cannot set up because the area is full.  Patients may go to whatever doctor they want.  Work will be related to remuneration and there will be much less tendency towards the creation of a second-class citizen because the patient can go where he wants, sign a slip for the doctor on which he may collect his fees.  There will be much less tendency towards hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>The biggest worry from the Department's point of view is that doctors may over-visit and overwork and there would have to be very strict control. This is fair enough but it is not impossible. This is a small country of 2,800,000 people.  The Manchester area alone is bigger than this and a baby computer could easily cope with all the administrative work.  Furthermore, this computer could pick up and give weekly returns which would very rapidly show up any doctor who was doing over and above the national average.  It would stick out like a sore thumb.  It would be quite easy for the Department to check with the regional body and they would very quickly tap the doctor on the shoulder and bring him to heel.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> This is one of the advantages of having a local medical body.  They would be able to do that much better than members of a civil service body. Even if there were unnecessary visitings it would take 20 to 25, or even 50 extra visits of a doctor per week to make up for one week in hospital of a patient.  I do not believe no matter how much over-visiting there is the bill will equal hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>The problem of the mode of remuneration to the general practitioners was reviewed by the Minister in his reply to the Dáil on 31st March, 1966, in volume 222, columns 459 to 464 of the Official Report.  This reply was a source of great worry to us because we knew the Minister had been energetically going up and down the country, asking questions trying to get information and generally trying to get a bird's eye view of the subject.  Yet, some aspects of his reply showed evidence of rather poor briefing.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with some of the Minister's points in detail.  In one of his first points the Minister said:</P>
    <P>In a fee-for-service system for which the public authority pays the full charge to the doctor it will be necessary to have very stringent control to prevent abuse.  This might involve interference with professional freedom and is one of the reasons I am not inclined to regard this as the best system of payment in our circumstances.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable approach but I do not think the Minister need be too worried about the need for professional freedom because if doctors were working under this rule I am quite sure they would be reasonable.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, during the Dáil debate practically all the Deputies who spoke praised the Irish country doctor and the dispensary doctor and mentioned especially their lack of monetary interest. I think it would be a pity if the Minister did not take this report from his men in the field and balance it against the rather suspicious forebodings of the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister then went on to say that there had been a very detailed review of the whole system of paying <Col N="359" /> general practitioners in England.  In the supplement to the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of 13th January, 1965, there was published the collected report of the Chairmen of the various regional conferences.  This document reported as the Minister quoted:</P>
    <P>If the capitation fee were sufficient, much of the present discontent of the method of payment would disappear</P>
    <P>and again:</P>
    <P>a careful study of reports of the regional meetings indicate that the capitation system is still preferred by the majority of family doctors.</P>
    <P>Again, speaking of the fee-for-service system the report did say:</P>
    <P>There was some but not much support for such a scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister then went on to say, and I quote:</P>
    <P>When a reasonable body like the British Medical Association sets up working parties and goes to different regions in Great Britain and then comes up with this report&mdash;well, I do not know.</P>
    <P>The trouble about this report was that it was not all it appeared to be and the facts leading up to this are documented in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of 1964, the year before the report mentioned by the Minister was published. It became evident that the gentlemen concerned with this report were not in touch with general practitioner opinion and, in fact, they were senior people who had the soft end of the work in their own practices and who were, so to speak, prepared to settle for a little more money and a little more help.  That state of affairs is very much like that which would exist if one were to call a meeting of our own senior dispensary doctors at the present moment.  They would be happy with a little more money and a little more help.</P>
    <P>But, as I have mentioned, this fact had been recognised the previous year at the annual conference of representatives of local medical committees <Col N="360" /> held in 1964 when a resolution was passed, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Having regard to the serious deficiencies in the machinery for ascertaining, mobilising and representing general practitioner opinion, as revealed by the present crisis, this conference instructs the General Medical Service Committee to institute an immediate review of its own constitution....</P>
    <P>This overhaul is still proceeding and so it is the report from which the Minister quotes is suspect and this fact is borne out by reading the recurring reports of the &ldquo;Assistants and Young Practitioners Committee&rdquo; throughout the past year in which recurring emphasis is laid on a change from capitation to fee-per-service system. Furthermore, at the actual meeting to which this report was made the President of the Medical Practitioners' Union, which was a body strong enough to have two representatives on this committee, stated that in his opinion the committee was gravely out of touch with the periphery if it feels that remuneration is the only problem confronting general practitioners today. The editorials in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> were, in the meanwhile, giving an inkling of the true state of affairs. On the 26th December, 1964, it stated:</P>
    <P>Discontent is bound to grow until someone agrees to simplify what has become so complex; that is the method of relating work done to the rewards that should come from it.</P>
    <P>Then in the issue of 27th February 1965, it is stated that no one must be left in any doubt:</P>
    <P>Of the profound dissatisfaction of general practitioners with their conditions of work and the pay they receive for it.  We think this is the correct order in which to place these two elements of the present outburst. Indeed, it could be said that so dissatisfied are the general practitioners with the way in which they have to do their work, their principal compensation for this is to seek for more money.</P>
    <P>So, the pressure in each of these articles was on the capitation system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> At that time this particular negotiation broke down and the General Medical Service Committee did a complete <i>volte face</i> and unanimously recommended that the British Medical Guild be asked to advise all general practitioners to place their resignations in the hands of the British Medical Guild.  They requested that immediate negotiations be opened with the Minister of Health with a view to devising an entirely new contract for general practitioners involving a fundamental change in the method of remuneration. Six weeks later the British Medical Association produced a Charter and this is very much recommended reading because it states:</P>
    <P>A doctor's pay must be related directly and realistically to his work load and responsibility.</P>
    <P>and it goes on to state:</P>
    <P>The method of payment must be flexible.</P>
    <P>Groups of family doctors should be given a choice of payment by capitation fee, fee-per-service or some form of salary.  So that a few weeks earlier, having had one opinion and publishing it in this report, the British Medical Association now makes those statements.</P>
    <P>They then went on to demand a capitation fee of 62/8 per head, based on the lowest possible payment made by Government Departments for certain services given to the public.  They were prepared to modify this sum of 62/8 and reduce it to 36/- if the Government were prepared to alter the conditions of service and negotiations were then started. These negotiations are not yet complete. They have not yet been accepted by the members of the British Medical Association but what has been given away to date has been quite amazing. First of all, while the Government would not agree to a fee-per-service for the main work, they agreed to a fee-per-service for maternity, innoculations, vaccinations, servical smears and for night work originating and being carried out between 12 midnight and 7 a.m.  They also agreed that pilot schemes would be discussed, would be <Col N="362" /> set up in different parts of the country and that these pilot schemes would be tried out using the fee-per-service system.  They also agreed to the use of salaries as a method of payment and have passed a Bill through Parliament permitting this.  So, in these negotiations the first major crack in the capitation structure took place.</P>
    <P>In the payment line they have made immense concessions.  They agreed, first of all, to a 5½ day week for doctors, finishing at 7 p.m. in the evening on weekdays and 1 p.m. on Saturday. They agreed that doctors would not have to work outside this if they did not want to and provided there was medical service available.  If doctors wanted to work outside it they would be paid a special standby fee and a supplementary capitation fee.  They also agreed that from 12 midnight to 7 a.m. there would be a fee-per-service system.  They went further.  They agreed to basic sums for doctors and these sums would be varied according to the location in which the doctor worked and, more important, would vary according to seniority, experience and qualifications, so that the merit system has been introduced for general practitioners.</P>
    <P>They agreed further that elderly patients would carry a special capitation rate, thereby admitting the persons of a high risk group.  They also agreed payments for nurses, secretaries, rent, rates, repairs, etc.  Having got all these conditions, they were then sent to be priced by the review board. This was accepted by the Government and so worried were they about the scheme in England, they accepted it without resorting to the Prices and Incomes Board, even though it far exceeded the three per cent which they had been prepared to give before that. It is now in the hands of the general practitioners as to whether or not they will accept it.  They probably will accept it but it will only last a couple of years before there is a further breakdown because even with the increased remuneration I am still sure that emigration will take 350 doctors a year. England will certainly not get back the 2,000 doctors she is below par and the overwork will not decrease.  Therefore, <Col N="363" /> remuneration will not tend to make up for it.  This increase in remuneration, however, may have quite serious repercussions in this country, as a large number of doctors who might have come home will probably go to stay in England now.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that it was only &ldquo;hot-heads&rdquo; and &ldquo;wildcatters&rdquo; in the Irish Medical Association and the Irish Medical Union who were pressing for the fee-per-service system. This is not, I think, quite accurate.  We have our &ldquo;hot-heads&rdquo; and &ldquo;wild-catters&rdquo;&mdash;any profession has&mdash;and there is no doubt that the Minister has received a certain amount of information which might lead him to believe that this is so but I think there is a genuine desire on the part of the majority of the doctors in Ireland for a fee-per-service system.  A survey was made by an organisation in this country and they have recently released their figures for the different methods of payment which are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>For direct payment&mdash;47 per cent; for fee-per-service&mdash;39 per cent; for salary&mdash;9 per cent; for capitation&mdash; 2 per cent; and no view expressed &mdash;3 per cent.</P>
    <P>I was quite worried about this problem myself so, during the Easter holidays, I sent out over 100 letters to different doctors throughout the country to ascertain their opinions.  The figures I got back were:</P>
    <P>82 per cent in favour of fee-per-service, and 18 per cent in favour of salary or capitation.</P>
    <P>There was also an argument that, perhaps, capitation did not favour hospitalisation as much as it appeared to and that in the opinion of the medical profession this was a pointer against capitation not being a valid system. The Minister quoted figures from New Zealand in the year 1961-62 which showed a hospitalisation figure of 10.8 per cent of the population, whereas in Ireland in the same year we had 9.4 per cent of the population.</P>
    <P>Now, this was not really a very good comparison because what we <Col N="364" /> should really be doing is comparing fee-per-service countries with capitation countries, or, conversely, we should be trying to estimate what number of patients in Ireland would be hospitalised if we went on to capitation as against fee-per-service, so that there is no real comparison of the effect that might take place if we went on to capitation.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, there are five reasons why patients would go into hospital. First of all, there is valid hospital admission for illness.  Secondly, there is admission for a supersophisticated piece of diagnosis.  Thirdly, there is admission for routine diagnosis which should not occur if there are facilities outside the hospitals.  Fourthly, there is admission because social conditions at home make this necessary. This is really a different problem.  It is a problem of the social services. Fifthly, there is admission because the doctor is lazy or careless or does not want to be bothered by the patient. It is the last kind that we want to prevent, and it is the last kind that will flourish under the capitation system.</P>
    <P>While that is going through my mind there is another point.  We want to reduce the long stays and slow processing in hospitals.  Those are points that could also be helped even within our existing medical set up.  The main issue is that increased hospitalisation due to careless or inadequate doctoring is the type we want to cut down, and that is that type that will increase under the capitation system.</P>
    <P>One of the problems that always arises when medicine is under some kind of review or change is that doctors always appear to be looking for more money and to be rather mean and grasping.  I do not think that is really a very fair statement, because if one examines doctors' incomes over the past half century, one finds that we have certainly gone down the scale more than any other profession.  At present in the voluntary hospitals group, which do most of the important specialist work in the country, the specialist pool is only four per cent of the cost.  The district medical <Col N="365" /> officers, the dispensary doctors, cost the country only £1 million a year which, out of a total of £31 million spent on health, is really a very small amount. They are the backbone of the whole medical system of the country.  I hope, indeed, that arbitration machinery for professional people will come to fruition, and that in future doctors' salaries will be negotiated by some independent tribunal.  I feel we would do better out of it and get a fairer approach.</P>
    <P>Over the years we have always been rather sympathetic towards the Department in that they did not have much money, and their officials were not too well paid, but there has been such a change in the past few years with everyone's salary going up so much, that the profession is rather resentful at the moment at the way its salaries are lagging behind everyone else's.</P>
    <P>I can give some examples which are really quite serious and tragic.  One came to my notice recently.  There is a doctor in a moderate sized town who looks after the county home. There are 147 beds in the county home, 80 of which are acute medical beds, in other words, beds which have to deal with medical cases, pneumonia, coronary thrombosis, pleurisy and so on.  The man in question is a well qualified man.  He has various degrees and diplomas.  He is interested in geriatrics and does courses in geriatrics. It is his duty to spend 15 hours a week in this hospital.  He must visit it every day which he does.  He is on call for emergencies at any time.  Now, 15 hours a week should represent about two-fifths of anyone's working week, and certainly by any scale of comparison with a reasonably employed professional man, that position should be worth about £1,000 a year.</P>
    <P>In England a comparable general practitioner doing this kind of work would not, first of all, be allowed to look after 147 beds.  Secondly, his minimal salary for this work would be over £1,000 a year.  In this particular post the man is paid £240 a year which, at £20 a month for 15 hours a week, works out at 6/8d an hour, not including emergency work.  Recently he <Col N="366" /> was offered an increase of £80 a year which would still only bring him up to another 2/2d. an hour, which is really appalling.  Now, I feel that this approach to medical personnel, and to the staffing of institutions, has had a good deal to do with some of our problems.  I have a notion that if the medical personnel were used more freely, and perhaps paid a bit better, a great deal of our problems could be solved without great expenditure in bricks and mortar and equipment.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 72 of the White Paper there is a table which shows that the greatest increase in hospital patients occurred in the larger hospital groups, in the voluntary teaching hospitals and in the regional hospitals.  Linking these two groups together is rather unusual because normally the voluntary hospitals and the regional hospitals are, so to speak, poles apart.  Thanks to the courtesy of the Minister I was able to obtain the figures for the regional hospitals so far as beds are concerned, during the period 1957 to 1964.  Using these against the Hospitals Commission figures for voluntary hospitals, some interesting facts emerge.</P>
    <P>In 1957, if we were to take the turnover of the regional hospitals as a base line, then we should have expected the voluntary hospitals that year, having due regard to the bed ratios, to have dealt with 60,000 patients.  In actual fact, they coped with over 78,000 patients.  In 1964, and by then bed compliment of the regional hospitals had increased by 25 per cent, while in the voluntary hospitals it had increased by only ten per cent, using the regional hospitals once again as a base line for admissions, the voluntary hospitals should have put through their hands 70,000 patients, but in fact they had 101,000 patients.  Now, this demonstrates the point I made before that the voluntary hospitals do a disproportionate amount of the specialist work in this country, and this can be attributed, in fact, to the very much higher staff ratio per patient there is in the voluntary hospitals as compared with the regional hospitals.</P>
    <P>Compared with the Regional Hospitals the voluntary hospitals would <Col N="367" /> appear to be grossly overstaffed but, in fact, this is not so in the sense that we get through a lot more patients and, therefore, show a much more economic return.  One wonders is this return really economic?  It is very hard to compare doctors' work but there is one side one can compare very well, and that is surgery.  Surgery is like any other job, like making a table or mending a pipe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was developing the point that if there were more and perhaps better paid staffs in the hospitals of the country we might be able to get through the work without expensive additions in the way of bricks and mortar.  I was about to give an instance whereby we can make comparisons in one particular branch of the profession, that is the surgeons, whose operations may be considered units of work.  In Dublin we have a regional hospital which has 117 surgical beds and in 1965 had 1,300 operations, which gives an average of one patient per 4.7 weeks or 33 or 34 days which cost overall £75 per case, assuming the weekly costing to be about £18.10.0, which is lower than average in this hospital, which has a large number of long-stay geriatric cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a voluntary hospital with which I am associated there are 197 surgical beds and in 1965 they carried out 6,300 operations, which is one patient per 1.6 weeks, about 11 days at a cost of £32 a head reckoning on £20 a week. This comparison, which is a valid one, gives a fair idea of the more economic terms at which the voluntary hospitals are operating and makes the point that we feel their staffs should be encouraged and paid better.  It is also a point which favours an increased number of staff of senior rating in the regional hospitals in order that the beds may be made to turn over a <Col N="368" /> greater number of patients and improve the economic rating.</P>
    <P>This was illustrated to a further degree in the regional hospital of which I am speaking in that they have a pediatric ward which a few years ago was overflowing, and serious consideration was being given to the thought of building an extension or else taking on a unit elsewhere.  I understand that instead of this a part-time pediatrician and a pediatric registrar were taken on, and once this extra staff got going the turnover was vastly improved and there is now no need to talk about extension or a secondary unit.  To my mind this proves that slow turnover of patients may be a very big factor in the present expense of hospital provision and bed management in this country.</P>
    <P>I want to return again to the voluntary hospital consultant staff which I have mentioned in a previous debate.  I would ask the Minister once again to reconsider his decision and perhaps negotiate better terms for these men. I would recall to his mind that in 1958 they looked after approximately 35 per cent of the country on a completely free basis.  We then took on 85 per cent and were paid a compensation which was really a very small amount and certainly not adequate. The recent addition of 200,000 patients on to this quota has made it practically impossible&mdash;I would say impossible&mdash;to carry on on the remaining seven per cent of the country. This is more accentuated by the fact that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board which really subsidised and supported the consultant corps of this country and enabled it to do this work in the hospitals at minimal cost to the Department of Health has now been interfered with considerably. While the effects are not being immediately felt the first trend towards this is now being noticed.  This will mean that it will not be possible to support this consultant corps on the remaining 200,000 fully private patients left in the country.</P>
    <P>This raises a further and, indeed, a more important point, and that is, what of the future?  We have great worries about the promotion of progress <Col N="369" /> from qualification to consultant status.  We have considerable trepidation that our bright young graduates may not return to this country as consultants. I understand that the Minister may in future announce a very marked improvement in the payment of junior hospital staffs, one which will adequately compete with terms abroad.</P>
    <P>He also made the wonderful offer that he was prepared to give full pay during a training period abroad but this, nevertheless, will not carry a young man over the change from being a senior registrar to being a junior consultant.  In the present state of affairs a young man may leave a post in England at £2,400 or £2,500 a year and come back to become a junior consultant in this country at about £1,000 a year.  Whatever may be in this for a single man who is prepared to rough it for a few years, most of these young men are married with families and will not be able to make this transfer for economic reasons.</P>
    <P>The Department know that at the moment they are short of 275 dentists, partly due to wanderlust, partly due to looking for training but <i>a priori</i> due to lack of sufficient incentive to return to Ireland.  There is not the money in practice for dentists in Ireland.  The same state of affairs could rapidly develop&mdash;indeed, it is rapidly developing&mdash;where young consultants are concerned. I am, in this connection, anxious to correct a misapprehension which arose in the Dáil debate on the White Paper.  It is that eligible patients are free to choose their hospital at the present moment.  This is so, but only at the expense of a financial penalty.</P>
    <P>To come up without penalty to a hospital of their choice or of their doctor's choice, patients must be either emergency admissions or have obtained the prior permission of their county council.  Contrary to what may be said, this is not willingly given in some counties, probably because the bed occupancy situation in the county hospitals is not too good.  In his speech on the Longford County Hospital, reported in volume 222, column 182 of the Official Report, the Minister told the Dáil that the bed occupancy <Col N="370" /> of four of these county hospitals averaged 76 per day.  This was certainly encouragement to the Minister to close the Longford hospital but it is also an indication of how much these hospitals could be worked up in the future.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, the primary reason why patients are not allowed freely to travel to hospitals of their choice.  I can never really understand why eligible patients who go to voluntary hospitals requesting semi-private or private accommodation are penalised, receiving only half the amount for a shorter period than if they went into a private room in a county hospital.  The private patient in a private wing in a Dublin voluntary hospital has to use the same X-ray equipment, the same pathological equipment, very often the same recovery room as the public patients and yet there is this discrimination against private or semi-private rooms in voluntary hospitals.  We must pay a tribute to the voluntary health insurance organisation which, almost single-handed are keeping the consultant corps in this country and are really keeping the pot stirring.</P>
    <P>The main criticism of the voluntary health insurance body is that they are not taking people on whom they know to be sick and for illnesses from which they know patients suffered before coming to them.  It is also said they cannot carry on insurance for an indefinite length of time.  This is very hard on the patients so affected but I think it is a reasonable consideration.  I cannot see an insurance company taking you on willingly if you have had an accident three or four times or if your house has shown a predeliction to being burned down more often than in normal circumstances.  Therefore, I cannot see voluntary insurance taking on high risk patients just to be told they are particularly good organisations. It is amazing the number of people who think they can join voluntary health insurance after their illness has been diagnosed and it is remarkable how generous the voluntary health insurance people can be in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell the House about a particular case, about a woman who <Col N="371" /> had gallstones diagnosed.  She went away and returned four months later to the hospital to have them removed. They were removed and in the course of her convalescence she developed an abnormal heart rhythm which kept her in hospital 14 days longer than her convalescence from the gallstone operation would have warranted.  She volunteered the information that she had gone to the voluntary health insurance body with a view to having her operation for gallstones covered.  When we convinced her we could not do it, we put up a case to the voluntary health insurance people that her 14 days extra in the hospital were due to the heart condition which was not her fault.  The voluntary health insurance paid for those 14 days though, naturally, they did not pay for the gallstone operation.  They are really very good with patients who have chronic illnesses provided those patients have come under insurance before the illnesses began.</P>
    <P>The geriatric problem will be of major concern in this country in the future as it is in almost all countries nowadays.  Some of the sad stories we hear concern patients in this group.  We hear of couples being taken to county homes and then separated, literally never to meet again.  I have heard that, for expense and other reasons, non-dangerous patients have been removed from mental hospitals to county homes there to become a great source of irritation and upset to healthy patients. The fact that we have 24,000 elderly patients in institutions is a bit of an eye-opener and makes a big hole in our 60,000 beds.  I should like the Minister to give us some clarification as to the costings of these old patients.  In the Dáil, some Deputies placed the weekly cost per patient as between £14 and £18 but there are other estimates much lower.</P>
    <P>It seems bad business to pay elderly patients 47/6 each per week if they are well and able to stay out of institutions and yet, if they go into institutions, we may pay for them anything up to £18 per week.  It seems very obvious that one must reduce the number of beds occupied by these old <Col N="372" /> folk and turn the money to better account, for home nursing, home help, meals on wheels and all the other various aids that can be given.  It is equally possible that once we get a scheme going along these lines we will be able to service a lot of very elderly people particularly by way of light, heat, companionship and travel to and from geriatric units.  We could perhaps have geriatric flying squads, and all these things will enable us to keep elderly people from going into hospital unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>We should also be able to develop means by which persons are paid an adequate sum to keep elderly relations out of hospital.  Certainly at the present hospital figures we could afford to pay well, and still make a profit, to have elderly people kept at the homes of their relatives.  We have also foster parents with foster children and I am sure if there were reasonable financial compensation there are many excellent families who would think nothing of adopting a grandmother or grandfather.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to see that the Departments of Health, Social Welfare and Local Government will cooperate, particularly in this scheme for the provision of flats in small units for elderly people, and their idea of trying to use parochial units and a parochial organisation is an excellent one.  I would appeal to the Minister not to be too dependent on parochial help because it seems to vary from place to place and is also dependent on fashion. Therefore, it is only fair to expect that the Department of Health would set up a proper unit for elderly people and that it would be self-sufficient in the major items and that the personnel would be well paid and well equipped. I would not be in favour of much responsibility devolving on religious or charitable organisations, other than to provide little extras.  The main things, I feel, must be the responsibility of either the relations or the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>The other important group of personnel which have received scant mention in the White Paper are the nurses.  This particular group are also having trouble at the present moment and there is a strong possibility of a <Col N="373" /> breakdown in this service in the not too distant future, unless some changes are made.  This is a very small country and there seems to be no reason why every nurse here should not be treated on the same basis as nurses elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As things stand at present we have three separate units&mdash;public health and local authority nurses, the voluntary hospital nurses and nursing home nurses.  The local authority nurses have at the present time the best of the bargain.  They have a reasonably good salary, reasonably good working hours and a pension.  There are, however, certain snags in their line as it is.  First of all, their period of training is not taken into account as it would be in any other organisation, for example, the Post Office. Secondly, many of those nurses have to live in the institution where they work paying a sum for their board and keep each week.  Therefore, they never get a chance of establishing small homes for themselves.  When these girls come to retirement age, therefore, they are in a rather bad way. They have not made provision even for themselves.  Would it be possible that in the future they could get some kind of retirement gratuity which would help them purchase a small house and settle down?</P>
    <P>Another snag arising in the local authority service is that if a girl has worked in a voluntary hospital she has gained much experience and then if she joins the local authority nurses she has to start from the bottom of the scale and no provision is made for her previous experience, either towards her present salary or towards her future pension.  Actually, it is even worse than that.  I understand that there is a special Local Government Act of 1941 which specifically excludes nurses and midwives from being deemed professional or technical people.  This prevents years of service being added on for them if they worked in other hospitals.</P>
    <P>So far as the voluntary hospital nurses are concerned things are very much worse.  Some of the hospitals have schemes for pensions but in many cases these were not recognised by the <Col N="374" /> Department of Finance and are, therefore, being abandoned, so that these girls are in a very bad position.  There are about 1,000 of them in all and in 1945 the Seventh General Report of the Hospitals Commission made the following statement:</P>
    <P>The staffs of the Voluntary Hospitals should have the same degree of security enjoyed by those in Local Authority Hospitals since, if the Voluntary Hospitals were not in existence, the State or Local Authority would have to provide an equivalent service.</P>
    <P>But, 20 years have passed and these girls are still not eligible for a pension and one feels it is an inequality which will have to be ironed out without delay.</P>
    <P>Now that the State is registering nursing homes and making sure their standard is up to requirements, and that is a step for which I think the previous Minister and the present Minister deserve credit, I think the nurses in these homes should also be eligible to participate in any scheme going, and their futures should be assured.  The 1,000 voluntary hospital nurses is a small number and there should be a lot more but these girls worked appallingly long hours up to recently&mdash;perhaps 120 to 130 hours a fortnight&mdash;and some of them were on continuous night duty for years.  Because of this the Department has fewer nurses to deal with than would be the case in normal circumstances.  I understand negotiations are afoot and I hope that when they are proceeded with the idea of reducing the number of years these girls have served before taking them into the scheme will be abandoned.  I do not think this would gain anything and the amount of finance it would save would be very little.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is a pity also that five per cent is taken from the nurses' salary for superannuation while pension rates for civil servants, bank officials and teachers are on a noncontributory basis.</P>
    <P>I could not leave this without referring to the fact that the Minister is about to introduce nursing home help <Col N="375" /> for people in the middle income group as well as in the lower income group. This will mean an extension in our district nursing services.  As well as our district nurses we had, over the years, jubilee nurses who are an excellent body of women.  For some reason or other they have been allowed to decrease and there are only 129 of them now and, indeed, but for emergency action in the last year or so they would have disappeared entirely.  At the present time the local authorities bear 85 per cent of their salaries but there is no guarantee of the continuation of this subsidy, nor are they paid any pension.  These girls' pension is paid by the Queen's Institute of District Nursing and amounts to only £3 per week. This is very poor compensation for having spent perhaps, the best part of their lives going around doing good. One feels that these nurses should also be taken into some scheme and given parity with the local authority nurses.</P>
    <P>The next category I should like to mention is the dentists and I shall be very brief about this.  Recently they presented a memorandum in which they stated they would like a unified system throughout the country and the Minister was wondering why.  In actual fact, they feel the country is rather small for a division and they are rather anxious to be under central control.  They have had unhappy experiences under local authority control. They do not feel that regionalisation will be any help and, consequently, they want to be under a central board. They have also announced recently that they will be agreeable to school children and the lower income group people being treated by private dental practitioners. The reason for this is also simple.  They feel that there is in this country a statutory obligation to treat children's teeth and the teeth of the lower income group, that the service has been inadequate and, in the case of adults, has deteriorated into an extraction service only with very little regard for conservation and greater effort on replacement with dentures. They feel the children's service is perhaps being sacrificed a little to this <Col N="376" /> denture service and they are anxious that this should not be so.  Consequently, they are agreeable to treatment by private dental practitioners. They feel this would be an advantage because it would take quite a while for the Department to recruit the needed number of dentists and the capital expenditure in equipping these dentists would be quite considerable.</P>
    <P>It is possible, therefore, to bridge the gap until time provides us with more dentists, by using ordinary dentists, possibly on a sessional basis in the country but on a fee-per-service basis in the cities, as the sessional basis would scarcely be economic enough for the city dentists to take it on.  It is hard to know what one could do at the present moment to improve the dental services but, if there were any possibility of speeding up the time between the taking of casts and the supplying of dentures, even this would be a help because, very often, the patient's mouth has changed considerably in the interval.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make is on regionalisation.  I have no doubt that this is a very good thing and that while the county councils gave great service in the past, at the present time their boundaries are too narrow.  The introduction of good size regions would be an enormous advantage.  I sincerely hope that the regions created by the Minister will not be too small, as there is a great danger in this country that geographical and other competition tend to make each region want what the others have.  Some of the units we have nowadays are so costly and so hard to maintain that it would not be really feasible to provide these in all regions.  One hears the number eight mentioned for the number of regions and one feels this is far too many when one considers that each of the smallest of the English regions is bigger in population than the whole of this country.</P>
    <P>I was also worried by the suggestion in paragraph 128 of the White Paper:</P>
    <P>These regional health boards would take over the administration of the health services from the local authorities.  The regional, county <Col N="377" /> and district hospitals, the mental hospitals and other local authority health institutions would be transferred to them for future management but, of course, the voluntary hospitals would remain in their present ownership.  Local staffs engaged on the health services would be transferred to the new boards....</P>
    <P>I feel and hope that this can be simplified. There was also a point brought up in the Dáil debate, Vol. 221, No. 5, column 844, in which a Deputy suggested that while professional people will be included in the new regional board, they should not have any right to vote where any financial matter was concerned.  My information on this was that they would be concerning themselves purely with medical matters and I was hoping the Minister intended to appoint full professional representatives and not just advisers.</P>
    <P>Finally, while the idea of career administrators for these regional posts appears very desirable, I was wondering if the Minister would consider the possibility of using experienced medical men who could, perhaps, be sent away to train, to some degree, in administrative matters.  The World Health Report makes a very clear point that everywhere in Europe, except in the British Isles, doctors are used as administrators in State schemes but, for some reason or other, in these islands doctors have been under suspicion and have not been appointed to these posts.  I think they could be used to advantage in these posts without causing any upset. As long as we have these regional officers under the control of the regional boards, I do not see any possibility of local dictators emerging.</P>
    <P>Within the next few weeks the Minister will have to make a final decision concerning the proposals for legislations. Of these, I am sure, the most difficult one will be the mode of remuneration.  The dice is already loaded in favour of a capitation scheme.  There is no doubt it would be the easiest to administer as expense would be predictable and it would certainly avoid the possibilities of doctors cheating by over-visiting, etc., for personal gain.  But, in conscience, <Col N="378" /> I do not think the Minister could be advised that this will be the best scheme for the country.  Nor would it be the best method of giving a choice of doctor to the lower income group; or make the least practicable distinction between patients.  I should like to remind the Minister that in the past 20 years all legislation in the north European countries has been away from the capitation system: the Department of Health in these countries have been able to make the necessary adjustments and the doctors have not robbed the States.  In quite a few of these countries there are model medical systems, one of which has been held up before the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to bear in mind that 20 years of capitation in England has brought a lot of trouble and upset.  It has resulted in the loss of doctors from England by emigration and resignation, and has brought the English National Health Service to 2,000 below par.  It has caused financial troubles, and has given rise to a recent dispute, a dispute which has been settled by an award by the Government which greatly exceeded the figure envisaged by their policy on allowable income increases.  I do not think it would be possible to introduce the capitation system into Ireland without running the risk of similar troubles and similar upsets in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I know it is not easy for the Minister, being unable to predict exactly how much he needs, to approach the Minister for Finance and look for extra money at this time but the Government will have to face up to the fact that health is a very important issue nowadays, that the matter of health in this country is responsible for 14 million lost days a year, about seven per cent of our total work force and five times as much time as is lost in industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>There would certainly be many problems connected with a change and, even against all the political pressures, I hope the Minister will go slowly at it, and give a chance for the absorption of the dispensary doctors to take place easily, and allow perhaps any <Col N="379" /> errors to be corrected or adjustments to be made so that the whole changeover will be more harmonious than might be achieved by a sudden switch.</P>
    <P>There is certainly a very large number of excellent proposals in the White Paper but good recipes do not always make good dishes.  Patience and planning and first class ingredients are needed if this scheme is to be a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion proposed by Senator Alton welcoming the White Paper on the Health Services and their Further Development. The Minister and the Department must be congratulated upon their forward-looking approach to the whole question of the health services.  The Minister has shown in several fields that he has drive and dynamism in this matter.</P>
      <P>In particular, I should like to say on behalf of the teaching profession that we are interested in the question of the schools medical service.  In paragraph 91 of the White Paper, it is pointed out that this service &ldquo;is primarily aimed at discovering defects, leaving treatment to other services or to private arrangements.&rdquo;  Unfortunately, however, there is a very large gap in this service, in view of the fact that children whose illnesses or defects are not discovered at the school medical examinations have to get private treatment and their parents have to bear the cost.  Doctors sometimes fail to detect defects in children.  I know of one typical example of a child who suffered from a rheumatic heart due to rheumatism in his early years and that defect was not detected at the school examination.  The child had to be hospitalised at a later stage.  The parents communicated with the local health authority, which I will not mention, and this is the reply which they received:</P>
      <P>Dear Madam,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am directed to refer to your recent call in connection with the account which you received for treatment of your daughter Mary, and to inform you that the treatment <Col N="380" /> in question is not covered under Section 15 (7) of the Health Act, 1953, under which health authorities make available without charge, institutional and specialist services for pupils of national schools, in respect of defects discovered at school health examinations.</P>
    <P>When you called at the office here on 30th August, the Medical Officer who carried out the school medical inspection in the school where your daughter is a pupil, explained the position fully to you.  I have, accordingly to advise that the Authority will not be accepting liability for your daughter's treatment, and the account which you left is returned herewith.</P>
    <P>It really does not make sense to find that type of situation.  If the doctor does discover a defect in the child, the parent is not obliged to incur any financial responsibility, but on the other hand, if the doctor does not discover the defect, the parent has to bear what are often heavy hospital charges.  That is a gap in the schools medical service which I should like to mention to the Minister.  I know he will have a very close look at it because, as I said, it does not make sense&mdash;it is not logical&mdash; that the parent should have to pay a considerable amount of money in one case, whereas the other parent has not to pay anything.  It is the intention of the organisation which I represent to make representations to the Minister on that matter, and we should like to visit him and discuss it with him.  It is not a matter which affects teachers as teachers; it is a matter that affects parents.</P>
    <P>Another paragraph which I should like to mention is paragraph 77 which deals with the care of the mentally handicapped.  In it the Minister indicates that he will be issuing a further White Paper dealing with this very serious social problem of mental handicap.  This is the time for a generous and broad approach to the solution of this problem.  Since the foundation of the National Association for Mental Handicap in Ireland, over 60 local associations have become <Col N="381" /> affiliated.  There are town associations, county associations, regional associations, which are affiliated to the national association, and there has been considerable enlightenment on the problem throughout the country. People are not now inclined to hide these children away from the public. They are now encouraged to bring them out into public view.  They are no longer ashamed of the fact that their children suffer from mental handicap. They are seeking advice and help.</P>
    <P>In the past people were inclined to look with a certain amount of suspicion, so to speak, on children so handicapped, and to be critical of them.  In the old days in France, they were looked upon with a certain amount of charity and were called, &ldquo;les enfants du bon Dieu,&rdquo; children of the good God.  There was also a traditional sympathy in Ireland for a simple child.  He was known as &ldquo;duine le Dia,&rdquo; an expression which incorporates the same sentiment as the expression used in France.  In other countries they were objects of ridicule. Moralists in the Middle Ages considered them as being evil or possessed. Now there is a change in the approach towards mental handicap and this is most encouraging.  If the Minister and the Department approach this question in a broad and generous way, they will find the public most responsive, and the Minister will get the utmost encouragement, irrespective of the cost involved. It is a tragic thing for a family to have a mentally handicapped child.  For the parents it is a very great cross and they need our help and support.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in the Department of Education they have established the nucleus of a school psychological service.  This could be of great use also in the detection of mental handicap.  Within the schools medical service, the medical examiners have not expertise or experience in this field, and when children are examined at school, their physical defects are detected but very often their mental defects go quite unnoticed.  Therefore it might be useful if a liaison were established between the Department of Health and the Department of Education in this matter <Col N="382" /> of the school psychological service so that mental defects in children will be detected at an early age and remedial treatment initiated.</P>
    <P>I should also like to express appreciation of the Minister's efforts in the field of rehabilitation.  I have been nominated by the Minister for Health to the Council of the National Organisation for Rehabilitation and certainly that organisation has received the greatest encouragement from the Department and from the Minister for Health, particularly the present Minister, in the whole field of rehabilitation. In the past, society was inclined to put the handicapped aside.  There was a tendency to put the handicapped people on the scrapheap.  An effort is now being made to rehabilitate those people to cope with their handicap so that they can be meshed into society as useful citizens.  They can be a gain to the community instead of being a loss to it.  I want to second Senator Alton's Motion on the White Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us on this side of the House welcome the opportunity presented to us by this motion to consider the terms of the White Paper, the circulation of which we also welcome.  We welcome it as a belated acceptance of some of the criticism offered in relation to the conduct of current health legislation. However, we cannot accept the contents of the White Paper as being the complete cure for present ills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We concede that it is an advance. The presentation of the White Paper was necessary because such was the situation that diagnosis was necessary. The presentation of the White Paper, due to the fact that money is not available, is like having the anaesthetic without any clear indication of when the operation is to take place.  We had the sad experience of the unfortunate handling of the special health committee which gave such lengthy consideration to all the factors involved and all the problems encountered in the carrying out of the work under existing legislation.  We have at least reached a situation in which a certain new approach is shown by the Minister <Col N="383" /> in relation to the provision of proper health services for our people.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we are influenced today by the practical difficulties encountered by those who are members of committees and members of health authorities.  Those people fully understand the conduct of health affairs in the country.  They are all intensely interested in seeing that proper consideration will be given to the views expressed in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that so much has been accepted currently of what was regarded as apostacy by the Minister's predecessor, who is showing current literary talents with regard to various matters, it is regrettable that it has not been possible to go further with regard to health legislation.  However, there is a distinct advance being made but we regret that many of the proposals advanced from this side of the House have not been accepted so far as we can interpret the enthusiasm of the Minister particularly in relation to the financing of health matters.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the gross miscalculations in the original presentation of the Health Acts relative to the impact on the rates.  The matter of ratio has been a growing problem in local authorities throughout the country who are faced with increasing costs in all realms of their activities and one of the severest imposts they have had to bear is the cost of the health services and the fact that so many people could not obtain benefits in any way without the operation of the Acts.  I must congratulate the officers who did their best in the circumstances to administer the demands made upon them to the best of their ability but certain guidelines were set for them. It is to be welcomed that the Minister's attitude in regard to this is so different from the attitude of his predecessor. The Minister has directed those responsible for the administration of the health authorities to adopt a more humane attitude in relation to many accounts presented to them.  We hope that this will be implemented and that many of the serious complaints <Col N="384" /> brought before public representatives so frequently will at least abate due to the changed approach.</P>
    <P>The most important change in policy reflected by this attitude is the acceptance of the principle of a free choice of doctor.  Senator Alton's contribution today was most valuable inasmuch as he has clarified the difficulties that will have to be surmounted before this work can be effectively undertaken. There is no reason why a start cannot be made, particularly in the built-up areas so far as the implementation of the free choice of doctor is concerned.  A democratic right so dearly held is that which entitles people to an individual choice of a doctor.  The approach up to now was extremely antiquated and it is not before time that this new approach has been introduced, that of extending the choice of doctor to all categories.</P>
    <P>We all know of many instances where people who, having secured the right to a medical card, have made the choice, not indeed from the point of view of being in the position to waste money, but because they were actually prepared to go to a practitioner outside the doctor to whom they would be required to go, merely because they wanted to have this choice. This practice was growing in many instances and it was a clear indication that even the lower-paid sections of our community regarded this as something they felt they were entitled to in order to preserve their health and that of their families.  A patient who has no faith in the doctor attending him faces extreme difficulties in overcoming whatever health difficulties he has to surmount.  This change is desirable, particularly in view of our history in regard to the dispensary system.  This is a very desirable innovation, in view of the modern age in which we live, but let me emphasise that in effecting the change we do not reflect in any way upon the capacity or the dedication of the dispensary doctors throughout the country in the work they have performed on behalf of the people entrusted to their charge down through the years.  I would exhort the Minister to take full heed of the clearly defined <Col N="385" /> case Senator Alton made in regard to protecting the future of so many of those professional men who have given the best years of their lives in the service of the poor and underprivileged people in our society.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of this that are worthy of consideration, but we are, unfortunately, disappointed that the system of financing has not been radically changed.  We have always favoured a system of insurance under which the contributor would be aware of the amount he would have to pay and would not be in the position he is in today in which he still has to pay&mdash; there is nothing free on this earth&mdash; without knowing how much he is contributing, and without being aware of his entitlements.  We feel that the introduction of a wide scope of insurance cover to users relative to health, either at home or in hospital, would have been a better method than the method employed.  We can look with pride on the distinct success that has attended the implementation of the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme as an example, and one is entitled to suggest that if this scheme had been introduced prior to the Health Act, embracing many more people, it is surely to be expected that the effect would have been even better than that which has resulted from the implementation of the scheme for what, after all, is a limited range in our community.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of hospitalisation and administration of hospitals and health in general to which we would wish to refer, but there are just a few aspects of it that I would wish to deal with today.  Senator Alton dealt in the closing part of his address, and rightly so, with the fact that the nursing profession have not been afforded that prominence in the White Paper which their importance, one would think, would require.  The nurses who leave our shores make a strong distinct impression on people abroad by their character, efficiency and sympathy and even our children today, as we frequently hear when they are questioned on television, in a great many cases regard nursing as a suitable career. There is something in the character of <Col N="386" /> our Irish girls which particularly suits them for this profession.</P>
    <P>We have in this country a considerable force of highly trained and dedicated personnel in our nursing services, but the situation is that we cannot absorb all those who desire to be trained in this country and, having been trained, to secure employment here. Over a period of a few years, it has been brought to my attention that some of our nurses, having trained in our hospitals and having failed to find employment here at home, are forced to emigrate and take up employment abroad, and the circumstances in which some of them have found themselves have been extremely questionable.  This is not a severe criticism of the circumstances of employment in which most of them find themselves in other countries, but certainly it should be, and I feel, is, a matter of concern for the Minister and the Department of Health that there are agencies engaged at the moment in organising the export of these nurses in conditions that would not bear very close examination.</P>
    <P>Again I do not wish my remarks to extend to all those agencies.  I have been in close touch with this matter over a considerable period, and I am satisfied that there are some agencies that take particular care to inspect these hospitals before these girls take up employment in them.  I also know that there is again operating in this country&mdash;it did operate but fortunately for a while the country was spared the activities of this individual&mdash;a particular agency and it would shock the members of the Seanad if I were fully to describe the circumstances in which our nurses are obliged by this agency to do certain things which indeed are anything but a credit to the people involved. I may remark that there were nurses who were obliged to take duty-free whiskey on their persons to the country to which they were going. There were nurses who were trapped into signing agreements whereby, if they did not complete a term of some years in the particular hospital to which they were assigned, and which had not been inspected by the agency exporting them, they would have to refund to the agency that part of their <Col N="387" /> salary related to the period for which they had signed.</P>
    <P>The fact that some of our nurses are subject to this treatment is a very serious matter.  I must say that I got very little satisfaction when I brought this to the attention of the previous Minister, but I am glad that the present Minister is at the moment looking into it and I hope that action will be taken to protect these nurses.  I do know that when some of them who were strong enough to withstand the pressures placed upon them when they found they could not possibly continue to work in institutions to which they had been allocated, they got legal advice, and it is indeed of interest to know that the moment it was known to the agency concerned that those girls were alert enough to their situation to secure legal advice, it was enough to frighten the export organisation concerned.  I hope and trust that in this matter the Minister will see his way to use his influence to ensure that the operations of this particular individual at least are brought to an end in this country.  It is also indicative of the type of conduct to which some of these people are prepared to resort that they actually attempted to bring about a situation of complete monopoly in organising the employment of nurses in hospitals in other countries, but fortunately in the interests of the nurses concerned, they failed.</P>
    <P>This is one of the matters that would very well require the attention of the Minister, and I hope and trust that it will be possible for him, or whoever succeeds him in that office, to see that many of the provisions of this White Paper will be implemented within a reasonable period and that in remedying the defects so apparent at the moment a hearing will be afforded to all those concerned.  We know that as recently as 12 months ago the Party I represent were advocating many of the provisions in this White Paper and were subjected to all kinds of misrepresentation and exaggerated criticism.  It is certainly extraordinary that within such a short time they should now be accepted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="388" /> I hope that in the full implementation of it regard will be had for the difficulties that face people in the professional and pharmaceutical retail trade who will be closely involved in this.  This measure cannot achieve success without the full co-operation of all those groups.  In giving this co-operation, they will have to adjust their businesses, employ additional personnel, and undergo considerable hardship, particularly in the transitional period.  In relation to the chemists, particularly in the rural towns, it will mean that their storage accommodation, which is extremely taxed at the moment, will have to be greatly extended if they are to stock at least 600 different items which must be kept separate from existing stocks.</P>
    <P>When we have adaptation in industrial concerns and businesses, there is usually available some fund to assist the people involved in bringing about the desired changes.  I suggest that the position of the people who are to cooperate in this matter be examined in relation to the difficulties which many of them will encounter in providing proper storage for the various stocks they will have to keep if they are to comply properly with the new conditions which are to replace the dispensary system.  I know that negotiations are in progress and I should like to impress on the Minister the desirability of having not alone the doctors represented on the regional boards but of having the Pharmaceutical Society represented also on the various regional bodies so that there will be the closest possible understanding between the people involved in the day to day working of the scheme.</P>
    <P>These proposals have the goodwill of the Party I represent as some advance, as a recognition of the weaknesses that were apparent over a long period in our health legislation.  It now remains to be seen when the Government can implement many of the provisions in the White Paper.  I should welcome a precise statement from the Minister on the advances made since the White Paper was published and on whether he feels matters have reached the point at which he can say he will <Col N="389" /> shortly present to the Oireachtas the enabling legislation to give full effect to the proposals.</P>
    <P>I suggest it is only right that at this time we should acknowledge the magnificent work done by those who voluntarily take part in so many activities in relation to assisting those affected by disablement, due to exceptional circumstances.  There is no doubt that the growing number of aged people in our community is quite a challenge to all involved with their care.  Everybody knows that during the harsh winter we have gone through, many people living in wretched conditions, with poor firing and little good food, had to suffer severe rigours. Their survival is a tribute to the many societies who have assisted them.</P>
    <P>In the changes being effected in our society, a disturbing feature is that people have not the same regard for or responsibility towards the care of the aged.  Consequently, there is a growing demand on public authorities to accommodate aged people who should be looked after by their families.  It is true that in many instances it is impossible for families to give adequate attention or care to the aged and there is no answer other than an institution. These institutions should be the last resort and I therefore welcome the home nursing service as a desirable innovation which could give particular assistance to old people who can be accommodated within easy reach of their relatives, neighbours and friends to end their days in happy association with those whom they have known all their lives.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the subject of demands on local authorities for the accommodation of many of these people in institutions, this is a serious problem.  It is a matter on which the Minister and the Department come in for criticism.  We have institutions lying idle which are ready to receive patients in the category I have mentioned, but despite repeated representations by all Parties, both in the Dáil and at health authority meetings, no action has been taken.  There is such an institution in the town of Macroom where there has been a 20-bed hospital, completely equipped, lying idle for the <Col N="390" /> past ten years, with furniture, clothing and even kitchen utensils carefully stored there.  It is situated within 50 yards of the local hospital and it would present no problem in regard to staff or administration.</P>
    <P>Yet, for some unaccountable reason, the Department have denied to the health authority sanction to accommodate aged people in that institution, while at the same time, in the huge central hospital of St. Finbarr's in Cork, there are at least 20 patients from the Macroom region living in overcrowded conditions, occupying beds that make it impossible for others from areas close to the city to be admitted. I suggest the administrative barriers responsible for this call for the closest examination.  It is preposterous that we in the health authority are not permitted to assist those old people to end their days in happier surroundings, where their people could visit them often and regularly and provide them with the few luxuries they are now denied.  At the same time, we would be making available beds to accommodate people from nearer the city.</P>
    <P>We have a situation in St. Stephen's Hospital in Cork where, at the expense of the State and the ratepayers, there are many unoccupied beds.  People cannot gain ready admittance to this hospital; yet we have overcrowded conditions in Our Lady's Mental Hospital.  It has now been agreed, after consideration extending over some years, that this institute should be utilised to absorb the overflow from Our Lady's Hospital.  The difficulty has arisen that we are unable to obtain psychiatrists to staff the hospital. The problem relates to the salaries that may be paid to attract such doctors.  Is it not regrettable to see such a fine institution deteriorating because of the difficulty of securing four doctors?  I suggest to the Minister that these administrative difficulties could be dealt with without legislation, without the enactment of any of the proposals projected.  They are creating difficulties for those concerned with the particular patients whose lot could be eased by some positive action in relation to these institutions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> I welcome the provision of the home nursing service.  It can only have the effect of reducing the demands on the organised hospital authorities.  It will make it far easier for aged people who can have the nursing service in their homes or close to where they have always lived.  It is to be hoped that the White Paper has been fully examined by the Government and that the examination will result in the prompt introduction of legislation to correct the difficulties that have been apparent in the existing health services for a long period. We welcome the White Paper as it gives the Seanad an opportunity to examine the proposals and to suggest how they can best be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this White Paper as well as our medical services in general.  From the layman's point of view the greatest strides over the last few years have been made in our medical services.  It is, indeed, very nice to see advances and new techniques introduced in our mental hospitals.  The staff, the RMOs, and clerks of these institutions deserve our very best thanks for the great interest they are taking in their work, and, more important still, for the wonderful results of their work and their new techniques.  Also, the facelift these institutions got over the last couple of years is a terrific contribution and a consolation especially to the relatives of the unfortunate patients.  No longer do our mental hospitals, at least those in Portlaoise and Carlow, look like dungeons.  They have pleasant surroundings, nicely laid out lawns and have completely changed over the past three or four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as that, the new concept of leaving the gates open, and so on, has completely transformed the outlook and approach of the public to the problem of mental illness.  I should dearly like to see the same energy and effort put into the tackling of our problems in relation to mentally handicapped and retarded children.  This is a problem that has not received the attention and thought it should have <Col N="392" /> received.  People may have thought about it but little has been done in a practical way.  It is so distressing to find, in practically every county in Ireland, long lists of unfortunate children waiting to be admitted to the very few places catering for this section of our community.  The regrettable part is that catering for them is left, by and large, to a few voluntary religious. That seems a pity because it is now well known that a lot can be done for the vast majority of those children if facilities are provided in time.</P>
    <P>The main reforms in this White Paper are, indeed, welcome.  There is provision for choice of doctor, where it is practical, for persons in the lower income group, with the result that drugs, medicines and appliances will be supplied to persons at retail chemists instead of at dispensaries.</P>
    <P>This is one of the earliest reforms of the Health Act of 1953 advocated by the Fine Gael Party.  The fact that a decision to introduce such a change announced almost ten years ago by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, when he was Minister for Health, bears out the rather slow thinking of the present Government in their attitude to reform and improvements in our health services over the years.</P>
    <P>On the question of the supply of appliances, it is unfortunate, especially where children are concerned, that ten months must elapse between the time a child who needs an artificial limb is measured and the time the artificial limb is supplied.  It is a pity, therefore, that growing children who are handicapped in this way always have artificial limbs that are at least a year out of date.  Surely there cannot be so many cases where the local authorities have to supply artificial limbs or feet for growing children that the authorities cannot supply them within a reasonable period of a month to six weeks after having measured for them.  It is a hardship that should be completely eliminated.  It is absolutely unnecessary. The Department and the Minister should take an active interest in these little things which mean so much to the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>Another unfortunate aspect of the <Col N="393" /> White Paper is that the Government propose to retain the class distinction and the means test which are completely out of touch with present times. It is still a lengthy process for an ordinary worker to qualify for a medical card and even an old age pensioner, despite the Minister's assertion that they would get medical cards on application.  The public find it difficult to understand, when they read in our national papers that a person in receipt of a full non-contributory old age pension can get medical service registration merely by applying, but when he applies he is still subject to another local government means test, and so on.  That is something that should be absolutely unnecessary.  If the Minister says something, the public are justified in accepting that he means what he says and that his directions will be carried out the way he has announced them.</P>
    <P>I also see in paragraph 53:</P>
    <P>As a wide extension of State-operated or State-organised general medical services has not been demonstrated to be necessary, the Government would regard it as undesirable and would not, therefore, propose that the limits to be fixed by the regulations mentioned in the preceding paragraph would be such as to include a high proportion of the population.</P>
    <P>This indicates a continuation of the present approach to the urgent need for health reform in our country, this situation which has caused so much anxiety to the public in the past.  The provision by health authorities of assistance to persons in the middle income group for purchase of drugs and medicines has cost a certain sum.  The White Paper proposals in this regard are indeed vague and obscure.  It is not clear whether any real change is intended in the present system whereby health authorities give assistance in certain cases.  If the proposed scheme involves further undignified means-testing and investigation by officials of family circumstances to prove or disprove the extent of hardship as the paragraph in the White Paper would <Col N="394" /> seem to indicate, it will be socially undesirable and will not be availed of generally by persons in the middle income group.  A limited number of proposals of this kind is no solution to the needs of our society, our workers and the people in the middle income group at the present time.  The cost of drugs and medicines has risen so dramatically in recent years that there is indeed urgent need for State-organised systems on a national basis available to all citizens, irrespective of the apparent means.</P>
    <P>I find, too, that in many of our dispensaries in rural Ireland, medical officers are often forced, for one reason or another, to issue prescriptions to holders of medical cards who have to have these compounded in the local chemist shop at considerable expense. It is true, too, of course, that in the small rural dispensaries, there is, very probably, the difficulty of keeping wide stocks of drugs but surely, with modern transport facilities, it should be possible to get over this particular handicap.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that even though the Minister said&mdash;and I believe he was quite sincere in saying it&mdash;that all persons in receipt of the full non-contributory old age pension are entitled to a free medical service, when such a person presents a prescription to a chemist, he must pay what amounts to a considerable share of his weekly pension. There is apparently no means whereby this can be refunded.</P>
    <P>These are the things which really affect the people, and the people in rural Ireland especially.  It is a problem which is causing grave anxiety. When this White Paper came out in January last, it was indeed welcomed and I sincerely hope that very much time will not pass before its terms are implemented.</P>
    <P>Any move in the direction of an extension of the district nursing service to the middle income group and the provision of home help service for old people and the chronically ill is indeed warmly welcomed.  We certainly support it, but it is impossible to comment on the adequacy or otherwise of the proposed service until further information, not contained in <Col N="395" /> the White Paper, is forthcoming.  Most local authorities have extended this service over the past few years and there is now, I think, a nurse attached to all dispensary districts, whose services are availed of and this has proved, though limited at present, very valuable especially for elderly people. It is saving our medical officers a considerable amount of work.  This is a very important aspect, because if our doctors can be saved unnecessary work, they are available to deal with cases which need their full attention.</P>
    <P>As to the extension of dental, aural and ophthalmic services to additional groups, this is a provision in the White Paper which is rather interesting because in the local authorities one of the major complaints at the present time is that these services are completely restricted.  It is very difficult for any person, whether the holder of a medical card or not, to get any of these services.  It is true that they are provided but it is really a skeleton service which is operated in most local authorities at present.  Perhaps lack of finance is the reason but that is a poor excuse in an age of mounting taxation and high rates.  While we must welcome this move, the way in which the proposals are worded in the White Paper gives some ground for doubting the extent of the benefit intended.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that a statutory obligation to provide these services for the groups mentioned in the White Paper was imposed on health authorities under section 21 of the Health Act of 1953.  Despite the enactment of this section, however, the necessary regulations for the operation of these services have never been made.  Little credence can therefore be attached to a further promise to provide something which is not really enjoyed by very many people in the country.  When it comes to introducing the legislation, we look forward to this particular problem getting a prominent place.  Going through rural Ireland today, especially in the villages and towns, and seeing the number of people without dentures, or obviously in need of glasses, one really wonders whether we have any health services at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> I also question the table showing the number of people registered on the general medical services register.  I recall on one occasion in the council's office looking at the file of the names of persons who were on the medical services register.  That was a confidential file but it was left open and I threw my eye over it.  Under the heading &ldquo;C&rdquo;, I think, 14 per cent of the people from my local area on that list were already dead.</P>
    <P>It is easy to say that 30 per cent approximately of our population have medical cards, but on that occasion I noted that quite a number of the people registered were dead, and had been dead for a number of years.  What really vexed me was the case of a man who had been dead for six years and was still registered, while his widow had been taken off the register as her means had been found to have improved.  When I questioned the county manager on that score, he said these medical cards are reviewed every six months.  Apparently they are unable to find the deceased members, but the living are quickly knocked off the register.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why any official or any council would want to keep these people on the register, unless it is to impress the community that 30 or 36 per cent of the population are registered.  I should like to know from the Minister if that was an isolated case.  If so, I would be satisfied.  The fact is that these files are confidential and we cannot see them.  I am not in the least inquisitive but this file happened to be left open while I was in the office and I could see it without going near it.  These are the things that annoy me as a public representative and they certainly should not be allowed to go on.</P>
    <P>I also find that even though we have quite a high number of people on the medical card register, every second person who gets sick appears not to have a card.  Half my time as a member of the county council is taken up with efforts to get people registered.  If you are well, there is no trouble in getting a medical card; but if you are sick, it is another story.</P>
    <P>However, I welcome the special provision <Col N="397" /> for people suffering from diseases such as cancer.  This indicates a most humane and commendable attitude on the part of our county managers. People who suffer from these chronic illnesses are indeed entitled to have their minds put at ease, and to know that they will not die leaving huge medical bills behind them.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on the amount of work he has put into the Department since he assumed responsibility for it almost a year ago.  I wish him every success.  The task before him is quite a big one.  I hope he will get down to it and introduce legislation, irrespective of where it has its origin, that will give the people of Ireland a reasonable and an improved health service, of which they will be able to avail with the least trouble to themselves. When people are sick and go to hospital instead of a doctor coming to examine them and to see to their physical complaints, very often the first person they see is someone with a big list of questions.  I am afraid the first examination they get is from the matron or from one of the officials.  I do not think that helps them at all. It could easily be left until the patient is in a better humour for answering questions.  At present no one wants to pay for treatment received in our county hospitals, not even the county councils, if at all possible, by patients who qualify under the 1953 Act.</P>
    <P>I certainly doubt the figures contained in this White Paper setting out the number of people registered under the present Act.  I feel the figure is altogether too high.  Otherwise, I would be forced to believe that people with medical cards never get sick and only people without medical cards do get sick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Senator Alton on putting down this motion.  I welcome the proposed changes.  As a matter of fact, the Labour Party have been advocating many of these changes for quite some time, but it is doubtful whether we would have financed the scheme in exactly the same way the Minister has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this White Paper is put into <Col N="398" /> effect, 90 per cent of the population will be covered by the Health Act.  If we had adopted a different method of financing it, it might have been possible to include the whole population.  It is suggested in the White Paper that the cost of implementing all the proposals might be so high that they might never be implemented, or not for many years to come.  There were many defects in the old Health Act.  We could not really decide who was entitled to benefit and who was entitled to be included in the lower income group.  In paragraph 51 of the White Paper, it is suggested that the Minister will lay down schemes for people who are entitled to be included in the lower income group.  The income of unmarried children was taken into account under the old Act.  This led to many difficulties and to much hardship for the people really entitled to health services.  As everyone knows, children are not exactly that good that they give up their full income to their parents.  In fact, it is the other way about.</P>
    <P>The free choice of doctor proposed in the White Paper is very welcome. I do not believe it will bring about such an extraordinary change because quite a number of people in the lower income group are quite satisfied with the dispensary doctor who is attending them.  Some are not satisfied, but these will never be satisfied with any doctor they get.  They are inclined to run from one doctor to another.  I can see quite an amount of difficulties arising as a result of some people wishing to change their doctor with every new pain they get.</P>
    <P>I know the doctors themselves were not altogether free of blame as regards the treatment of some medical card holders.  There is not a county where we have not some experience of a medical card holder getting a very raw deal from the dispensary doctor.  The fact that there is a choice of doctor will eliminate any such abuse and from that point of view alone, the provision of a choice of doctor will be helpful.  However, doctors are not so keen about getting medical card holders.  It is laid down here that a doctor may take on new clients, if he so desires.  He may also refuse them <Col N="399" /> by saying he has to give all his hours as it is and it is more than likely that many of the doctors will say: &ldquo;I have sufficient patients to look after and I do not want to accept a new one.&rdquo;  I can see quite an amount of difficulty arising in cases like that.</P>
    <P>The supply of drugs is another matter that has been dealt with and the provision in this regard is very good if it is implemented.  There are many people in the middle income group who are in dire distress as a result of having continuously to purchase drugs.  We find it is more than difficult to persuade the county manager, who is all powerful as regards the issue of medical cards, to issue a certificate which entitles a person to get drugs. I hope that when the section is implemented it will be easier for those people to get these drugs.</P>
    <P>I notice some provision here about a choice of hospital.  I would be in favour of that, although I see no change here as regards a choice of hospital unless a person is prepared to continue paying what he is paying under the old Act.  For example, in Athlone, we have the Portiuncula Hospital, which is just a few miles away. Doctors often send patients with medical cards there.  The same thing arises in Meath where people are sent to Mullingar.  When it comes to paying the bill, the people themselves have to foot the bill up to the extent of 10/-a day.  This has meant considerable hardship on those people.  In many cases it has not been the fault of the people that they went to the hospital outside the county.  I should like this matter looked at with regard to the borders.  We have a Border between the North and South but we have many borders between different counties in the South.  When making out reports for health services, they should be made out as near as possible to the hospital which is fully equipped to deal with all illnesses.</P>
    <P>The Minister praised the Voluntary Health Board for the good work they are doing.  I agree with him on that but I do not think the Voluntary Health Scheme is an answer to people <Col N="400" /> who are outside both the lower and middle income groups.  Anybody who has the experience of completing the application form for membership of the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme will know that if a person has suffered from a particular disease, he is not covered if that disease should recur. Many people have been refused admission to the scheme and those people who are outside the middle income group find themselves in serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer particularly to farmers over £60 valuation.  They do not compare in any way with the man earning £1,200 a year.  It is pretty rough to ask a man with £60 valuation, which includes not only his land valuation but the valuation of his property, his house, sheds, etc., which is often a considerable part of the total valuation&mdash;and it is unjust to say that that man makes over £1,200 a year&mdash;to pay for all medical services. I know some people who are almost on the road because of the fact that they cannot get cover under the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme and cannot get cover in any other way for illness.  The county manager may give some slight relief in certain cases but the reliefs suggested in the White Paper are just the same as they were under the old Acts.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency for people to go into hospital.  It is referred to here and some people wonder why that is the case.  I do not wonder why it is so because in maternity cases, for example, people find it much more convenient to go into hospital than to stay in their own houses.  It is often cheaper for a person in the middle income group to go into hospital than to stay at home.  If the person is depending on a daily visit from the dispensary doctor for injections, he will have to have £1 in his hand every time the doctor comes, whereas in the hospital he is there at the rate of 10/- a day. He will be maintained for that amount. Therefore, the tendency will be for people to go to hospital when they are ill.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister intends to issue a separate White Paper as regards <Col N="401" /> the mentally handicapped.  I hope that when he does so, he will see his way to give mentally handicapped children free care, free education and free rehabilitation because the healthy people of the country should be good enough to carry the mentally retarded children.</P>
    <P>The care of the aged is another matter dealt with in the White Paper. I suggest that the Minister give every encouragement to have those people cared for at home.  The tendency is for the younger people not to accept the responsibility of taking care of the older people but to send them not only to the county homes but to the mental hospitals.  There are many people in mental hospitals and county homes today who could be well cared for at home.  A nursing service for those people is essential and should be developed fully.</P>
    <P>The school examination is a subject I have never been satisfied with.  The medical officer of health is seen about once in three years and I do not think that is sufficient.  Furthermore, if a child is taken ill or has any defect and has not been examined while at school, that child cannot be treated under the Health Act provisions for school children.  Another point is that the condition must be detected in the school, and at times this is most difficult.  I could give an example of an overgrown boy who became suddenly lame. He was all right the day of the medical examination, but as a matter of fact, had a diseased bone which showed up a few months afterwards, and because it was not detected in the school or the parent did not give any indication that he had been suffering any pain, he was not covered under the Act.  An Act that is open to that sort of abuse is not a good Act.</P>
    <P>I hold that parents should be free to bring their children to the county clinic and have them examined for a defect that may arise subsequent to the school medical examination.  There are many improvements required as regards the care of school children, because if no serious defects are allowed to develop when they are young, the State could save money in the long <Col N="402" /> run.  Take, for example, defects of eyes, teeth and various other disabilities.  If a child is not examined for a period of up to three years, then it is certain that delay will do quite an amount of harm.</P>
    <P>We are glad the Minister is taking responsibility for any increase in the rates over the 1965/66 figure.  It had come to the stage that the local authorities could not even collect the rates, and, of course, the increase in the health rate was responsible.  The fact that he is taking over any extra expenditure there will help to stabilise the rates, and that in itself will be a good thing.</P>
    <P>I am not too sure about what the Minister has in mind regarding the special regional boards.  I am afraid there will be many growing pains before he finds these regional health boards give satisfaction to the general public.  If we are to have a successful Health Act, we will want the full co-operation of the doctors and the Department. They will need to work hand in hand.  Everyone knows that the last Health Act did not work, for the simple reason that the IMA and the Department were at loggerheads from the day it was introduced until the present Minister came in.</P>
    <P>Up to the present there has been bad planning as regards hospitals, etc. I would almost go so far as to say that millions of pounds have been wasted throughout the country in erecting hospitals that should never have been erected.  In Athlone, there was a hospital built at a cost of £144,000.  All facilities were put there for a surgeon, but no surgeon was ever appointed, and now one could describe it as a glorified old persons' home without any facilities for operations, etc.  If there had been good planning, the hospital in Mullingar would have been extended to such an extent that in all probability it could be a training school for nurses today.  Then in Longford there seems to be chaos altogether.  The county council were instructed to buy a site some years ago, and now the new Minister has told them that not only will no hospital be built on that site but that the old hospital will not be reconstructed and that instead Mullingar <Col N="403" /> will now be extended to take in people from Longford.</P>
    <P>If we are to get the full benefit of the White Paper when implemented, the other Departments will have to see that health hazards are removed.  For example bad housing must be eliminated.  Seeing how things are going at the moment and that money cannot be got to build houses, I think that the Department of Local Government will undo much of the work which the Department of Health is trying to do if people are left in bad houses.  We have also the difficulty about getting water and sewerage schemes.  All the schemes have been put in abeyance, and as long as we keep these health hazards there and do not provide the money to get rid of them, the Minister will find that he will have many more problems on his hands than he should have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks will be brief because much of what I would say would be a repetition of what has been said.  I would like to draw attention to the extremely long delay in making any changes in the health services, changes which are so very urgently needed.  It has taken since 1961 to introduce the White Paper.  I hope that it will not take as long to implement it.  I am afraid, however, that with the financial position of the country as it is today, any hope of immediate change seems very remote indeed if the Minister adheres to his policy of financing any such changes out of national taxation or by placing a bigger burden on the rates.  Neither can afford it, and yet a very good health service can be achieved by social insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest example is the success of the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  I cannot for the life of me see why a wider section of the population cannot be treated in the same way.  The ratepayers will certainly be up in arms if there is any further increase at that end.  The local authorities are also, to my mind, eating up too big a share of the money available in administering the present service.  That leads me to believe that <Col N="404" /> the proposals in the White Paper to do away with the health authorities, as we know them now, and to introduce a larger regional health authority will not be in the best interests of any section of the people, because, first of all, if the Minister is determined that the larger portion of the cost will come from the ratepayer, the people who pay the piper should at least be able to call the tune.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the fact that there will be larger regional boards will do away with the personal contacts which members of local authorities have with members of the public&mdash;the liaison between the persons concerned and the members of the health authority. For that reason I have doubts about the feasibility of larger regional health authorities but I should like to hear the Minister's reply on that point before I make my mind up definitely.</P>
    <P>The debate has ranged over the whole field of health, and medical cards have come in for considerable criticism.  I should like to add to that criticism and to express the hope that the provisions of the White Paper in this respect will be implemented without delay.  Under the present system, it is a case of people not knowing who is entitled to what.  At the moment, the ratepayers have to foot the bill and employers have to pay their share in respect of their staffs and finally have to finance their own health bills.  A change is necessary in that respect.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about mental illness which today is capturing the imagination of the people, and not before its time.  That there should be overcrowded mental hospitals in Ireland is beyond my comprehension. Has the Minister had the opportunity of visiting St. Dympna's Hospital in Carlow, administered by the Carlow-Kildare Health Authority?  There we have had a revolution in mental treatment under a dynamic RMS.  The number of patients has dropped steadily each year and with the exception of some people who were there long before the change began to take place, the drop will continue, having remained static for a few years.</P>
    <P>That position has been brought about <Col N="405" /> by the increasing use of drugs and the fact that many patients are returned to their homes and treated there by nurses from the hospital who visit them.  The changes there are something that must be seen to be believed.  The old stigma of mental illness is slowly but surely being removed and the sooner it is removed completely the better.  If health authorities who have not begun to make these changes visit Carlow, they will see for themselves the benefits that can accrue both to the authorities and the patients.  If patients are too long hospitalised, their families tend not to want them any longer; they tend to shirk their responsibility to take them back into society.  Under the system we operate in Carlow, patients are not kept long in hospital but are treated in their own homes, which, in the long run, is the best place.</P>
    <P>The major problem in this respect is the mentally retarded.  It is a problem we have not even begun to tackle. There is the question of the provision of institutions.  That, to my mind, can be overcome easily.  However, no provision at all is being made to train personnel to treat such patients.  Very often, on many subjects, we are ready to compare Ireland with some European countries.  This is one occasion on which we can make a comparison with Holland, not to our credit.  In Holland, patients, having been rehabilitated, are given continuous employment.  They are returned as useful citizens to society and are able to play their part continuously to the benefit of themselves and their country.  Here it is not the same.  We train people to a particular skill but we neglect to provide the jobs afterwards.  All such people are most anxious to be independent, to play their part in society, and it is up to the Minister to see that something is done to give them the chance they ask for and deserve.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of looking after old people.  Here the Departments of Health and Local Government must have very close liaison. Instead of housing numbers of old people in institutions, an effort should be made to provide flats and small houses and community centres where <Col N="406" /> they can come together.  We should also provide home nursing visits.  In such circumstances, our old people will be much happier than if we continue to dump them in institutions there to await the Lord's call.  We have very great responsibility in this matter.  I am sure the Minister has it in mind but I should like to see him implementing it at the very earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>I welcome the White Paper as far as it goes.  It does not go far enough.  I ask the Minister to see to it that the points raised during the debate are brought before the Dáil at the earliest opportunity.  I hope there will be no undue delay in bringing about a radical change in the health services. If the Minister is worried about where the money is to come from&mdash;and I am sure he is&mdash;I ask him to have another look at the idea of insurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to thank Senators for their constructive contributions and to say, as I have already said, that it is my intention to bring to the Oireachtas next November a new Health Bill.  I also have decided that it would be a good thing for me as Minister for Health to visit every health authority in the country and I intend to do that next September.  There is evidently some confusion on various matters and I think that by visiting the various areas, I may learn a lot and, at the same time, be in a position to talk about the local problems of the health authorities, and, with the assistance of my officials, answer any queries which the members of the health authorities may wish to put as a result of studying the White Paper.  I hope also to be in a position to allay any anxiety which may have arisen, or which may arise, so far as the new regional boards are concerned.  We wish to ensure that the health services are worked by the co-operation of all interested parties, the elected members, the medical personnel, and so on, and I do not think it is beyond the bounds of human capacity to come up with proposals which will satisfy everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of having elected members outvoted by these regional boards.  I do not think that <Col N="407" /> need cause any anxiety.  It is my intention, first of all, that the elected representatives will be in the majority and I do not know of any occasion&mdash; and I was a member of a health authority myself&mdash;where votes have taken place, and I think that by and large the anxiety of most members in every health authority is to see that the patients in their area get the best possible treatment.  That, I think, is the anxiety of all members of the authority and that is the position that will continue to obtain.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I have not much time to deal with all the matters raised here today.  I would not have wished to speak at length to explain the various proposals in the White Paper.  It speaks for itself and I do not think it necessary for me to restate the proposals in it.  I am here as an interested spectator, as it were, and a willing listener to the debate, with the object of hearing the views of Senators on the White Paper proposals for the health services.</P>
    <P>We welcome particularly the views of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We have learned a lot from the discussions and contributions from all sides in the Dáil and have certainly learned a lot from contributions here today.  I am very grateful.  This White Paper is not a gospel or a hard and fast <i>fait accompli.</i>  It is an outline, an indication of what the Government propose.  On the basis of what we have learned from the debates and from what I will learn between now and next September from going around to the health authorities, we will come along and present legislation to the Dáil.  In other words, the new Health Bill will be ready by next November and there again my approach to this will be to submit it to the Dáil for approval and then to the Seanad, and I shall be quite amenable to accepting any reasonable, constructive amendments which any member of either House feels would make for further improvement of the health of our people.</P>
    <P>Since we first published the White Paper, we have received views from many representative organisations and we still continue to get opinions and <Col N="408" /> views every week.  The officials of my Department and I have participated in discussions with a number of bodies and the views which we have received, together with what has been said in the Dáil and here, will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Apart from discussing the principles of the changes which will be embodied in the new legislation, we have started on preliminary discussions with representatives of the medical profession on the actual practical implementation of the proposals after the legislation has been passed.  I should mention that I have had discussions with the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union on the proposal to introduce a choice of doctor in the general medical service and on how this will affect the dispensary district medical officers. While my Department is proceeding with the next step in the development of the necessary legislation, I think the House will agree that I am not at present ready to go much beyond the White Paper in so far as details of the changes are concerned.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the freezing of the rates.  I announced that in this House on 12th January last when speaking on the Health and Mental Treatment (Amendment) Bill. I anticipated the White Paper by announcing that the Government did not intend that the local rates should bear the cost of the health services and that, furthermore, arrangements will be made to ensure that the total cost of the services falling on local rates in respect of the financial year 1966-67 would not exceed the cost in respect of the year 1965-66.  This has been a help to local finance, as every member of this House will know.  It is all right producing White Papers and bringing in legislation but someone has to pay for these things and the burden on local taxation is far too heavy and beyond the capacity of many people to pay.  Therefore, I think this decision of the Government to freeze the rates for this year at last year's actual cost and to agree that all new services under this White Paper are extensions of existing services and will be borne as to 100 per cent of the cost by a source other <Col N="409" /> than the rates is right.  It is not smart to bring in proposals, desirable though they may be, if they will put from 12/- to 15/- or 20/- on the already very heavy burden of rates.</P>
    <P>I would, of course, like to congratulate Senator Alton on the great trouble he has gone to in the preparation of his serious and constructive document.  In the time at my disposal, I cannot deal with these matters but I can assure the Senator they will be gone over, point by point, by my officials and me and I have no doubt we will be able to learn a lot from them.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Alton's concern that the present permanent district medical officers should be properly fitted into the new scheme.  I have already seen a deputation from the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union consisting of some 45 dispensary doctors and I have told them that I intend to send a new memorandum to their organisation which will deal fully with dispensary doctors in various areas.  I <Col N="410" /> appreciate the point about ability to transfer from remote areas to better areas and I have directed that this be specially considered in working out the details of the scheme.</P>
    <P>On the question of the capitation as against the fee-for-services, I was intrigued to hear Senator Alton say that he had written to 80 members and he gave the result as an overwhelming majority in favour of a fee-for-service. I wonder how he picked his 80 friends.  Were they out of the blue; were they taken at random? There are a lot more than 80 doctors in the country.  I should love to have seen the phraseology of the letter.</P>
