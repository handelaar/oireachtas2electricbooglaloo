      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with my objections to the enactment of the Bill I should state briefly the purpose intended to be served by it.  It relates to a small graveyard&mdash;Saint Peter's Graveyard&mdash;in Peter Street, adjoining Messrs. Jacob's biscuit factory.  This graveyard, which contains some 250 to 300 bodies&mdash;there is some doubt about whether or not it was consecrated&mdash; was first bought in 1711 by some Huguenots who had fled to this country from France in the years after 1685. They set up a church there, where services were held in French for very many years and interments continued until around the year 1879.  Since 1879 there have been no further interments and it is in effect a disused graveyard.</P>
      <P>The proposal in the Bill is that the six trustees&mdash;who in 1917 were appointed by the High Court to look after this graveyard and also certain funds which form, I think, all the Huguenot funds which I shall deal with later&mdash;propose to sell the graveyard to Messrs Jacob for the purposes of their business.  The payment is £20,000 and, under the Bill, this is to be used for the purposes of the Huguenot Fund.  I should say, of course, that for this procedure sanction in the form of a Private Act of the Oireachtas is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was first introduced last year.  It was discussed fairly briefly in this House on 3rd March, 1965.  I spoke on the matter, as did a few other Senators but the general consensus of the House was, I think, in agreement with Senator Michael Hayes <Col N="412" /> and Senator O'Brien who said, in effect, that this matter should be allowed to go in the normal way to a Private Bill before a Joint Committee of the two Houses, be discussed by them and, if it came back to us, we should decide what further action to take.  The matter went through the Joint Committee, who had evidence and were addressed by counsel for the opponents of this Bill and also for an objector who put in a petition.  A Huguenot put in a petition against the enactment of the Bill.  The Committee have accepted the Bill, making certain improvements which I must say I am glad to see with regard to the method of transfering the bodies and detailed matters of that kind, and it now comes back to us.</P>
    <P>In spite of the various improvements in the details of the Bill made by the Committee, I think it would be generally accepted that the general principle at stake remains the same.  The objections to this Bill relate essentially to the views which very many people&mdash;I think nearly everyone&mdash;will hold about the sanctity of graveyards.  We do not normally think a great deal about graveyards, but so far as we do, we accept that the graves of our ancestors, and in due time our own graves, should be left undisturbed.  That is not merely a Christian belief or a belief that we hold in Ireland.  It is a belief that is held, I think, in nearly every country in the world.  We believe that graveyards should be left undisturbed and undesecrated, unless their is some great and urgent necessity for their disturbance. That necessity with which I shall deal later has not arisen in this case to my mind.</P>
    <P>There is a further point which relates to this particular proposal.  The Huguenots who came here and sought the hospitality of this country in 1711, bought this graveyard, and set up trustees to look after it, and set up a fund for the purpose, among other things, of the upkeep of the graveyard. We should be slow to upset the wishes of those Huguenots of long ago who, as they thought, had made provision for a permanent resting place for their bones in this little graveyard in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Apart from the immediate question at issue in this Bill, there is the very <Col N="413" /> important question of public policy which we must consider, and which could affect not merely this graveyard but all the other graveyards in the country.  We cannot consider this proposal in isolation.  We must realise that if we pass this Bill, whether we like it or not, we are creating some kind of precedent which could have, and I think would have, an influence on future matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>I know that I will be met with the rather shallow and facile argument that the living are more important than the dead.  It is easy to say that, but I wonder how far we are prepared to bring it.  Obviously, the living are more important than the dead.  That is a truism.  Let us take one of the big graveyards, the graveyard at Deansgrange, for example, where there are big areas that are already filled and in which no further interments can take place.  Supposing someone made the proposal that the Corporation were always looking for sites for housing and that they should build a big scheme like the Ballymun scheme on this graveyard.  No one would consider it for a moment.  It would be regarded as a ridiculous suggestion if it were propounded.  There are limits beyond which the argument that the living are more important than the dead would go.</P>
    <P>The question at this stage is: if we are going to upset the arrangements which our ancestors made for interment, what is the boundary line?  At what stage do you say: &ldquo;All right, the needs of the living are pressing and the dead must take second place?&rdquo; In the case of Deansgrange the argument that the living are more important than the dead would not apply, and perhaps in regards to St. Peter's, it is a more borderline case.</P>
    <P>No adequate reason has been propounded for desecrating the graveyard in this way.  Obviously, there have been, and there will be, cases where it is necessary to move graveyards. There have been some cases in the relatively recent past.  An obvious one was the little graveyard at Poulaphonca, and when the lake was being filled the graveyard had to be moved. Otherwise it would have been under the lake.  There was a similar case in <Col N="414" /> connection with the hydro-electric scheme on the Lee.  Those are obvious cases of the public interest being at stake and I do not think anyone could say that the action taken in those cases was not correct.  There are a few other cases.  There were one or two in Dublin city.  I think they were St. Thomas's and St. Bride's.  Other graveyards were removed altogether or partly removed or corners were taken away in order to allow roads to be built or widened.  Those are one or two cases where space for the general public has been made available.  There was a graveyard near Athlone, St. Mary's, where a road-widening scheme was taking place.  A corner of that graveyard was made available.  The bodies were removed to the remainder of the cemetery.  All those cases are not cases where private commercial interests were involved.  Public interest and the public at large were concerned in all of those cases.</P>
    <P>Counsel for the proposers of this Bill made, I understand, a search for precedents.  This was very important. As I understand the statement from counsel he could not find any precedent. The nearest he could get was some Railway Bills in England where an Act of Parliament was needed to permit some railways to be built.  A cemetery was taken over to enable the railway lines to be laid.  The railways were privately owned in the past.  It is important for the public at large that railways should be built.  That is a different matter entirely from this particular proposal.  It is fair to say that there is no precedent at all&mdash; certainly not in this country&mdash;for a proposal to take over a graveyard specifically to improve the operations of a commercial undertaking.  There is certainly no case in this country and, as far as I understand, no case in Britain where an Act of Parliament has specifically authorised a precedent of this kind.</P>
    <P>Two main reasons are advanced as to why we should agree to uproot this old, historic graveyard.  The first is that the £20,000 would be used for the purpose of this particular charity.  The second is that the taking over of the graveyard would be used for the operations of Messrs Jacob.  I should like to <Col N="415" /> say a little about each of those in turn. First of all, I accept completely, and without any hesitation, the good faith of the trustees in this matter.  The trustees were offered this very big sum of money by Messrs Jacob.  They could accept it or refuse it.  They decided to accept it and use the funds to help poor Huguenots, or people of Huguenot descent in Ireland.  I think they were wrong but I completely acknowledge that they were accepting the money in good faith in order to continue the work they are doing.  I hope anything I should say in criticism of them will be listened to in the light that however wrong it may be they were acting in good faith.</P>
    <P>In 1948 there was a proposal by the ESB to take over a corner of this graveyard compulsorily for the purpose of setting up an electricity substation. There were four trustees at that time. They are still trustees and two more have been added since.  Those four trustees took a very strong line at that time.  They brought a <i>certiorari</i> order to the High Court to have the compulsory order quashed.  In paragraph 9 of the affidavit which was submitted to the High Court they had this to say:</P>
    <P>Each of the said Trustees is a member of the Church of Ireland and a person of Huguenot descent, and as such, is in his or her personal capacity, strongly opposed to the proposed acquisition of land by the Board as constituting a desecration of a Christian burial ground and an improper and unjustifiable appropriation of the property of the charity.</P>
    <P>That, to my mind, was a very proper attitude for them to take.  I can only regret that they did not continue to take that attitude with regard to the present proposal.  Of course, they would be the first to agree that there was a very great difference between the £200, which was all the ESB offered in 1948, and the £20,000 which Messrs Jacob offered in 1964.  A period of ten years is not a long time.  The trustees were extremely sane people but there is a very big difference in <Col N="416" /> the sums of money involved.  One of the trustees, during examination before the Joint Committee, had this to say on the question:</P>
    <P>I think a man who has a sense of proportion will think this wonderful sum of money stands on a different footing from the £200, mere chicken feed, offered by the ESB</P>
    <P>That is a very fair statement of the attitude of the trustees.  A sum of £200 was, of course, chicken feed.</P>
    <P>The question arises, with regard to the very large sum offered by Messrs Jacob in 1964, that the trustees were forgoing half of their trust, that is to look after the graveyard, in order to do better by the other half, that is this particular charity.  I have no doubt they will be able to put the money to good use.  They hope to be able to put young persons of Huguenot descent through the university or to set them up in business.  They will be doing very good work.</P>
    <P>This matter, of course, applies to any graveyard.  Anyone could buy a graveyard for a large sum of money, no matter who owned it.  The money received for the graveyard could be put to good use.  I do not think that should necessarily influence us here. In any event the existing charity, which has been changed from time to time, is a very different matter from that set up by the Huguenots in the 1700s.  The fund was set up then for the upkeep of the church and the poor of the parish.  The present fund, while it had to be altered by the court, because of changing circumstances, is a long way removed from the type of fund the original Huguenots had in mind.</P>
    <P>The second main argument for this Bill is that the graveyard is needed for Messrs Jacob's Factory.  It is quite obvious it is of use to them. The graveyard is a very small part of the total block occupied by Messrs Jacob.  Their block is completely surrounded by public highways and it extends over four acres.  This little graveyard is about one-ninth of an acre.  It is about three per cent of the total area occupied by Jacobs. Jacobs occupy 97 per cent of the total <Col N="417" /> area.  Obviously it is of use to them to have it.  In their evidence to the committee Messrs Jacob produced firm arguments that I think I should mention.  They said the Government had asked them, like other Irish industries, to increase production.  This is necessary for industry as a whole in order that we should be ready to compete with the possible Common Market countries in the event of our entering the Common Market.  This is very true but we should be realistic about it.</P>
    <P>It was not in 1964 that Jacobs decided to buy this graveyard.  The first offer was in 1917.  In 1917 there was no Common Market and no free trade. There was no Irish Government at that time.  We should be realistic about this matter and we should forget about this talk of the national interest, the Government and so on.  It would be a good thing for Messrs Jacob to get this graveyard.  They said there would not be any guarantee of increased employment. It is not a matter of giving more work.  It is a matter of producing more economically.  It will certainly make more profits for them.  That is what is involved.  Mind you, I say, all power to them.  They have done well by the citizens of Dublin and by Ireland.</P>
    <P>But let us be clear about this.  From their point of view it is a means of improving their business and let us forget about everything else.  They said they want to increase the length of their biscuit ovens and so forth.  They also admitted that if they do not get this site they have alternative plans which, perhaps, will not be as good but will enable them to expand by moving in other directions.</P>
    <P>We should have regard to the fact that there are other disused graveyards in and around Dublin and in various other parts of the country.  Whatever we do here, we may be perfectly certain it will be watched by various interests.  If we enact this Bill there will be insurance companies, there will be factory owners, there will be all sorts of commercial interests casting covetous eyes on little graveyards of this kind.  There are eight such graveyards in the city of Dublin, in extremely valuable central positions.  We <Col N="418" /> will have multi-storey office blocks built on these enormously valuable sites.  Religious bodies will be faced with the same problem&mdash;that huge sums will be available to them with which to build churches, schools and with which to help charities.</P>
    <P>Do we want this?  Are we willing, anxious or prepared to give a headline of this kind?  We should not be. It is entirely wrong to say that an old graveyard, just because it is a graveyard, should be left there, but we can limit it to one straightforward proposition: we are not prepared in any circumstances, as far as it is in our power, to allow the desecration of graveyards for purely commercial purposes. That is the basis of my opposition to the Bill.  It is not that the graveyard is being moved.  I am prepared to see any graveyard moved if it is in the public interest to do so but I am not prepared to support the proposition that it is right that for purely narrow commercial purposes a graveyard of this kind should be uprooted and the bodies removed simply because biscuit ovens are to be erected on the site.  It is quite wrong and I do not think we, as a House of the Oireachtas, should give a headline in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Yeats has made a very reasoned case against this Bill.  The sentiments he has expressed ran through the minds of the members of the Joint Committee who sat on this Bill and before whom the trustees and the objectors gave evidence.  I can quite easily realise the apprehensions he has with regard to the future&mdash;that this Bill might create a precedent.  We all feel, quite properly, that we owe respect to the dead and to the places where their last remains lie.  That was dominant in my mind and in the minds of the other members of the Joint Committee. The Committee heard the evidence at considerable length and I think the matter which probably influenced us most was the fact that this proposal had been given very long and very anxious consideration by the trustees of the little cemetery. They had been finding certain difficulties in the maintenance of the graveyard. <Col N="419" /> Indeed, the graveyard had been in a very derelict condition during the years and had been put in a more respectable condition in recent times by Messrs Jacob.</P>
      <P>The Committee had regard to the fact that the trustees, who were descendants of the Huguenots, had consented to the proposed change.  I think it is correct to say that the fact that this money, made available from the sale of the plot to Messrs Jacob, will be made available for the necessitous descendants of the Huguenots is something that cannot be overlooked. It is something of which Huguenots who had gone before, who had not an opportunity of dealing with it, would approve of&mdash;the fact that their necessitous descendants would benefit.</P>
      <P>It is also true to say that the Joint Committee inquired very fully into the manner in which the remains were to be removed and I have little doubt &mdash;the House can be assured of this&mdash; that the way in which the remains will be removed and the searches that will be made will accord with the sentiments or the susceptibilities of all right minded people.  One of the things that swayed me in the course of the Committee proceedings was that in the meantime the distinguished Prime Minister of India died and his body was put up on a bier and the ashes cast on the waters of the Ganges.  It seems to me there is no inherent disrespect to the dead in that because we know that is a method of burial common to very many millions of people.  In dealing with the remains concerned here, a much more reverent method in accordance with our notions will be employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Yeats and the House will realise that what is really important is the approach, the mental outlook people had towards the dead and towards burial places.  They know exhumation and reburial are approached with due respect and reverence and that there is no outrage to public feelings or to the dead.  In the light of the fact that this is the approach that will be adopted&mdash;that the trustees have been at considerable pains to get a minister of a religion as close as <Col N="420" /> possible to the belief of the Huguenots to preside at the reinterment&mdash;from the point of view of religious feeling and sentiment the Bill makes very adequate provision.</P>
    <P>I understand Senator Yeats feels that other small disused graveyards may attract the attention of business interests. That matter was adverted to in the course of the discussions that took place before the Committee.  It was pointed out that the same trustees are the owners of the Huguenot cemetery in Merrion Row, a couple of hundred yards from this House, and it was made quite clear that no proposal such as that of Messrs Jacob exists in relation to Merrion Row and that as far as the Committee could bind a future Committee it was made quite clear that any similar application would not be welcome.</P>
    <P>That may serve to allay the fears of Senator Yeats that this Bill may be regarded as a precedent.  The Bill was passed by the Joint Committee in the particular circumstances of the location of the graveyard and for the reason that some benefit will accrue to the necessitous descendants of the Hugeunots.  A variety of other factors were also taken into account but they do not arise here today.  We should make it quite clear, as the Seanad, that this Bill is not to be taken by any other body of trustees who may be approached for the acquisition of similar graveyards as in any way establishing a precedent.  I agree with Senator Yeats that it is undesirable that disused graveyards should, save in exceptional circumstances, be interfered with.</P>
    <P>That was a view common to all the members of the Joint Committee.  One may agree or disagree with the view taken as to the circumstances.  The Committee felt it was desirable in the particular circumstances to grant this Bill and it was granted purely in relation to the consideration that it was not to be taken as a precedent.  For these reasons I recommend that the Bill be accepted by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator O'Quigley, and I am sure other Members of the Seanad, I understand and respect the views expressed by Senator Yeats.  We all have to try to reconcile <Col N="421" /> conflicting reactions many times in our lives and this is one of them.  I was very impressed by the Report of the Committee on this Bill and the care with which every aspect of the proposition was gone into and the insistence in the Report that due respect be paid to the remains in this graveyard and to their ultimate disposal.</P>
      <P>I have been convinced, on the other hand, that the benefits accruing from the Bill would far outweigh the objections to it and the possible disadvantages which might arise in the future. We have, on the one hand, a small fund which had a considerable draw on it and portion of this fund must be diverted to the upkeep of the graveyard. I mean that the charity of Messrs Jacob would not continue indefinitely and this is to the disadvantage of those living whose interests should be served by the fund.  On the other hand, we have the prospect of a much larger sum accruing from this transaction, if I may say so, and the reduced expenditure, of course, on the upkeep of the graveyard.  So, the balance to me is quite definitely based on the point of view strongly in favour of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that there is no real disrespect shown in this proposal for the remains of the people buried in this graveyard.  As Senator O'Quigley has pointed out, various people have different customs for the disposal of their dead and cremation is one of the possibilities in France.  That is not possible in Ireland just now.  It is quite possible that many of those people might have chosen to be disposed of otherwise than they are if they lived today.</P>
      <P>We have various other examples of changes that have taken place in the usage of what was sacred ground.  Not very far away from that graveyard is the site of a church which is now occupied by a commercial building.  I think we have to accept that changes take place and so long as, when the time comes, we give every consideration to each particular proposal and keep in our mind the respect that is due, we do not do any real harm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mind about creating a precedent so long as I know what it has been created about.  I think this is <Col N="422" /> a precedent arising out of the careful consideration of a particular proposal. I do not mind how often this proposal comes up provided on each occasion it is similarly carefully considered.</P>
    <P>I do not think we are creating a precedent for the easy transfer of burial ground for commercial purposes.  We are creating a precedent for the very careful consideration of proposals such as this and I see no great objection to that.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Committee on the amount of work they put into the report on this Bill, and for the excellent conclusions and suggestions they have offered us and I support them on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to say a few words to clear up some points. Like Senators Jessop and O'Quigley, I should like to congratulate Senator Yeats not only on his advocacy of this matter but for the fact that he has raised it at all.  I take the same views of his raising it here as the petitioner against the proposal.  It was very important in the public interest that these steps were taken so that everything that was done was thoroughly done and seen to be done.</P>
      <P>Senator Yeats referred to the trustees' different approach years ago when the ESB wanted this property for less money&mdash;£200.  I must say, in fairness to the Senator, that he did not try to draw any wrong inference from the different approach now.  May I suggest to the Senator that the trustees were in much the same position as Senator Yeats: they were putting everything they could think of into their argument then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I correct Senator Yeats on one or two points which might lead to misapprehension?  The trustees were not originally the trustees of the graveyard who were given charge of a charitable fund.  It was the other way round.  These were trustees of a charitable fund to whom the care of the graveyard was given.  It is a distinction with a difference, if you like. I think there is an inference in it that their first and most important function was the administration of this charitable fund.  Certainly in the Committee <Col N="423" /> this was the view I took.  This was their primary consideration and the terms under which they operated are quite clear.  The first charge on their funds was the charities and it is only when they had funds available that they could be spent on the upkeep of the graveyard.  Of course, it is quite clear they never had money available for the graveyard.  Consequently, the graveyard got into a shocking state.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of correction, the graveyard was in a shocking state when there were no trustees. There were no trustees up to 1917.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that is a question of opinion.  I suggest the trustees had not sufficient money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>There were no trustees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>If there had been trustees the income was not sufficient to pay for the upkeep of the graveyard&mdash;7/- a week is the sort of money they were able to give.  This is the sort of money they were able to administer.  I do not give a hoot whether it is Messrs Jacob, or a shipyard, or anything else that is involved, there is a chance to make money.  I look at it in the light that here is a way for the trustees to get money which would be useful to their fund. It is true they were only able to do it because there is a firm like Messrs Jacob who are willing to pay the fantastic sum of £180,000 an acre. That is money.  There is the possibility that one could look at it another way and say that the trustees should not sell even at £230,000 an acre.</P>
      <P>In a few years' time land values may tend to rise but I do not see very much chance of a better offer in the future.  I think it is proper that the trustees should take this opportunity and I think this is the view that matters.  It matters not who gets it or whether it is used for commercial purposes.  The most careful consideration is given where any remains that are discernible are being disinterred and every possible precaution is to be taken so that they will be reinterred with every reverence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> The Bill was amended at the request of the local authorities to ensure that everything was done under proper supervision.  It was amended with every goodwill on both sides and I have no hesitation in saying that I believe the petitioners are satisfied that the Bill as it now stands takes care of everything with one exception. It is fair to mention this as to my mind it is not obvious from the Report. There was a suggestion from the petitioner that a portion of the ground in Mount Jerome should be cut off; that room should be left for future interments and the proposal was agreed, the only difficulty being how much; but the Committee did not agree, though both sides had agreed.  The reason that they did that was that they felt that it was no function of the trustees of a charitable fund to decide who might or might not be buried in a particular plot.  It appeared to be a shocking burden to place on these people that they would have to decide whether or not any particular person had a right of interment, and if they had, when it would stop.  Supposing they left room for six, and a seventh turned up, what position would they be in?  The whole thing appeared to be both morally and legally insufferable to the trustees, and, therefore, the Committee disregarded the amendment that had been agreed on both sides.</P>
    <P>I did refer to the fact that the trustees were trustees of a charity originally and they got this graveyard only as a sort of added duty.  It is quite clear from the terms that the added duty was subject to their having any money available to do anything to it.</P>
    <P>In regard to precedent, I agree with Senator Jessop that I can see no precedent in this except that the fullest examination will obviously be given to any proposal that comes up.  The Committee has made it clear, and so has the Seanad, that this is not something that happened by chance.  As far as burial grounds belonging to any religious community are concerned, they cannot be touched because they are safeguarded by the Constitution. It is only in this particular graveyard that no religious community is the <Col N="425" /> owner.  These trustees are trustees of a charity and not a religious community so that there is this broad distinction to be made.  I would not agree with Senator O'Quigley that it is clear to the trustees that no consideration will be given to a proposal that might come up regarding another graveyard under their control.  I do not think that we can say what any future Seanad or Dáil or Joint Committee might do.  That would be going much too far.  It was, however, made reasonably clear that we were dealing with a very special circumstance and no precedent had been created.</P>
    <P>As far as commercial interests are concerned, I have no interest in that at all.  I look at it purely from the point of view of which way this is going to operate for the best.  If this Bill passes the trustees have the chance &mdash;though there is still a case before the Courts&mdash;of acquiring a sum of money which will enable them to do some good.  If this Bill is thrown out they are back with a graveyard which they do not want and no money to administer.  It is as simple as that. People ought to disabuse their minds of the question of a commercial concern, and the trustees should have money for a charitable purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not disagree more with Senator O'Quigley and Senator Jessop and to a certain extent with Senator Sheldon about this not being a precedent.  Of course, it is a precedent, and purely and simply a precedent.  It boils down in my opinion to this simple proposition, that a commercial interest, if they give enough money to a charitable organisation&mdash;though it sounds a rather horrible way to put it&mdash;can remove a graveyard as in this instance.  It will, of course, be a precedent for Bills going through this House and for similar applications being made perhaps for the other graveyard of the same type in this city, or other graveyards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that Senator Yeats has put a case that I feel a great many Members of this House in their heart of hearts really feel was a good and proper case.  Certainly it was to my mind a very proper case to make.  All <Col N="426" /> human races, whether Christian or not, have this great respect for the burial places of their dead.  It is one more of the principles, that maybe some people would see as sentimental, in this country in any case, and I think a principle of Christian peoples in particular.  If one more of the things that we have always held dear is going this is a precedent in Dublin city. There have been similar cases elsewhere perhaps for different reasons, perhaps for the public good, but that is not the case here.  It seems that gone is another of the notions we have always held dear.  It is perhaps a step towards the removal of those sort of things if there is a commercial reason for doing it.</P>
    <P>I go back to the point where Senator Sheldon stressed very much the charitable side of it.  I do not think that the charitable side has ever been brought to our notice until the commercial side arose first.  That is a very simple and obvious way to put it. The trustees, if they really wanted to raise this charitable fund, could have raised it some other way.  Possibly this is a step towards the removal of memorials, plaques and anything you like, things that former generations have put up as a memorial and historical evidence of their times for future generations.  This is one more graveyard going, one more of the historical parts of this city going, if you pass this Bill, and I feel that I must support Senator Yeats's position, and I will not take part in the removal of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a Government Bill and there are no political issues involved.  That probably makes it more difficult for us because we cannot make up our minds according to whatever political party we support. We have to try to make up our minds and judge it on the basis of our conscience on what has been said here and what we have read in regard to the proceedings before the Joint Committee. I have listened to the previous speakers and to the case made by both sides, and I find that I must support Senator Yeats.  I do so because I do not think that a case has been well made for allowing this Bill to go <Col N="427" /> through and for allowing the disinterment and reinterment of the remains of the people who purchased this plot of ground as their graveyard. I do not think that commercial interest or charitable interest outweighs that consideration.</P>
      <P>We have heard Senator O'Quigley say that the proposers of this Bill were told that another graveyard which they own in Merrion Row was not affected and that this measure should not be regarded as a precedent &mdash;that no matter what offer of money they might be made for the other graveyard they could not regard it as being likely to be approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  What is the real argument in favour of the charitable purposes?  If they are to be offered a million pounds, which is fantastic, then according to a member of the Committee that dealt with this Bill this should not provide a decisive factor.  It is a very difficult choice for the trustees of this fund, who are responsible for this graveyard.  I certainly would not like to be faced with this decision, this problem of being offered a comparatively huge sum of money which they could use for charitable purposes in order to give over this graveyard for which they are responsible.  If I were one of the trustees, I would be in favour of it. If I were in the situation that I was offered the use of this money for charitable purposes, I would tend to favour it but I do not think we, as a House of the Oireachtas, should allow these people to be put under that sort of pressure.  This is what we would be agreeing to.  Are we saying &mdash;if it is £200,000 it is not enough or if it is £500,000, then they should be allowed to take it?  I say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think, no matter what the amount of money offered to them for charitable purposes, that should decide the issue.  We should not allow them to be put under that sort of pressure, because we are not dealing with the sale of a plot of land.  That is not the problem.  We are not dealing with the maintenance of a graveyard.  I have seen graveyards turned into children's playgrounds&mdash;a very good thing&mdash;I <Col N="428" /> am not against that but what we are concerned with here is really the uprooting of remains of people who decided they were purchasing this plot of land as their graveyard or for the reinterment of someone else.  No matter how properly it is done, I do not think we should favour it.  I do not think we should allow this body of trustees to be put under this very heavy commercial pressure by way of this offer of a large sum.  I favour Senator Yeats.  I have tried to listen to the arguments and have tried to be impartial.  We are in a difficult position trying to judge the issues as they are put up to us as individuals and my conscience would favour the case made by Senator Yeats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Longford):</i> I supported Senator Yeats when this Bill came before the House originally and, because of that, I want to express my view briefly again.  I do not want to give a lecture on this matter to the House but I am prepared to say that the Huguenot people here were a minority who suffered oppression.  I suppose, because of that fact, they tried to protect themselves as a minority both while alive and dead.  Like all minorities, I suppose, they suffered from pressures from many quarters. That would appear to me to be the reason they were compelled to choose private cemeteries.  They may not have been allowed to mingle freely with the rest of the community here at that time.  I know very little about the Huguenots but I do know of one particular family and I think members of that family might still exist.  Compared with many of the landlord class the Huguenots seemed to have many good qualities in their administration of property which could have been copied by other people in the same social class of that time and that might have prevented many of the things which happened in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am saying that those people appointed trustees to administer property which included a cemetery. I am not prepared to agree fully with Senator Sheldon when he says that the cemetery was an addition to the trusteeship.  I would say that all the <Col N="429" /> property vested in the trustees was, in the opinion of the people forming the trust, equally important.  I would be prepared to take the view that the people when setting up the trusteeship to administer a charity or look after a cemetery intended it to be undisturbed and to be used for the purpose for which it was intended.  It is clearly my view that the purpose of the trusteeship, when it was set up, was that the cemetery should be kept as a cemetery.</P>
    <P>I take issue with Senator O'Quigley when he says there is no precedent. He tried to guard against a similar occurrence in Merrion Row where there is a little Huguenot cemetery, by suggesting there is no precedent involved and what happens here in regard to this cemetery will not happen to the cemetery in Merrion Row.  But who is he to say that in 25 to 30 years from now a similar situation may not arise?  I think there is a precedent being established and I do not like it.</P>
    <P>One comes down on one side or the other in an issue such as this, depending on one's outlook.  It is the sort of thing about which people can feel very strongly.  My views may be coloured in this matter because of the fact that an ancestor of mine was buried in a private cemetery which became part of a farm.  Any time I go past that particular place, even though it was a long time ago, I remember that simple fact and it does not please me to remember it.  That is what colours my view in this matter.  Therefore, I support Senator Yeats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all agree that Senator Yeats made a moderate case yet a strong case for his point of view.  We would all agree that respect for the dead is a common human attribute.  I speak as a humanist, believing that when you are dead, you are dead.  This does not, however, alter my attitude towards the dead or towards that respect which is a natural human attitude towards those who are gone.  I think, nevertheless, if we face the actual situation here, we can see that the outward symbols of this respect can perhaps be carried too far, if, for the sake of <Col N="430" /> outward symbol, some positive real modern benefit to living people is allowed to be outweighed on the other side of the scales.  It is to the credit of Senator Yeats that he has not been prepared to cast a cold eye on life and death, and to pass by.  He would like to halt here.  The realities of the situation, however, would suggest that, while recognising the respect due to the dead&mdash;and this is one of the important factors both in the Bill and in the amendments proposed by the Committee&mdash;nevertheless, we should be prepared at this stage to pass onwards.</P>
      <P>It should be recognised that the Huguenot Church in Peter Street was actually pulled down in 1840&mdash;quite a long time ago.  This has not been mentioned here today.  The last interment in the graveyard took place 87 years ago, in 1879.  It has been made public also that no inquiry concerning any person buried in the cemetery was received by the trustees for at least 20 years before the application to the court.</P>
      <P>There has been some confusion about the situation of the trustees which has not been mentioned today. It was probably mentioned on the previous occasion.  The trustees of the cemetery were also the trustees of a fund which before 1891 exceeded £8,000, which was a considerable sum then.  At that time it was possible to pay what would now seem rather small annuities of £30 or £40 a year, but at that time they represented a fairly effective purchasing power.  Unfortunately a firm of stockbrokers went bankrupt and the funds from over £8,000 dropped to £900.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently all the trustees died and consequently the trust lapsed, and it was not until 1902 that a scheme was brought in again for the administration of the seriously reduced funds available in part for the upkeep of the burial ground.  This was approved by the High Court and new trustees were appointed.  This was further amended in 1917 and provision was made for a variety of things: payment of rent, repairs, keeping the ground in good condition, the giving of relief to deserving Protestants of Huguenot descent by weekly allowances not exceeding 7/-mittee&mdash;nevertheless <Col N="431" /> a week.  They could also give grants to advance such persons in education or business, and they could make small grants towards funeral expenses where a person was eligible.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, owing to the protracted bankruptcy proceedings, the fund was by then considerably reduced, and the income was reduced to a mere £130 a year.  If that were spent entirely on maintaining the graveyard there would not be anything left for the relief of the descendants of the Huguenots who might be in financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>An arrangement was consequently made with Messrs Jacob, years ago, under which they were to lift all the fallen tombstones and erect them around the walls.  They were to turn the cemetery into a small garden in which their employees could sit during their short breaks.  So, many of these headstones were already out around the walls, and Messrs Jacob in fact have spent quite a bit of money on this graveyard.  They are now offering a considerable sum of money to take it over completely.</P>
    <P>It has already been stated, but it should be made perfectly clear, that the trustees themselves are getting nothing out of this £20,000.  This £20,000 is to make it possible for them to revise their capacity to pay the wretched 7/- a week to a handful of annuitants.  At present three annuitants receive 7/- a week, and two receive 5/- a week.  That is the reality of the situation which would weigh with me more importantly in the balance than the symbol of maintaining the graveyard in its present place.</P>
    <P>Provision is made by the Bill for a memorial stone or tablet on the new plot which would record all the details of the reinterments.  It is also agreed that the remains of any person buried in the Peter Street cemetery may, if their descendants or relatives so desire, be removed and reinterred at any other cemetery they care to choose. Therefore, I do not agree with Senator Yeats's phrase that the cemetery is being &ldquo;desecrated&rdquo;.  I do not think that is really fair to the provisions of the Bill and in particular of the Bill as amended in Committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="432" /> This offer of £20,000 would make it possible to raise the limit of 7/- a week which was placed on the trustees in 1917.  The trustees also say they are satisfied that there are plenty of people who would qualify for such increased weekly pensions.  They already have a waiting list.  When I heard Senator Cole saying that we must not sacrifice what we hold dear, and so on, I feel we should ask the question: &ldquo;At whose expense are you being asked to make a real sacrifice?&rdquo;  If we decide not to allow the cemetery to be sold, and thus prevent an increase in the annuity payments in order to preserve this derelict cemetery we are making impoverished people sacrifice real money.  It is not costing us anything, but we are asking someone else to sacrifice for an outward symbol something which they might legitimately hold dearer to-day.</P>
    <P>It should furthermore be noticed that the trustees were unanimous in recommending acceptance of Jacob's offer.  It is quite obvious that if it were merely a question of £200 which would not enable them to increase the annuities, or to help in any real way, they would be justified in refusing it. This large sum, however, gives them a real opportunity of giving far greater assistance to the living.  With all the provisos in the Bill, as amended, they are prepared to proceed with the disinterment and reburial of the people who are buried there, most of them for 100 years or more.</P>
    <P>I also notice that it is recommended in the Bill as before us now, that the new burial ground should be consecrated and the reburials carried out in accordance with the rites of the French Reformed Church, that is the French Protestant Church.  Furthermore, I notice that exhumations will be carried out under the supervision of an officer of Dublin Corporation, and that re-interments will be carried out under the supervision of an officer of the sanitary authority in whose functional area the place of re-interment is situate.</P>
    <P>I feel, therefore, that on balance the human needs of the situation are represented <Col N="433" /> by this Bill.  One has a certain emotional sympathy with Senator Yeats's case.  Nevertheless, the realities of the situation, and the fact that it will be possible to help the living descendants of these Huguenots oblige one to come down on the side of the Bill.  Any of us here having to decide whether we would like a certain amount of money to be spent on our own grandchildren or descendants, or to be spent on the purchase of elaborate headstones or the perpetual care of our own graves, would choose in favour of the living, who might actually be in distress, and who would be more greatly helped by the passing of such a Bill as this than by its rejection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are obviously two points of view on this Bill, both held with great conviction and sincerity. Both points of view are certainly deserving of special consideration. It seems to me that we have approached the trustees in a slightly unfair way because the tendency has been to regard them as being in some way prejudiced, being on the one side, as opposed to the other point of view held on the other side.  The trustees are as representative of the Huguenot community as it is possible for them to be.  They are also probably better informed than most people as to the considerations which should be borne in mind in this matter.  It is not suggested that the trustees are acting with anything but the best of motives.  That being so and having regard to the fact that the trustees have advocated that this Bill should be passed, I would certainly be very slow to put forward my personal view in opposition to what they advocate should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second thing that influences me is that the Seanad referred this Bill to a Committee of this House which went into all the details and heard the arguments on behalf of the trustees. This Committee, having heard all the arguments, have recommended to this House that we should accept the Bill. That being so, it seems to me that when the trustees, on the one hand, favour the Bill and when our own Committee, having heard all the arguments, recommend that the Bill should <Col N="434" /> be passed, I feel the House should support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing we want to realise is that this cemetery is really the property of private individuals.  It is not a cemetery of a religious denomination. The last burial that was made in it was in the year 1879.  After that nobody apparently took the slightest interest whatsoever in it.  As far as was generally then known nobody owned it.  Nobody claimed any ownership to it.  None of the descendants of any person buried in it took the least interest in it.  The funds that are in the hands of trustees were originally the funds of religious communities which were divided into two parts.  You had the Huguenot conformists and the Huguenot non-conformists. In 1917 trustees were appointed for those funds by an order of the court.  A scheme had earlier been settled in 1902.  In the 1902 scheme nothing was dealt with but the funds.  When the scheme was settled in 1917 for administering those funds for the benefit of the descendants of the two communities of whom I am speaking there was also vested in the trustees certain lands, including this graveyard and the graveyard in Merrion Row.</P>
      <P>I should think, therefore, that Senator Sheldon is correct when he states that from a practical point of view this was an additional obligation that was put on the trustees.  The total income from the funds in the hands of the trustees in 1917, and since then, was only £130 per annum.  As nobody had claimed any ownership, and as nobody had shown the least interest in this cemetery from the year 1869, it was in a state of dilapidation, ruin and decay&mdash;a complete wilderness.  It was a place that could not be said to be treated with the slightest bit of respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this cemetery was vested in the trustees in the year 1917 the funds did not permit them doing anything towards rectifying the dilapidation and decay.  One of the first charges imposed on them by the conditions of the trust was to contribute towards certain persons in very needy circumstances and towards certain educational <Col N="435" /> purposes.  They were limited to a weekly sum of 7/-.  From 1917 to 1924 not a single thing was done to improve the condition of this cemetery because the trustees' funds did not permit them to do so.  Daily it was getting worse.</P>
    <P>In 1924 it was such a complete eyesore that it was really a disgrace from the point of view of the respect which should be held for the dead.  It adjoined Messrs Jacob and Messrs Jacob got permission from the trustees to take it over under a caretaker's agreement.  It really cast a reflection on any property in the immediate vicinity.  When Messrs Jacob took it over they cleaned it up. They levelled the sites.  They took up the broken tombstones that were scattered all around the place.  They put them up against the wall.  They levelled the site and they made it into a sort of recreational park for the employees. That is what it then was.  That was in 1924.</P>
    <P>In 1948 the ESB offered to erect certain power lines, pylons, on the graveyard but they offered a small sum to the trustees for doing this.  The trustees did not take it, not because it was a small sum, but because in their view it would be a desecration of the dead since what the ESB proposed to do was to erect pylons right plumb in the middle of what was now converted into a pleasure ground without disinterring or removing any of the remains that were there.  Although Messrs Jacob made it into a kind of pleasure park under the caretaker's agreement, that is as far as they went at that stage.</P>
    <P>In 1963 there was a big high wall on one side of this cemetery which had become dangerous, so much so, that a notice was served on the trustees under the provisions of the Dangerous Buildings Act.  The little income which the trustees had, the £130 per annum, was completely and absolutely inadequate for the purpose of pulling down this wall and rebuilding it.  Therefore, the trustees, in 1963, offered this cemetery to Dublin Corporation under the provisions of the Open Spaces Act, 1906, so that Dublin Corporation would themselves undertake this expense which the trustees were unable to <Col N="436" /> undertake.  Dublin Corporation refused. At that stage Messrs Jacob came back again and said: &ldquo;We will purchase this site.&rdquo;  When Messrs Jacob made that offer at that time they were actuated by their own motives.</P>
    <P>As appears from this Report, the acquisition of this plot by Messrs Jacob would enable them to expand their business very considerably because they could expand laterally instead of vertically.  They gave evidence that it would enable them to expand so much that they could get a very serious grip on the export market and thereby expand very considerably the employment of their staff.  From that point of view, it would be a benefit to the general public, to those who would be employed and to future generations.  This, of course, is a completely selfish motive.</P>
    <P>Messrs Jacob then offered the trustees a sum of £20,000.  The trustees were all descendants of the people who were originally of the Huguenot faith but no persons, as far as is known, of the non-conformist Huguenot denomination are now in this country. After much heart-searching, the trustees came to the conclusion that they would be properly and more fittingly performing their trust if they went ahead with the sale to Messrs Jacob. To do so, a Private Bill was necessary.</P>
    <P>Now we are told it will establish a precedent.  I should point out that the precedent is already there.  In 1898, there was disinterment from St. Bride's in this city and reinterment in another cemetery.  In 1925 and 1926, the remains of what were understood to be 422 people were removed from the cemetery of St. Thomas and reinterred elsewhere.  The offer made by Messrs Jacob was: &ldquo;We shall have this plot deconsecrated by a minister of the Huguenot faith&rdquo;&mdash;he must be brought into the country because I understand there is no such minister in the country and no such denomination here at the present time&mdash;&ldquo;We shall acquire a certain plot in one of the Dublin cemeteries.  We shall have the remains reverently reinterred in that plot.  Again, the services of a minister of the religious faith of those <Col N="437" /> people will be brought in and he will be present at the reinterment.  The plot will be kept in good condition <i>ad infinitum.</i>&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us therefore consider the question of respect.  One hesitates to do anything which might hurt the feelings or the susceptibilies of the descendants of any person who is interred in a particular place.  In this instance, apparently no one can trace relationship to any person who is interred in that plot.  If anyone could so trace relationship, even to 40 or 50 years ago, he would have to be heartily ashamed of himself for the condition of decay and dilapidation which the graveyard had got into.  There is no hurt to the religious susceptibility of any person because the remains are being reverently disinterred, reverently reinterred.  It is much more desirable, I think, that the remains of the dead should be kept in a cemetery and not in a playground, and in such a manner in that cemetery that the plot in which they are buried will be kept in good condition for all time.</P>
    <P>One must respect the plot where lay the remains of the dead, but in this case that plot is being deconsecrated and the remains are being buried in another plot which will be consecrated in accordance with the faith of the people being buried there.  Therefore, having heard the arguments offered here today, I was impressed by the respect which Senator Yeats showed towards burial grounds, towards the dead&mdash;that when a person is dead, that is not the end of all things. Despite that, and weighing all the circumstances, weighing the respect now being paid to the remains, I feel the Seanad should pass the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very rarely do I find myself in agreement with Senator Yeats but I do on this occasion.  I have listened to the arguments for and against the Bill and with particular attention to the arguments put forward by those Senators associated with the Joint Committee, and I must confess to be anything but impressed by the strength of the case put forward by these Senators.  When all things are <Col N="438" /> weighed up in this&mdash;principles, respect for the dead, sanctity of burial places, guarantees of respectful removal and reinterment&mdash;and one puts money on the other side of the scale, the money wins.  It is as simple as that.  I must ask how far do principles go or stand when £ s. d. are on the other side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  On the basis that the money is to be well spent, and we agree with the idea that sanctity of burial places is to be respected&mdash;it is an age old respect common to all Irish people who believe it is wrong to interfere in this way with burial places&mdash;where do we proceed?  The Irish people regard it as an evil thing to interfere in this way with the remains of the dead.  The argument being put forward here is that out of evil cometh good. On that basis you could establish houses of ill-fame in the city of Dublin and on the proceeds set up scholarships or other things that would bring good results.</P>
      <P>I do not think that argument is one that Senators or others would agree with.  I agree that the living are more important than the dead but I am sure in this case the interests of the living can be met without in any way interfering with the sanctity of burial places.  There were other ways open to the trustees.  It is all right to say that financially this was a very tempting offer.  It was, but as Senator Murphy said, it would be unfair to this House to allow the decision to be left finally in the hands of the trustees.  They examined their consciences, I feel sure, and found in this a way to provide benefits for the descendants of the people whose remains lie in the graveyard. The Seanad, however, must take a wider view because a precedent is being created, no matter how we erect a smokescreen to hide it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two points arise here.  First of all, the upkeep of the graveyard had become a difficult matter and Messrs Jacob had taken care of it over a period of years.  The first I knew about Dublin Corporation's interest was from <Col N="439" /> comments here that Dublin Corporation offered to look after this graveyard. Dublin Corporation on that occasion refused to live up to their responsibilities and it remains at this stage because the Corporation do not see things in a proper fashion.  Messrs Jacob should be given the choice of taking over the graveyard.  Without going into detail, we know the mentality of the Dublin Corporation when it comes to Georgian houses and when it comes to canals.  We know there is not a greater set of primitives in the country than the Dublin Corporation when it comes to things of historical value in this city.</P>
    <P>Let us look upon this graveyard in another regard.  Dublin is an ancient city and one containing many historical remains.  Dublin's past goes back into history.  If the argument can be put forward in this House successfully that money is the main object because it can do a certain amount of good, on that basis many of the most precious possessions in this city will be wiped out on the grounds that certain people will reap good from it. But, we are destroying something of an historical nature in the country and we will leave Dublin purely a commercially modernised concern.  We are inviting foreigners to Dublin on the basis that this is an ancient city with ancient history, ancient monuments and ancient cemeteries.  I believe people would come from all parts, from France, Germany and so on, to look at cemeteries like this. But again there are pounds, shillings and pence coming in in this way.  I, at any rate, having listened to the arguments put forward here, am satisfied that the very reasoned case put by Senator Yeats is one that would impress many people outside this House, and especially in this country which respects its dead.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley made a point which puzzles me.  He said he was greatly impressed by the funeral arrangements of the late Prime Minister of India.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to confirm an Order which I have made under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, on the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission, in regard to the supply and distribution of intoxicating liquor and non-alcoholic beverages.</P>
      <P>Senators have already received copies of the Commission's report of their Inquiry into this matter, but I propose to give here a summary of its contents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Inquiry related to restrictive trade practices affecting supply and distribution and involving, <i>inter alia</i>, arrangements, agreements or understandings between retailers, made at the instance of retail trade associations, which affect or are capable of affecting the retail prices of intoxicating liquor and soft drinks.  The Inquiry was undertaken by the Commission at my request, when, shortly after the introduction of the Budget on the 11th May, 1965, retail prices in the licensed trade throughout the country were increased by amounts equal to twice the <Col N="444" /> amount of the increase in the duties on spirits and beer imposed by the Budget.</P>
    <P>The Commission gave consideration to all the relevant factors, including the structure of the retail trade, the gross profit margins in the trade, the activities of trade associations and the preparation of price lists and circulars. They also examined a number of financial accounts furnished by publicans both in Dublin and in rural areas. They took into account the special importance of a fixed gross profit margin when it relates to a trade the value of the sales of which are enhanced by revenue duties of considerable magnitude.</P>
    <P>The Commission found that there was only one type of restrictive practice in the trade which fell within the terms of reference of the Inquiry, i.e. the one relating to the preparation and issue of price lists and circulars by retail associations of licensed traders.  A remarkable feature of the trade is the number of associations which represent retail interests.  These have issued price lists or circulars in 17 counties. To the knowledge of the Commission, 27 associations issue price lists or circulars periodically.  In their Report, the Commission describe the procedures employed by a number of associations in connection with the preparation of price lists and circulars.  In Dublin, for example, it is the practice for the trade associations to have the question of revised prices considered by its Committee of Management which consists of some forty members of the Association. There is normally a discussion about conditions in the trade generally and an attempt is made to assess the magnitude of increased costs and the appropriateness of making an increase in prices.</P>
    <P>It is not the practice to have financial accounts of a cross section of members available for discussion.  The Association considers that the combined experience of the Committee of Management enables it to decide in an equitable and satisfactory manner what the new prices ought to be and in this connection, the Association has constantly in mind the desirability of achieving a fixed percentage gross profit margin on turnover.  Usually, though not always, a general meeting <Col N="445" /> of the members of the Association is subsequently convened, when the proposals of the Committee are placed before it and a vote is taken after the proposals have been discussed.</P>
    <P>When new prices are decided upon by trade associations, they may be notified to members by means of a price list or by the issue of a circular letter or, on occasion, by the insertion of an advertisement in the daily press.</P>
    <P>Two associations viz. the Dublin Licensed Grocers' and Vintners' Association and County Sligo Licensed Vintners' Association take measures designed to secure compliance with their recommended prices.  These measures are described in Chapter 14 of the Report.  The Fair Trade Commission are satisfied that serious and systematic attention to &ldquo;price cutting&rdquo; in the Dublin area has been given by the Committee of the Association. Both members of the Association and non-members have been visited by the Organiser and, on occasion, by some of the honorary officers of the Committee in an endeavour to secure their agreement to charge the Association's recommended prices.  On one occasion the question of securing the co-operation of the trade union was considered. The Association also took specific measures in certain instances in which compliance with their recommended prices would have created a special problem for members.  In regard to arrangements between the Association and Messrs Guinness concerning retail houses owned by Guinness, the Commission were not satisfied that there was not an element of moral pressure underlying the arrangements.</P>
    <P>In the case of County Sligo officers of the Association may call on publicans with a view to explaining to them the economic reasons for the new prices proposed and, if a member remains unconvinced, he may voluntarily withdraw from the Association.</P>
    <P>The Commission took evidence from brewers, distillers, and soft drink manufacturers, as well as from the licensed trade itself, in regard to the advantages or disadvantages of the issue of price lists by retail associations. Having considered the views of the different parties, most of which they <Col N="446" /> reject, the Commission were of opinion that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the practice of issuing lists of recommended prices manifestly restricts price competition, since many licensed vintners unquestioningly charge the recommended prices, and do not determine their own selling prices in the light of their own costs and their experience of the trade;</P>
    <P>(b)  a further restrictive element arises in relation to the enforcement of recommended prices by a number of associations because its objective is to ensure that particular traders charge higher prices than may be warranted in their cases;</P>
    <P>(c)  such interference with competition is unfair and operates against the public interest, because (i) the public are denied the benefits which ordinarily result from the free play af competitive forces, and (ii) retail prices are recommended on the basis of fixed percentage gross profit margins which are capable of yielding excessive profits, since the profit margins are related to selling prices of which taxation forms an important constituent;</P>
    <P>(d)  it is not compatible with the public interest that retail prices in the licensed trade should be influenced by the collective action of members of associations whose primary interest is their own welfare rather than the promotion of the public good.</P>
    <P>The Commission recommended&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  That the practice whereby associations representing the licensed trade issue lists of recommended prices should cease.</P>
    <P>The Commission did not see any reason why matters affecting costs or prices should not be discussed at meetings of such associations, but they do think that no recommendations should be made, pressure exercised, or guidance in any form given by retail organisations in regard to the prices to be charged for intoxicating liquor or soft drinks.</P>
    <P>(2)  That an Order should be made under the Restrictive Trade Practices Acts making it unlawful for retail trade associations or groups <Col N="447" /> of licensed traders (a) to make any collective decisions, recommendations or proposals in regard to the selling prices to be adopted for intoxicating liquor or soft drinks, and (b) to prepare, publish, issue or advertise retail price lists or circulars or other communications (whether oral or written) indicating or recommending alterations in retail prices by reference to existing lists or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I accepted the Recommendations of the Commission and made the Restrictive Trade Practices (Intoxicating Liquor and Non-alcoholic Beverages) Order, 1965.  The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, provides that an Order of this kind shall not have effect unless it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  The Bill now before the Seanad is the confirming Bill which is necessary to give force of law to the Order.  With Bills of this kind, the arrangement is that the Order which it is proposed to confirm should not be subject to amendment by the Oireachtas but should be accepted or rejected as it stands.  The matters with which the Order deals have been the subject of a detailed public inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission and their report sets out the arguments in favour of adopting the provisions embodied in the Order.  I can, therefore, recommend the confirmation Bill to the Seanad without reservation.  Its enactment should result in the development of competition which should tend to produce more diversified prices at a generally lower level than under the present system, with consequent benefits to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that anything which will reduce the price of drink would be generally acceptable to Members of the House but it seems to me a strange order of priorities which the Minister and the Government have.  This is a measure to deal with restrictive practices in relation to what is a luxury rather than in relation to restrictive practices in connection with the sale of food, essential clothing and other more important and essential items which members of the public have to <Col N="448" /> buy every day.  However, in so far as it goes and in so far as it is an indication by the Government of an interest in the matter of lowering prices and keeping prices down, we should accept the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would have thought that the Minister might, in introducing the Bill, have given the House some idea as to the content in the price of spirits and beer taken up by excise duty, turnover tax, by profits and, then, by the actual cost to the retailer.  The price of drink has risen very sharply over the last number of years.  I remember when I came to Dublin in 1945 the price of a half-one was 1/-.  Frankly, I do not know what the price of a half-one is now because prices vary so much and, indeed, that is one of the difficulties which face members of the public.  I do not know what is the price of a half glass of whiskey, the price of a half glass of brandy&mdash;there are so many different brands&mdash;or the price of stout because they vary so much.  I think it was because of this variety of prices the Minister lost a good deal of the goodwill in the licensed trade&mdash;that the price of drinks should be reduced by the same amount in each case, irrespective of what the publican had been selling drinks at up to that time.  However, it would be interesting to get some of these facts because members of the public would like to know, in fact, who has the big share out of the price of a glass of whiskey or out of the pint of beer.  It seems to me that this is a useful measure as far as it goes but I do not think it will be a very profitable measure from the point of view of the drinking public.</P>
      <P>I observe the Minister says the arrangement is&mdash;I take it that is under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act&mdash; that this Order of his is not subject to amendment.  It seems to me that this Order can be got around by a new development which is taking place in the retail trade, both in grocery and in the licensed grocers' business.  Part 2 of the Order which we are confirming by this Bill provides that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A retail trade association shall not, either alone or with another or other trade associations, decide, recommend <Col N="449" /> to retailers for adoption, or propose for adoption by retailers, the retail selling price of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  intoxicating liquor, or</P>
    <P>(b)  non-alcoholic beverages sold in or from bottles or cans.</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to say:</P>
    <P>A group of persons (other than persons who are members or officers of the same firm or company) ...shall not make any collective decision, recommendation or proposal relating to the retail selling price of such liquor or beverages.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, from watching television and the way I see things developing, there is now a new situation which can become in fact as impeachable to free trade among retailers as these trade associations fixing prices. There is a large area of traders; certainly in the grocery trade, and I am sure it can apply in the licensed trade. It can apply in the licensed grocers' end of the business who are collectively buying in bulk.  They are the equivalent of a trade association but they can certainly call themselves a firm.  They can say: &ldquo;We are a partnership, we are buying in bulk&rdquo; and they can fix retail prices under this Order.  It seems to me that this Order is quite defective in that respect; that they can call themselves a firm&mdash;a firm is not a limited company, it does not even have to be a partnership.  One sees these&mdash;the shop with the VG sign, the MACE sign and so on&mdash;people like that; they are all a big number of traders and they can call themselves&mdash;the VG firm, the MACE firm or whatever their name is, they can fix the retail prices under this Order and that is the end of this Order. They can do effectively what the trade associations are being prohibited from doing under this particular Order.</P>
    <P>If there were an opportunity of amending the Order I think that the word &ldquo;firm&rdquo; should be omitted.  In any event it seems to me that even with this particular Order there is now so much bulk buying going on and so many of the large supermarkets have taken over a number of the smaller traders that a large volume of the trade hitherto being done by numerous small traders is being done <Col N="450" /> now by these firms who have taken over smaller firms and who, in fact, are doing away with the business shops in small towns.</P>
    <P>Recently one of these big supermarkets was established in a town in Mayo.  The Government should look into this aspect of the situation.  Wholesale fraud is being practised by these supermarkets.  I saw that the Minister, or someone from the Government side, said in the Dáil that they are bound to sell butter in standard packets of 1 lb.  That is supposed to be the position but the people are being hoodwinked. Butter is being sold in packets which contain 14 ozs.  It sells at 8d cheaper than 16 oz. packets of butter in these establishments.  Unfortunately, the public are being deluded into thinking they are getting value.</P>
    <P>This is all worked out by psychologists and salesmen.  The whole purpose of the big combines is to extract money in increasing amounts from the consuming public.  Fraud is being practised on a grand scale.  It is all worked out carefully by the advisers of these great firms for the purpose of deceiving the public, and the public are getting no protection from the Minister or anyone else.  There is a great conspiracy on the part of these organised big businesses to extract the maximum amount of money from the public. There is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>I am told that in relation to certain commodities you will not find the same price on a particular item for three months running.  The practice is to create confusion in the mind of the public so that they will not know what the price is.  If they go to another shop the price is different. The prices are constantly changing. All this ringing of the changes is worked out by psychologists and by men who understand how to work upon the mind of the public.  I should like to see these malpractices being dealt with, but this Bill is only a patch or a small improvement in relation to what is a luxury item, intoxicating liquor.  This will make no impression upon the amount of money spent by any family in any week, in any month, or over any period of time.  I urge the Minister <Col N="451" /> now to look into the fraud that is being perpetrated most skilfully by the big supermarkets and to take stock of the situation.  Perhaps I have wandered somewhat from the terms of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will take note of what I believe to be a situation of growing importance, and a situation that is becoming more serious with the passage of time.</P>
      <P>I do not understand how the licensed business works but it seems extraordinary to me that you can buy a bottle of gin for 35/10d in one shop, while it costs you 40/- in another shop.  I am speaking of good Cork gin.  The person selling it at 35/10d must surely be making a profit, but if there is that disparity in the retail price surely someone is making an excessive profit at some stage.  Gin is sold at considerably higher prices in licensed grocers.  All this adds up to the fact that inordinate profits are being made in some sectors.  This Bill is an earnest of the Government's desire to achieve a reduction in prices, but I do not really think it will get to the root of the problem.  Competition is becoming less and less in the retail trade, as more and more small firms get together in these loose associations, and as bigger supermarkets intervene. These are matters which require the attention of the Minister and the sooner they get it the better.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, our thanks are due to the Fair Trade Commission who, apparently, ran into difficulties, if my recollection of their proceedings is correct, in trying to get to the root of this problem.  They deserve our thanks. I believe the House should have little difficulty in accepting this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill. It simply confirms an Order already made by the Minister under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953. The Minister has said that following the Budget the price of drink was increased by twice the increase in <Col N="452" /> taxation provided in the Budget.  I was puzzled as to why there should have been an increase at all.  I thought that price control governed the situation, and that no group of people like this were free to adjust their prices as they willed.  They did so, to my mind, in contravention of the legislation then in operation.  Apparently they got away with it for a time, and then they were compelled, as a result of an Order made by the Minister, to reduce their prices somewhat.</P>
      <P>The effect of this is to prevent trade associations from entering into a conspiracy, if that is the word, to regulate their minimum prices.  The Order is now in operation but I am not conscious of the fact that there has been any great decrease in the price of drink. The other night I was charged 1/7d for a bottle of stout, which seemed to me to be an exorbitant price.  In spite of this restrictive Order by the Minister, that was the price.  Incidentally, I should say I did not simply go to the counter and purchase one bottle of stout.  It was easy to make the calculation, and it was confirmed later in the course of the rounds that this bar was charging 1/7d for each bottle of stout.  That was an exorbitant price to my mind.</P>
      <P>While I welcome this Bill, and the Order made by the Minister and now confirmed by this Bill, I do not think it has had a proper effect in regard to the price of drink.  I hope the Minister will keep his eye on this problem and do what he can to prevent profiteering on this source of nourishment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission's Report lays great stress on the attitude of the trade associations towards gross profits on selling prices.  As the Minister has pointed out today in introducing the Bill, in some cases it was suggested that their profit on the duty was actually greater than the profit which they were earning on the commodity itself, on the basis that their profit was on the selling price.  I had an impression&mdash;I discussed this with a member of the licensed trade from my school days&mdash;that profit was always calculated on the buying price, that you got the difference between what you bought <Col N="453" /> the article at and what you sold it at and you then calculated that as a percentage of what you bought it for. Therefore, there would always be a substantial difference.  Apparently the attitude of the trading associations in this case is that their profit is always calculated as a fixed profit of their selling price.  Therefore, it was timely, having regard to the increases imposed on liquor in successive Budgets, that this Bill should be introduced.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I should like to join with the other speakers in expressing a certain anxiety.  My own personal experience has been that price lists on display can, in fact, operate as a protection to the consumer.  I am speaking of the licensed trade particularly.  At least I know that I will be charged what I see on the price list displayed behind the counter.  I think the experience of most publicans is that where such a list is on display the general level of prices is somewhat lower than where no list is on display.  My anxiety would be something similar to that of Senator Murphy.  One may enter a rather more lavish establishment to find there is no limit with regard to the prices which one may be asked to pay.  I have not seen any price list displayed in such establishments, either before this Bill was mooted or subsequently.</P>
      <P>That is my greatest anxiety with regard to this matter.  When displayed in the smaller country public houses price lists generally indicated the price I would be asked to pay.  In most cases I did not find the prices exorbitant. While I agree with the purpose of the Order and the Bill in restricting the amount of gross profit that can be charged, I express a certain amount of reservation in relation to the disappearance of price lists.  Those price lists acted as a safeguard.</P>

      <P>I think everybody is agreed that you have a great range of commodities that are daily required by the public at large.  Therefore, there would seem to be a necessity for some restriction on price movements.  As Senator O'Quigley has said everybody knows that in relation to a wide range of foodstuffs all kinds of malpractices are being employed for getting greater profit.  The reason for this is that over this whole range there is no set standard with regard to quantity or quality.  Tins and packages are offered to the public without any indication as to the weight or the type of product involved.  A general indication is given of the type of product but there is no indication of the weight.  If I wanted to look for some sector that I could go into and regulate I would have gone into the licensed trade because in that trade retail is by imperial measure, which is a statutory measure controlled by law.  The strength of the spirit is also governed by law and it has to be printed on the bottle.  Both the strength and the type of spirit contained in the bottle must be printed on the outside. You have a definite standard of both measurement and quality over that whole range.</P>
      <P>The idea that members of the licensed trade have been making an exorbitant profit is complete and absolute nonsense.  Everybody knows that in this country up to 15 years ago the standard in public houses was the lowest possibly in Europe because during the depressed times competition was so keen that no publican could invest a penny out of his earned profit to improve his business or make it more attractive for customers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at the moment anyway.  It is well known that the people who do the best business at the moment in the licensed trade are those who have spent a considerable <Col N="455" /> amount of money in providing new and better facilities and amenities for the customers.  The people who find themselves on the lower price structure are gradually going out of business.  This is happening because they did not do up their premises.  Perhaps they were unable to do so because of lack of capital.  It is very difficult for some people to be able to put in new carpets and armchairs and such like.  The only people who are on the lower price level are the people who could not do up their premises because they had not the capital to do so.  Everybody who goes down the country can see dowdy public houses scattered all around.  I know there are at the moment considerable malpractices at the higher level because price control has not reacted on those more sumptuous places.  It has reacted very severely on the lower level premises.</P>
      <P>The standardisation order had one good effect.  It stabilised prices.  If the publican in the lower price bracket could get sufficient capital to improve his premises to put it in line with the higher bracket premises he would be got at under the stabilisation order. If he spent a certain amount of money in doing up his premises he could increase his prices like the others.  It is a complete fabrication to say that there was gross profiteering throughout the licensed trade.  I am prepared to go along with this Bill but I should like to see it applied to a much wider sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to come from behind the counter as well and say a few words on this subject. There was reference made to the importance of the fixed gross profit margin.  Senator O'Kennedy mentioned it a few moments ago as well.  It is wrong to consider the gross profit in the licensed trade, particularly in rural Ireland, when one considers that the turnover in most publichouses is very small and that while the gross profit may be large, the net profit will naturally be smaller and that the expenses of an estabishment can be very high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that in many publichouses <Col N="456" /> throughout Ireland the average weekly takings do not exceed £100. There could be a gross profit of £30 to £35 but the net profit would be as low as £12 to £15.  I should much prefer to see the emphasis laid not on the gross profit but on the net profit.  I do not understand the objection to the printing of price lists.  I have no price list on display, I never had one, but I feel it is a protection for the customer who would then know what price he should be charged and whether a barman was overcharging on his own initiative.</P>
    <P>One can go into a shop and see the price of goods displayed&mdash;it could be a hardware or furniture shop or a grocery store&mdash;but it is being made wrong for a publican to display the price of his goods.  One can come across the situation where one publican charges 2/6 for a half one, another charges 2/7 and another 2/8. I suggest there should be uniformity and in order to have it a price list should be put on display.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators have drifted from the subject matter of the Order.  Confusion may have arisen because Senator Murphy asked how prices were increased when legislation prevented it.  That is not so.  At the time of the Budget, on May 12th last year, the amendment to the Prices Act had not been introduced.  That came in July.  At the time of the Budget, the only power available to me was the power of the Fair Trade Commission to investigate.  Senators will know that the philosophy of price control as far as the Government are concerned has always been that there should be free and fair competition, that the best form of price control is competition.  The activities of the Fair Trade Commission were calculated to ensure such free competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of the Budget of 1965, the only power available to me was the power to have the Fair Trade Commission investigate whether there were restrictive practices restricting competition. By the time the Commission reported, however, we had amended the Prices Act and I had new powers, <Col N="457" /> among them being one to fix prices. While the main result of the Fair Trade Commission's investigation was a recommendation to have an Order made against these price lists or circulars being issued by associations, paragraph 86 of the Report suggested to me that I should take action against the increase in price which had taken place before I had the power.</P>
    <P>I made another Order, as distinct from the Fair Trade Commission Order, not attempting to make level prices or to make all establishments charge the same but to stop the increase that had been put on.  The Order was on the basis of what the price had been before the Budget, plus whatever revenue was put on by the Budget.  I did not attempt in that Order to have equality of prices.  I do not think Senators should expect lavish premises to have cheap drink.  If one wants a carpet with a pile up to one's ankles, soft lights and sweet music, one must pay for it.  It is only right that people who want luxurious surroundings should pay for them.</P>

      <P>I doubt it.  A price list can be made by the owner of a firm &mdash;his own price list.  What the Fair Trade Commission recommended to me was that I should make an Order preventing associations coming together to make price lists up to which everybody in the trade would have to charge. One point raised was that this Order reflected a Government order of priorities and that this was not commonsense. The Order does not at all determine an order of priorities.  The Report of the Fair Trade Commission has an appendix showing the legislation already enacted to confirm Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It includes the Restrictive Trade Practices (Radios) Order, 1955, the Restrictive Trade Practices (Materials) Order, 1955, the Restrictive Trade Practices (Motor Cars) Order, 1956, the Restrictive Trade Practices (Groceries) Order, 1956 (Amendment) Order, 1958, the Restrictive Trade Practices (Carpets) Order, 1960, the Restrictive Trade Practices (Motor Spirits and Motor Vehicle Lubricating Oils) Order, 1961, <Col N="458" /> and the amendment of that in 1962, the Restrictive Trade Practices (Cookers and Ranges) Order, 1962, and the Restrictive Trade Practices (Handknitting Yarns) Order, 1962.  It would be wrong to assume this is the first Order made under the legislation or to say it reflects the Government's order of priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We should think of this as an attempt by the Fair Trade Commission to create competition.  Since I got further powers I made an Order in October last requiring three months notification of any increase in price and it covers a very wide range of commodities. Prices have held stable since that time.  As well, there have been prices advisory bodies in action and at the moment one of them is examining the price of liquor at the request of those who produce it.</P>
      <P>The question of bulk buying was raised and it was suggested that those who buy in bulk could call themselves a firm and thus evade this Order.  Bulk buying by grocers, for instance, is for the benefit of customers.  It helps the grocers to compete with the new supermarket organisations.  It is not true to say they can call themselves a firm because they combine only to buy but they retail as individuals.</P>
      <P>The wider idea of consumer protection was raised and it was said there is widespread fraud on the customers. As I have indicated, consumer protection is a very wide field and while I appreciate the need for some consumer protection, I have told the Dáil that with the staff now available to me this is not high among the priorities of our activities.  There is protection in so far as an article which is marked at a certain weight must scale that weight.  The further protection Senators were thinking of was that articles which appeared to be a certain weight should have the weight stamped on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main proposals of this Bill are, firstly, to provide for the establishment and administration by An Foras Tionscal of industrial estates, with factory premises for renting, in development centres and, secondly, to continue in operation for a further period the scheme of enlargement and adaptation grants to assist industrial undertakings in preparing for free trade conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> With regard to industrial estates, Senators will have seen the Report of the Committee on Development Centres and Industrial Estates and the statement of policy indicating the Government's attitude to the proposals in the Report.  For the convenience of Senators I might recall that it is the intention on completion of the regional surveys being undertaken by the Minister for Local Government to identify development centres in each region.  Meanwhile, it is proposed to proceed with the development of industrial estates at Waterford and Galway. The necessary powers to enable An Foras Tionscal to establish and administer industrial estates are contained in section 4 of the Bill and there is nothing in this provision to restrict the location of industrial estates to particular areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that the identification of development centres and the setting up of industrial estates is not intended to involve the discouragement of industrial development at other locations.  The Government have already indicated in the policy statement to which I have referred that the dispersal of industrial activity throughout the country, where this is economically feasible, yields important social advantages, and that, in the administration of the industrial grants scheme, the location of industries in other centres will be encouraged. It is confidently expected, however, that the development of industrial estates will attract thereto industries which might not be located in Ireland at all but for the facilities offered at these estates.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed in the Bill that An Foras Tionscal should be empowered to make available, at reduced rents, factory premises situated in industrial estates administered by An Foras Tionscal and also to make grants available towards the reduction of rents for factory premises situated in what may be termed private industrial estates.  This power is inherent in the provisions of section 4 of the Bill in relation to estates administered by An Foras Tionscal and a specific provision is made in section 9 in relation to estates in the other category. <Col N="462" /> Where factories are made available at reduced rents it is the intention that the reduction in rent would not be more advantageous to the industrialist than the equivalent grant which could be given under the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>Senators will, I am sure, agree that the industrial grants scheme which has been in operation for a considerable time and under which assistance is provided in appropriate cases to industrialists who build their own factories, has been an important factor in the progress so far achieved in industrial development.  I am satisfied that the provision of factories on industrial estates at attractive rents will represent a significant extension of the range of incentives available for industrial development and, therefore, should stimulate activity among industrialists contemplating industrial projects that are suitable for location in an industrial estate.</P>
    <P>Under the existing legislation the aggregate maximum expenditure provided for in relation to grants which the Minister for Industry and Commerce may make to An Foras Tionscal is £30 million.  It is not proposed to increase this amount, at least for the time being.  Section 3 of the Bill proposes, however, to increase from £20 million to £30 million the aggregate amount of grants An Foras Tionscal may make for industrial development. The provision for grants made by An Foras Tionscal will thus be brought into line with the provision for grants made to An Foras Tionscal by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed, in section 5 of the Bill, that An Foras Tionscal should be empowered to recruit staff for the administration of industrial estates.  As the type of work involved will be more akin to commercial activities than normal Civil Service procedures it is desirable that An Foras Tionscal should have this power so as to ensure flexibility in staffing arrangements both in the administrative and technical spheres.</P>
    <P>The legislation which enabled An Foras Tionscal to assist firms by way of special grants, not exceeding 25 per <Col N="463" /> cent of cost, expired on the 31st March, 1966.  The Government feel that if the impetus towards adaptation which has been generated is to be maintained and strengthened the continuation of the grants scheme is necessary and one of the purposes of this Bill is to extend the operation of the scheme to the 31st December, 1967, as provided for in section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In March last I had the &ldquo;Report of the Progress of Industrial Adaptation&rdquo; prepared and presented to the House.  Senators will have seen from this report the steps which have been taken to prepare industry to meet the challenge of freer trade.  As the report also indicates the work of industrial adaptation is by no means complete. However the failure of some firms to make use of the assistance provided and the lack of progress in certain directions mentioned in the report may be due to the uncertainty that had obtained regarding our future trading relations.  With the signing of the Free Trade Area Agreement this uncertainty has been largely dispelled and it is to be expected that more firms will urgently carry out the necessary measures of adaptation.</P>
    <P>As is indicated in the report, up to 31st December, 1965, some 600 firms had formulated adaptation proposals representing a capital investment of over £55 million.  Adaptation Councils for the various industries have been applying themselves to the solution of the problems highlighted in the reports of the Committee on Industrial Organisation.  Some councils have achieved fairly satisfactory results.  Others have not as yet made any real impact on some of the wider aspects of adaptation, such as joint marketing, exporting, training etc, which involve co-operative effort between individual firms in the same industry or in related industries.  There is an urgent need for a great burst of activity in those aspects of adaptation&mdash;equally urgent, as I have said before in another place, with the need for further progress in physical adaptation by way of installation of <Col N="464" /> new and modern equipment, expansion of buildings and improvement in techniques.  I am confident that the desired progress will be made as I think industry is now far more aware of the need for adapatation measures than it was when the legislation was first introduced.  This is, of course, only to be expected.  The conclusion of the trade agreement with Britain brings us to the threshold of free trade and it is only the most ostrich-like mentality that could in the present circumstances ignore the need for radical changes in all aspects of industry. Evidence of the new and more realistic outlook is afforded by a sharp increase in the number of applications for special grants received in the quarter ended 31st March, 1966.</P>
    <P>There is still a great deal of adaptation work to be done.  Even though quite an amount has been achieved we must continue to build on this.  Action cannot now be postponed.  Now is the time for an all-out effort to ensure what still remains to be done will be tackled with energy and completed with speed.  Section 2 of the Bill provides one of the means of continuing to assist those industries which are willing to prepare themselves to make proper provisions for the future.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>Ten per cent of the way.  I have no hesitation in welcoming this Bill both because of the technical increase in the provision for grants, the extension of the period for adaptation grants, and this new development of industrial estates. When industrial grants were introduced originally they were introduced with a view to spreading industrial development more evenly, particularly to the west of the country.  This was a reasonable idea at the time but whether because of the general stagnation of the economy at that time or because the grant provisions were inadequate, this early measure proved almost totally ineffective, and in five years the total of grant commitments amounted to less than £400,000 representing a total investment of less £1 million and giving at best 200 low-grade, low-paid jobs a year in small and not very stable industries in the west.  During this period, as an examination of the statistics of industrial output by counties shows, the decline in the relative amount of industrial activity in the west as compared with the rest of the country continued unabated. It was at the end of this period that the legislation was extended to take in the whole country and the philosophy of industrial grants was changed from one of diversion to one of the creation of employment and the attraction of industry.  Though the original provision made in the eastern part of the country was rather limited the subsequent increase in aids and in grants generally began to yield a good return in the late 50s and particularly in the 60s.  I think there is no doubt but that these grants make a most effective contribution to the expansion of employment.  It may be an inadequate contribution, and it is in fact, as I shall mention later on, quite inadequate to what we require, but it does involve the creation of new employment of a kind that would not otherwise be created, and the grants have proved effective in this way. Again, because of deficiencies which <Col N="466" /> I shall mention later, we have not got adequate information to test the return we got on those grants but from the inadequate information there are strong indications that the effects on the creation of employment and continuing output are considerably greater than in other fields, and certainly greater than from investment in agriculture which has produced consistently such poor returns in increased growth of output over the years, and probably up to the level of what we get from investment in tourism and certainly greater than from investment in other activities.</P>
      <P>In a developing country the attraction of outside industry by industrial grants and the encouragement of development of domestic industries are both essential if such a country is to solve the problems of economic development.  In three ways these grants make a contribution.  The first is that we do not have in this country, or have not had hitherto in any event, anything like sufficient volume of entrepreneurial ability and enterprise in the public and private sectors together to add up to the volume of enterprise required to create new activities that would provide employment at the level which we need.</P>
      <P>Secondly, and this is greatly underestimated by many people, we do not have in our domestic firms and much less in our State enterprises the kind of market know-how and control of market access which is so vital.  There is a very wide range of modern products whose development and sale is a highly expert business, often controlled by relatively few firms throughout the world.  No small firm certainly, and not even many among the large firms, can readily break into that business.  The only way in which Irish products of this kind can find their place in the markets of the world is if one of these large firms establishes itself in this country, and to gain that kind of market access we have to attract foreign firms to this country and accept and welcome them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, and this is a more recent development, we need capital.  Up to a couple of years ago this was not a <Col N="467" /> primary concern, we had adequate capital for the limited amount of enterprise available, but more recently for various reasons capital has not been available and from now on it will not be readily available, and therefore we require foreign capital to supplement our own financial resources.  For this reason a grant which attracts foreign industry is of great importance.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that some people tend to take a negative attitude to the whole idea of industrialisation, which tends to be subjected to unfair and unwise criticism, more particularly the idea of industrialisation with the aid of foreign enterprise.  This type of xenophobia is not only out of date, it is dangerous. Foreign enterprise comes to countries which welcome it and in which the atmosphere is one favourable to foreign enterprise. Those who criticise the idea of foreign enterprise and who oppose measures to attract it, in a country where we are only providing a fraction of the new jobs required each year for our people, are not doing good work for our country.</P>

      <P>When this debate was adjourned on 12th May last, I was referring to what Senator Alton had said on capitation, as opposed to fee for service, basis for payment for general practitioners.  He, of course, favoured the fee for service basis, and certainly came out of his corner fighting, on this round anyway.  I am not going to argue with him.  I want the issue to be the subject of cold appraisal, not hot war.  I think Senator Alton would <Col N="468" /> have done a much greater service had he allowed discussions to take place between me and the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union as they have been taking place&mdash;and I have promised to continue these discussions&mdash;rather than coming out so specifically on one side, namely, fee for service.  I may as well say it, I think it was most unfair.  I do not think that was the time to do that. There are other criticisms of the health services and the White Paper which could have been made without going into this in such detail.  I am quite aware of my responsibilities and my first consideration is always the patient.</P>

      <P>I do not think this is the place to have taken&mdash;well, I had better leave it at that.  In the Dáil, I made it clear that I did not nail my colours to the mast on this issue of payments, and that references in the White Paper to capitation being considered the most practical system did not mean, and does not mean, that the Government will consider no other method of payment.  There seems to be&mdash;I might as well say it&mdash;a lobby working among the medical profession&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;about a certain method of payment.  This will not influence me in the slightest.  I shall advise the Government on the best method, as I see it, in the interests of the country, within the capacity of the country to pay and in accordance with justice, but I shall not be blackmailed into coming down on any particular side, and if the doctors are trying to influence me unduly, and trying to work up a hysterical lobby, they are dealing with the wrong man on this occasion.  I can tell them that much.  They will not frighten me with some of the threats I have heard and some of the methods which are being adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> I have had the happiest relations with the Irish Medical Association and with the Medical Union since I became Minister for Health.  I have the greatest respect for them.  I have got good co-operation from them; but if there are individual members of those bodies who are acting in this manner, the sooner they cop on to themselves the better.  They are not going to bully me.  I intend to see that the health services of this country, the improvements initiated by Senator Dr. Jim Ryan in the Act of 1947, the subsequent Act of 1953 and now the Bill I shall bring in in November next, will work.  I realise it is only with co-operation from all parties they can work.</P>
    <P>I am willing to sit down and discuss round a table any of the peculiarities or problems which exist, or which certain sections of the community&mdash; bodies, representatives or individuals &mdash;might think constitute an injustice. I do not want to use the big stick. I do not want to bring in legislation which, (a), will not work or (b), if it does work would constitute a hardship on anyone.  This is not the spirit in which we want to get things done.  I have a personal preference&mdash;and I want to repeat it is mine and that I am not a puppet of my Department in this, as evidently Senator Alton tried to imply &mdash;in favour of a capitation system, based not on a slavish imitation of Britain but on considerations arising from our own particular scheme.</P>
    <P>I might say, in this connection, that we have heard here and in the Dáil people saying what takes place in Australia, New Zealand, the Scandinavian countries, Italy, France, Germany and Britain.  This is all most interesting.  We also have studied all those things.  We can learn a lot too from them but there are problems peculiar to this country. The solution of those problems in other countries would not be appropriate for the solution of them here, just as the health services in Ireland, no matter what way we improve them, just would not work in other countries. I want, also, to say that we have learned an awful lot from what has happened in Great Britain as to the <Col N="470" /> pitfalls into which we could fall were it not for the experience gained there.</P>
    <P>The White Paper proposes a general practitioner service without charge on the patient for a section of the population. In principle, this is quite different from any scheme in the northern European countries mentioned by Senator Alton.</P>
    <P>Senator Alton went into the position in Britain in great detail and he inferred I had given incomplete information to the Dáil on this.  I cannot see, having listened to him, with all his inside knowledge of the working of the British Medical Association, that he produced evidence to show I was misleading in what I said in the Dáil.  I cannot see that I was, and had I been, I should immediately have admitted my mistake and taken an opportunity of correcting it.  I read what he said very carefully and I read what I said in the Dáil very carefully and I find I do not have to change a comma.</P>
    <P>Senator Alton quoted some references from the British Medical Journal to show the doctors in Britain are not satisfied with how much they are being paid and have been paid in recent years.  Anyone who reads the report of his statement will find that the Senator has not produced evidence that a majority of the doctors working under the British National Health Service want a fee for service basis.  I think the records show that agitation among doctors in Britain has been mainly against the particular form of the capitation system which they have had there.  Under that system a pool of remuneration was established and what went into it was calculated by multiplying the number of participating doctors by a fixed average income per doctor.  The distribution of money from this fixed pool did not meet with the satisfaction of the medical profession and one reason was that no doctor could increase his income from it without reducing the amount available for other doctors.</P>
    <P>I note that the British Government have agreed to abolish this pool system but they have not agreed that fee for service should be substituted for it as the principal way for paying <Col N="471" /> general practitioners.  The review body on doctors' and dentists' remuneration in Britain this month issued a report recommending a certain system.  The report has yet to be voted on by the medical profession but the fact that this new system of payment was, by agreement, referred for pricing to the review body is a good pointer that the majority of the British doctors are willing to continue with capitation as the basic system of payment.</P>
    <P>Senator Alton mentioned that under the new arrangements in Britain there will be supplemental payments on a fee for service system for certain items. I do not rule out something similar here.  I am quite ready to discuss this with the medical organisations, as indeed I am ready to discuss all their ideas on remuneration.  At present, this detailed discussion on methods of payment can more appropriately take place, and continue to take place, between the medical profession and myself rather than in a debate here in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear, in case anyone might think otherwise, that I have never suggested that what we want in Ireland is a capitation system on the old British model with a limited pool related to the number of participating doctors.  Finally, on this issue I should like to appeal to Senator Alton and to other doctors not to close their minds on this issue before our negotiations have got under way, so to speak.  I am afraid that in this respect I must say that openmindedness has not been encouraged by a recently conducted poll on methods of payment.  The Seanad have probably seen the results of this poll as published in a periodical called <i>Pulse International</i>, dated 12th May last, under the banner headline: &ldquo;Sorry, Mr. O'Malley, but 98 per cent say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to capitation&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The poll which got this great publicity is called the Pulse Survey of Medical Practitioners.  In fact, the poll was based on a questionnaire filled in by only 457 of the 2,952 doctors in the country.  One hundred of the 457 were specialists so that only 357 general practitioners completed the questionnaire.  Do these 357 make up a representative statistical sample of the Irish general practitioners?  Does this justify the banner headline: &ldquo;Sorry, Mr. O'Malley, but 98 per cent say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to capitation&rdquo;?  If, as is very likely, those surveyed are all devoted readers of <i>Pulse International</i>&mdash;since readers of that journal are continuously subjected to pressure by articles from anonymous contributors favouring fee for service&mdash;the validity of the survey's findings is open to question.  It is a pity this kind of pressurising should be going on in advance of negotiations. I hope the majority of Irish doctors will not be influenced by the publicity given to it&mdash;that they will study the matter in a dispassionate, unbiassed, unprejudiced manner without prejudging the issues involved.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to some of the other points made by Senator Alton.  He suggested that instead of giving relief in the purchase of drugs to the middle income group when private expenditure has exceeded a certain sum &mdash;as set out in paragraph 55 of the White Paper&mdash;relief should be given when private expenditure on drugs had exceeded a fixed proportion of the person's income.  I see merit in that; but I see, too, that it would be a very difficult system to administer. If the fixed sum mentioned in the White Paper is not too high&mdash;I do not intend it to be&mdash;there should be no hardship on any member of the middle income group in the application of the idea, which has the merit of simplicity. I am not binding myself to this but it is only fair that I should say in a detailed way what I have in mind as far as assistance for the middle income group towards drug supplies is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> As a result of the recent Health and Mental Treatment (Amendment) Act, those with an income of £1,200 a year and under qualify for hospital services. It is interesting, and Senator McQuillan will notice this, that the old system for calculating income has gone.  No longer is the family income pooled.  Now it is only the individual's income or the income of the man and his spouse that is taken into consideration. Those with an income of £1,200 a year and under, whom we would regard as the lower and middle income group, represent about 92 per cent of the population.  They are entitled therefore at the present time to the benefits of the Health Act briefly as follows.  The lower income group are entitled to free public bed hospital services.  The middle income group can be charged up to, and not more than 10/- per day for such services. They have to pay their own general practitioner.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper, of course, we propose to continue the hospital charge of up to 10/- per day.  In actual fact 60 per cent of the population are paying nothing for these hospital charges which is absolutely ridiculous. We have to draw the line somewhere. The maximum charge of 10/- per day cannot be said to be a hardship and it has been in operation for quite a while.  One would not live at home on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator could be correct because different local authorities had different scales.  You could, for instance, get some genius of a county manager who in his wisdom refused medical cards to old age pensioners. <Col N="474" /> Fortunately, the vast majority of these people act in a Christian way.  But, when you have exceptions like I speak of, you have to study the position closely.  And as I said in the Dáil, we propose to get into every house in the country a document in simple ordinary parlance telling each individual what he or she is entitled to.  The big expense in the middle income group, therefore, as far as my experience goes and as people on both sides of the House have agreed, is the cost of drugs and medicines.  This is the crippler.  It can be a continuing cost; it can go on for a long period and it is here we propose to give assistance.</P>
      <P>Let me say, without binding the Government, the Minister for Finance or myself, what I have in mind, what I hope to achieve.  Some medical preparations cost a lot of money.  Supposing, for the sake of argument, a person has to pay out of his own pocket say, £3 a week for drugs and this looked like being the demand on his resources for some time ahead, and such a demand was not within those resources to bear, this is where I propose that the health authority would come in and meet say half the cost in excess of an agreed sum.</P>
      <P>It could happen that the cost of medicine would be as high as 10-12 guineas a week.  Half the excess over the agreed sum could in that case still be a hardship.  To cover such a case, it would be only reasonable to invoke a hardship clause which will still be preserved and so give greater assistance. What I want to do is to prescribe a standard of assistance which will be available to everybody and to leave as an option to the different health authorities only the extent of the additional assistance which they will give in hardship cases.  We will set out the basic standard in black and white and it will be the exact same for a person in the city as in the remote parts of rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am referring to the points made by Senator Alton in, I trust, not a destructively critical manner.  I have already complimented Senator Alton on the tremendous research he put into the speech which he made here <Col N="475" /> on the 12th May.  It has been of great assistance to me.  I have read it assiduously and I have learned a lot from it.  There is a lot with which I do not agree, but I am grateful to him and if, at the outset, I spoke in a harsh manner about the method of payment to doctors, it was only because I wanted to make it clear that if he comes back on the same line again, I shall not hestitate to tell him that he is riding the wrong horse.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Alton mentioned a proposal for a national formulary.  He said, as far as I recollect, that he hoped that the body entrusted with the drawing up of the formulary should include practising doctors in general practice and in hospitals.  Yes, that is the intention. That will be done.  It is quite logical.</P>
      <P>Senator Alton said that 200,000 extra people have recently been made eligible for hospital services and that no compensation has been offered to the consultants.  This is not absolutely correct.  I do not suggest that Senator Alton is deliberately misleading the House.  There have been a number of full discussions with the medical organisations on this.  I told them that if it is shown that the consultants' income is materially affected by the change, I fully accept that they should be compensated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of people here do not know what I am talking about.  That is not strange as when I came into the Department of Health I was not too sure myself and indeed I am learning every day.  The health services of this country are a complex problem.  The point made by Senator Alton was that before I came along with the Health and Mental Treatment (Amendment) Act, 85 per cent of the population of this country were eligible for hospital and specialist services.  That is so. Senator Alton's point is that I have deprived the specialists, by increasing the eligibility limit from £800 to £1,200 a year etc. and that I have taken a percentage of the population, approximately seven per cent, away <Col N="476" /> from them.  I cannot at the moment appreciate his point fully but he will be replying shortly.  If the Houses of the Oireachtas pass an Act it does not mean people are going to get sick more frequently or less frequently. They will still continue to be ill and therefore they will be treated by doctors.  Someone, whether it is the specialists, who maintains that seven per cent has been taken from them, who are going to continue to treat the patients.  That is right, and they are going to be paid.</P>
    <P>I can see one thing, however, and I may as well be straight about it. A farmer comes up from the country and he is paying a doctor&mdash;it might not happen in Dublin, but in Limerick&mdash; and he will say to the specialist &ldquo;What do I owe you, doctor?&rdquo;  I suppose if it was a major operation it might be £50, and the farmer will take out a roll and peel off five £10 notes.  Let us be straight about this&mdash;is not the big nark of the specialists that I have stopped this source of ready cash on which they will not pay income tax while we are all caught?  Is not this the truth of the matter?  Is not this the big crib?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is a matter for the Chair, unless the Senator has ambitions in that direction. It could happen, too.  To get back to Senator Alton, there were some matters mentioned by the Senator in relation to the efficiency of hospitals so I must comment on them.  He seems to have gone out of his way to attempt to show that local authority general hospitals are inferior to the voluntary general hospitals.  I do not know why he is making this point.  As far as I am concerned all hospitals are contributing to the health service.  I think the voluntary hospitals of this country have done, and are doing, tremendous work, but I cannot see what is going to be achieved by comparisons which are unfair for obvious reasons.  Very many of the specialist staff of the local authority general hospitals are no less competent and no less conscientious than their professional colleagues in the voluntary hospitals, and I am sure they will not agree with the point put forward by Senator Alton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To prove his case that the voluntary <Col N="478" /> hospitals are more efficient than their local authority counterparts he quoted certain statistics about the length of stay of surgical patients in what he describes as his own hospital and what he describes as a regional hospital in Dublin.  If the comparison were valid there would be some point in it, but is it valid?  Do the surgical beds he mentioned&mdash;I presume it was the Mater&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, but in instances such as this where the Senator has chosen to compare one voluntary hospital with a local authority hospital, and when he says that the numbers are small in ENT in the Mater, nevertheless he will agree they affect the average when arriving at certain statistics.  In the regional hospital he refers to&mdash;I suspect it is Saint Kevin's&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, sir.  Anyway in Saint Kevin's is it not likely that it is necessary for social reasons to keep the patients longer in hospital than in the Mater?  That is not criticised, I trust.  Further, if patients already in Saint Kevin's for other than surgical reasons are admitted to the surgical unit for operation and there is not pressure on the surgical beds at the time, does it matter whether the patient is kept in the surgical unit instead of transferring him back to another part of the hospital?  Surely that is reasonable.</P>
      <P>As I said on the 12th May, I regard myself more as a willing listener to this debate and I do not think it appropriate that I should deal at length with the points made by all the Senators who have spoken on the Motion.  What they have said has been carefully noted and when I return to the Dáil with the Bill to implement the White Paper&mdash;I hope in November next&mdash;I am sure all those points will be debated in the detail appropriate to discussion on a Bill.  I think I should also say that both in the Dáil and in the Seanad I have heard some excellent constructive suggestions which I hope to incorporate in the new Health Bill when it comes before the Houses of the Oireachtas in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper itself&mdash;as I have said time and again&mdash;is not a bible, it is not anything hard and fast; it is just an indication of what the intentions of the Government are.  Having received very wide discussion by all interested parties, organisations, professional bodies, members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and members of health <Col N="480" /> authorities, I shall obviously make certain amendments and have certain improvements included in the Bill.  I think, too, that there is a lot of uninformed criticism by members of health authorities.  Some of them discussed the White Paper and they did not have it before them; this criticism must have been from what they read in the papers.  I propose, in September next, to visit every health authority in the country with my officials and answer any questions they may wish to put to us.  They may have problems unique to their own areas and there may be some proposals in the White Paper which would not be workable in their opinion.</P>
    <P>I would repeat one thing&mdash;that on the question of the abolition of the dispensary doctors I agree that there are areas in rural Ireland where something on the lines of the dispensary system must be preserved.  There could not be such a thing in those areas as choice of doctor.  It would not be feasible.  It is hard enough to get a dispensary doctor, God knows, in some of those places without talking about a choice of doctor.  We are also aware of the fact that to get a doctor in some of the isolated rural areas we will have to give them a very substantially increased subvention or bonus to live in those areas because after all a doctor, apart from his basic salary, is supposed to enjoy a private practice.  Naturally, if the population is sparse it is only fair that he would be given this consideration.</P>
    <P>Anyway I think the White Paper has been received very well generally by everyone.  People have to get in their little political digs and who said what on such and such an occasion. I forgive and overlook that.</P>

I might say I do not believe the Health Bill I will bring in in November next will be the be-all and end-all for health services in this country.  I do not know what is the matter with Senator O'Quigley; whether he does not want me to bring it in or whether&mdash;as has been said by some of his colleagues&mdash;he thinks this will never see the light of day; live horse and you will get grass; where will I get the money and so on.</P>

I was interrupted in my intention to conclude my remarks on the White Paper by saying that the health legislation we shall be bringing in, in November of this year, will not be <Col N="484" /> the be-all and the end-all.  Medicine, hospitals, hospital design, health services generally will improve as well as the standard of living of our people. Design of hospitals will change.  There will be new methods, new inventions, and new drugs on the horizon, such as those which have almost wiped out TB.  Although it is still quite a serious problem it is not anything like as intimidating as it was in the past, although I do not want to be complacent about it.</P>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that there will be further improvements in the years that lie ahead, and I am sure that whatever Minister for Health and whatever Government bring them in, they will all be advancements. I am grateful to the House.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to get annoyed with the Minister although he does not seem to have much difficulty in getting annoyed with some people.  He put on a great show of getting annoyed with Senator Alton early on in his speech.  Indeed, one might almost imagine that Senator Alton had signed the Presidential nomination papers of Deputy T.F. O'Higgins.  However, the Minister has given some indication of his interest in improving the health services of the country.  I suppose there are few more fertile fields in which any Minister can work than in the field of the health services.  I am not going into past history because I am concerned with the present and with improvements in the future.  Of course, it is quite true to say that the Fine Gael Party will not oppose the White Paper on the Health Services because everyone knows that half a loaf is better than no bread.  If the Minister offers us half a loaf, or even perhaps threequarters of a loaf, we are not the people to say no to that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It was there, and the Minister for Health who stared death in the eye for Ireland was so mesmerised by his former glories that, although he was Minister from 1957 to 1965, he did not adopt what had been put forward either by the Labour Party, by the Fine Gael Party or by both.

O'Higgins offered him the Fine Gael Party room to meet in.  Whether this is a product of the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party, makes no matter.  This health scheme was available to be introduced by the then Minister for Health seven or eight years ago.

      <P>That does not make any difference.  I do not mind whether the Minister called them pigs or said that they treated their patients like pigs.  It does not matter a damn to me.  The thing I am concerned with is either they were pigs in the way they behaved towards their patients or they treated their patients like pigs. The Minister can take his choice.  That remark is regarded as so scandalous that not one Irish paper published it. They felt if the Minister wanted to throw mud like that he could do it on television but they were not prepared to publish it.</P>
      <P>I now want to develop my argument. First of all, if the Minister is wrong in saying that five per cent of the dispensary doctors or the general practitioners in this country treat their patients like pigs, then it is a very wrong and a very serious thing that the Minister should say what is wrong, that is, five per cent of the doctors treat their patients like pigs.  If the Minister is right what is the Minister doing about it and what has the Minister done since he discovered this on taking up office?  I remember when three or four doctors in Galway were accused of charging fees when they were not entitled to charge fees.  That, of course, is quite wrong.  They should not do that.  The then Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee, held a public investigation that went on for days.  To me, charging fees is a matter of no account compared with treating patients like pigs.  The Minister has said that five per cent of the doctors were treating their patients like pigs.  If that is correct what has the Minister done about it?</P>

      <P>This is a good excuse for not introducing a Health Scheme.  The Government are short of money.  Because of that the Minister for Health cannot introduce his Health Scheme.  Therefore, his statement that five per cent of the doctors were treating their patients like pigs would create a row with the Medical Association and the Medical Union. He could say: &ldquo;What can I do? Look at those fellows.  How can I implement a Health Scheme with those fellows?&rdquo;  The Minister's remarks here today were directed towards the same end.  The Minister knows, even if he wanted to introduce a good Health Scheme, that there is not any money available at the present time to implement any of the proposals in the White Paper.  Having said all that, I want to commend the Minister for Health and the Government on the introduction of this White Paper.  The Minister has referred to the county managers continuously as geniuses. The Minister should get as wide a volume of opinion as possible as to what is the best way of producing good health services for this country so that when anybody comes from abroad we can say: &ldquo;This is the way we treat our old people; this is the way we treat our mentally handicapped people&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>When I proceeded to commend, as I wish to do again, the Minister and the Government for laying a White Paper before the Houses of the Oireachtas while speaking to a motion that welcomes the proposals in the White Paper, exception was taken to that course of action.  I think it is a good thing that proposals of this kind should be incorporated in a White Paper before being crystallised in the form of a Bill.  When a White Paper is laid before the Oireachtas it is open to debate and there is no <Col N="492" /> loss of face on the part of the Minister if he says: &ldquo;I have listened to the debate.  I do not think well of this proposal or that proposal.  Such and such a proposal would be better.  I think such and such a proposal is a good idea and shall incorporate it in section so and so of the Bill&rdquo;.  That is the kind of thing we regret was not done in relation to the Succession Bill. The first Bill had been crystallised before we got it and we found it impossible not to change some of the malevolent provisions of that Bill.</P>
      <P>I join with Senators Alton and Sheldon in welcoming the proposals contained in the White Paper in so far as they go but I must confess that it would be a very good thing if the Minister for Health were to familiarise himself again with the proposals for insurance as a basis for financing the health scheme.  These proposals were outlined, according to the Minister, by the Labour Party before the Fine Gael Party, before the paper of Deputy T.F. O'Higgins on health.  I detect in the Minister a feeling that these proposals are not the last, that he may well move in the direction of financing this scheme, perhaps because of the exigencies of our financial circumstances, on the basis of insurance.  If he does that, I assure him that as far as I am concerned I shall not say a word to the effect that it was our proposals or the Labour Party proposals that started it.  All I shall do is commend the Minister for adopting these proposals.</P>
      <P>It was a source of some disappoinment to me to find that the Minister in his White Paper had not adverted sufficiently to the condition of old people.  I think a very good test of any man or woman, son or daughter, son-in-law or daughter-in-law, is the respect they pay and the tolerance they show and the patience they accord to old people.  That is the great test of the family.  It is also the test of a nation. The respect it shows for its old people and the provisions it makes for their well being is in my view a great touchstone of the moral standards of a nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret to say that in this White Paper we do not find any elaborate <Col N="493" /> provisions of a detailed character for old people.  One can read from page 44 to page 47 of the White Paper merely an expression of a vague feeling that something should be done, that some little money should be provided, that the Government will encourage voluntary organisations to provide the most effective system of home aid for the aged. I do not think we can dismiss a growing population of old people in a few pages of a White Paper.  Their problems are too serious to dismiss, too varied to be covered in the few paragraphs devoted to them in the White Paper.  I have a recollecteion of reading in the newspapers that the Minister for Health discovered some old lady in Limerick.  He was like St. Paul after Damascus.  He had seen the light.  He had never known before that old ladies living in small, unheated rooms spent their evenings in churches telling the beads because they did not have sufficient fuel or comforts in their homes to stay there.  The Minister announced this with the frankness of a Saul turned Paul.</P>

      <P>I confess he did not do that and I confess what I am talking about is not what happened in 1925 or 1927.  I am talking about something that is here and now causing pain and distress to old people.  What happened in 1925 or 1922 is of no avail to people who are hungry, cold, suffering physical and mental privation, people who are senile before they should be. If the Senator wishes to go back to 1925 he will find there is not an old person in the country who will be one whit the better for one single bit of what happened in 1925.  What I am concerned about is what the Minister for Health proposes to do for the old people.  I find in the White Paper that what he proposes to do is distressingly inadequate.  He merely gives expression to a feeling of dissatisfaction with the way old people are being cared for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a lawyer I come across a great variety of people.  I have to deal with workmen for half an hour and the next time I am in court I have to act on <Col N="494" /> behalf of an old person who signed away her farm or house and the son-in-law finds her an intolerable burden &mdash;an old person who is trying to get back her farm or house.  I should like to refer to the case of an old lady who slept with a dog to provide her with sufficient warmth.  That is the kind of problem we should be concerned with, not what happened in 1925.  That old lady slept with the dog in bed to keep her warm.  She was too senile and too far gone in mind to get her neighbours to do anything.  She did not have a fire to heat her.</P>
    <P>They are the people we should be dealing with and not with the happenings of 1925.  I do not find anything in the White Paper to deal with the condition of the large numbers of old people whose sons and daughters have left the farms because they could not get a living, old people whose spouses have died and whose children in England have not come home.  They are removed from the kindly ministrations of their neighbours, living perhaps on a mountainside.  I urge on the Minister to conduct an early intensive survey of the conditions of these old people and to do something to alleviate their conditions.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the White Paper to the mentally handicapped. We are told we can await a White Paper.  I cannot understand why White Papers and reports published by the various commissions and committees, all of whom do admirable work, require such detailed and prolonged consideration by Government Departments. If I were in the Minister's position I would insist on early proposals from my official advisers.  It is disgraceful that we provide no proper system of health or education for our mentally handicapped.  In this respect, health and education are inseparable. Under our Constitution, which the Minister does not like us to accept for some reason or another, mentally handicapped children are as much entitled to a primary education, paid for by the State, suited to their particular condition, as are the healthy minded children of the country.</P>
    <P>We have failed and failed disgracefully in relation to this country's <Col N="495" /> mentally handicapped children. Equally, it can be said we are failing in relation to the physically handicapped among us and there is nothing in this White Paper that I can find to deal with physically handicapped children or physically handicapped people.</P>
    <P>There is also one paragraph devoted to the school medical examination and treatment services.  The Minister has been giving statistics.  It seems to me, and I speak merely about the services provided in Dublin, that the examination of children in the national school is merely another exercise for the purpose of providing statistics for the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>I have children going to a national school and I can tell the Minister that one of them was suffering from an ailment that must have been diagnosed by the school medical attendant. I never heard anything about it from him.  It was quite by accident that the child around the same time was referred to our local general medical practitioner.  She diagnosed it and then we had weeks in and weeks out in the children's hospital in Harcourt Street.</P>
    <P>I do not know what they were doing at the school medical examination. We signed forms to have the children examined; they were presented for examination but we never heard a word since as to whether they were in good or bad health.  It is not confined to that one child.  There is another child who had another ailment of a passing character.  The ailment of the first mentioned child was of a more substantial character.  The latter child was quite ill on the day he was examinted but at any rate we sent him out to be examined like one of his fellows in his class.  But, there has been a great silence since then.</P>
    <P>If my recollection is correct, I think I wrote to the county council to get a report on those children but I never got a reply.  I know, of course, that in other cases children's ailments have been diagnosed and rheumatic heart disease or incipient rheumatic fever has been detected.  But what is the purpose <Col N="496" /> of these examinations if we hear nothing, if the parents having filled in the forms are not told that if they hear nothing they can assume the child is all right?  If there is something wrong the authorities should write to tell the parents what they ought to do.</P>
    <P>I would commend to the Minister that he make it obligatory on the health authorities, if they are spending money in conducting examinations, to make some report to the parents.  After all, it is the parents who have to look after the children day in day out.  As I have said, had it not been for our own private medical practitioner we would never have known what particular ailment that child was suffering from, which we took steps after to deal with.  There is a grave defect in the medical services provided in the schools if that attitude is in any way general.  I have no reason to believe that my children were singled out for any kind of unfavourable treatment. I think this is the system.  In relation to that kind of thing, I would suggest there should be some liaison between the Department of Health and the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I have seen many national schools and I will ask the Minister for Health to find out from his colleague, the Minister for Education, how many times in the year are the windows cleaned in national schools in the country.  I do not mind whose responsibility it is but in how many schools on the 19th November, to take a random date, at 11 o'clock is there light for the purposes of reading?  In how many offices all over the country is there light on the 19th November at 11 o'clock for reading?  It is necessary, but still we expect our children to go into schools&mdash;some of them are perhaps short-sighted, some long-sighted and some of them suffering from astigmatism&mdash;where their health is being impaired through lack of lighting.</P>
    <P>Under the Offices Act which was introduced by the late Deputy Norton and pushed through by the present Government there was a standard laid down for lighting in offices but there is no standard for lighting laid down for national schools.  There is no point in sending doctors around to examine <Col N="497" /> children and prescribing glasses when we will not provide proper lighting in the national schools.  These are the kind of things an alert Minister should deal with.</P>

      <P>Is prevention not better than cure?  The Minister has been forced into a sulky silence and I appreciate Senator Yeats coming to his rescue.  However, the Minister may revive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the fee for service, I have not read what Senator Alton said on the last occasion and I do not know what is the best system. I do not know what system would suit doctors and I do not know what would be the best system for the patients.  That is a matter on which I have not sufficient knowledge to offer an opinion.  But, when I hear the Minister for Health ranting about people and expressing in a trenchant form his views characterising them as pressure groups, I do not think it is the most tactful way in which to lay the ground for fruitful negotiations with these people.  Let them say what they want.  Let them clamour hither and thither but eventually what happens is the Minister must <Col N="498" /> get around the table with the medical association, the local authorities and his advisers and all the talk and all the noise and all the pressurising would be of no avail to sensible men. Eventually they will have to sit around and work out a sensible solution to the problem of the needs of this country. I do not think for a moment that the Minister does the medical people any service and he certainly does not add service to the patients of this country by exacerbating the feelings of the people with whom he will associate.</P>
    <P>Senator Alton is a medical doctor elected by the medical representatives of the National University of Ireland and what else would he do in this Chamber but express what he supposes to be the views of the people who elected him?  What else would he do in this chamber but express what he believes to be the views of the people who elected him?  What do the Labour people do?  What do those people on the industrial and commercial panel do?  What do the farmers do when they come up here but express in the most intelligent form the views of those people whom they are supposed to represent in this professional and vocational chamber?  Then the Minister rounds upon Senator Alton as if he was most antagonistic to his political point of view.  For a moment I was beginning to wonder. I do not think that that kind of approach is likely to produce fruitful negotiations.</P>
    <P>I say it here and now, and this I shall repeat, that if the Minister fails to introduce and put through a Bill because he says that the Medical Association and the Medical Union are trying to make money out of the sickness of the people of the country and to trade upon the ill-health of the poor population&mdash; if he comes in and says that kind of thing and that for that reason he is unable to bring in a Health Bill&mdash;I shall point out to him that he has paved the way for unfruitful negotiations by the reference to five per cent who treated their patients like pigs and by his diatribe here against the democratic expression of view by Senator Alton on behalf of the medical people of this country.</P>
    <P>I observe that we are making slow <Col N="499" /> progress in relation to grants for multiple births.  The Minister said that he is not under the domination of his Department and his Departmental officials, and one would welcome that being the position.  Is it not remarkable that in paragraph 88 of the White Paper they say: &ldquo;It is also intended to introduce an amendment to section 23 so that where there is a multiple birth a grant will be paid for each live-born child&rdquo;?  The typical civil servant comes to life in the words &ldquo;each live-born child&rdquo;.  Does not the mother who has the misfortune and disappointment of bearing a still-born child suffer the same amount, indeed more, than the mother of the live-born child?  But the Departmental mind and the Civil Service mind says &ldquo;This would upset a whole lot of new principles in giving grants for children who are born dead&rdquo;, and they put in &ldquo;for each live-born child&rdquo;.  This is not a very generous measure and it is certainly not the product of an affluent society.  I would commend the Minister at least for going the distance of giving a grant for each live-born child.  I go a further distance in saying that when a child is born alive, especially where you have twins and more especially triplets and in the exceptional cases, as in the Minister's own constituency, where you have quads, the burden thrown upon the parents rearing those children is quite exceptional, and I cannot understand the attitude of mind of the Minister and of the officials whether in Health or Social Welfare who have not at ths stage woken up to the fact that the mother of twins and triplets is quite unusually burdened in rearing those children.</P>
    <P>Most mothers will tell you that to rear one child at a time is quite sufficient.  You sometimes hear mothers talking about the problem of having three in three.  I heard recently about four in three, which is a remarkable business.  Where you have three in three you hear from time to time from mothers that they do impose great stress on their physical resources, their emotions and everything else.  We in this country sit back and are not able to rejoice with nature when there are <Col N="500" /> triplets and quads and provide the parents of those children with exceptional grants to meet the kind of real physical difficulties that they have in rearing those children.  I wish that any Minister would amend section 23 in order to provide the most liberal grants for triplets and quads, and I do not think that there is a single person in either House of the Oireachtas or anywhere else in the country who will say that he is being extravagant in providing that kind of grant.</P>

      <P>The position of the Chair is always very difficult in regard to matters of this sort. In particular it is difficult when the Minister is not a Member of the House. <Col N="501" /> The main concern of the Chair must always be with the matter of order in debate.  The Chair may have views on what is courteous but is not able always to enforce them.</P>

      <P>As I said, I do hope that when the Minister reads what I have to say if he does not hear what I am now saying because of his absorption in <i>Pulse</i>, he will in the generosity of his heart and at the expense of public funds provide more liberal grants for multiple births, especially triplets and quadruplets in this country, even in his own constituency.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the health services and their further development involve doing something about providing appropriate research that is necessary, especially for the particular type of diseases that occur in this country.  I do not find anything in this White Paper dealing with research.  I believe that the research workers of this country, as they have shown in both Trinity College and in the National University, provided with the appropriate funds can produce results comparable in different fields to those produced in other countries. There seem to me to be a lot of endemic diseases in this country which require a good deal of research, and it is a lack in our health services, especially in the field of preventive medicine, that nothing is being provided in that direction of a worthwhile character.  Certainly there is nothing in the White Paper which would indicate a further development in that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, one of the main criticisms of this White Paper is the fact that when people are in bad health in the upper income level within the ambit of the health services to be provided under this White Paper they will still have to worry when they are ill as to how much money they will have to pay for their maintenance in hospital. It is all very well for the Minister to say &ldquo;It is only 10/- a week.&rdquo;  It is very easy for the Minister, who has never known hardship and want, and has never found himself trying to make ends meet on a slender income, to <Col N="502" /> say that this is no worry.  But it is not all right for the father of a family of seven who may be paid part of his income when he is ill in hospital and who has to worry whether it is going to be 10/-, 7/6, or 5/- a day he will have to pay while he is ill in hospital.  Of course the Minister will be aware that if the father of a family is involved in a road accident that he and his legal advisers&mdash;if he is taking an action&mdash; will receive regularly from the health authority a bill for £13 10s., representing 27 days at 10/- a day for maintenance in hospital.  Of course, the man may have got no income at all during his sojourn in hospital. While the Minister says he should not have to pay anything, the health authority insist upon sending out that bill so that it can be claimed from the person who caused the accident and, subsequently, recouped to the health authority.  That happens, in our experience, every day.</P>

      <P>What is in the Road Traffic Act is a different thing and something which has never been implemented by the health authority.  What is in the Road Traffic Act is a right on the part of the health authority, where a person is involved in an accident, to look to the insurer of the person causing the accident to reimburse the health authority for the hospital maintenance.</P>

      <P>Under the Road Traffic Act the bill should not be sent to the person who is injured but to the insurers of the person who caused the accident.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>They are entitled to the full amount under the Road Traffic Act.  There is no use in the Minister saying&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, 10/- a day is nothing, you could live at home for that&rdquo;.  When somebody gets sick in Belmullet, has to be transferred to Castlebar and sojourns there for 18 to 21 days there is no use in the Minister saying&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, it would cost that to keep him at home&rdquo;.  People have to visit him; there are always new pyjamas to be got; husbands do not go into their wives or wives into their husbands with their hands hanging, they buy a whole lot of things and these are the kind of additions which cause an imposition, readily undertaken by people and relatives of sick people.  In a civilised community, when it is possible to do so, we ought to relieve people who are sick in hospital from any worry of that kind.  God knows anybody who is sick has enough to worry about as to how soon and to what extent he will recover from the illness from which he is suffering.  It is uncivilised, in my view, in modern times to have people worrying about the hospital charges they may have to face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, to my mind, is one of the great defects of this White Paper.  I hope the Minister, notwithstanding all that has been said, will find it possible to revise his attitude in this matter and bring in a kind of health service&mdash;in so far as it concerns the ordinary illnesses in the home and the ordinary illnesses which require hospitalisation&mdash;which will relieve people from all financial worries in so far as these prevent them from recovering.  If he does that kind of thing, he will bring in a much better <Col N="504" /> Health Bill, which will require much less amendment, than the Bill he has at present in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to put briefly some points I think should be aired again at this stage on the question of health.  Senator Alton, in his opening remarks, said that two matters caused great heat in Irish politics&mdash;one was the question of milk and the other was the question of medicine.  I hope Senator Alton will remember that, because it is all very fine to come into this House and make an impassioned speech on behalf of a particular interest, but there are two sides to the story.  I do not agree with the Minister in his views on health in general but I do agree with one statement he made&mdash;that the prime interest in health should be the welfare of the patient.  That should be the decisive factor in the implementation of any health service.  In any civilised community where that is put number one or given priority all the other things fall into their proper place.  After that it is a matter of the interests involved fighting hard to ensure that they are not left behind and that proper regard is given to their position.</P>
      <P>Senator Alton is a well-known medical man, for whom I have the greatest respect in his capacity as such.  I cannot say the same when it comes to my views on him as a politician.  He was elected by the graduates of the university and I must say that, since he spoke on this White Paper, a number of graduates have spoken to me&mdash;who played a prominent part in the election of Senator Alton&mdash;and they disagreed completely with his views on medicine. In fact, it would appear from his remarks in this House that, when the tapes went up, he was running, if you like, as a graduates' candidate for the university and when he came to the winning post he had donned IMA colours.  I may be unfair to him but the reason I say that is that he himself said that health has generated heat in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience of the health services in this country goes back a good deal further than most people in this House. I remember in 1951 when the first attempt was made to bring socialised <Col N="505" /> medicine into Ireland.  We had the unholy alliance, in my opinion, of the medical association and the hierarchy condemning socialised medicine on moral grounds.  They were helped, of course, in this task of killing a first class health scheme by certain politicians who were, again, used as fronts or puppets, particularly of the IMA. I want to say clearly now that the blame for the disgraceful health service we have today must be traced back to those people who in 1951 sought to suggest that a socialised health scheme was immoral, contrary to the morals of the Irish people and that the period from 1951 to 1966, which is 15 years, was allowed to elapse in which people had to put up with very poor services; many people had to emigrate and secure the socialised services in Britain. I should like to know is there even at this late stage one iota of regret in the minds of those people who irresponsibly sought to finish for all time the idea of treating all the children of the nation equally in the question of health, as we should be doing also in education and other fields.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that many of the people who stood by the idea of socialised medicine in 1951 are still prepared to stand by that view, and so far as it lies in their power, vested interests whose main purpose is to feather their own nests, will be opposed tooth and nail on local platforms, at public forums and in every democratic way, in order that the public will realise what is being attempted, and what they have in mind, to prevent the people from getting the socialised services to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to trade unions, be they the Irish Medical Association or the Irish Medical Union, making their case.  To me the Irish Medical Association are a trade union and as such they are entitled to fight, and to fight in a courageous and bold manner, for the rights of their members, but they are not entitled to go further and suggest that they have the sole right to decide what the health services should be.  They have no right to attempt to sabotage the health services. They have no right to set themselves up as being above society because in <Col N="506" /> their profession they look after the sick.  They have no right to expect the rest of the community to bow down before them as if they were some mysterious group of whom we should live in awe.</P>
    <P>A case was made that the dispensary doctors and the district medical officers were a distressed group because of pending changes in the proposed new legislation.  Senator Alton said that they have &ldquo;accepted a rather quiet dull life in the country&rdquo;. I wonder how many medical doctors are prepared to accept that smug paternalistic description of these people who, to my knowledge, live anything but quiet dull lives in poor old rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The majority of the dispensary doctors are first class doctors who do wonderful work but, like other groups of men doing their work, they often allow spokesmen to arise on their behalf who do not represent their true interests.  I have found that the majority of the dispensary doctors have spokesmen down in Fitzwilliam Square or elsewhere who on numerous occasions manipulate and utilise the dispensary doctors for their own ends.</P>
    <P>Back in 1951 the majority of the dispensary doctors were prepared to operate the Health Bill although it was sought to suggest afterwards that they were against it.  In fact, it was well known that at that time the people in Fitzwilliam Square, the Crescent in Galway, and similar places in Cork and elsewhere, were behind the opposition and led the fight against the implementation of that Bill.</P>
    <P>I believe that when the case is put to them clearly the majority of doctors favour the idea of security.  Many doctors in private practice show by their actions in later life that they are anxious for security.  They like to come into the public services after a strenuous period in private practice. We all know from our acquaintance with medical people that there is no more strenuous type of work, or more dedicated work, than the work of a doctor in private practice in the city or in the rural areas.  He is on tap at all hours of the day and night.  He <Col N="507" /> lives under constant stress.  He has to worry about his family in case anything happens to him.  He has to insure himself and to look after his own interests.  If he is ill for a period someone else may come in and take his practice.  We talk of the instincts of humanity and this applies to doctors as well as anyone else.  Doctors like to have a sense of security and proper remuneration with some form of superannuation afterwards.  In those circumstances great work is done, there is a more relaxed frame of mind, and the best possible attention is given to the public.</P>
    <P>These medical men must be well remunerated.  I will not put a figure on their services but I will say this: they are not entitled to put a figure on their own services by setting up what I describe as their own personal means test to be carried out on each individual patient who comes before them. The difficulty is that sometimes in private practice, or in areas where there are doctors giving part time service to the public authority, or in the upper echelon, there are consultants who are, in fact, far more skilful than the local pensions officers in getting a detailed picture of how many hens a person has and how many eggs a year they lay.</P>
    <P>Senator Alton made the case that a capitation approach to payments was not successful in Britain and that there was great dissatisfaction about it among medical men in England.  He said that the medical profession would not like to see a capitation system brought in here to a great extent.  He went back to the 1948 period when Nye Bevan was in Britain and he said that Nye Bevan implemented the 1948 Health Act against the wishes of the Labour Party.  I always had a great regard for Nye Bevan but I never realised that he was such a single-handed wizard or wonder that he was able to implement the Health Act against the wishes of the Labour Party, and I presume of the Conservatives as well.  I do not accept that view, and I do not think Senator Alton was serious about it either.</P>
    <P>Let us be quite clear about this. Senator Alton made one good point in his speech so far as capitation was <Col N="508" /> concerned.  He said:</P>
    <P>It was not so bad in England where everybody, 100 per cent of the population, were put on the capitation system.  Here, however, we propose to put only 45 per cent under the system and we shall thereby immediately create this second group again.</P>
    <P>I am with him so far as the segregation and the differential involved are concerned. He left the door open when he said: &ldquo;It was not so bad in England where everybody, 100 per cent of the population, were put on the capitation system.&rdquo;  I do not want to see two or three different groups, or what I call two or three tier medicine available to the people.  I mentioned the rights of the citizens under the Constitution.  I do not believe that we should tolerate the idea that there should be a different type of medicine available for people according to their status in society.</P>
    <P>Let me clear the air somewhat as far as that is concerned.  The best example I can give of my idea about that is the voluntary health service. Here we have a health scheme run on what is known as the unit system.  You pay for so many units for maintenance and the cost of upkeep in hospital. You can take so many units regarding an operation, for instance.  I think most people will agree that if a person wants to travel in a train first class that is his business.  It should be the right of everybody to travel in a second or third-class carriage if he wishes.  As far as public hospitals and public wards are concerned it should not count whether a person is a £10 million a year man or a 10/- a year man. Public wards are available to all.  If somebody wants privacy or wants luxury in his surroundings in the form of attention he can pay for it. There is nothing wrong with that.</P>
    <P>When it comes to an operation or specialist treatment everybody should be treated the same.  That is the view I have always had and I regard the voluntary health system as very unfair in this regard.  For instance, in the voluntary health scheme, if a person takes out, say, four units, where an operation is involved, and another person takes out two units is it not an extraordinary thing that for the <Col N="509" /> same operation, say appendicitis, the surgeon is paid a different fee according to the number of units which the person has taken out?  That is outrageous. It is no concern of the man carrying out the operation or the investigation whether the person has two units or six units.</P>
    <P>I know perfectly well what happens. It is human nature.  It makes a difference to the medical man whether his fee will be £25, £30 or even 10 guineas.  That should not enter into it at all.  That system, with regard to the voluntary health scheme, is something to be deplored.  I believe Senator Alton, perhaps through his long experience with the voluntary health system and through his isolation from the rural community, feels that poor people become annoyed because they are asked to fill in certain details on a questionnaire, which the assistance officer has to fill up.  Senator Alton said:</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is the way he goes about the questions or perhaps it is the general approach.  It may well be that a few words of explanation to those people beforehand as to why the questions are being asked or perhaps a course in public relations for those officials might go a long way towards solving this difficulty.</P>
    <P>Why should there be questions asked? What is the point in it?  The Senator bases his case on this.  He also said:</P>
    <P>I can never really understand this because through all our lives whether we are looking for a loan from the bank to buy a house or getting a car on hire purchase there is always the means test, no matter what class one belongs to.</P>
    <P>How can you reconcile that argument with the health services?  How can you suggest if children are going to a primary school that there should be a means test?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is.  I happen to be on a local authority. When we come to medical card holders as far as those people are concerned they are all ratepayers to the local authorities.  They pay rates just the same way as the man with £60 valuation.  Unfortunately, the man with the £60 valuation will have to pay for his own health services and he will also have to pay for the man who gets them free.  The man with the £60 valuation should be facilitated and brought in.</P>
      <P>If the Minister or his representative want facts with regard to this matter I can give them.  The 10/- a day hospital maintenance charge is the maximum which can be charged.  The Minister admits that 60 per cent of the patients do not have to pay it at all.  The remainder have to pay 10/-or 7/- a day.  I can assure the Minister that so far as the Roscommon local authority is concerned the collection of that 10/- or 7/- is costly.  That is one local authority.  I am perfectly sure that other local authorities are no different and that that is the position throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a huge system of administration set up.  We have a Frankenstein created in the form of investigation machinery.  We must churn everything through that machine. Of course, this gives employment to the people carrying out the investigation. In my opinion, leaving the moral issue out of it, there should not be this means test.  I do not want to say too much about the doctors but it is well known that they want to carry out their own means test because it is only natural that the people in the income tax department and elsewhere do not get <Col N="511" /> the full facts of the shakehands between the patient and the medical man.  All the pious talk and all the smokescreens in the world will not hide that.</P>
    <P>That is not the system which operates with regard to the TB scheme. When a person becomes ill with TB and goes into a sanatorium, he is not questioned whether he earns £40 a week, £20 a week or even £7 a week. Nobody asks questions about that.  The same treatment is available to all. There is no question of snobbery attached to this as there is in other forms of medicine.  That system should be adopted so far as the other services are concerned.</P>
    <P>I opened my remarks by saying to Senator Alton that this is a very touchy subject indeed.  I am speaking from the other side of the picture because as far as I am concerned the patient is number one.  The doctors may say that is their view, too, but I say that since 1951 the patient has got the wrong end of the stick and the doctor has thought about the advance of his profession. There are many items that need inclusion in a priority list for departmental attention and I hope the Minister shows the same drive and enthusiasm and interest in his Department as he shows in his speeches and in the way he can deal with those who cross swords with him.</P>
    <P>He should give immediate attention to the old people.  The study of geriatrics is much behind time in this country.  It is outrageous to see county homes still operating on the basis of 50 to 90 years ago.  I can tell the Minister that in Roscommon there is a county home the sight of which is enough to depress a visitor, do not mind the unfortunate people who have to spend the remainder of their days there.  During the past 15 years we have been listening to plans for a new modern home for people who have no other place to go to.  All we have got are plans.  We have had architects from the Department, we have had technical advisers and medical advisers from the county and from the Department.  The public body are all behind some action but nothing has been done to construct a new building.  Now we have got to the <Col N="512" /> stage where people who have made a study of the treatment of old people have come to the rightful conclusion that those large buildings are not places in which old people can be treated.</P>
    <P>Experts have been telling us that the idea of institutionalisation is something that should be avoided as far as possible where old people are concerned.  The new trend, which I hope the Minister will push in all areas, is to plan buildings which will give privacy, especially to old couples, so that they can live in their own private units where they can have some of their furniture, some of their little belongings, that will remind them of home.  There will be a community spirit which will get rid of the idea of a prison society.</P>
    <P>In many county homes at the moment permission has to be got from those in authority for old people to get out even twice a week to visit the local town.  It is hard to understand such an attitude at this time. The local authority officials responsible for the administration of county homes take the side of the nuns who run the institutions.  I am afraid we are a long way behind in our thinking as far as medicine is concerned. The people who should be giving a lead, instead require a course on Christian charity.</P>
    <P>I could speak for a week on health issues but I do not propose to do so. I have not said anything that could be regarded as controversial, as blaming one Government or another for our health services.  I hope we are all united in the aim of getting the best possible medical services.  We must start with the fundamental thought that the patient must come first.  I do not deny that all groups concerned with patients' welfare should get what they rightfully deserve but they should not try to get it before the patient is considered.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to make a long intervention but should like to query briefly why it is that we still retain the notion we do not want health legislation which will govern the whole population. When Deputy T.F. O'Higgins was <Col N="513" /> Minister for Health he told us that with the voluntary health scheme he introduced and which I did not notice being opposed by Fianna Fáil at the time we would cover all but one-sixth of the population, the remaining sixth being rugged individuals who like to pay their own bills.  This sixth has been pared down by the present Government but I should like to know why do they feel it necessary to retain all the apparatus of forms and means tests in order to find out whether a tiny percentage of the population should come under the scheme.  Is it not time we had a national health scheme which would cover everybody?</P>
      <P>We might give people the right to opt out, to buy privileged treatment, but why should we not devote our energy to the formulation of a scheme which would be an all-in health scheme and abolish the highly cumberous mechanism of the means test which leads to an awful lot of questioning as to whether we are entitled to this or that service?  When the Minister earlier spoke about this not being the be all and end all he must in his heart be looking forward to the day when he will have a comprehensive health scheme covering the whole country, all of us, and not have the necessity retained, as I fear he will have it, of applying a means test which will produce more questions about the financial status of a patient than about his health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the whole, the Minister should be pleased with the reception of the White Paper. It is inevitable, and he should not show so much irritation, that people on the other side should say certain things are not satisfactory.  During the past 20 years all Parties have been responsible for the failure to get things done but all Parties have made contributions to this end.  This White Paper is a contribution and the Minister is to be congratulated on taking this initiative. I know him as someone of ability and energy and it is a good thing to have somebody of energy and ability in an office which has for some time past languished a bit.  We have not had the progress we ought to have had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I press on the Minister this question <Col N="514" /> of insurance contributions.  The Minister's reluctance in regard to this may be partly due to the fact that the idea has come from the other side of the House but he is man enough to overcome that difficulty.  He is not the type of person to allow that to deter him. The reference that has been made from the other side&mdash;the other Party&mdash;to insurance contributions as a poll tax is extraordinary.  We are in the middle of debating an occupational injuries scheme in which the Government are insisting that the finances must be by a flat rate of insurance.  They say they do not believe any other system would be desirable.  They admit there is a strong case against it but they insist on putting on this poll tax in this instance.  There are arguments against a poll tax.  If you have this flat rate contribution, regardless of means, you are limiting the amount you can get by the most you think you can take from the community. The flat rate contribution is disadvantageous and is something we ought to be starting to move away from.  I think an insurance contribution is something which is accepted in the social welfare scheme and which the Government have accepted as so desirable that they are bringing it in in the social insurance in the case of occupational injuries.  To argue that this is all right for social welfare or desirable for occupational injuries, but that they must shy away from it with regard to health because this is a poll tax, is totally inconsistent.  It is simply an excuse for fobbing off this proposal.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not finally made up his mind against it.  He may feel some embarrassment in accepting it because it came from the other side of the House.  But it is a mistake to turn it down on the spurious argument that it is a poll tax.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this.  This country is unique in Europe because of the small amount of money which it raises in taxation for social welfare purposes by means of insurance contributions.  What we raise in this form is a fraction of what other countries raise.  It is only a fraction of what is raised in Britain. There the average amount raised in this way is only one-half or one-third of what is raised in other European countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> This is the one untapped form of taxation here.  It is no coincidence that in this country where this form of taxation is untapped and where we raise only between ten and 20 per cent of what is raised in other European countries in this form, as a proportion of national output and national income, the type of expenditure which is financed by this type of tax for transfer benefits, social welfare benefits, health services and things of this kind, is at a minimal level compared with other countries.  We are behind because we have been unwilling to tap this source.</P>
    <P>It ties us down to the minimum level and we are appallingly behind in the whole business of social welfare and health services.  I think the Minister should consider this matter seriously. Otherwise he will never be able to develop a worthwhile health service, because he will never get authority from the Government to finance a first-class health service here so long as one hand is tied behind his back and he has to finance it out of taxation.  He has now for good and proper reasons also tied the other hand behind his back because he has agreed, rightly I think, not to call further on the rates in financing the health services.</P>
    <P>If the Minister refuses to use insurance contributions and refuses to use the rates all he will be left with is central government taxation, which is already in most forms at a level beyond which he cannot go rapidly if at all. Some forms of taxation have reached their effective limit.  If the Minister will tie himself in that way he will limit the development of the health services and tie his own hand.  It is vital that he should open his mind to this question of insurance contribution.</P>
    <P>If he feels there should not be a flat contribution he will meet with no objection from this side of the House. This is more relevant in areas like retirement pension, workmen's compensation which we are discussing at the moment and perhaps indeed in social welfare benefits also.  Nevertheless, I do not think there would be opposition here if he felt that flat rate contributions are a form of poll tax and if he felt it desirable to vary the <Col N="516" /> level.  But that he should have recourse to this form of taxation is essential to do the job towards which he has so courageously set himself.  If he does this he will be going a long way towards improving the health services of this country.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter on which I would appeal to the Minister also and that is the question of the fee for service.  I think Senator Alton made a cogent case for consideration of this. There are certain difficulties and the Minister is right in what he said in the White Paper, I think, that if such a system were introduced it would be necessary to police it most carefully to avoid abuse.  It is a system that could be open to abuse.  On the other hand.  Senator Alton on this point encouraged the Minister and said to him that if the Minister felt that tight policing would be necessary he need not fear that the doctors would object to this.  They would accept that there must be control.  If there is evidence that the system is being abused policing could be employed and they would not get away, as the dentists did in Britain, with an enormous increase in incomes.</P>
    <P>As a system it has enormous merits over the capitation system and it is one the Minister should consider. Again, he has not closed his mind, but he has a pre-disposition in the other direction.  The Minister has said repeatedly that he has put this White Paper before the Houses of the Oireachtas because he wanted a discussion on these matters and he said he had an open mind.  Sometimes he has seemed to have a slightly closed mind but this is understandable for anybody approaching a subject of this kind who starts with a certain point of view.  I take the Minister at his word, that he is open to suggestion and I hope he will listen to this discussion and that in this matter of fee for service he will have regard to the arguments put forward in the discussion in this House.</P>
    <P>I believe in the matter of health services there have been signs that we are moving towards a consensus of opinion.  In the past there has been serious dissension and political up-heavel in this country.  All Parties <Col N="517" /> have made mistakes and all have also made contributions.  Looking at it in retrospect, it is sometimes hard to understand how we can have got embroiled in some of the arguments we got embroiled in.  Looking back, I shudder to think of the views I myself once held in that regard.  Since then we all have learned and our views have broadened and have come together, I think, and this debate, despite occasional asperities which were unfortunate, has shown that this consensus is developing.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington has suggested that we should move a step further and indeed my sympathies are with him on this, and I will be interested to see what the Minister has to say on the Senator's brief intervention.  We are moving towards a consensus in a certain direction and it is a great thing that health no longer arouses the passions which it did fifteen years ago, passions which held up development, as Senator McQuillan rightly said, in this field for fifteen years.  This is something we must all regret and look back on with sorrow&mdash;that when it did become a political issue and, God help us, a religious issue of all things, it held up development for so long.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be commended on this White Paper.  He would be even more commendable if he had listened to the discussion which part of the time he was not doing, as I had to point out, and if he applies his mind to what was said in the discussion. Whether he does so or not, the debate has been worthwhile.  By initiating it Senator Alton has given this House an opportunity to air views which, even if the Minister does not accept them, needed airing and discussion. Senator Alton should be pleased with the general trend of the debate and pleased that his initiation of this matter has led to a good and useful debate on it.  I would hope that account will be taken of the suggestions made here today and on a previous occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanAlton" hpid="Dr. Alton Dr. Alton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>There were so many points raised that I propose to deal with the more important of them and I think I would like to refer to what <Col N="518" /> Senator O'Sullivan said about the nurses in Ireland, that we should be much more careful of them and we should look after them better.  I could not agree more with this, and I hope that the Minister will in the very near future introduce legislation which will treat all nurses of this country on an equal footing, that the public health nurses, the voluntary hospital nurses and private nurses will all get the same consideration as regards pay and conditions of service and right of pension. We are very lucky in our nurses. One has only to go overseas and see the number of hospitals closed and units that cannot work properly because of the shortage of nurses.  They are really a particularly good and hard-working group of girls.  We read this morning of a strike in New York where public health nurses are looking for a wage of £2,500 a year and they have gone on strike against immunisation and inoculations and all that until they achieve parity with nurses in other services over there.  We would be sorry to have this kind of upset here, and we would suffer considerably by loss of girls going on for the profession.  This is very noticeable in England, where they have lost a large number of girls who used to go on for nursing.  They are now giving tremendous inducements to girls to go into the profession, but once the demands for a profession has been lost how very hard it is to build it up again as something popular as a career!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned when speaking on paragraph 128 of the White Paper that I was not very clear on it.  This is the paragraph dealing with regionalisation. I was very anxious that the Minister would try to simplify the officialdom dealing with the regional set up.  This paragraph says that local staffs engaged in the health service will be transferred to the new boards, and further on it says that it is realised that many of the services will continue to be operated by the staffs resident in the area of operation and that there will be no question of having all the staff working from one centre in a region.  There are going to be central regional setups and, therefore, I would be afraid that we <Col N="519" /> would be building up a double set of officialdom&mdash;the original setup and also the county council setups still remaining intact, and instead of it being easier to get things done it might be much harder in future.  In my experience if you get on the telephone to make an inquiry nobody could be nicer, but if you write a letter for a patient time seems to go on, sometimes there are serious delays of up to six months, before letters are answered.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some kind of misconception going on at the present moment, and both the Minister and Senator McQuillan seem to be under the impression that the main soreness of the doctors is that they will no longer be able to dodge income tax. I must at this stage make a protest on this.  It is very unfair.  It is not justified, and I doubt if either the Minister or Senator McQuillan or anybody here would make those statements face to face with their own doctors, saying as Senator McQuillan said that they view patients simply from what they can get out of them. I do not credit this, and I find it a very bad approach.</P>
    <P>Concerning the hospitals of this country, the Minister was under the impression that I made rather hurtful comparisons between the voluntary hospitals and the local authority hospitals.  I stated that the vast majority of the specialists' work and most of the super-specialists' work was carried out in the voluntary hospitals.  I did not comment adversely on the local authority hospitals other than that I did say, and I repeated here, that it would be much more possible to get better service out of our local authority hospitals and to make them more economic if they were better staffed with both senior and junior personnel.</P>
    <P>The Minister thought that I made poor comparisons between St. Kevin's and the Mater, where I work.  I do not think I did, because another figure which he did not give me was the admission rate to St. Kevin's and the admission rate to the Mater.  If you take away the maternity and geriatric beds out of St. Kevin's you are left <Col N="520" /> with a hospital which has roughly twice the capacity of the Mater hospital.  The admissions to the Mater hospital are more per year than the admissions in St. Kevin's.  I have very little doubt that with proper staffing with full personnel highly qualified and properly paid you would rapidly produce the equivalent of a new 200 or 300 bed hospital in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister also took the point of view that when he increased the number of patients eligible for hospitalisation from 85 to 93 per cent or thereabouts and transferred 200,000 patients from being private to being patients eligible for hospitalisation he did no more than transfer a group of patients who would normally be private to being paid for by the State, and that from now on we would be paid by the State for these people.  But the Minister did not take into account that the payment is limited by the number of occupied beds in the voluntary hospitals, and these are working to capacity at the present moment.  The increase in capacity by 200,000 patients will be negligible.  Therefore, while he has transferred 200,000 patients he has not made any provision to pay for them, and while the profession is very willing to accept that we must move towards a more socialised state of medicine we are not prepared to accept that 200,000 patients can be put on us and we can be told that we must do work on those patients which will involve extra work, because it will involve quicker turnover of beds to cope with them, because they are going to get sick.  Take the surgeon, whose units of work is easily measured.  Where a surgeon has done 30 patients in a year that is the turnover of his beds, and he will now have to do 35 to make up for those extra patients.  Therefore, there is extra work involved on those patients.  We do not want compensation for losing them, we want remuneration for looking after them.  We want to get away from this compensation.  We have had compensation since 1958 and that has not helped.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware of the statement made last week in England about the hospital services. It was proved that the English hospital services are at breakdown point.  They are now talking about restricting the accessibility of the hospital to people at random through England.  This is a very big breakdown because it means no longer will anybody in England be eligible to go into hospital, as they are at the present moment.  The alternative to this is grave and heavy expenditure to bring the system up to date. I do not want to stir up things but I would point out that this is almost certainly the result of the capitation <Col N="522" /> system over the past 20 years, which has so strained England.  England has her hospitals very well staffed compared with ours and by consultants on full-time duty, while in this country we are dependent on hospitals, voluntary hospitals staffed by part-time consultants, and local authority hospitals staffed by an inadequate number of full-time consultants.  The part-time consultants in the voluntary hospitals are no longer able to cope.  For economic reasons, because the number of private patients has been reduced, we are going to be forced more and more out of hospital work to try to keep going.  Therefore, the hospital patients have to be dealt with literally in less time.  The consultants in the voluntary hospitals are paid approximately one-quarter to half that of the consultants in England; they give about one-third to half of the time which an English consultant gives. But it is not economic for the voluntary hospitals to deal with an ever-growing number of patients in the hospital and give them adequate time, under the present arrangement. I would spare the Minister most things but I shall have to come back to capitation and fee for service.</P>

      <P>It is in the Minister's Paper for discussion; it is mentioned. With all due respects, we are moving towards a measure, which will be so far advanced by the time discussions take place that it will be very hard to do much about it.  As the Minister knows&mdash;though he does not feel I have done it properly&mdash;I have taken, to my mind, a random sampling of the medical population, rather carefully, with the results I gave him the last day.  The Minister asked me how I did it.  I did it as follows: I asked to be given 60 name plates at random from the GP's list in the IMA and from the DM's list and I wrote letters to these.  I explained I was in great doubt as to what the situation was like; that there were all kinds of rumours afloat; that the Minister in his own speech in the Dáil felt that <Col N="523" /> it was a lot of hotheads who were leading this thing; that it would be unfair to put on the medical profession the extra clerical work and the difficulty of policing a fee per service system; we had heard rumours of letters to the Minister's Department from doctors looking for capitation.  I put all this into the letter; I asked them to look into this, to consult with their colleagues and to let me know what they thought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard myself as representing the NUI and the doctors who are the second largest group thereof. I am not on the council of the IMA and I grind no axe where this is concerned. It is the wish of the people with whom I have consulted that capitation is not the mode of choice and that fee per service is the mode of choice.</P>
      <P>Some of the letters I got back&mdash;and they are very interesting&mdash;would warm the cockles of the Minister's heart.  Here is an extract from one of them:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As you say yourself the fee per service system would entail too much book work and would be <Col N="524" /> grossly abused.  In the present world, and especially in Ireland, a legacy of the penal days when the poor had to steal from and cheat those who had too much in order to survive, petty deceit is considered to be a form of cleverness&mdash;not dishonest mind you.</P>
    <P>Fee per service is favoured only by the drunkards, gamblers, and the incompetent ones, who would, for obvious reasons, abuse it wholesale.</P>
    <P>I understand this doctor sent a copy of his letter to the Minister.  He also adds a postscript:</P>
    <P>I have just learned to touch-type at the local technical school...</P>
    <P>There are others equally in favour of capitation.  There are some very, very fine letters as far as going into detail is concerned.  May I read again?</P>
    <P>Many DMOs will lose income under any system....  In almost one-third of the present dispensary areas there are only approximately 350 eligible patients.  Under capitation or fee for service it would be impossible for a doctor to make his present salary in one of these areas as the population is not there.  Unless a doctor is guaranteed his present income at least there is bound to be an exodus of doctors from these areas.  As you said, the policing of the fee per service would be troublesome for the administrators and the doctors but it is the only system where the busy doctor would be adequately remunerated and the Minister who has stressed that he expects no distinction to be made between Health Act and private patients could hardly himself introduce a distinction by offering the doctors a smaller fee for these patients than they get from their private patients.  It would open the eyes of the administrators... et cetera.</P>
    <P>These letters, all of them are quite reasonable and the net result is roughly 80 per cent for fee per service and the remainder anything else.  But it is the way they feel about it and I do not think they are wrong, for a different <Col N="525" /> reason.  Doctors are not trying to make money out of this.  I resent this very deeply because if you are going to spend at least £3 million more than you estimate spending on capitation then the Minister might as well put it into a good scheme as a bad one.  The Minister's documentation sets out in paragraph 44:</P>
    <P>...an eligible person will have the right to be attended by any doctor participating in the scheme who is living within a reasonable distance...</P>
    <P>That is the first set of rules and the next set is:</P>
    <P>...all existing permanent district medical officers would have a right to be included in the list of participating doctors for the area, but that there would probably have to be some restriction on entry into the service by any doctors, to avoid too many doctors participating in any area and each not having a worthwhile panel.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Department intend that there should be a worthwhile panel. Now, what is a worthwhile panel?  In England, a GP gets 3,000 patients.  That is considered to be too many, so 2,000 would be a worthwhile panel.  At present 30 per cent of our population are on the register, and that is now going up to about 45 per cent.  If you take the number of dispensaries which have only 1,400 or fewer patients on the register, under the new scheme there would be 330 dispensary districts with 2,000 patients to be looked after.  That is about enough for one doctor.  I cannot see how these 330 dispensary areas will have more than one doctor. The Minister used the words &ldquo;a reasonable number&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Most of these dispensaries are in small towns and the capitation method cannot give a choice of doctor unless the lists are so small that they will not be worthwhile to anyone.  To my mind that is one of the great disadvantages of capitation.  It will give choice of doctor in the cities and in the urban areas, but it will not give choice of doctor in the rural areas&mdash; not only in the distant rural areas but <Col N="526" /> also in the more populous rural areas. I cannot see this capitation system working out properly.  I still feel that fee for service does not make second class citizens.</P>
    <P>I have no axe to grind.  I have gone into this as carefully as I could and I do not think it will cost any more to administer.  The Minister, when he was talking about dental technicians in the Dáil said:</P>
    <P>...I should have to be satisfied that a practice which has been apparently rejected by the authorities in the majority of European countries could be accepted in Ireland without danger to the health of the people.</P>
    <P>He knows in his heart of hearts that this is right.  Why should he apply capitation when it has been rejected in the majority of the European countries?  There is no country in Northern Europe, outside Russia, that has brought in legislation in the past 20 years in favour of capitation.  Why should we go backwards?  I think we would be foolish to go back.  Finland, which every one talks about as comparable with Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has my sympathy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The patient is my primary consideration.  We have been talking about doctors all evening and capitation or fee for service.  Let us talk about the patients who are my primary consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanAlton" hpid="Dr. Alton Dr. Alton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister frightened me earlier on when he talked so loudly. I know now that when he is on weak <Col N="527" /> ground he talks in a loud voice.  He has my sympathy about this because I, too, have had great difficulty in finding out what happens to the poor patients who have no money in those countries. I have here a letter from the Royal Swedish Embassy which says:</P>
      <P>As regards your question as to what happens if a doctor is called to someone so poor that he could not settle a bill there and then and do without the money until he got it back from the State, I wish to state that if he is not covered by an insurance scheme it is always possible for him to turn to the municipal social welfare boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="BryanAlton" hpid="Dr. Alton Dr. Alton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  That is the <Col N="528" /> point the Minister mentioned, the poor patient who has not got the money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a means test like the medical cards at present.  The Senator was talking about Finland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanAlton" hpid="Dr. Alton Dr. Alton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>Finland changed over two years ago to a fee per service system.  I believe that this is the only system for the future.  As it is, the capitation cost would be £3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Senator Alton is right and fee per service is the best.  He could be right.</P>
