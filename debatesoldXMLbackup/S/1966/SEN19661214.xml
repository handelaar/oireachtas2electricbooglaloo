      <P>As one of the oldest colleagues of the late Seán T. Ó Ceallaigh, I should like on behalf of Seanad Éireann to express sympathy with his widow and other relatives.</P>
      <P>Everyone here and elsewhere knows that in the national movement since he was a boy Seán T. took a leading part. I knew him for some 60 years and he brought honour to this country everywhere he went.  He was a man full of courage and no matter what the occasion was he always spoke out what he had to say and was afraid of nobody. I, personally, feel a deep sense of loss.</P>

      <P>In associating myself with the vote of sympathy which Senator Boland has proposed, I should like you to convey my deepest sympathy to the family of the late Mr. Seán T. Ó Ceallaigh.  I am, of course, conscious of the fact that it was never my privilege personally to have known the late Mr. Seán T. Ó Ceallaigh.  Nonetheless, as a young student of the State I was aware of the qualities of mind and heart which the late Mr. Seán T. Ó Ceallaigh possessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was a man of small stature but of great quality of mind and this he used for the betterment of his country.  We sometimes think of him as being the dignified personification of this country because the last 14 years of his public life were occupied in the Presidency, but we ought not to forget what Senator Boland has called to our minds that in his early days he played a tremendously important part in the history of <Col N="156" /> our State.  I think the Easter celebrations this year show exactly the importance of his position as Secretary of the Gaelic League and his association with the founders of Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>In those days he did not have the scope which later years gave him for the qualities he possessed and, indeed, as Minister for Local Government and Tánaiste in the Government which succeeded the Cosgrave Government in 1932 and subsequently as Minister for Finance, the late Mr. Ó Ceallaigh won the affection of all who knew him. We should remember that he was an able politician and a great fighter&mdash;a man who liked to use the trenchant phrase in order to give expression to the beliefs which he held so deeply. With the capacity and breadth of mind he possessed, as President he was able to dispense with the trappings and it is a further mark of the esteem in which he was held that his nomination as President for a second time was unopposed and he was elected unanimously.</P>
    <P>We all saw the fine though frail figure at the celebrations in Dublin Castle last June.  It was clear at that time that Mr. Ó Ceallaigh had won the admiration of all shades of political opinion.  Go ndéanfa Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my colleagues in the Seanad I should like to be associated with this vote of sympathy and expression of regret at the passing of the late Mr. Seán T. Ó Ceallaigh.  I, like many people here now, had not the privilege of working with Mr. Seán T. Ó Ceallaigh but I think we all knew him as a very lovable and highly respected character who had the respect of all political parties and all shades of opinion in this country.  No matter what post he held he always did the job very efficiently and I think we all regret his passing.</P>

      <P>Thar cheann mo chomhsheanadóirí ó Ollscoil na hÉireann agus thar mo cheann féin, ba maith liom ár gcomhbhrón a chur in iúl do bhaintreach agus do mhuintir an Iar-Uachtaráin, Seán T. Ó Ceallaigh. Mar atá ráite ag Seanadóirí eile <Col N="157" /> cheana, agus ag go leor eile nach iad, ba dhuine é ar chóir don chine Gael neith bródúil as.  Thug sé go fial dá dhúthracht agus dá bhuanna pearsanta ar son a thíre.  Ba dhuine é ar mhór aige i gcónaí neamhspleachas, cultúr, saíocht agus teanga na hÉireann.  Ní fhéadfaí taidhleoir ab fhearr ná é d'fháil ar an náisiún Gaelach, mar ina dhearcadh, ina phearsain agus ina iompar, ba fíor-oidhre é ar an náisiún sin.</P>
      <P>Is bochtaide an náisiún a bhás.  Is trua go gcaithimid scarúint lena leithéid.  Go gcúití Dia leis a shaothar uasal agus go dtuga Sé áit árd do i gcomhluadar a Chuid aingeal.</P>

      <P>I should like to associate myself with this vote of sympathy to the widow and relations of the late Mr. Seán T. Ó Ceallaigh.  I had the privilege of knowing him slightly and of appreciating his warm friendliness for all who came in contact with him.</P>
      <P>I should like to recall a fact that has not been mentioned&mdash;his links with France.  He was Republican representative in France representing his country right back in the days of the first Dáil and won a great deal of appreciation and understanding for the Irish cause in France by his knowledge and by his good nature.</P>
      <P>He was, as many of us recall, an admirable host and I think Senator O'Quigley was right in recalling that when he became President he, as a host, was entirely oblivious to any differences of Party politics and represented, I think, in every sense the best spirit of Irish hospitality.  He had an Irish welcome for everybody he received and he received a great number in Árus an Uachtaráin.</P>
      <P>With his passing I think we all feel a sense of loss.</P>

      <P>As a representative of the graduates of Trinity College I should like to be associated with this vote of sympathy to the relatives of the late Mr. Seán T. Ó Ceallaigh.  I had the pleasure of knowing him, not very well, but I had also the privilege of working with him, in a sense, in the early days of <Col N="158" /> the Medical Research Council.  When this Council was set up he was Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  The smallness of our grant on that occasion was a cause of some embarrassment to us and necessitated a number of discussions with him.  He was extremely sympathetic on all those occasions.  He did not have any knowledge directly himself of science. I think he had not worked in this field but we were always received by him with very great sympathy and we appreciated this and were encouraged by it.  I am sure my colleagues on the Council would like me to be associated with this vote of sympathy.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise one small matter on the Schedule to the Act; it may be quite unimportant. We are providing in section (3) that the Council may accept gifts of money, land and other property for the purpose of the fund.  It does not seem to provide that the Comhairle can dispose of the land.  They may accept these gifts for the purpose of the fund but if, for example, they get a gift of land, presumably they would have to sell the land in order to be able to utilise it for the purpose of the fund.  It may not be necessary, but we do not seem to be giving them the power to be able to sell the land in order to utilise the money they would be able to get from it.  Maybe it is covered by something else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 (4) (a) of the Arts Act, 1951, reads:</P>
      <P>The Government may from time to time by order confer or impose on the Council such additional functions as the Government think proper and specify in the order, and any order made under this paragraph may contain such incidental and supplementary provisions as the Government think necessary or expedient for giving full effect to the order.</P>
      <P>On the 5th July, 1966, the Government made an Order&mdash;the Arts Act, 1951 (Additional Function) Order, 1966&mdash;authorising An Chomhairle Ealaíon to establish and administer a fund to help creative workers in the fine and applied arts who are advanced in years or who, because of ill-health, are unable to provide for themselves. The Council hope that the fund will be financed by voluntary subscriptions and gifts of property.</P>
      <P>The Arts Act, 1951 provides that the Order will not come into operation unless it is confirmed by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the Senator can take it that this power does reside in An Chomhairle Ealaíon.</P>

      <P>Before the motion is passed, I should like to welcome this addition to the operations of the Arts Council.  It is inevitable, in the days in which we live, that the main patron of the arts must be the State.  It is good to see the State is now recognising, through the instrument of the Arts Council, it should take some action in regard to these creative artists who, however difficult they may find it to make a living in their full vigour and strength, find it utterly impossible to do so once their health wanes.  I should hope that this would be only the first move in the enlargement of this patronage function of the Arts Council which it exercises on behalf of the whole <Col N="160" /> community.  I should hope that there would be further moves in this direction. I should hope, too, that the Arts Council would be vigorous in their attempt to canvass support so that they might, through the operation of this order, become the channel through which individuals, who are unable themselves to make any worthwhile contribution to this upkeep of creative artists in their old age, would&mdash;through this particular fund&mdash;be able to do it as a common enterprise.  It is, indeed, a welcome departure and we hope it will be followed by others.</P>

      <P>I should like to support what Senator Dooge has said and to add to it a question as to what is the reason for the exclusion in the order of certain types of artists, actors, musicians and so on.  I imagine there is some basic reason for that but I did not hear any reference to it.</P>

      <P>Section 1 of the Arts Act, 1951, states:</P>
      <P>In this Act&mdash;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;the arts&rdquo; means painting, sculpture, architecture, music, the drama, literature, design in industry and the fine arts and applied arts generally;</P>
      <P>Under the Act the functions of An Chomhairle Ealaíon are confined to this, so that any grants or annuities that may be paid under this new innovation must be confined, under the section, to people under these various cultural headings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is only my interpretation of it.  I can certainly think of one or two names which come to my mind of very fine actors who would come within the heading of drama and literature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The exclusion refers only to actors, theatrical producers, instrumentalists or conductors in respect of their interpretative work, so that in so far as they are concerned purely with the interpretative aspects of the work, they are excluded, but where such actors, theatrical producers, musicians or conductors are concerned with creative work, then that would come within the definition envisaged in the section.  An Chomhairle Ealaíon were designed to deal with creative artists, as set out in the section, and the extension is to provide for such creative actors.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister consider the question as to whether some injustice is not being done by this exclusion, which may be necessary under the Act, but nevertheless will not cover many people one would like to see assisted and, even though their art is an ephemeral or transient one is, nonetheless, highly creative?  I am just asking if the Minister would give some consideration to some ways and means for including people whose art, like that of the actor or conductor, was a transient one but is, nonetheless, creative in the full sense.</P>

        <i>(Longford):</i> Is there <Col N="162" /> not an organisation having some responsibility&mdash;I do not know whether it is a voluntary one&mdash;and catering for actors, musicians, conductors and such people, rather than for creative art?

We are saying in this amendment that &ldquo;used for the purposes of business&rdquo; means &ldquo;used wholly or in part for the purposes of business&rdquo;.

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to clarify that that category is in.  In the Commission's original recommendation it was confined purely to residential premises.  We have already brought business premises within the Bill to obviate that type of argument which would be used in the case postulated by Senator O'Quigley. As the Bill stands, it covers all types of premises: business premises, business premises cum private residences, and private residences.

What I am concerned about is that when you define the &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; as a premises that is used wholly or in part for the purposes of business you might be excluding premises used in part only for professional purposes.  I think the Minister will agree that if we define one term and do not define another, the courts may interpret it that the term was defined to include exactly what it said, and because the other term was not defined the courts might say that a distinction was drawn by the Legislature between the two.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 21, to delete &ldquo;as respects&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;with respect to&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The point of each of these amendments is exactly the same and anything I say about this amendment applies to the other two.  This is merely a verbal amendment because it sounds strange to my ear to use this phrase &ldquo;as respects&rdquo;.  The subsection reads:</P>
      <P>A person who, as respects any land, is a person to whom this section applies, shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, have the right as incident to his existing interest in the land to enlarge that interest into a fee simple, and for that purpose to acquire by purchase the fee simple in the land and any intermediate interests therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This turn of phrase &ldquo;as respects&rdquo; does not seem to be quite right.  I think it is a kind of hybrid deriving from &ldquo;as regards&rdquo; and that it is intended to mean &ldquo;with respect to&rdquo;. The Oxford Dictionary does not recognise &ldquo;as respects&rdquo;.  It does recognise &ldquo;as regards&rdquo;.  Mr. H. Fowler in his <i>Modern English Usage</i> does not recognise &ldquo;as respects&rdquo;, and does not think very much of &ldquo;with respect to&rdquo; which I am suggesting in the amendment. He recommends that it should be used as rarely as possible.  The alternatives he suggests are &ldquo;about&rdquo; or <Col N="166" />&ldquo;for&rdquo; and they would not really apply here.  I notice that in section 5 (3) and in section 8 (3) the phrase &ldquo;in respect of&rdquo; is used.  The phrase which seems acceptable to me in sections 9 and 13 is &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo;.  Here it would seem on balance that the most satisfactory expression would be &ldquo;with respect to&rdquo;.  I do not think that even in legal jargon &ldquo;as respects any land&rdquo; would bear examination and, therefore, I propose that in these three cases we change &ldquo;as respects&rdquo; to &ldquo;with respect to&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>As I said on the Second Stage, it seems to be futile for this House to spend its time providing that a lessee shall be entitled to acquire the fee simple of property and then to continue unabated the evil which we are seeking to remove in this section. All kinds of excuses can be thought up for doing nothing.  The simplest thing in the world is to do nothing. It is very easy for people to find excuses as to why nothing ought to be done.  It is traditional in a certain branch of one of our great institutions to find reasons as to why things cannot be done.  We all know that if you impose restrictions on the creation of ground rents you may, if you do not take corrective action, cause the price of land available for house building to increase.  But that is not an excuse for the gross exploitation of young married couples by the present owners of land and some house-builders. Settling down in life is a sufficiently difficult matter nowadays without having to pay exorbitant prices for land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that this is a problem in this country, and it is a problem rendered acute by the failure of the Department of Local Government and of certain local authorities to provide the main sewerage and drainage necessary for certain areas around our towns.  Money has not been made available for that kind of work, and consequently the work of developing the land may sometimes be a great deal <Col N="168" /> more expensive than it ought to be and land in some areas is just not available for house building, or if it is within the ambit of existing sewerage schemes it is at a premium.  These are all problems that must be faced. Simply burying one's head in the sand will not solve them.</P>
    <P>The same problem of land and the price of land for house building has arisen in England, and we know of the corrective action taken over there by the present English Government.  It is a remarkable thing in 1966 to see that an English Government is establishing an institution analogous to our venerable institution, the Land Commission, and known by the title of the Land Commission, in order to deal with the gross exploitation of people who require houses by the owners of land and building sites.</P>
    <P>In my view one of the most essential things is houses for people to live in. We have price stabilisation orders dealing with the price of bread, meat and other commodities, and orders dealing with a variety of hardware and ironmongery and other commodities, but there is no price stabilisation order in respect of a commodity, which is absolutely essential to the wellbeing of a great many people in the community; there is nothing in relation to the price of land.</P>
    <P>I can think of a simple means of regulating the price of land.  It cannot be said that there are not adequate powers in the Housing Acts for the compulsory acquisition of land by local authorities so that in certain cases local authorities having acquired land and developed it are in a position to sell it to persons seeking to build houses. In these circumstances it seems that where land can be sold subject to a price to be fixed under the Acquisition of Land (Compensation) Act, 1919, the price need not necessarily be an exorbitant, inflated current market price.  I do not think that the people who own the land of Ireland in and around our towns and cities ought to be entitled to exploit the needs of those who require to build houses on it.</P>
    <P>I can think of another method of making land available for people who <Col N="169" /> wish to be housed at a reasonable price, by taking the rateable valuation of land, which remains constant since the Valuation Acts came into operation, and multiplying the valuation by whatever might be considered a reasonable multiplier.  Agricultural land in the region of our towns generally has a valuation of between 10/- and £1 an acre.  If one were to say that the current price for agricultural land was £200, £250 or £300 an acre depending upon the area, there is no reason why you should not multiply the rateable valuation and fix the price of land for housing as being 600 times the valuation, which would give a figure of £300 an acre in the case of land valued at 10/-an acre or by 300 for land valued at £1 an acre which would give a price of £300 an acre.</P>
    <P>It seems to be a futile exercise on our part to deplore the creation of ground rents and at the same time permit under this Bill the future creation of ground rents.  It is a nonsensical exercise.  For that reason I put down amendments Nos. 4 and 5 to exclude the creation of building leases after the commencement of this Bill, and the more specific amendment No. 46 to provide that after the passing of this Bill it shall not be lawful in any lease of land for the purpose of building thereon to reserve a rent or other periodic payment, and to invalidate any such reservation on land by the lease.  I think that there is an unanswerable case against the continuation of these ground rents, and the only reason why they are being continued is the failure of the Minister and his colleagues in the Government to face up to the fact that, difficult though it may be to control ground rents, it is absolutely essential that this should be done if the members of the public who must buy land for the purpose of building are not to continue to be exploited in the way they have been up to the present, more particularly in the last ten or 15 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I went through this matter very fully on the Second Stage in the course of my reply.  Let me say at the outset that initially I was very struck with the idea of prohibiting <Col N="170" /> absolutely the creation of future ground rents.  However, when I teased out the situation very fully I could see, as well as my colleagues, that the immediate effect of prohibiting future ground rents would be to put up the cost of building houses as far as the builders were concerned and thereby put up the initial cost of houses as far as intending purchasers were concerned. I have no intention of inserting in a Bill here a section which would mean an immediate increase in the price of houses and an immediate increase in the capital which young married couples who are purchasing houses must find.  This is the reality of the situation.</P>
      <P>There is much merit in what Senator O'Quigley says in regard to controlling the price of development land.  This is something which could be investigated. There is a number of obvious snags in that as well.  However, this is something entirely outside the scope of this Bill.  One would want to bring in a very comprehensive measure to deal with land development and the price of land adjacent to urban areas to cover this matter.  I suggest that it is outside the scope of this Bill which is mainly concerned with the buying out of ground rents.  There is much in what Senator O'Quigley said but it is a matter which would require very close investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already said, the immediate effect of doing what the Senator suggests would be to put up the price of houses as far as young married couples are concerned.  I was very attracted to the idea of prohibiting the creation of future ground rents but after investigation, I changed my mind.  I do not accept that the Bill is not going far enough.  It represents a considerable advance on a Bill being introduced by the British Government on the subject at present.  There is another aspect as far as young married couples are concerned.  Those are the people about whom the Senator should be concerned.  I do not think that the provisions of this Bill will be of any great interest to them immediately. They will be interested in buying out their ground rents after a number <Col N="171" /> of years when they have sufficient funds accumulated.  At the very start they will, naturally enough, be stuck for money and their main interest will be to keep the initial cost of the house down as low as possible.  For this reason they will not be very interested to exercise their right in regard to purchasing the ground rent.</P>
    <P>Another practical consideration is this.  I think I said this on the Second Stage.  If the Bill as it now stands becomes law those who were previously interested in investing money in ground rents will get out of that type of investment.  Already the trend has set in.  People who have traditionally invested in ground rents are getting out of them very rapidly.  When this Bill becomes law, it will mean the virtual abolition of investment in ground rents because it will become unattractive.  Ground rents will then gradually disappear.  The aim of insurance companies and trustee companies, who are the people who used to buy ground rents, is to have a secure long term form of investment. This disappears when the tenant can buy out at any stage, and I think that for that reason this Bill will lead to the disappearance of ground rents.</P>
    <P>The final point which persuaded me against the absolute prohibition of ground rents is that it might be unconstitutional. The right of everyone to dispose of his property as he wishes is enshrined in the Constitution.  If you remove the absolute right of a person to dispose of his property as he wishes you may be interfering with the rights of property owners.  This could be questioned in the courts.  I do not want to have anything introduced into this Bill which could allow it to be torpedoed in that way.  There are, therefore, three practical considerations and one Constitutional consideration which made me change my view and made me stick to the idea that what we have here, a flexible system whereby people have the right to purchase their ground rents, is better in the long run, particularly when I am certain that this scheme will lead to the virtual abolition of ground rents over a period of time.</P>

I do not for a moment think that the Minister considered whether this matter of the <Col N="173" /> ground rents was unconstitutional or not.  Mark you, the Minister, who is very concerned about the Constitution, should have regard to the fact that in September, 1939, this House and the Dáil passed a law suspending the Constitution for the duration of the emergency.  The Constitution still remains suspended as a result of that and the Emergency has not concluded despite the fact that it is more than 20 years after the end of the Second World War.</P>

      <P>To come back to the Minister's argument on this, he says that if we prohibit the creation of ground rents that will increase the cost of housing.  He goes on to say that young married people will not be concerned with buying out their ground rents.  Of course, young married people would not be at all concerned with buying out their ground rents if such rents were not permitted to be created. That does not answer the question at all.  What I want first of all to provide is that a young married couple will not unnecessarily have to pay £14 or £15 per annum to a ground landlord for no reason whatever other than that the ground landlord has the land and is able to enforce his will over a defenceless couple.  This has been going on for years and it is something we are remedying in this Bill to some extent retrospectively.  It is something that every Member of this House, excepting Senator E. Ryan, regrets.  We all regret the creation of ground rents with the exception of Senator E. Ryan who has some grave and serious misgivings about it.  That is what we want to prevent.  It seems to me to be wrong to provide we are going to entitle people to buy out their ground rents and at the same time allow these rents to be <Col N="174" /> created in the future.  It is the most unnecessary exercise that this House has ever engaged in.  The Minister's next argument is that the immediate effect of preventing the creation of ground rents will be to increase the price of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of land and, therefore, the price of houses.  Of course, it is outside the scope of this Bill as read a Second Time to deal with the price of land but it is equally true that the Minister and other members of the Government have collective responsibility for the production of this Bill for consideration by the Oireachtas.  It was not outside the competence of the Minister for Justice to point out to the Minister for Local Government that it was desirable that the price of land should be controlled. Concurrently with this Bill or immediately afterwards we could consider a Bill dealing with the price of land.  I believe that the price of land can be stabilised at a fair and reasonable level by reference to a multiplier. I would give the Minister power to provide for different multipliers for land in different areas.  That having been done, one would get some stability in the price of houses that young married couples or anybody else, even old married couples who have been living in a house provided for them during their employment, would be buying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind there is no reason why this gross exploitation of people buying houses should be permitted to continue. When I say gross exploitation I mean just that.  The evidence of that is to be found in the fact that Dublin Corporation and other local bodies such as Dublin County Council and the building societies no longer advance money on the basis of the price of the house paid by the person seeking the loan.  They always value the house property at their own valuation and there is nearly always a considerable gap between what Dublin Corporation or Dublin County Council or the various building and insurance societies <Col N="175" /> value the house at and the price charged to the customer.  That difference represents the excess charged by the builder for the house over and above a fair and reasonable price.</P>
    <P>Ground rents in the city of Dublin would be a great deal higher but for the fact that the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act section of the County Council would not grant loans for houses where the ground rent was higher than £14 or £15 for a certain size of site.  That is the scandal which the Minister and the Government are permitting to continue.  The Minister is prepared to sit back and say: &ldquo;Let it be, because to remedy it would mean bringing in something that is outside the scope of this Bill.&rdquo;  The Minister, if he wanted to remedy the evil which should never have been permitted for so long, could have asked the Minister for Local Government to bring in a Bill or indeed a provision to deal with the control of land prices for house purchase could have been brought within the scope of this Bill.  The evidence is there before the Minister and before the Government and we are going to allow that to continue.  I do not for a moment accept that by abolishing ground rents you are necessarily going to increase the price of houses: the Minister himself supplies the argument against that when he says that ground rents are on the wane as an investment.  If they are on the wane as an investment there is no incentive to create them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>That can be dealt with by <i>ad hoc</i> legislation, if necessary. If they are on the wane, then that strengthens the argument that we ought to prohibit them because if they are going to wither away with the passing of time because they cease to be a good investment for those who have surplus capital, then you are not doing any injury constitutionally, financially or otherwise, to the people who would be disposed to create ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister thought it was unconstitutional to fix a maximum price, <Col N="176" /> then it is very easy to get rid of that provision in the Bill.  It is quite easy for a few cases to be decided as to what is the factor that is to be used for determining the amount of multiplier to be used in determining the price of ground.  People would soon grasp the precedents provided by a few test cases.  There is no argument whatever for leaving the Bill as it stands except the argument that there is a problem there that requires to be solved and that a lethargy has overtaken the Minister or perhaps he is fatigued after the recent by-election campaigns.  We see Ministers spending their time looking at gravel pits and the like instead of attending to their work; yesterday the Minister for Local Government presented a prize to somebody out in Stillorgan.  When Ministers are busily engaged at these important functions they cannot get down to solving the problem of what ought to be an equitable price for land.  Such a problem could be solved by a few days' consideration&mdash;a little more time spent by Ministers in their offices is all that is needed.  If we had that we would have the solution to a scandal which has been going on for too long and which we are going to allow to continue in the future.</P>

      <P>I confess I was puzzled also by the Minister's contention that if he were to accept these amendments it might be deemed unconstitutional.  I think he said that the ground rent, as it were, was, in fact, the property of the ground landlord and that consequently it might be considered unconstitutional for the ground landlord &ldquo;to be prevented from doing what he liked with it,&rdquo; as was I think the phrase he used.  Of course, there are all kinds of laws to prevent people from doing certain things with their own property.  This very Bill is for the purpose of forcing him to sell this commodity about which the Minister claims he has a right to do what he likes so I am afraid this objection falls to the ground.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I listened to Senator O'Quigley with much interest but I fail to appreciate his point.  The <Col N="177" /> real expense in a building site is not so much the ground itself as the development of the ground.  Many local authorities take over land, not for building houses for the working classes, but to enable people living within the urban authority area to acquire sites. The urban authority, say, take over five or ten acres of land; they develop it, put in roads, sewers, lay on lights and, when all that is done, work out the cost to themselves.  My experience of local authorities and of the people in the urban areas is that the people then prefer simply to pay for the cost of building their house&mdash;the contract, the bargain they make with the contractor&mdash;the local authority give them the site at a certain percentage of the capital cost per house, the local authority themselves having borrowed the money through the Local Loans Fund, at a rate which is usually one-quarter per cent or one-half per cent over and above what the local authority paid for it.</P>
      <P>If Senator O'Quigley's amendments were to be accepted, all that, in the future, would be invalid.  Then people who would wish to build houses or wish to acquire those houses would, in the future, have to find considerably more capital than they have to find at present.  Therefore, from that point of view and also from the point of view of builders themselves, it would be disadvantageous.  Senator O'Quigley says that if you fix the price of land, if you fix the price at which he can sell it, then everything is fine, but, at the moment, the people in most need of houses are the working classes.  These people have the right to acquire sites, to go to arbitration to have the price fixed and get their own house.  If people wish to build very expensive houses, or wish to have these housing sites, it is up to them to pay for the particular site they want, buy it in fee simple or under a ground rent but there is no injustice ultimately done because there are other considerations, the site being really the smallest cost of the entire house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you want, as Senator O'Quigley wants, to let everybody have cheap houses, then you must have a definite price fixed which you can charge for <Col N="178" /> a house, on so many cubic feet.  If you follow it to its logical conclusion, you must also fix, on the basis of the poor law valuation or otherwise, the prices of houses which are now occupied and are up for sale, because many young married people are buying houses which are on the market for sale, not necessarily new houses.  No injustice is done because at any stage, young folk having built a new house and finding themselves in a better position afterwards, can, under the terms of this Bill, then buy out the ground rent, at what would be a reasonable multiplication of the ground rent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get a few things quite clear.  I do not follow Senator Nash's line of argument at all, because let us not forget that this Parliament passed an Act&mdash;the Rent Restrictions Act of 1960&mdash;which controls the rents of a whole series of houses and does not permit landlords to charge what they like.  It is rather, I presume, the kind of houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind whether a person has a house which he can rent or which he can buy, provided he is not exploited.  There is no protection whatever &mdash; equivalent to the protection afforded under the Rent Restrictions Act&mdash;for the person buying a house, which is about to be built or which has recently been built. The Minister and the Government should face up to the fact that there is gross exploitation of people in that category and the test of that, the proof of that pudding, is to be found in Part VII of the Finance Act of 1965 which skims off the large exorbitant profits which were being made out of the development of land. People were getting away with thousands of pounds out of the development of land and, even this Government were moved&mdash;I suppose for financial rather than for social reasons&mdash;to provide for the taking from land developers huge slices of income which had previously gone untaxed or which they were able, by very devious and questionable <Col N="179" /> methods, to avoid paying income tax upon.  That may not be very good English but it will do for the moment. Part VII of the Finance Act of 1965 is the proof that there are great profits being made by the developers of land.</P>
      <P>Here we are going to allow the creation of future ground rents by those land developers.  A possible solution to some of the inequities of Part VII, and there are some&mdash;I think the idea of having to pay income tax upon the capitalised value of a ground rent upon its creation and then continuing to pay income tax on the same ground rent from the first year of the lease is somewhat iniquitous&mdash;would be to have some kind of control of the price of land and, at the same time, repeal Part VII of the Finance Act of 1965. If you had a control of a reasonable character, Part VII would become a redundant piece of income tax legislation, because the huge profits would not be made and would not then be assessable to income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not understand Senator Nash's talk about the cost of developing land.  I have always understood that the grant which was provided for anybody building a house under the Housing Acts&mdash;the £275 or under a provident society £285&mdash;was for the purpose of buying the cost of development. It can be argued that that should have been increased but that did at one time, sometime in the 50s, represent the cost of development.  But, consequently, the building contractor, when he gets the £275 has been paid already for the cost of development. It may fall a bit short and it is not correct to say, as Senator Nash said, that the site fine&mdash;the cost of a site&mdash; is only a small part of the price of the house.  It may be a small part to a man of the liberal means of Senator Nash but the sum of, say, £800 to a person with an income of £15, £17 or £20 a week is a very considerable sum to have to pay on a site of, maybe, one-eighth of an acre, or whatever it is in the housing estates around Dublin; £500, £600 or £700 is an extremely heavy impost.  The worst of it is that <Col N="180" /> at least one-third of that is now going in income tax to the Exchequer but the rapacity of such a builder&mdash;and his hope of eventually dodging the income tax&mdash;will not permit him to charge what would be merely the cost of the development of the land.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the 1965 Finance Act is a clear indication that there is big money being made out of land being developed for house-building purposes. The Government sit back and permit that to continue under this Bill&mdash;that gross exploitation, that immediate unnecessary big charge made upon young married couples&mdash;and, on top of that, say to the builder: &ldquo;You may create your ground rent as well&rdquo;.  The Minister should take serious note of this problem.  I know it is not his particular province to control the price of land but I do think he ought to bring to the notice of his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, the facts I have put before him.  I believe that an examination of these facts and the very cogent evidence provided in Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965, will convince the Minister for Local Government and other members of the Government that the price of land ought to be and can be controlled to the advantage of house purchasers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall bring what the Senator has said to the attention of the Minister for Local Government. There are arguments in favour of what he has said in regard to the control of such land, but there are difficulties too, difficulties which might, indeed, hinder rather than help house building which is what we wish to encourage. If there were not such incentives towards the development of land we might find that houses were not being built.  I want to enter that <i>caveat</i> against what he said.  This is not a matter of easy solution but I shall bring it to the attention of the Minister for Local Government.  As I said, I think it is outside the ambit of this Bill.  I shall not refer again to the constitutional position.  That is open to argument in the Supreme Court and it was not uppermost in my mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main reason for deciding against <Col N="181" /> prohibiting the creation of future ground rents was to ensure that the price of housing would not go up for the categories about whom Senator O'Quigley is so concerned, young married couples who are in a position to buy their houses.  The immediate effect of this Bill would, if we prohibit the creation of future ground rents, be to put a further burden of £200 or £300 on the price of the house.  That was my most pressing reason in deciding not to prohibit the creation of future ground rents.  Young married couples are not interested in buying out their ground rents.  Their concern is to get a house as cheaply as possible so that the mortgage repayments do not bear too heavily on them.  The purchase of ground rents is a matter that arises for business people and people with houses at a later stage when they want to become the absolute owners of their residences or business premises.  For young married couples ground rents are not uppermost in their minds.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), lines 39 to 48, to delete paragraph (d), and substitute the following paragraph:</P>

      <P>Senator O'Quigley has asked me to explain the section as a whole and the amendments which we propose in the context of the section as a whole.  The amendment which we propose here is designed to meet the point made in the Dáil by Deputy M.J. O'Higgins and I think it goes some way to meet the amendment put down by Senator O'Quigley which follows this amendment.  To go down through the section as a whole, <i>seriatum,</i> first of all the section deals with the general right to acquire fee simple, to buy out the ground rent under a building lease and a proprietary lease.  That is straightforward enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister tell us what is included in a building lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A building lease and a proprietary lease are defined in the 1958 Act.  The section also deals with a person who held land under a building lease which has expired or a proprietary lease which has expired but who is still entitled to be granted a reversionary lease of the land under the 1958 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Originally, the intention was to confine the Bill to building lessees and proprietary lessees which are the normal ground rent categories.  We then decided in subsection (2) (d) to bring in the yearly tenant, that is a person who has been continuously in occupation of the land which is a tenement <Col N="184" /> within the meaning of the 1931 Act, as a yearly tenant for 25 years&mdash;originally, we had that at 50 years but we amended it to 25 years in the Dáil, at a yearly rent of an amount that is less than the amount of the rateable valuation of the land.  The effect of that is to bring in a yearly tenant of a tenement under the 1931 Act who has been paying rent of less than the valuation of the premises and has been there for a period of 25 years.  The purpose is to bring within the Bill people who have acquired a real equity in the property by being there for 25 years or more and whose rents are so low as to bring them into the ground rent category.  Rents in excess of the valuation would be regarded as rack-rents and would be outside that category.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil Deputy O'Higgins pushed the point&mdash;and I was impressed by it&mdash; that in addition to yearly tenants we should include certain leases.  The purpose of the amendment which we are now considering is to extend the right of purchase also to lessees who are not building or proprietary lessees but whose rents are also ground rents. These are persons occupying land which is a tenement under a lease for a term of not less that 99 years which will expire 25 years or more after the date of the service of a notice under section 4.  In effect, what this amendment does is to extend the right to purchase and so widen the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Although I have gone far outside what was originally envisaged I have decided not to go too far.  This applies also to other sections, because the law relating to leaseholds and in particular the reform of the 1931 Act is under consideration by a Landlord and Tenant Commission established by me this time last year.  I understand the Commission will be coming up with certain positive recommendations about reforming the 1931 Act in the very near future which will be, I hope, incorporated in a Landlord and Tenant Bill in the new year.  In addition to that, I have asked this Commission, presided over by Judge Conroy, to examine the whole question of the <Col N="185" /> Landlord and Tenant Acts going right back to Deasy's Act, 1861.  Following the amendment of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, I should like to see a situation arising where I or somebody will get a final consolidation Bill in about two years' time, so that the complete law relating to Landlord and Tenant, including the present Bill and the Bill which I hope to introduce next year, will be contained in one comprehensive statute.  That is broadly my thinking on the matter.  I hope that I have explained the section and the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is grateful to the Minister for his comprehensive treatment of the section.  I think that the Government amendment goes a good distance to meeting amendment No. 7 which I had down.  As the Minister says, it is a matter for speculation as to whether or not the amount of the original valuation should be the factor&mdash;he has told us that in the case of pre-1914 valuations, it is less than three-quarters of the amount and in any other cases is less than the actual rateable valuation.  What I am somewhat puzzled about&mdash;perhaps the Minister will be able to assist me&mdash;is that we have put in a certain number of categories from (a) to (d) in sub-section (2), and then we begin to eliminate in subsections (3) and (4) certain types from these categories.  The reference in subsection (2) to a proprietary lease does not include under subsection (3) a lease of land used for the purpose of business.  I wonder if the Minister can clarify what is meant by that.  One can clearly see the rest of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (4), though yearly tenants of tenements within the meaning of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, are covered in paragraph (d) of subsection (2), we eliminate under this paragraph (b) of subsection (4) the category of persons who occupy land as yearly tenants if the buildings in the land were not erected by the person in occupation of the land or by another person while in occupation of the land as lessee or tenant.  There is a presumption that the buildings were, in fact, built by the occupier or his predecessor in title.  I wonder what the value of <Col N="186" /> paragraph (d) of subsection (2) is in the light of the exclusions contained in subsection (3) in relation to business and paragraph (b) in subsection (4). Perhaps the Minister might be able to indicate the broad category of persons he has in mind, because he seems to be liberal in paragraph (d) and then his liberality is cut short by paragraph (b) of subsection (4).</P>

      <P>As regards paragraph (i) of subsection (3), in any case where the parties entered into an arrangement in which there was a variation clause enabling the rent to be varied up or down during the continuation of the tenancy, it would be inappropriatae to deal with the lease as if a ground rent&mdash;that is a fixed rent&mdash;arrangement existed.</P>

      <P>This again applies only to a yearly tenant where the buildings were not erected by the tenant in occupation or by a previous tenant.  The presumption is that they were so erected.

As far as the proof that the buildings were erected by somebody other than the occupier, that seems to me to be a very reasonable approach to the problem and to bring in a fair number of people.  On the question of the rateable valuation of a property referred to in the amendment now introduced by the Minister, where you have a lease for 99 years of which 25 or more remain unexpired and where the land is under a particular valuation, am I right in thinking that that can be any kind of lease, an ordinary lease of property, and the person is entitled to buy out the ground rent?</P>

      <P>That seems to me to be satisfactory.  The people of Waterford city or Waterford county where the valuations were revised sometime in the 1920s or 1930s enjoy an advantage. The rateable valuation in respect of Waterford is higher than that of any other county.  I do not want to deprive the people of Waterford of any advantage which may accrue to them under this Bill.  I think there is a provision in the income tax law where in the case of, I think it is Schedule A, it is always 1¼ or 1½ times the valuation but there <Col N="188" /> is an exception made in the case of Waterford.</P>

If the Government get comfort out of that I shall not deny them the illusory comfort it provides them for the time being.  The Minister will know that as regards income tax for the rest of the country&mdash;Senator Nash will be more familiar with this&mdash;the fact is that for Schedule A it is 1¼ times the valuation. We had that all those years.  We have to pay income tax on that basis. The Minister might consider, instead of it being the rateable valuation in respect of premises where the lease was made post 1914, increasing the valuation 1¼ times.  There is a good precedent for that under the income tax law.  It might be fairer that that would apply to all cases, except the city of Waterford, where there is this higher valuation imposed on holders of land.  While agreeing with the Minister's amendment as it stands, I would ask him to look at that in the light of the statutory provisions in relation to income taxation.</P>

      <P>I was concerned about providing that where land might be held which was lower than the rateable valuation and there were no buildings on it a person might be entitled to buy out the ground rent and acquire the entire fee simple.  There is a case to be made where you have land in excess of what is actually required for building purposes.  One finds that there are too few open spaces especially on the outskirts of Dublin.  There is a general move in building estates around Dublin to try to get urban authorities to provide some open space. Indeed, in some cases, residents associations have combined to buy out some of those open spaces for the purpose of providing playing fields, parks and community centres for the local community.  Amendment No. 8 was designed to deal with the case where you could have such open space after housing requirements were completed. The Minister's amendment probably meets the situation.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the drafting of subsection (3) (i).  The sub-section provides in effect that the right to purchase the fee simple shall not apply to modern business leases which contain rent review clauses.  This amendment distinguishes between this type of lease and the type of lease taken by a builder which may have a clause enabling the rent to be altered on the completion of each house or on the completion of all the houses.  This type of lease is not uncommon.  This is to make quite clear that this sort of clause inserted in the lease will not preclude the tenant from the right of purchase.  We are narrowing down the exclusion from the right of purchase purely to the cases where there is the genuine variation clause&mdash;for instance enabling the rent to be altered every seven years.  This is widening the scope of the Bill and restricting the exemption from it.</P>

It provides that any fine paid by the lessee will be taken into consideration &mdash;one-twentieth of it will be added to the rent.  This is not in the tenant's interest but I have undertaken to have a look at it with a view to bringing a greater degree of uniformity into all the categories embodied in the addition to subsection (2)&mdash;that is the yearly tenancy category and the new lease category&mdash;so that the same criterion would apply to them all in respect of the valuation, to have no distinction between them.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might be permitted to make this observation. We do not seem to have got rid of the fee farm rent and I take it we are not doing that in the section.  A fee farm rent, to my mind, is as much a nuisance as the ground rent.  It seems to me that, under this section, we are not making provision for the elimination of fee farm rent, which is never <Col N="199" /> any more, indeed, than a ground rent, but perhaps the Minister would clarify that.  We are dealing with it in this section and, indeed, a fee farm rent, when bought out, will give to the owner of the property exactly the same kind of interest as, or an almost analogous interest, that of a person who buys out the ground rent under a lease.  Fee farm is normally subject to certain conditions but more particularly to the right of re-entry in the event of non-payment of the fee farm grant which is only £3, £4, £5 or £10. It is probably less than the ground rent.  I wonder whether the Minister has adverted to that.</P>

      <P>The same point was raised in the Dáil and we brought in an amendment to section 2, the interpretation section stating that &ldquo;fee simple&rdquo; does not include the interest in land of a person holding the land under a fee farm grant.  That was intended to give the fee farm grantee the same right to purchase which is given to other tenants in this Bill.  The fee farm grantee has the same rights as other ground rent tenants mentioned in the Bill.  If the Senator looks at the interpretation section he will see it. This precise point was raised in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>Before section 4 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person who proposes to acquire the fee simple in land by virtue of this Act shall serve a notice in the prescribed form upon each of the following persons who can be found and ascertained, that is to say, the person who is for the time being entitled to the next superior interest in the land, every (if any) person who is, in relation to the land, the superior lessor of the person so proposing and every (if any) person who is the owner of an incumbrance thereon.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment No. 18 seeks to add a new subsection to this proposed new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) The person entitled to the next superior interest to a person who proposes to acquire the fee simple in the land and every other person entitled to a superior interest or their respective agents, shall, on being requested in writing by the lessee supply the lessee with particulars of the names, addresses and interest in the land of the person from whom such superior lessor holds or who holds the land from such superior lessor.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 and section 3 are probably the vital sections in the Bill because they confer rights upon the tenants. What I had in mind in amendment <Col N="202" /> No. 18 was to provide machinery for the effective use of those rights.  I am aware that in section 12 a person shall &ldquo;serve a notice in the prescribed form upon the person to whom the rent is payable and upon any other person who holds any of the land demised by the lease as lessee under a building lease or a proprietary lease...&rdquo; Very often there are considerable difficulties where there have been several sub-lettings and assignees and, indeed, one finds people in possession of property and liable for ground rent because someone has died or gone away and their names may not be known to the tenant wishing to acquire the fee simple.  At times there can be great difficulty in ascertaining to whom ultimately the ground rent is payable.</P>
    <P>What I am trying to achieve in amendment No. 18 is to provide that wherever you can find someone who has an interest in the lease or is that person's agent, the tenant should be able to require him to disclose to whom he pays the rent if that person is not known to the occupying tenant.  I think we should put the onus on anyone who has information to disclose it to the acquiring tenant.  That would be helpful to the acquiring tenant and would substantially reduce the cost of an investigation.  That is all amendment No. 18 is intended to do.  If a precedent is required it will be found in the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, and in the Rent Restrictions Act, 1946, where there is an onus upon a landlord or a tenant to give as much information as possible relating to a particular property in order to enable the basic rent to be fixed.</P>
    <P>Similarly, under the Rent Restrictions Act, it is provided that failure wilfully to supply information is an offence punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding £100.  I think the Minister will agree that that is a reasonable requirement on any person who has information with regard to a superior interest or a lower interest, that he should be obliged to give that to the acquiring tenant under threat of penalty if that information is not forthcoming.  It is a bit ineffective to provide under section 12 that you will serve notice upon people whose names <Col N="203" /> and addresses or identity may not be known.  Amendment No. 18 at least puts some teeth into the Bill to enable the tenant to ascertain who are the owners of various interests who are required to be served.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did Senator O'Quigley advert to section 7 under which we cover to a very large degree what the Senator suggests?  Section 4 deals with the notice of intention to acquire fee simple, section 5 deals with the procedure in relation to acquisition, section 6 deals with the conveyance of the fee simple, and in section 7 which deals with notices requiring information, we have covered, I think, a large extent of what Senator O'Quigley has envisaged in amendments Nos. 18 and 19, short of having the penal provision which he suggests. We provide under section 7 that any person who proposes to acquire the fee simple may serve a notice on the immediate lessor requiring information as to the nature and duration of his reversionary interest in the land and the existence and nature of any encumbrance and the name and address of any person entitled to the next superior interest and the owner of any encumbrance on that, and a similar notice on each other person having a superior interest in the land.  Then in subsection (2) we provide that where a person upon whom a notice may be served cannot be found or ascertained, a notice may be served on the person receiving the rent in respect of the land, requiring the name and address of the person to whom the rent is paid by the person upon whom the notice is served.  Subsection (3) says that such a person on whom a notice is served shall, within one month, give so much of the information required by it as is within his possession.  This goes a very long way to meet Senator O'Quigley's point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>( ) Where land held under a <Col N="205" /> lease is indemnified against payment of any part of the land held under that lease by other land held under the lease, the apportionment of the rent reserved by the lease shall in respect of land so indemnified be nihil.</P>
    <P>We are dealing under subsection (3) of section 5 with a person entitled to acquire fee simple in land held by him under a lease, and providing that he shall be entitled to have the rent payable to him in respect of the land and any other land held under the same lease apportioned between the land the fee simple of which he is acquiring and the other land.  I am trying to provide for a situation which may arise.  Take a site of 11 houses.  A builder builds 11 houses and the annual rent is £80, and instead of making the rent on each site one-eleventh of £80 he decides that he will occupy house No. 11 for himself or give it to his son, and he has that free of rent, and the rent which is to be payable under the lease will be borne by the other ten.  This happens in many cases of builders nominating people who take a lease.  Consequently, you find that ten houses pay a ground rent of £8 and the eleventh is indemnified against any portion of the rent of £80 by the other ten houses.</P>
    <P>That happens at present, and in cases where properties were held under building leases, mainly 19th century or earlier, or at any time, where you frequently find that in the course of time somebody has shifted the liability to pay the rent on to another property. If it happened that a man owned two houses held under a lease subject to a ground rent of £20 he might have a larger price for one of the houses not occupied by himself and sell it, indemnifying the tenant against payment of the entire rent, and charge the full £20 upon his own property, and effect that in a deed of assignment of the second house to a purchaser.  If that vendor's successor in title were now to seek to acquire the fee simple in the property it would be inequitable that he could come in and say to the county registrar: &ldquo;Apportion this rent of £20 which I have to pay under the lease and which was payable in respect of two houses, as between myself and <Col N="206" /> my neighbour&rdquo; who had never been liable to pay any portion of the £20, and he may find himself saddled with a rent of £10.</P>
    <P>It seems that that is what is envisaged under the Bill.  I suggest in the amendment that where land has been held under lease and it is indemnified against payment of any part of the rent, the person liable now to pay the rent shall continue to pay it, and the indemnified portion will remain free of any liability for an apportioned part of the entire rent reserved under the lease.</P>

      <P>I am aware that you have these indemnity provisions in regard to certain leasehold arrangements. At the same time, I think that rather than have a rigid provision such as that proposed by Senator O'Quigley we should leave the apportionment of the rent to be agreed between the parties, and where they cannot agree let them go to the county registrar. It is desirable not to pin it down any further.  If we say, if they cannot agree among themselves, let the county registrar decide, he will have regard to the indemnity arrangements which have been made and will take due cognisance of them.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I could not agree with that.  When the county registrar is faced with an application, say, my hypothetical applicant who has to buy the entire ground rent of £20, the county registrar is bound to apportion all the rent.  I think it is necessary to say that it shall be applicable to rent in the case of a person&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me fairer if a person is buying out the ground rent of £20 that he will pay somewhat less if you accept my amendment.  We should ensure that a man who is indemnified all those years in regard to the payment of ground rent, and who now wishes to buy out the fee simple, is not burdened with the rent and that he will not find himself not alone having to pay the apportioned rent but also the capital value if involved in buying it out.  We want to avoid that.  If the Minister is a bit unhappy about putting this in as a subsection of section 5 I wonder whether he would be prepared to put it in under subsection (2) of paragraph (d) in this manner so as to indicate the view of the legislature determining if a person is entitled to have a rent apportioned and the amounts in which it should be apportioned.  We could then include some clause which will not limit the powers but will indicate what way we wish to have it done in this type of case by saying &ldquo;Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (d) of this section&rdquo;, and then go on to say: &ldquo;where land is held under a lease and indemnified against payment of the rent that case shall be apportioned at nil.  That will not take away any powers which the county registrar has in regard to apportionment. As matters stand it would be very unjust and would create unnecessary discontent on the part of a person who found himself burdened with rent which he never had to pay up to now. It would be wholly wrong of the legislature not to say quite clearly in the case I have indicated that a man who is indemnified against the payment of any ground rent should bear any proportion of the rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you take the case of the 11 houses which I have mentioned it would be quite wrong that the eleventh should pay the same as the others.  If he were <Col N="208" /> buying his house and particularly if he were not the first occupier, he would pay somewhat more by reason of the fact that he did not have to pay ground rent and he was indemnified by the other 10 property owners.  It would be very inequitable to leave it that he might have to pay portion of the ground rent and then if he wanted to acquire the fee simple that he would have to pay the capital value.  We ought to insert in section 17 &ldquo;without prejudice to other powers contained in this type of case there shall be a nil apportionment&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I would not imagine that the county registrar would do otherwise than that asked for by the Senator in the case mentioned by him.  The Senator is very well aware that the variations in regard to landlord and tenant holdings are infinite. You could have a case such as the one mentioned by the Senator where there is an indemnity and no rent paid.  This could give rise to different rights which could be put into the nil category in regard to compensation and yet no rent would be paid.  The other property owners in the estate would be carrying it.  That is one case which comes to my mind.  It would entitle the landlord to compensation and yet no rent was payable.  I am sure if you start getting down to it you could find a dozen cases of involvement in technicalities.  That is why I dislike this sort of thing.  If there was a case such as that envisaged by Senator O'Quigley I am certain the county registrar would do what the Senator is seeking he should do.</P>

      <P>I can see county registrars who are extremely careful people looking at this section and saying: &ldquo;I am here now to apportion a rent.  The legislature says I must apportion the rent under which this property is held.  This man says the property is held under a lease for so many years at an annual rent of £20.&rdquo;  That is what the lease says.  It so happens that at some stage in the devolution of the property somebody was indemnified against portion of the rent.  The county registrar may say that may be so but he is bound to apportion the rent and there is nothing in the Act to say that <Col N="209" /> apportionment of the rent means relieving somebody of the rent.</P>

If the tenants bought out their ground rents for nothing the landlord would be left holding the baby in that case&mdash;he would have no real security for the rent.

      <P>The Minister is talking about any apportionment.  Let us be quite clear that a landlord is not bound by any apportionment of rent unless he consents to it.  If upon the sale of one of the pair of houses I was talking about subject to the rent of £20 the owner of the two properties said: &ldquo;I will let you have that house free of rent if you give me another £200&rdquo; and the purchaser 20, 30 or 50 years ago said: &ldquo;Very well, I am perfectly happy to have to pay no rent&rdquo; and then the vendor of the two houses agrees to indemnify the property <Col N="210" /> being sold against payment of any rent and charges it upon his own property, that kind of indemnification does not bind the landlord.  That is a particular type of situation that can arise.  It is a well recognised fact that there are lots of houses held under a lease always liable to the entire rent in cases where the landlord has not consented to the apportionment.  The landlord can say: &ldquo;That is a poor old widow.  I will not charge her any ground rent&rdquo; but this man can afford it and the merchant in such a case can have no answer to the landlord's claim for the whole part unless he had been joined in the apportionment when it was made.  It seems to me we must give some cognisance to the fact that there are such properties which are not now liable because of dealings with the property in the past.  I think we should put something into section 17 in the manner I suggest.</P>

      <P>No consistency on the part of the Minister I am afraid. Senator Sheehy Skeffington's timely intervention enabled me to find a point which I think arises.  I wonder whether the Minister has considered this situation. Here we are dealing with building leases and proprietary leases.  There is a certain situation&mdash;and here I am talking upon advice&mdash;where you have a partly built on lease which is dealt with under the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act of 1958.  I am advised that only in certain situations is a partly built on lease a proprietary lease for the purposes of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1958, and that proprietary leases and building leases as we have defined them in subsection (2) of this Act will not capture <Col N="211" /> partly built on leases.  I wonder whether the Minister has adverted to that.  I am raising the matter in this vague way now in order to entitle him to put down an amendment on the Report Stage.  I am advised that there are situations in which partly built on leases which for the purposes of the Act of 1958 are to be deemed proprietary leases or building leases&mdash;I cannot say at the moment&mdash;but only for limited purposes.  Would that not come within the ambit of this particular Bill?  I wonder if the Minister has had that point brought to his attention?</P>

      <P>My advise is that section 6 of the Act of 1958 which deems partly built leases to be building leases is proper enough but at the same time it is one of the matters on which doubt has been passed.  There are no decided cases on it but doubt has been passed on the drafting of it and we have had already one or two examples of drafting in the 1958 Act which came to light during the examination of the present Bill and which we have improved in the present Bill.  The 1958 Act along with the 1931 Act and the other Acts back to the 1861 Act are under consideration by a Commission with a view to improvement. I hope to have results from them in the coming year.</P>

      <P>We have already had some discussion on section 7 in connection with an earlier amendment. Senator O'Quigley had some ideas on its improvement.  We were not altogether happy with it as it stood and that is the reason for the two amendments. At present the purchasing lessee can serve notice requiring information upon the superior lessor or upon the person receiving the rent.

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide for a situation which is bound to arise where a county registrar, his wife, son, daughter, father or other relation may be a person interested in property, the fee simple of which is being acquired and the property, if it is situate in the county where he is county registrar, would fall to be dealt with&mdash;as regards apportionment and all the other functions a county registrar has under section 17&mdash;by him.  It seems to me highly undesirable, in fact, quite wrong to say that a county registrar, who was himself the lessee of part of a property held under a lease, the fee simple of which was being acquired, would be adjudicating <Col N="215" /> upon a matter in which he had a material interest.  It is quite simple to see that that could not be; it is contrary to every notion of justice we have.</P>
    <P>Of course, that situation sometimes arises in our courts where you have a circuit court judge in a particular county who may have an interest in property or who may know somebody who is the plaintiff or defendant in an action particularly well&mdash;there may be a relation involved&mdash;he does not deal with the case himself; he asks the President of the circuit court to ask another judge to deal with the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not very happy about section 8 because I do not think the county registrars should be burdened with the many difficult and complex matters which they will be called upon to decide under this Bill. The Minister referred this evening to the large variety of cases and circumstances which can arise under a Landlord and Tenant Act.</P>
      <P>Some county registrars may be very good at equity matters.  Some may be interested in landlord and tenant legislation, and so on.  It does not follow that their experience after a period of ten, 20 or 30 years as county registrars fits them for making decisions on the very complicated cases the Minister thinks are likely to arise under this Bill.  It is different in the case of judges who day in and day out and week in and week out deal with some aspect of landlord and tenant law.  Landlord and tenant law even when it is consolidated under the proposed new Bill which the Minister indicated will be brought in, will still continue to be fairly complicated, especially because of the history of landlords and tenants, and because of the peculiar views taken by courts in times past on the relations of landlords and tenants, and the sanctity which formerly attached to the interests of landlords as distinct from the interests of tenants in property held under leases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A county registrar has nothing like the necessary qualifications, the necessary skill, and the necessary experience in practice, to fit him to deal with cases under this Bill.  In addition, it is noteworthy that it is intended that all these matters will be dealt with in what is regarded as a summary fashion.  The employment of solicitors and counsel will depend very much upon whether or not a county registrar acquires a reputation for awarding fees in the form of costs.  The problems will be so great that I cannot see a county registrar, through lack of practice in this branch of the law, being able to deal with them when they arise. What is one to do in the case, say, of the city of Dublin?  There is one county registrar.  He is registrar to the three <Col N="219" /> circuit courts and, in addition, he is registrar to the Central Criminal Court.  Those duties impose a wide variety of obligations upon him and occupy a great deal of his time.  I cannot see how the county registrar for Dublin city will be able to deal with all those duties and at the same time deal with all the cases of the buying of ground rent which will occur in the city of Dublin.  To me it seems quite absurd.</P>
    <P>We have in the city of Dublin one extra circuit court judge.  I would suggest that matters of this kind should be dealt with finally so far as the city of Dublin is concerned by the third circuit court judge.  In saying that I am not overlooking the fact that the mode of referring these matters to the circuit court judge, or to all three circuit court judges, should be by summary hearing in chambers which will not involve any lengthy pleadings or increase the costs on the person acquiring the fee simple.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with the practical aspect of section 8 and the unsuitability &mdash;I do not hesitate to say&mdash;of many county registrars purely because for years they have not been practising law. It would be impossible for them to cope with the amount of work.  What will the result be?  I can see an application to the Department of Justice from the County Registrars Association for two things.  The first will be for an increase in salary by reason of the new and onerous duties which they will have to perform.  They will probably quote what I have said, doubtless with advantage to their case, before an arbitrator. They will quote what the Minister said about the complexity of the landlord and tenant law.  As well as the application for a salary increase, there will be an application for more staff in the offices of the county registrars. Make no mistake about it, this will come and this is a matter of which the Minister must be well aware.</P>
    <P>Under the Succession Act, from the 1st January next the county registrars will become assistant probate registrars. This is all new work and more of their time is being occupied.  In addition to that we are imposing this extraordinarily large increase of work with <Col N="220" /> which they will not be able to cope. If they do not get an increase in salary they will look for a new clerical officer, or a staff officer, or someone of that kind.  To my mind, the way to anticipate all that unnecessary expenditure is to hand these matters over to the circuit courts or to the district courts, institutions which are in existence already to deal with anything that is contemplated in this Bill in a summary manner.</P>
    <P>Apart from these practical considerations which do not seem to have been adverted to&mdash;if they were they have been ignored&mdash;it is entirely wrong in principle to have matters relating to landlord and tenant law decided by civil servants.  County registrars are civil servants, subject to the jurisdiction of the Minister for Justice.  We cannot get away from that.  They are civil servants and that is all there is to it.  I have no particular objection to civil servants as such&mdash;the contrary is the situation&mdash;but having regard to the fact that there may be a considerable amount of money involved in these cases, there are matters of law which will fall to be considered under this Bill and I do not think it is right or proper to have persons other than judicial persons or persons with judicial status considering these matters.</P>
    <P>One of the great things in our system of justice is that our judges, when it comes to the push, are absolutely independent and demonstrate that quite clearly in the manner in which they make their decisions.  County registrars of their nature and because of the nature of their office are not independent persons.  I deplore the fact that non-judicial persons are being given the right to make decisions affecting property rights under this Bill. The Minister for Justice in the Dáil referred to the fact that county registrars take judicial decisions, or quasi-judicial decisions, every day.  Nothing could be further from the fact.  Every time a couny registrar holds an inquiry on the administration of an estate he makes up his report and that is subject to confirmation by the circuit court judge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned about the fact that there is an appeal. The Minister talked earlier about the Constitution.  If the Minister were concerned about the law and upholding the Constitution he could not fail in a case like this to have regard to the decision in the case of Farrell and O'Gorman and the Solicitors Act.  That case clearly shows that if the determination of rights can be effected by a non-judicial person in the first instance the fact that there is an appeal to the court does not render it proper to have rights which should be the appropriate subject for judicial decision determined in the first place by non-judicial persons.  That is the effect of Farrell and O'Gorman. To me it is quite wrong to give this power to county registrars.  They do not have the same independence that a Land Commissioner has, or a Special Commissioner of Income Tax.  It is wrong to take these public servants and ask them to adjudicate on property matters and rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked about constitutionality on another matter.  I have very little doubt, reading the Constitution in the light of the decision in Farrell and O'Gorman, that this section is completely unconstitutional.  I would not, however, speculate any money as to the result of an application to the court to have the section declared unconstitutional because of the trend of decisions which have been reached in the Supreme Court recently upon such matters as drunken driving under the Road Traffic Act, which the court deemed to be a minor offence.  It is impossible at this stage in the evolution of our system of jurisprudence to know what way the courts will go from now on in the light of that decision.  Personally, I have little doubt that this section, read in the light of the Farrell and O'Gorman decision and against the background of the Constitution, is quite unconstitutional and quite invalid. I deplore this gradual erosion of the rights of the court, this new manifestation of the dislike of the judicial system and of the courts by the executive authority in this country, shown in this section.  For practical reasons and for reasons based on constitutional <Col N="222" /> law, I deplore the fact that this device has been adopted to determine these matters under this Bill.</P>
