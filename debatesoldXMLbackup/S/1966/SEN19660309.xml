      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the County Borough of Waterford (Extension of Boundary) Provisional Order, 1966.  The order provides for the extension of the Waterford city boundary to take in an area of the County Waterford comprising some 520 acres.  The order is the result of a petition by the Waterford Corporation under section 36 of the Waterford City Management Act, 1939.  The petition was the subject of a local inquiry on 1st December, 1965, at which both the county council and the corporation were represented. There were no objections to the extension at the public hearing.  The proposed extension had already been agreed on between the corporation and county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area which would be added to the city under the proposal includes the townlands of Logloss, Rathfadden, Clearboy, Ticor, Lisduggan Big and <Col N="1704" /> Pastimeknock and part of the townlands of Ballynaneashagh and Kilbarry. The corporation already own a considerable amount of land in this area amounting to more than a third of the total acreage proposed to be taken in.  If my rendering of the place names should be unintelligible to those who know them, I hope they will excuse me.  It is the first time I have come across them.</P>
    <P>The present city is closely built-up and the necessity for further space is apparent.  The immediate land requirements are mainly for housing&mdash;corporation housing and private housing &mdash;and for industrial development. Provision must be made, too, for schools, churches, a cemetery extension and other essentials of a large and expanding urban community.  Provision must be made for rehousing from insanitary houses and overcrowded conditions in central areas as well as for new housing needs arising from population and employment growth.</P>
    <P>The Government decision that Waterford is to be a development centre with an industrial estate means that considerable economic and social expansion must be envisaged and provided for.  The boundary extension will facilitate such provision.</P>
    <P>Apart from minor extensions in 1944 and 1955 the boundary of Waterford City has remained unchanged since 1896.  The 1955 extension consisted of taking into the city three areas on which the corporation had erected houses due to the non-availability of building sites within the city itself.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned the Waterford County Council have accepted the need for the proposed extension.  Agreement has been reached between the city and county authorities on all aspects of the matter, including the compensation to be paid to the county council in respect of the added burden on the county rates to which the extension would give rise.  The extent of the added rates burden in the county will be limited due to the fact that the land being taken into the city is mostly undeveloped.  The agreement provides for payment of £19,000 to the county council as a financial settlement and <Col N="1705" /> has been ratified by the two local authorities.  The intention is that rates on property brought into the city by the boundary extension will not be raised to the higher level of the city rate immediately.  Article 13 and the Second Schedule to the Provisional Order provide that for these properties the gap between the level of the county and city rates will be bridged gradually by annual stages over a period of six years.</P>
    <P>Agricultural land in the added areas will cease to attract the agricultural grant following the boundary extension. A corresponding amount of the grant will, however, be paid over to the corporation and, in turn, the proportion of the valuation of agricultural land in the added areas to be assessed will be on 7/10ths as in the case of all agricultural land taken into the city. In addition to this relief the procedure I have just referred to in regard to the easing of rates by means of differential rating on properties in the added areas will apply to agricultural land also.</P>
    <P>Finally, the order includes a number of other consequential provisions on the usual lines such as the preparation of official maps of the extended city area, continuation in effect of county council resolutions and orders where appropriate, arrangements in regard to registers of electors, employment and hours of trading orders, the adjustment of the agricultural grant and a saving from disqualification for county council members in the added area pending the forthcoming local government elections.</P>
    <P>The corporation wishes to have the boundary extension made effective from the 1st April, 1966, and it is hoped that it will be possible to do this.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is inevitable, with the increase in population, that the boundaries of some cities will have to be extended from time to time.  I am glad that the Minister is able to tell the House, in this particular case, unlike the extension to the Cork city boundary recently, that there is no dispute whatever apparently.  I am glad to know <Col N="1706" /> that the local authorities concerned have agreed to the demarcation of the boundaries and to whatever financial adjustments that have to be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so. There are a couple of matters that arise on the order which, to me, seems to be in the same form as the Provisional Order in the case of the Cork city boundary.  The first thing&mdash;perhaps the Minister might be able to deal with it in his reply&mdash;is the position in regard to valuation.  As I understand it, the city of Waterford was revalued some years ago at a higher valuation than other towns.  I am wondering how that affects the position in regard to the land being taken in.  That, presumably, would be at a lower valuation.  I suppose it is fair enough that there should be an abatement in respect of agricultural land taken in but I am wondering whether or not the fact that there are two different types of valuation in operation will affect the people who are being taken into the city boundary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter to which the Minister refers is the Register of Electors.  He has said, I think, that it is hoped to have this done in time for the forthcoming local elections.  On that, perhaps the Minister might indicate, firstly, how forthcoming the local elections are and, secondly, whether or not the register will, in fact, be completed in time.  What problem is associated with the preparation of the electors' register, or will the part which relates to the land to be taken in be physically separated from the county register and reprinted or, for the moment, just be taken in and left as it is?  What I am trying to get at is this.  I should imagine that when Waterford Corporation hold their elections they will have their own register relating to the corporation area.  I am wondering what machinery will be invoked for the purpose of getting the register which relates to the county area joined on to the corporation register, so that there will be no doubt as to who is within the corporation <Col N="1707" /> area for the purposes of elections.</P>
    <P>A final point arises on the order.  It seems reasonable to provide that the higher valuation will not be charged to people who are in the county area and that there will be an abatement in the first five years but I do not understand, and perhaps the Minister might clarify, what is meant in paragraphs (4) and (5) of Article 13 as to how this abatement will work.  It seems in paragraph (4) of Article 13 that all classes of hereditaments are included and then there seems to be an exception made in respect of paragraph (5).  Frankly, I do not quite follow what is intended by these paragraphs and the Minister might be able to deal with them.  Apart from those observations I hope the Bill will have a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point raised by Senator O'Quigley is this question of land valuation and what is the situation in regard to the land and property which comes into the new area.  It is probably fortunate in a way that a great deal of this extension is land which has not yet been developed so that, by and large, we are dealing with land in the transfer.  In so far as the valuation of the land, either within or without the boundary now or in the future, is concerned, that land valuation does not change.  What does change is the actual rate in the £ as between the two areas.  In so far as the land valuation and the rates to be struck are concerned, there is quite a considerable difference in rate in the £ at the moment between the two areas, which it is proposed to put on in stages over a six-year period rather than that there should be a change from one rate to the other immediately. In addition to that in so far as the land is concerned, moneys paid to the corporation will have regard to the new additional lands brought in and, as a result, the amount to be paid by way of rates will be assessed on seven-tenths of the valuation of that land, as is the case of all land in the city as of now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the compilation of the <Col N="1708" /> registers or their effectiveness is concerned, if this goes through, then the persons resident within the new boundary will, in all respects, be urban electors and will so be designated in the register in whatever way it may be necessary to put it together or to revise it in so far as its use at elections is concerned.  I do not think we need anticipate any problems in regard to that.  The answer to Senator O'Quigley's question is that from the passage of this Bill by both Houses those within the new boundary, as designated, will be urban electors.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other matters already raised, the Second Schedule suggests that the matters dealt with there are more clear than in section 13, which Senator O'Quigley mentioned.  I suggest that the Second Schedule does set out fairly clearly the matters Senator O'Quigley has been raising on that particular aspect.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages to-day.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.</P>

      <P>Would it be possible at this stage to ask the Leader of the House to postpone item No. 8 in view of the very short notice available to the Labour Party on this?  The first intimation I had that the Government even contemplated giving time to it today was when I rang the Leader of the House today before lunch.  My impression was that the Housing Bill, which we were told could not be taken last week, was to come on this week and would be taken today.  Consequently, we were not ready and I would ask the Leader of the House, in the circumstances, to leave No. 8 for the present.</P>

      <P>Senator McQuillan sounds very innocent but I do not think he is as innocent as all that.  On the day on which he tabled this motion, he insisted that it was a matter of urgent public importance. Several times since he wanted to know when it would be taken.  At the last meeting of the Seanad, I gave an undertaking that, as soon as Senator Sheehy Skeffington's motion was concluded, we would take this.  So to talk about not having adequate notice is rather naïve.</P>

      <P>There is no question of the Housing Bill being taken today and that was not stated last week.  The Senator is as well aware as are other Members of the House that there are difficulties in regard to this motion and the fact that on many occasions there was a clash between the Minister's obligations in the Dáil and his commitments here.  It so happens that it is possible to deal with this motion today.  If not, he should withdraw it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:-</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 45 and 46, to insert a new section as follows:-</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the removal of doubt it is hereby declared that the power conferred by section 35 of the Registry of Deeds (Ireland) Act, 1832 to establish, reduce, alter or vary fees shall be exercised, and shall be deemed always to have been exercisable, only by order.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I argued this amendment in considerable detail, and the Minister for Finance who was then present said he was not completely briefed on the points raised and asked for time to have the matter considered. Fortunately, I re-entered this amendment for this Stage because apparently whatever consideration was given was not of the type that would be satisfactory to me.  That is one of the advantages of having some Parliamentary experience, and not being too easily led to the belief that Ministers are about to be suddenly reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> I said on Committee Stage that the section which the amendment deals with was not the function of the Minister for Finance but was more properly the function of the Minister for Justice.  I am glad to see the Minister for Justice here to-day, and I suppose he will be better briefed than the Minister for Finance said he was.  I had a certain amount of difficulty since.  I do not wish to weary the House by going in detail through what I have already said.  There is the added difficulty that the printed report of Committee Stage is still not available. If it were, I might have been able to refer to things which were said on Committee Stage.  I propose to run through the salient points and elaborate in respect of one or two additional arguments which have occurred to me since.</P>
    <P>Section 4 presumes that the fees prescribed under section 35 of the Registry of Deeds (Ireland) Act, 1832, were made by order.  I believe that if there is any doubt as to whether these fees were, in fact, to be promulgated by order, section 4 ceases to have any meaning at all.  I do not feel it is necessary for me to prove beyond yea or nay that the 1832 Act did not, in fact, envisage these fees being prescribed by order.</P>
    <P>Since Committee Stage I have gone through this again, and I am as convinced as ever that there is reasonable doubt.  Under the 1832 Act these powers were vested in the Treasury, whose natural successor would be the Minister for Finance, and under an adaptation order of 1956 these powers were given to the Minister for Justice. I am sorry the Minister for Finance is not here, because I was hoping to drive a wedge between the two Ministers on this point, by suggesting that the Minister for Finance should take a very hard look at what powers the Minister for Justice has, because they do not relate only to prescribing fees. They relate to the entire regulation of this office and without any reference to Finance at all.</P>
    <P>Nowadays when questions of fees or any type of charge such as that arises, whatever Department is immediately <Col N="1712" /> concerned, there is usually a proviso either that the thing shall be done with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, or after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Justice finds himself in the odd position that he has the last word under the adaptation order.  However, that is more or less by the way, and whatever trouble I might have made for the Minister for Finance, I suppose I am not likely to make any trouble for the Minister for Justice by saying he has too much power.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the trouble is that the 1832 Act does not specifically indicate how the Treasury shall establish, alter or vary fees.  I suggested, and I still suggest, that with the background of the 1832 Act in mind, it is doubtful whether anyone at that time had the intention that these alterations and variations should be brought to the notice of Parliament my way of order. Even in the title of the Act there is a fair indication that this was not so.  The proper title is: &ldquo;An Act to Regulate the Office for Registering Deeds, Conveyances and Wills in Ireland&rdquo;.  That was its function.  The force of the word is &ldquo;to regulate&rdquo; in this context.  Up to then the Registrar collected the fees and paid himself out of the fees.  Under the new way of looking at things at that time there was a continual process of bringing all these offices under a regular system by which the officers were paid salaries, and fees and emoluments coming to the office did not go to them.  It went one way or another to the Treasury.</P>
    <P>In this case it is fairly clear that the whole thing was very involved.  Under the 1832 Act the fees went to pay the salaries and expenses of the office and if there was any surplus it was to go into the consolidation fund but on its way there it was earmarked for the expenses of the office.  In fact, its main task was that it should be used to make the office more convenient for the public.  It is not very clear what was supposed to happen if the fees did not meet the salaries but since the Treasury had power to sack anybody in the office or to reduce the salary of anybody, it is obvious they had also the power to adjust the salaries so that the fees <Col N="1713" /> would meet them.  I presume that under the old set up it was not considered likely that the fees would not meet them.  Whether in every year since 1832 there was a surplus over and above the salaries and expenses I do not know, but if there was and all this was properly directed, as the Act states, towards making the office convenient, by this time it ought to be about the most convenient office one could think about because it had more than 130 years to become so.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in Halsbury in relation to a question not the same but it has to do with statutory rules and their publication and here a clear distinction is drawn between orders which are legislative and orders which are executive.  Legislative orders are those proper to be laid before Parliament but executive orders did not have to be dealt with in that way.  My argument is that in 1832 there does not seem to have been very much doubt that the fees in relation to the salaries and expenses were looked on as an executive matter for the Treasury, the whole thing being under their control.</P>
    <P>I should like to be able to produce evidence one way or the other on this matter but I am not able to say that between 1832 and 1875 the fees were ever altered or varied.  I do not know whether between 1875 and 1956 they were altered or varied.  There were two Treasury orders about 50 years ago but I cannot find them in the Library so I do not know what they purported to do, but I have at the back of my mind a recollection that in 1956, when a new schedule of fees was brought in, somewhere there was reference to the necessity for this change because the existing fees were of such long standing.</P>
    <P>The Transfer of Land (Ireland) Act, 1848, is of no assistance in clearing the matter up, as I pointed out on Committee Stage.  The fees prescribed in the schedule to that Act are described in the Act as capable of being varied and altered by order under the hands of the Treasury, but, unfortunately, the Act does not say anything about orders, regulations, rules or anything else being laid before Parliament. There is nothing in it and the <Col N="1714" /> intention in 1848 was that the fees should be prescribed by order.  It is not without significance that no suggestion occurs in the 1848 Act that Treasury orders should be laid before parliament.  In the 1875 Act, there is a presumption that fees under the 1832 Act will be made by order but this reference is in the preamble and not in the section of the Act.  This, I admit, poses a certain amount of difficulty because what exactly is the force of the preamble is not always very clear.  There is one sidelight on it&mdash;I am not very sure of the date&mdash;in Halsbury's citing of Coke on Littleton:</P>
    <P>By the authority of our author, the rehearsal or preamble of a statute is to be taken for truth: for it cannot be thought that a statute which is made by authority of the whole realm, as well of the King as of the lords spiritual and temporal and of all the commons, will recite a thing against the truth.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister has not relied on this rather ancient quotation because every indication I can get is to the effect that if there is in a section of an Act something which is ambiguous the preamble can be cited to clarify its ambiguity and the courts shall have reference to it, but I cannot find anything to suggest you can use the preamble of an Act to clarify a section of an Act 40 years earlier.  It is probably fortunate that it is in the 1875 Act that it is the preamble which is in question.  Before 1851 you had the odd effect that there is no section 1 in any Act.  You get the preamble and the first section is marked II.  From 1851 on, this is changed and there is a preamble followed by section 1 and so on. Therefore, I would be very doubtful about the pramble of an Act before 1851 because of the curious way parts of the Act were marked out.  The preamble to the 1875 Act does no more than state the reasons for the enactment and I think that is all one can hope a preamble will do.  It is not so different from a speech made by a Minister introducing a Bill, stating why it was desirable the legislation should go through.  If a mistake occurred in 1875, the parliamentary draftsmen of <Col N="1715" /> that time somewhat rashly assumed that the fees in the 1832 Act must be done by order.  It is quite understandable because in between the two dates there were the 1860s in which the whole system of parliamentary control was very much revised particularly in financial matters.  It is not too difficult to envisage that a parliamentary draftsman in 1875 would have got into difficulties because of the control of moneys which came in with the appearance of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee in the 1860s.  He could very easily walk into such a trap.</P>
    <P>I am only saying this to show that there is a doubt in this matter and I suggest that even if it is only a very slight doubt it is very easy to put it right.  What I am suggesting should be added into the Bill will not do any harm even if it may not do a tremendous amount of good.  There is nothing in it to injure anyone except possibly the parliamentary draftsman who may think, by allowing this to be accepted, that it is a criticism of himself for not having seen the point.  I suggest that is silly.  No such question arises at all.  If there is a doubt, we ought to clear it and it is very simple to clear it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was slightly confused in the reading of the amendment. He thought I was talking about the past, whereas it refers to any power which shall be exercised and shall be deemed always to have been exercisable so it deals with the present and the future as well as the past.  The reason for dealing with the past was that the order of 1956 was presented on the presumption that this business could be done by a statutory instrument and that that was the proper way to deal with it.  If there is a doubt, then I think that particular instrument needs to be bolstered up by making it clear that it is now assumed to have been a proper statutory instrument for laying before the Houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, may have more information.  It is very natural he should and I must admit I would be very impressed if he could show that <Col N="1716" /> between 1832 and 1875 these orders were altered, varied and established and that this was done by order laid before the Houses of Parliament.  I have not been able to discover it.  I would not be as impressed by anything done after 1875 because such an order would be relying on what I think is a defective Act in the sense that it assumes something which is not proper to assume so I trust the Minister will not rely on some possible way of reading the 1875 preamble into the 1832 Act.</P>
    <P>It is important that this matter should be cleared beyond doubt and it is only for the avoidance of doubt I am suggesting this amendment.  I do not see whatever good it may or may not do but I suggest it cannot do any harm.  It would be safer to include it in and make absolutely sure that any orders made in regard to fees have been properly made and will in future only be made by order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, on the point just made by Senator Sheldon, as a matter of practice, Treasury Orders, as they were then known, made under the Registry of Deeds (Ireland) Act, 1832, were laid on the Table of the House.  It is a matter of practice, although it does not go the whole way to meet the Senator's point, and irrespective of what view he or I might take on the interpretation of the statutes concerned so the nub of the issue between Senator Sheldon and myself comes down to a matter of interpretation.  In order to remove any doubt Senator Sheldon suggests in the amendment:</P>
      <P>that the power conferred by section 35 of the Registry of Deeds (Ireland) Act, 1832 to establish, reduce, alter or vary fees shall be exercised and shall be deemed always to have been exercisable only by order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, it has always been done by way of order laid on the Table of the House.  I suggest that the preamble to the 1875 Act, as a statutory declaration&mdash;this is the advice I have received, and is the advice with which I would concur&mdash;does, in fact, refer to fees <Col N="1717" /> orders, which were known as Treasury Orders then, and are now Registry of Deeds (Fees) Orders.  In relation to the preamble there is nothing between the Senator and me.  Reference is made to regulations, orders and declarations and such fees and moneys received.  In other words, fees are referred to in the preamble and further on there is provision that such fees orders shall be laid before Parliament.  Looking at it in this way the only issue between us concerns the effect of that preamble. The practice that has always obtained with regard to Treasury Orders, and has since obtained in regard to Registry of Deeds Orders, bears out the practical interpretation of the preamble to the 1875 Act.  In other words, the Act, in effect, cleared up any ambiguity in the 1832 Act by making it plain that Treasury Orders, as they were then known, had to be laid on the Table of the House.</P>
    <P>Section 4, of course, is concerned only with the very limited matter of the date on which the order is to come into operation.  It merely carries on a practice written into this preamble, which is a statutory declaration and which in turn interprets the 1832 Act and clears up any ambiguity which may have been in that Act.  I will not argue as to the ambiguity or otherwise of laying these Fees Orders before Parliament.  Senator Sheldon made the point that this was a preamble to a separate piece of legislation from the 1832 Act.  I do not think he can take the two Acts in isolation because the 1875 Act, introduced precisely to amend the 1832 Act, is a continuing piece of legislation dealing with the laying of those orders on the Table of the House.  The preamble in that Act relates back to the 1832 Act, which it amends, so it is a continuing legislative process.  The advice I have on the interpretation issue is borne out by the practice pursued over the years in regard to the British Parliament and our own Parliament whereby those fees orders were, in fact, laid before the House, and rightly so, having regard to the statutory nature of the preamble to the 1875 Act.</P>
    <P>The nub of the issue between Senator Sheldon and myself appears to <Col N="1718" /> be this question of the preamble to the 1875 Act, whether that can be regarded as a statute or not, and, in particular, whether it can be regarded as a statute following the earlier Act, that is, the 1832 Act.  In my view it does and in the Senator's view it does not.  He seems to confine that preamble to the actual piece of legislation itself.  That is not my view.  In my view anything incorporated in a statute must be taken as amending or extending an earlier Act.  This is a view of interpretation that has been taken by the courts over the years particularly when a later Act is related to an earlier Act.  I would say that on this issue of interpretation my view would be upheld.  I am not arguing that a very good case has not been made by Senator Sheldon.</P>
    <P>I do not see the need for his amendment for this reason&mdash;we are concerned here in section 4 with a very limited matter, merely a matter of time and date in regard to the order.  The Senator's point is an arguable one and can be examined in conjunction with the preparation of legislation in the Department of Justice to amend and consolidate all the old statutes governing registration of deeds.  Despite what Senator Sheldon said about the Minister's promises being shortlived and designed to ensure an easy passage, I will see that his point is borne in mind in the contemplated legislation.  But we are solely concerned in this section with the date of coming into force of fees orders and it would not be proper to concern ourselves here with defects or anomalies in the old statutes, particularly as in my view the point raised is adequately covered by the preamble which amends the earlier statute.  To remove any ambiguity whatever, I will certainly bring the Senator's point to the notice of people drafting the contemplated new legislation.</P>

      <P>Before Senator Sheldon concludes I should like to intervene.  I am rather disappointed that the Minister has not dealt with this particular amendment more clearly.  The Minister has ended up by saying that there is sufficient ambiguity left in the particular case to warrant investigation of the matter by his <Col N="1719" /> Department.  He said earlier that this was an arguable case and I think there is no doubt that, as a result of the perambulations through preambles which have been made by both Senator Sheldon and by the Minister, there is still doubt; there is still a basis for argument; there is still ambiguity in regard to this matter.  It is a pity that, in cases like this, the inevitable reaction of Ministers seems to be&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, better not do anything, we will have the whole matter examined&rdquo;.  It would be far better legislative practice, when there is even a glimmer of ambiguity, when there is even the slightest doubt, that the matter should be put beyond doubt and beyond ambiguity at the earliest possible moment.</P>
      <P>The Minister made his case as regards the effect of the preamble of 1875 and the previous statute of 1832. Several times he has said it is my view against Senator Sheldon's.  He adduced little authority in support of that view and, indeed, there is very little in what the Minister has said that would convince me there is not still in this matter doubt which could well be removed.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Senator Dooge for having drawn attention to this.  It struck me, too, that the Minister had thrown away his case when he said that this was his view; I had my view and it was arguable. It is precisely because it is arguable that I want the doubt removed.  If the Minister had been able to prove there was no doubt, then I would have been satisfied but he is going to ask his officials to look at this and make sure that any doubt is removed in regard to comprehensive legislation.  If the amendment could hamper anyone, then I would not worry and I would be quite happy to let it run.  It is merely a matter as to whether or not these orders are statutory presentations. Whether or not they are statutory presentations does not affect the validity of this in regard to whoever has to pay the fees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely the Minister did say it was arguable.  May I make this point?  I have not suggested that if the Treasury brought in new fees or altered or varied fees by order that anything could happen except that that order would have to be laid before Parliament.  My point is that there is nothing in the 1832 Act to show that it is by order that that should be done.  If they just prescribed fees or declared that the new fee would be so-and-so, then these would not be orders and would not properly be laid before Parliament.  I am not suggesting that they do wish to use it or that they ever attempted to use it and the Minister for Justice could prescribe the fee for the Registry of Deeds and he need not do it by order under the 1832 Act.  So, the doubt still remains.</P>
      <P>If this amendment could in any way confine anyone, I would not push it; I would be quite happy knowing that it is not every day that any change is made in these fees.  Then I would be quite happy to await the type of legislation the Minister has said is envisaged but it cannot do any harm, and it would be a very good idea, that such doubt as exists&mdash;and the Minister more or less admitted it&mdash;should be removed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:-</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 49, to delete &ldquo;only&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust the Minister will find it possible to accept this amendment because, on the wording of the existing section, it makes no sense at all. When I raised this on Second Reading, the Minister for Finance said he only wanted it to refer to orders dealing with fees.  This, of course, is not what the section says.  It is not the same thing to say &ldquo;I only wish it to refer to orders dealing with fees&rdquo; as to say &mdash;&ldquo;I wish it to deal with orders only relating to fees&rdquo;&mdash;because the second way of putting it excludes anything <Col N="1721" /> which deals with fees and something else.  The word &ldquo;only&rdquo; has no force at all.  All it does is make for confusion.</P>
    <P>If the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; was left out this section would then read:</P>
    <P>This section applies to any order under section 35 of the Registry of Deeds (Ireland) Act, 1832, or under that section and section 9 of the Land Transfer (Ireland) Act, 1848, which relates to fees.</P>
    <P>which seems to me to make sense.  It says precisely what it wants.  But the addition of the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; merely brings in this curious business that, if the Minister makes an order which relates to fees and something else, it is no longer an order which relates only to fees.  I trust the Minister follows me in that argument&mdash;that it is like the Mad Hatter's Tea Party where it is not the same thing to say &mdash;&ldquo;I breathe when I sleep&rdquo; as &ldquo;I sleep when I breathe&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is very unfortunate that this phraseology has crept in.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the Minister has some deep plot in mind in which he will vary fees and do something else in the same order and so escape the new restrictions of section 4 but he could do it and if the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; is left out he could still do what he wants, that is the order relating to fees prescribed in section 4.  I shall be very glad to hear from the Minister as to why the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; was put in. It is not any good to say: &ldquo;Because I only want this to deal with orders made relating to fees&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Because that is not what it says.  The Minister said he wants this to apply to orders which relate only to fees.  If the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; had appeared somewhere else I would not have a word to say.  The section says: &ldquo;... any order ... which relates only to fees&rdquo;.  I cannot see that that means anything, except that if the order relates to fees and something else, it shall not be dealt with according to the provisions of this section.  It is merely when the order refers only <Col N="1722" /> to fees and nothing else that it is dealt with under the section.  Probably when one is drafting this sort of thing, it appears easy because one is looking for a particular thing to be done, and in doing it one does not necessarily see that it is capable of some other interpretation.  I think it is capable of the interpretation which I am saying it has, that is, that only one particular type of order comes under the section and that is one restricted to fees and nothing else.</P>

Might I suggest that sort of thing might be done by the Treasury by order or by regulation or by description under the 1832 Act which the Minister can now do in regard to salaries and expenses and all he has to do is to make an order relating to fees.  Section 4 says it must relate only to fees.  That may be the intention but it is not what the Minister is saying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe in plain language and in plain English, apart from the gymnastics of drafting.  As I see it, this subsection is very explicit. It relates only to fees.  It properly confines me to the intention in the legislation, which is that section 4 deals only with fees orders.  It emphasises the point which Senator Sheldon sought to make which was to confine me strictly in the laying of any such orders, and that they should be fees orders and fees orders alone, and that no extraneous matter should be involved.  That is what we have set out in fairly plain English by using the plain word &ldquo;only&rdquo; in subsection (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1723" /> I want to emphasise that this Bill is very limited and that section 4 is more limited still.  We are concerned only with fees orders and no more.  We are not concerned with the exercise of any other power in section 35 of the 1832 Act or in any other Act.  I am not seeking to get any powers in regard to any orders which might include fees and other extraneous matters.  I want to bring the Seanad back to the realities of the Bill we are discussing, which is a very limited Bill concerned with the laying of documents.  Under section 4, fees orders will have to be laid on the Table of the Houses of the Oireachtas, but proper provision is made in regard to the time and date of coming into force of the orders.  My anxiety is to ensure that we do only what we want to do, and what we want to do under section 4 is to remove doubts as to the effective date of fees orders.  The rights or wrongs of any other type of order under section 35 of the 1832 Act are not being touched on in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to follow why the Minister is so insistent on this point.  As I see it, there would be three types of orders : orders which relate to fees and absolutely nothing else; orders which we may describe as orders of a mixed type which would relate to fees and other matters; and orders which would relate to matters other than fees and make absolutely no reference to fees.  It seems to me that the basis of the difference of opinion here is in regard to what might be described as the mixed orders, that is, orders which can contain a reference to fees and other matters. The Minister may say that he has no intention of breeding any such animal, no intention of making any order which refers to fees and other matters, but it is open to the Minister and his successors, so far as I read it, to make these mixed orders which would refer to fees and other matters. If it is open to the Minister to make these mixed orders, they should be dealt with in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that as this is drafted, it clearly applies to orders <Col N="1724" /> which relate to fees and fees alone, and equally clearly, it does not apply to orders which deal with matters other than fees, but so long as it is open to the Minister to make orders of this mixed type, then I think that if an order which relates to fees only properly comes before the House, a hybrid order which mentions fees in one section and something else in another should come before the Houses also.  If these are to be a matter for review in an order dealing solely with fees, they should be a matter for review also if they are made by means of a mixed order, as I have called it.  Otherwise the Minister should bring in a self-denying ordinance which would preclude him from making orders which relate to fees and other matters. Then the issue would be clear.</P>

It seems to me that on the face of it a reasonable case has been made by Senator Sheldon that such orders may possibly be mixed orders and should be covered. What the Minister wanted to do is very proper but I suggest the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; got into the wrong part of the sentence. To give effect properly it should have read: &ldquo;This section only applies to any order which relates to fees.&rdquo;  It is the unfortunate position of the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; in the last clause which produces this odd effect and it would be possible to have a mixed order which then would not be subject to the control of section 4.  All I want is to ensure <Col N="1725" /> there is no foolishness or doubt in the provision.  I would be happy if the Minister promised to have another look at it.</P>

      <P>If I had my way with the House on the Committee Stage of this Bill, what I have to say now would be out of order because university statutes would not be part of the Bill.  However, the House has determined that the Bill shall apply to university statutes and there is one small comment on the position which I think I should make.  The House has, by rejecting the amendment on Committee Stage, made it clear that it wishes the intention of the 1908 Act which allowed university statutes to lie before the Houses of the Oireachtas to be kept in effect through the provisions of this Bill.  Long before this Bill was brought in, in 1942, a statutory order <Col N="1726" /> was made to the same effect.  It was a Government order and it laid down that in the case of university statutes that the minimum of the prorogation of Dáil Éireann should be a period of 21 days on which Dáil Éireann would not sit.</P>
      <P>It appears there is a reasonable case for arguing, and I should like to bring it to the notice of the Minister and ask him, in turn, to bring it to the notice of the Government, that the statutory order of 1942 is now redundant by reason of the passage of this Bill.  It may not be possible readily to revoke that order, but on the face of it, the order appears to apply only to the count of time during prorogation which is now covered by four sitting weeks in the present Bill.  The simpler things can be made in regard to this the better and, as I pointed out, the better it will be for the universities in the matter of the difficulties they may run into in the recruitment of staff.  I ask the Minister if the matter of the possible revocation of the statutory instrument of 1942 which appears now to be redundant could be favourably considered.</P>

      <P>Having queried quite a number of things in regard to detail, I should like to say that this is indeed a very welcome Bill, one that does something very desirable in clarifying the laying of documents before the House.  Even section 4 has wrought some clarification in regard to them.  I should like to take this opportunity of indicating my welcome for the Bill. I might have left some doubts in the Minister's mind earlier in the day.  A great deal of the Bill might have been expressed more clearly.  In essence, the possible lack of clarity in reading it is not of great importance.  This is a Bill very much for the officials of the House.  Once they know its provisions, they know it is not necessary to say things this way and that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this relates particularly to sections one to three.  I am still not happy about the phraseology of section 4. It is very important that care is being taken to see that control of delegated legislation is precise in the way it <Col N="1727" /> operates.

      <P>The existing law relating to patents for inventions is contained in the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act, 1927, which will be replaced by the Patents Act, 1964, when that Act is brought into force by Order.</P>
      <P>Section 55 (1) of the 1927 Act precludes protection of chemical products or substances intended for food and medicine, except when those products or substances are produced by the actual processes described in the complete specification.</P>
      <P>It would, obviously, be very difficult for a patentee in any infringement action to prove that the alleged infringing substance was made by a particular process.  There is, therefore, an important proviso to Section 55 (1) by virtue of which any substance which is of the same chemical composition as one to which a patent concerned in an infringement action relates is deemed to have been made by the patented process unless proof to the contrary is forthcoming.  In other words, it is sufficient in such an action for the patentee to show that the alleged infringing substance is of the same chemical composition as that covered by his patent, and so place the onus of proving that it was made by a different process on the defendant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Act, the 1964 Act, following on international trend, introduces protection of chemical products or substances intended for food or medicine and so differs from the 1927 Act which, as I said, precludes protection of the products except where they would be produced by the actual process described in the specification.  In <Col N="1728" /> addition to this extended protection, the new Act, by means of a transitional provision enables pending applications relating to such products or substances to proceed under its provisions and have the benefit of the wider protection which it affords. Patents granted under the new Act, the 1964 Act, will not, therefore, require the protection given by the proviso to section 55 (1) of the 1927 Act and for that reason the proviso has not been continued into the 1964 Act.  It was dropped.</P>
    <P>No representations were made at the time of the enactment of the 1964 Act regarding the proviso to section 55 (1) until after the enactment of the new Act.  There was nothing on record to show that at any time anybody had found it necessary to avail of the provisions of this proviso.  The Pharmaceutical and Allied Industries Adaptation Association has, however, subsequent to the passing of the Act, brought to notice the apprehension of its members at the pending removal from the law of the proviso in the 1927 Act as a result of which, where a patent granted under the 1927 Act is infringed or the subject of an infringement action, the patentee may be burdened with the almost impossible task of proving that the substance concerned was made by the process which he had patented.  It is probably impossible for a person so to prove.  The association contends that, rather than indicating that it was not necessary, failure to avail of the proviso proved that it had acted as a deterrent and was therefore of value.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the fears expressed by the Adaptation Association are well founded and that there is a danger that the removal of the presumptive clause will tend to retard or inhibit expansion prospects in the pharmaceutical industry.  The amendment of the Act now proposed will continue the clause in force in relation to patents granted under the 1927 Act in the new 1964 Act when that comes into force.</P>
    <P>I recommend the principle of the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <P>Having listened to <Col N="1729" /> Senator Sheldon giving a disquisition on the law relating to stamp duty and now having listened to the Minister, one begins to see the need for lawyers. What the Minister has said to me, as a lawyer, is quite difficult to follow, except that I understand the interpretation of it.  Since this is something about which the affected interests, the pharmaceutical manufacturers, are concerned, and since the Bill is the result of the Minister's acceptance of their representations, I think the House should have no difficulty in accepting it.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister might indicate when it is intended that the Patents Act will come into operation?  The old 1927 Act is divided now into three new pieces of legislation and it would be interesting to know when it is intended that the 1964 Patents Act will come into operation or whether, in fact, it is necessary to extend the transitional period for some little time further in order to enable the transition to be effected in a manner suitable for people interested in it.</P>

      <P>While I am not a lawyer, I suppose fools rush in where angels fear to tread.  I should like to add my voice to that of Senator O'Quigley in asking the Minister the date of the operation of the Act.  It would seem probable to me, because the Act has already been delayed 18 months, there might be a tendency now to rush it when this amending legislation has been passed.  Even though this provision we are dealing with now is already a deterrent, it has proved, in the past, to be effective and will, no doubt, be so in the future.  For that reason, we welcome this provision in the Act and certainly do not intend to oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, who gave an assurance in the other House that the patent agents would be given sufficient notice, to be more specific and to give at least four months because, while 90 per cent of the applications here are from outside the State, it will be necessary for the Association of Patent Agents to notify their colleagues who, in turn, notify their clients.  I would ask that as much notice <Col N="1730" /> as possible, at least four months, be given.  It is only fair that that notice should be given because it takes so much time, and even with present means of communication, big business moves slowly.  We know only too well they deserve to be given that amount of notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, I am surprised that this Bill should come before us at all.  We now have a situation that we passed a Patents Bill, now an Act, in 1964, which has not yet been put into operation and even before it has been put into operation it is necessary to amend it.  I think we are entitled to an explanation as to why this matter was not dealt with in the Act of 1964.  Was there any consultation with those people who say they are now affected by it?  Why did they not make their point of view clear at that time?  Surely there was some consultation between the Department and the people concerned in the legislation going through at that time.  Why is the Act still not brought into force? Presumably, when we pass legislation here, it is with the intention of applying it?  I know it is often prudent and necessary to provide within the legislation that it will operate on a date fixed by the Minister so that some necessary action can be taken; in other words, that it will apply, for example, say, on 1st April rather than on 23rd February, when it was signed by the Minister.  Why has the Act passed in 1964 not yet been brought into operation? Is there some good reason why it is still held off?  If so, why did we pass it in 1964?  What was the urgency about it at that time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite frankly, I am quite puzzled about all this.  There seems to be a messing about with a situation, when we passed legislation two years ago which is still not in operation and now we are asked to amend that legislation even before it is put into operation.  It is terrible messing.  What is this body? Is this a joint body composed of both sides of industry&mdash;pharmaceutical and allied industries?  Is it a joint body? If so, why did the employers not have a responsibility in the matter way back in 1964; why did they not see the <Col N="1731" /> point?  I am sure the Minister would, at that time, have been very willing to provide the matter in the legislation, as apparently he is now willing to do.  I am not opposed to this measure, but I think it is sloppy and messy that we are asked to amend an Act which is not yet even in operation, despite the fact that we passed it two years ago.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I should explain for the Senator what the Adaptation Council is.  I do not think it is necessary.  There were consultations with the industry concerned when the 1964 Bill was going through the Oireachtas and, indeed, there were recommendations from the industry in relation to that Bill.  The Adaptation Association was, I think, hardly formed at that time and if they did not make representations on this particular point, it was, perhaps, because their attention was directed at other matters which were more immediate. I do not think, however, it is to be regarded as messiness on their part.  It was a responsible action of theirs to ask that this proviso, which is not new but was being dropped, should be reintroduced into the new Bill, and I recommended it to the Seanad on that basis.</P>
      <P>I do intend that adequate notice of several weeks will be given to the people concerned before the order is made.  I am disappointed that the date of commencement has not been appointed.  Again, it is not a question of: &ldquo;Why did you have to have that Act a couple of years ago if it is not introduced yet?&rdquo; Rules have to be made and the task involved in making the rules was protracted.  These were not made until December, 1965.  Apart from that, there are administrative difficulties in the Patents Office in relation to trained staff and other matters but I hope that quite soon we shall be able to find a solution to these problems and name a commencement date in the near future.  As I said, when it is being named, adequate notice will be given to the people concerned.</P>

Why not the Patents Bill, 1966?  Every one of the Transport Acts amended previous Acts and yet they read&mdash; Transport Act, 1963, Transport Act, 1964 and so on.  I see no reason whatever for inserting &ldquo;Amendment&rdquo;.  It is a waste of time and printing to put it in.  We had the Tourist Traffic Bill, amending a previous Act, but we did not call it the Tourist Traffic (Amendment) Bill.  This is more of this sloppy kind of drafting.

      <P>I have circulated an <Col N="1733" /> explanatory memorandum to Senators in relation to this to explain the background of the Order and the purpose of it.  The Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain provides for the removal of a number of quotas, some on the 1st July, 1966 and others are being retained for varying periods of time after that.  One of those being retained for two years is the quota on leather footwear and this quota is being retained to meet the wishes of the manufacturers here.  The agreement also provides for the elimination of the quota restriction on rubber and plastic footwear.  The rubber footwear quota up to now included slippers. The manufactures of slippers wished to retain protection by quota and, accordingly, this order enlarges the scope of the leather footwear quota to include slippers.  Plastic footwear is being removed from the leather footwear quota and the quota on rubber footwear is being abolished.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about the Memorandum.  I do think that, if we are asked to approve of a particular Order, that that Order should be circulated in the same way as a Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I observe from what the Minister has said that it is intended to abolish the quota on leather footwear at the end of two years.  I remember here at one time in the House, on the Institute of Standards Bill, complaining about the quality of Irish footwear.  The Minister for Transport and Power was handling the Bill for the Minister for <Col N="1734" /> Industry and Commerce and I complained&mdash;I thought I had a legitimate complaint&mdash;that before three weeks were out a pair of shoes were letting in water.  When I made representations to the manufacturers, they said: &ldquo;We do not guarantee them to be dry.&rdquo;  I felt that was a reasonable kind of complaint to make, but I was told they were not guaranteed to be watertight. Some time later when the CIO were established, apparently it was discovered that there was great room for improvement in Irish industry.  I hope the two year period which is being allowed will be used by the manufacturers for the purpose of getting themselves into proper shape.  I know they realise the necessity for it, and I hope they will take the appropriate steps to prepare themselves for the competition they will have to meet when the quotas are abolished.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that on the last occasion when I was looking for a pair of lady's slippers, in the company of my wife, I was told in O'Connell Street that you cannot get such slippers in June, July and August.  Apparently women do not wear or need slippers in the summertime. It is an extraordinary commentary upon this business, that in the city of Dublin, in the heart of Ireland, in the summertime, you cannot get slippers, and that you are told they are only in line at Christmas.  That is the kind of thing that brings Irish industry into disrepute, and the kind of situation that resulted from the fact that these people had protection, and knew that only a certain amount could be imported, and did not bother their heads to meet the needs of the market. I hope that situation has since cleared up.</P>
    <P>I want also to refer to the kind of drafting we get.  When I referred to this matter on the Patents Bill, the Minister took refuge in the advice of the parliamentary draftsman that this type of thing is necessary.  The parliamentary draftsman is not the person who makes the laws.  I hope we will be given an opportunity of expressing our views on these matters on a motion to amend this kind of nonsense and slovenely drafting.  I want to draw <Col N="1735" /> the attention of the Minister to paragraph 3 of this order and I want to ask him whether it is fair to expect business people who cannot be running off to lawyers, and who want to get a short synopsis of what the position is at any time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It depends on the lawyer.  A leading Queen's Counsel in England got a fee of 500 guineas for saying: &ldquo;This particular draft does not conform with the spirit or intention of the Hire Purchase Act&rdquo;.  You can get very short opinions if you want them.  Will the Minister attempt to justify this: &ldquo;The Control of Imports bracket Quota No. 3 bracket Order, 1934 bracket S.R. &amp; O., No. 242 of 1934 bracket, as amended by the Control of Imports bracket Quota No. 3 bracket bracket Amendment bracket Order, 1935 bracket S.R. &amp; O., No. 18 of 1935 bracket, and by the Control of Imports bracket Quotas Nos. 1 to 32 bracket Amendment bracket Order, 1939&mdash;they forgot to close the bracket there&mdash;bracket S.R. &amp; O., No. 402 of 1939 bracket, is hereby further amended by the substitution of the following paragraph for paragraph 4.&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister justify that kind of draftsmanship?  Will he tell us that the parliamentary draftsman decrees that this is the way this should be done, or the only way it could be done?  If that is his view, I should like to invite the parliamentary draftsman to meet me and I will give him a run-over what I think ought to be done.</P>

It is dreadful.  The time has come when we should modernise, and instead of having all these amendments, state what the position is.  There must be some way other than constantly looking at one after another.</P>
      <P>We also find: &ldquo;This Order may be cited as the Control of Imports bracket Amendment of Quota No. 3 and Revocation of Quota No. 4 bracket Order, 1965.&rdquo;  That is absurd, and I do not expect that the Minister will begin to justify it.  I do not think he ought to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Senator O'Quigley was unable to get slippers in August.  I am concerned about this because I feel that the footwear industry is a very important one.  I am concerned also because plastic footwear is of increasing importance, particularly for children.  What has been produced in Ireland in recent years has been very good value, and of very good quality.  The quota on plastic footwear has been removed and in the future it is to be replaced by a duty.  In fact, the duty applies from 1st January, 1966.  I should like to know whether this will in any way affect the employment prospects in that industry and whether the provision of a duty instead of a quota will prevent dumping of cheap material which is found in other countries, which would affect the employment here of the people engaged in this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In another context, the Minister has been talking about doing something to protect industry generally from the ill effects of dumping.  I wonder if he is satisfied that the quota restrictions being substituted by tariffs will properly protect the workers employed in the industry.  I should like him to <Col N="1737" /> assure us there has been consultation with the unions representing these workers in regard to these changes&mdash; whether they are satisfied that the interests of their members are properly looked after and that they have no opposition to express to these changes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum states that the leather footwear manufacturers wished that quota restrictions should apply rather than a duty and that the rubber and plastic footwear people wanted the levy.  I am interested to know why there is this difference in this field.  As far as the footwear industry is concerned, the Minister and his colleagues are so anxious for free trade that I imagine quota restrictions would suit the manufacturers and the unions better than the duty from the point of view of protection.  How does it come that the plastic and rubber people feel that the other way is more advantageous to them?</P>
      <P>Another matter is referred to in paragraph 3 of the explanatory memorandum which states that the order prohibits the importation, save under licence, of all footwear other than that made solely of rubber or plastic.  This raises a very important question.  Whether we like it or not, a large section of our people will pay any price for continental shoes, particularly Italian.  They do not mind about the price so long as they can get the shoes.  There is a fortune to be made by those people in the trade who have licences to import foreign footwear and I should like the Minister to tell us on what basis are the licences issued.  Is there an annual review, are the licences issued on a first-come, first-served basis, or are the names of reputable people put into a hat and the lucky ones drawn, or is it a fact that a certain number of people in this city in particular, have a gold mine at their disposal for as long as they live in the form of licences for the importation of foreign shoes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of years ago I was asked by various people interested why it was that there was this wall, this iron curtain to prevent them from getting <Col N="1738" /> an opportunity to import footwear from abroad.  It is not that I favour the idea of foreign footwear but since it is allowed in, I submit that fair play should be given all round in the issuing of licences.  I ask the Minister to tell us if licences are issued each year and the system under which they are issued.  Will the Minister ensure that if a number of applications for licences come before him, they will all have equal opportunities?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The question raised by Senator McQuillan was raised recently in another place&mdash;the question of the anomaly arising in this industry.  The licensing system is administered very rigorously but the base year was taken as 1956 and the licences have been issued on the basis of Irish purchases by individual people in that year.  I intend to have that changed to a more recent year and I think this will get rid of the anomaly which existed because there was not an annual change.  One year was accepted and was continued.</P>
      <P>Protection is by quota and tariffs.  In either case, quotas will be replaced by a tariff and in relation to footwear, the tariff will be high.  The proposal of the leather footwear people to maintain the quota for two years is to suit their own needs.  They feel this is a better form of protection for them.  The rubber footwear people represented to me that the protection by quota resulted in better lines filling the quota and the Irish manufacturer was left with the less remunerative field and the quota was utilised to use up what demand there was for the more expensive lines.  They thought, therefore, they would be better protected by tariff than by quota.  In each case it was a decision of the industry, as it was in the case of the makers of slippers who wanted to be protected by a quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of drafting, I think the lawyers may find it necessary to make certain, even if the paragraph might look obscure, that it covers the law.  The note states that the instrument prohibits the importation, except under licence, of certain footwear&mdash; and it goes on to describe the type of footwear.  It gives a very clear explanation <Col N="1739" /> to those in the trade and if any difficulty arises, the Revenue Commissioners are there.</P>

      <P>I had a few minutes last week to start my reply and I want to finish this evening, if possible.  I am sorry the Minister cannot be present but I appreciate that there are a lot of calls on his time. I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for being present.  I would like, first of all, to answer some of the points made by Senators.  The first speech I want to deal with is that of <Col N="1740" /> Senator Ó Maoláin.  He made some, what seemed to me, fantastic remarks about my speech being the gory story of sadistic teachers.  I was making the point last time that I never used the word &ldquo;sadistic&rdquo;, either in my opening speech or on any occasion when I raised the question of corporal punishment.  Senator Yeats also seemed to think I made some &ldquo;sadistic&rdquo; references.  My main contention has been that the vast majority of cases of corporal punishment are for minor offences which may not do any harm but are so rife that attention should be paid to them.  The quantity of those minor beatings, furthermore, may become a basis for extreme cases.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Maoláin startled me, and rather frightened me, by saying: &ldquo;The ghost of Cromwell walks the land today.&rdquo;  This naturally is geared to frighten any Senator walking out in the dark after a meeting.  I never understood his reference to the ghost of Cromwell.  Apparently, the identification here was pretty well between myself and Cromwell.  I never understood that Cromwell was a vehement opponent of corporal punishment.  I rather thought the contrary, that he was an exponent of it.  I do not agree the cap fits here.</P>

      <P>I struggled to understand it.  I remember, in fact, the point he was making.  Cromwell treated teachers very badly and I was similarly treating them very badly. Therefore, Cromwell and I were on the same level.  James Joyce, Seán O'Casey and myself also came more or less into the same bracket.  I should be very proud to be considered in the same bracket, but I do not really feel that this is a strong argument.  In fact, I am inclined to ask what kind of nonsense is this, in relation to this motion. All I can say in relation to Senator Ó Maoláin's remarks in this connection is that I am quite convinced the major portion of the more nonsensical views and speeches he makes he does <Col N="1741" /> not believe in at all.  I give him credit for that.  Why does he do it?  Why does he make this kind of speech?  I have a sort of feeling it is in order to show that there is a big difference between the extreme reactionary, which he pretends momentarily to be, but which he is not, and myself, whom he might regard as an extreme in the other direction.  This would allow the Minister to tread the middle path and look very liberal because he does not go all the way with Senator Ó Maoláin and all the way with me.  This is the only explanation I can find for Senator Ó Maoláin going to such lengths of absurdity.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Maoláin also said that the Irish revolutionaries, whom we are soon to honour, were all produced by national schools.  I intervened and reminded him of what Pádraig Pearse, who is regarded as the symbol of those men, thought of the national schools of his day.  I have a copy of his pamphlet here.  He called them the murder machines of the day.  He compared the English educational system in Ireland with the systems of slave education which existed in the ancient pagan republics side by side with the systems intended for the education of freemen.  He went on to say:</P>
      <P>To the children of the free were taught all noble and goodly things which would tend to make them strong and proud and valiant; from the children of the slaves all such dangerous knowledge was hidden. They were taught not to be strong and proud and valiant, but to be sleek, to be obsequious, to be dexterous: the object was not to make them good men but to make them good slaves.  And so in Ireland.  The education system here was designed by our masters in order to make us willing or at least manageable slaves.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Maoláin spoke about those &ldquo;splendid&rdquo; schools, the schools which &ldquo;formed&rdquo; people like Pádraig Pearse. This is what Pearse thought of the national schools of his day, and I feel his argument will have some strength.</P>

      <P>I would say the rebels produced by those schools were in rebellion against authority, as Senator Ó Maoláin and his Party very frequently were, and very frequently, if not always, to their credit.  You cannot have it both ways. The men who came out and the men who fought were not sleek and obsequious but that is what Pádraig Pearse thought was the aim of the national schools in his day.  I could give further quotations but I shall not weary the House on that point.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Maoláin also said that &ldquo;restrictions&rdquo; on corporal punishment, as he said, &ldquo;must be got rid of.&rdquo; I wonder what the late Tomás Ó Deirig, who introduced in 1946 these restrictions, would have thought?  Why should his restrictions be got rid of? I think he, in introducing amendments to those regulations, was doing a very good job.  I do not feel he was imposing either irrational or harmful restrictions.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Maoláin would also ask us to believe that teachers would not be &ldquo;robbed of their authority&rdquo; if we did not allow them to use corporal punishment.  From whom or from what is this authority derived?  From whom in fact is the authority of our national school system derived?  If you go back to the Council of Education Report, you will find, of course, it derives in a major extent from the British administration, going right back to the Lord Lieutenant and his rules and regulations.  The authority of the Minister, and the authority of the school managers, and in particular, the managerial system, was the British system. It was welcomed by many of the authorities then despised by Pádraig Pearse but it is still in operation.  This authority and, of course, the vesting of this authority more theoretically than in practice in the parents of the parish, goes, in fact, to the school managers who need not in fact, under the law, be clergy.  They can be any prominent or respect-worthy citizen but, in practice as we know, almost all of them are clerical school managers, but their &ldquo;authority&rdquo; derives directly from the old Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1743" /> I think it worth mentioning, when we talk about authority, the case of the teacher McGahern who was given leave of absence by the Minister. The Minister paid his salary while he was a teacher for seven and a half years, and I have it on good authority from pupils under his care that he was regarded as one of the best teachers in the school.  I also heard, indeed, that he was granted a special award some years before as an outstandingly good teacher, but the fact is, of course, that he was given leave of absence by the Minister, and was paid by the Minister, but when he was dismissed, deprived of his livelihood by the school manager, not only did the Minister have nothing to say to it but he has, we were told, no responsibility, no control, no authority in the matter. That is the point I am making&mdash;the authority in the school is all too often not vested in the Minister at all; he has no power, in other words.  I should like to ask the question whether, in a particular case like that, involving ministerial authority, from whom did the Minister receive the order to cease paying a salary to this dismissed teacher?</P>

      <P>I turn to the speech of Senator Garret FitzGerald and he said quite reasonably that it was for me, on my side of the debate, to show that corporal punishment can be done without.  I shall try to satisfy him on that point.  I should first like to quote a letter in <i>The Times</i> of London dated November 11th, 1965, signed by the headmaster of a Jewish school in London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1744" /> He says, in relation to corporal punishment:</P>
    <P>Caning is an indignity for the child as well as for the teacher who administers it and too frequently is not efficacious.</P>
    <P>In the Rosh Pinah Jewish Day School, of which I have the honour to be Principal, corporal punishment is unknown and no lack of discipline results.  Generally speaking one can, over a period of time, create a climate of happy discipline, which obviates the treating of children as some ignorant people treat the lower animals.</P>
    <P>In the Scandinavian countries, and in France&mdash;about which I know a fair amount&mdash;it is found possible throughout the whole educational system to abolish corporal punishment altogether. Even the Les Fréres de la Doctrine Chrétienne in France and their counterparts in Italy teach there effectively without recourse to corporal punishment. How can this be?  If corporal punishment can be done without by this teaching order in France and Italy, why is it necessary in Ireland?  Is it because Irish children have a greater dose of original sin, or is it because Irish teachers have a greater dose of original sin?  Why is it necessary here, if it can be done without in the Scandinavian countries and in France?</P>
    <P>I will say this also, to come nearer to home.  In Ireland, as Senators know, some of the teaching orders&mdash;and by no means the least effective ones&mdash; never use corporal punishment.  I would regard this as a central proof that it can effectively be done without by the others.  I should like to quote Fr. O'Doherty, Professor of Psychology in University College, Dublin, who was quoted by Michael Viney lately as saying&mdash;I will paraphrase but, essentially, this is what he said: No person who willingly inflicts pain upon a child can be considered civilised.</P>
    <P>That is the opinion of the Professor of Psychology in University College, Dublin.  It does not necessarily mean we have to accept that without question but it does mean that we have to see it as being in favour of the dropping <Col N="1745" /> or modification of the application of corporal punishment in our schools.</P>
    <P>I should like to cite the case of a boy-he is now a young man-whom I questioned on a previous occasion when I was inquiring in all directions as to the extent of corporal punishment in schools&mdash;and I knew he was a boy who had been in a primary and secondary school of a well-known teaching order.  I asked him if corporal punishment extended to the secondary school level and he said: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;Up to what class?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;Up to the Leaving Certificate form.&rdquo;  This was a boy who got 75 per cent in Leaving Certificate Honours in chemistry and physics.  I asked him further how many were in the class and he replied &ldquo;30&rdquo;.  I then asked what age were they and he replied: &ldquo;About 17½.&rdquo; I asked how many approximately would be beaten on an average?  He paused and said: &ldquo;About ten per week&rdquo;.  These were senior boys in a relatively small class going up for Leaving Certificate Honours.  I asked him another question: &ldquo;Were there any Brothers who did not use corporal punishment?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;There were two who never laid a finger on us.&rdquo; I asked if they were any use, and he replied: &ldquo;Ah, the best.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, I regard this as an argument showing that it is not necessary in Ireland to have corporal punishment as commonly applied as it is in our schools.  Just one final point about that particular boy which struck me: he was a lightearted, intelligent and cheerful person, and yet when he was answering these questions&mdash;and in fact the only time I ever saw it happen&mdash; he was trembling with hatred.  I feel that this is not a normal condition for a boy; he had left the school two or three years before that occasion, when he was asked a number of questions about his schooling.  Yet he was apparently still filled with hatred.</P>
    <P>In further answer to Senator Garret FitzGerald's question as to whether it could be shown that corporal punishment could be done away with, a Yorkshire survey, the West Riding of Yorkshire, again as illustrated by Michael Viney, showed, in a <Col N="1746" /> detailed survey on schools which had given up corporal punishment, that there was no question but that discipline improved and the delinquency figures diminished after the abolition of corporal forms of punishment.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one final quotation.  It is from a book in the Library downstairs called <i>The Challenge of the Retarded Child</i>.  It is by a nun&mdash;Sr. Mary Theodore, OSF, published in 1964, and this is one of the things she says:</P>
    <P>Unless discipline becomes self-discipline, it has little permanent value.  The attempt to forestall misbehaviour through fear of punishment will not help the child to control his conduct when the threat is removed.</P>
    <P>That seems to me a very balanced statement.  I refer Senators to the book, which is in our own Library downstairs.</P>
    <P>So in answer to Senator Garret FitzGerald's question of whether or not corporal punishment can be done without, I suggest that it can, for those six reasons I have given; and they are examples of why I think it can be done without, and fruitfully done without.</P>
    <P>Senator Garret FitzGerald also asked the Minister why the rules in regard to corporal punishment had been changed, and the answer he got from the Minister was a pretty dusty one, I am afraid.  The answer was that the Minister is proud of his &ldquo;positive approach&rdquo;&mdash;and the word is his&mdash;to the new rules.  I should like now to do what perhaps I should have done before.  I should like to quote side by side the old rules and the new rules so that they may be on record.  I shall quote first of all from section 3 of Rule 95 of the old rules.  It reads:</P>
    <P>To evince a regard for the improvement and general welfare of their pupils; to treat them with kindness, combined with firmness; and to aim at governing them by their affections and reason, rather by harshness and severity.</P>
    <P>Rule 96 of the old Rules reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  Corporal punishment should be administered only for grave transgressions. <Col N="1747" /> In no circumstances should corporal punishment be administered for mere failure at lessons.</P>
    <P>(2)  Only the principal teacher, or such other member of the staff as may be duly authorised by the manager for the purpose, should inflict corporal punishment.</P>
    <P>(3)  Only a light cane or rod may be used for the purpose of corporal punishment which should be inflicted only on the open hand.  The boxing of children's ears, the pulling of their hair or similar ill-treatment is absolutely forbidden and will be visited with sever penalties.</P>
    <P>(4)  No teacher should carry about a cane or other instrument of punishment.</P>
    <P>(5)  Frequent recourse to corporal punishment will be considered by the Minister as indicating bad tone and ineffective discipline.</P>
    <P>Those were the old Rules.  The new Rule, number 130 at page 74 reads as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  Teachers should have a lively regard for the improvement and general welfare of their pupils, treat them with kindness combined with firmness and should aim at governing them through their affections and reason and not by harshness and severity.  Ridicule, sarcasm or remarks likely to undermine a pupil's self-confidence should be avoided.</P>
    <P>(2)  Corporal punishment should be administered only in cases of serious misbehaviour and should not be administered for mere failure at lessons.</P>
    <P>(3)  Corporal punishment should be administered only by the principal teacher or other member of the school staff authorised by the manager for the purpose.</P>
    <P>(4)  Any teacher who inflicts improper or excessive punishment will be regarded as guilty of conduct unbefitting a teacher and will be subject to severe disciplinary action.</P>
    <P>Having quoted one after the other the old and the new Rule, I should <Col N="1748" /> like to make the point that in the new Rule there are, in fact, five sentences in all.  Four of these sentences are negative in effect, I think, and the other is already there in the old Rules as I have quoted them.  Five sentences, four are negative and one positive, and that one is already in the old Rule. What becomes, therefore, of the Minister's plea that the change in the Rules represents a &ldquo;new&rdquo; positive approach?  He has five sentences.  One is positive, and it was already in the old Rule and the other four are negative. I regard his defence of the change as eyewash.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald was perfectly right on another point he made, in regard to parent-teacher associations, which I should like to see evolving, about crankiness on the part of some parents being dealt with in practive by parental public opinion.  That is the best way to deal with it.  It does not, in fact, provide a problem.  The mere fact that there is an occasional crank or crackpot does not mean you must not allow teachers and parents to come together.  It makes it easier because the parents themselves will deal with unreasonable parents.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald made very strongly the point that parents should be encouraged to come into the schools.  I should like to read the new Rule 13 on page 11.  Section 1 reads thus:</P>
    <P>Any person may, with the manager's permission, visit a national school during school hours for the purpose of observing the ordinary working of the school, but such visitor may not interfere with the business of the school or divert the attention of the teachers or pupils from their work.</P>
    <P>The old Rule 3 on page 9 was:</P>
    <P>The teachers should receive visitors courteously and afford them an opportunity of observing the ordinary working of the school.</P>
    <P>There is here again a significant change in the Rule.  Previously the parents could go freely to the schools provided they did not disturb the work.  Now they can go only with the manager's <Col N="1749" /> permission.  I asked the Minister for an explanation of this change, but I did not get any answer on the point.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the speech made by Senator McAuliffe.  He suggested that I was bound to raise this question at the very first opportunity and so on, and apparently he was disappointed that I was not elected to the Seanad the last time.  He felt in a sense&mdash;perhaps I am being unjust&mdash; that they had wasted their time in getting Senator Brosnahan in here to answer me when I was not here to be answered.  We are both here today, I am glad to say.  I think the Senator will do this justice to me: I want to point out that on July 28th and 29th I spoke&mdash;and not briefly&mdash;on the Appropriation Bill and I mentioned education.  I spoke about the Minister's plans and about the Minister himself. I gave him a great deal of praise, and though in one passage I did mention corporal punishment, it certainly was not the major portion of what I said. I should like to feel&mdash;but I am not innocent enough to believe it&mdash;that the Minister might have read what I said then, because certainly what I said was very much in favour of what the new Minister said in his speech on the Estimate in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I come now, however, to Senator McAuliffe's reference to my &ldquo;attacks on national school teacher&rdquo;.  I do not think I attack or have attacked national school teachers.  I recognise that teachers are caught between the upper and the nether millstone, the upper millstone being the managers above them, and the nether millstone being the overcrowded classes under their charge.  I have said again and again that I recognise that the vast majority of teachers do not maltreat their students.  For instance, on 19th April, 1956, as reported at column 1950 of the Official Report, I said:</P>
    <P>These are extreme cases.  I have never suggested that this type of case is the rule.  But I am satisfied that the extreme cases show a background, a general pattern, of beating for minor offences, that is to say, not grave transgressions, and I suggest that that goes on to the certain <Col N="1750" /> knowledge of most of the parents of the country in far too many schools, and that it applies to girls as well as to boys.</P>
    <P>On June 30th, 1955, as reported at column 105, I said:</P>
    <P>...when any protest or criticism is made of beating in schools, one sees an unhappy &ldquo;closing of the ranks&rdquo;, and unfortunately, the good teacher who, I am convinced, is in the big majority, feels bound to defend the transgressors from a sort of false sense of loyalty.</P>
    <P>That is my attitude towards teachers. The good teacher is in the vast majority.  That is what I have said all along.  I do not like to be credited with making a kind of all-out and indiscriminate attack upon the teaching profession. In fact, on 30th June, 1955, when I raised this on the Adjournment as reported at column 100 of the Official Report, I said:</P>
    <P>In relation to the teachers, I know that the teachers themselves are uneasy about the whole question of corporal punishment, that the National Conference of the INTO had several resolutions down calling for the abolition of corporal punishment in primary schools&mdash;and indeed I think that in that direction lies perhaps the best solution.</P>
    <P>My sympathy goes to the teacher. I myself am a teacher; I am the son of teachers, and I do not want anything I say subsequently to be taken as a sort of general attack upon the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>These three quotations I think should suffice to indicate that I am not making a slashing and all-out attack on the teachers for the situation in relation to corporal punishment in our schools.</P>
    <P>I quote one final passage from the Seanad debate of June 30th, 1955, when I said at column 105:</P>
    <P>I should like to ask also what is the teacher to do?  We know that they are teaching sometimes close on 60 to 70 children in overcrowded conditions.  We know that many of them are under-trained teachers. <Col N="1751" /> We know that most of them are underpaid.  We know that there are no recreational facilities for the children.  That is all very true, but is this the fault of the children of six and upwards in the schools? Why should these children pay for neglect of duty by the Department, by the Minister, by society, by all of us, and pay dearly for it, in terms of pain and fear and tears?</P>
    <P>I think I have demonstrated therefore that Senator McAuliffe was less than just when he accuses me of making constant attacks on national teachers. Clearly I did not make general attacks on national teachers, and I never have.</P>
    <P>Senator McAuliffe thinks it is a slur on or an insult to the teacher to say: &ldquo;Do not box this child's ear or pull his hair&rdquo;.  I would ask him to consider whether it is an insult, for instance, to the country folk to say: &ldquo;Do not make poteen&rdquo;.  Is it an insult to a factory to say: &ldquo;Do not have insanitary premises or unsafe machines&rdquo;? Do they feel offended if we pass legislation and post up rules for safety regulations in factories?  Is it an insult to a motorist to say: &ldquo;Do not drink&rdquo; or &ldquo;Do not exceed 30 miles an hour in a built-up area&rdquo;?  No insult is involved; no slur is intended and the same applies to rules for school discipline.</P>
    <P>Senator McAuliffe also referred to &ldquo;Constance O'Connell type of propaganda&rdquo;. Propaganda is properly defined, I think, in the American phrase, as &ldquo;The other side put so well that it makes you mad&rdquo;.  What in fact have Mr. and Mrs. O'Connell, and the School Children's Protection Association which they helped to found, done?  What they did primarily, and the major impact and import of their work, was quite simply to make the Rules widely known to the parents. They have said all along&mdash;and I differ from them in degree&mdash;that all they wanted was the application of the Rules.  They did not want abolition. They made the Rules widely known to parents, and this is regarded by some as not merely making the Rules widely known but necessarily also making it widely known that the Rules <Col N="1752" /> were being widely broken.  Therefore it seemed to be concluded that since now the Rules were known and it was now widely known that they were being broken, the only action the Minister could take was to have the Rules changed.  If only the School Children's Protection Organisation and Mr. and Mrs. O'Connell had kept quiet, then the Rules need not have been changed, because though they were in fact being broken with impunity but most parents would have been none the wiser.</P>
    <P>The strap, under the new dispensation, is now permitted, and its use need no longer be confined to the hand.  I do not know whether the Seanad have seen the strap, the sort of current article, but I have one of them here and I do not know whether the House would consider it a dangerous instrument or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, and I am prepared to lay it on any volunteer Senator, for that matter. They can all recognise that it makes itself both heard and felt.  This is the strap which has become legitimate under the new Rules.  I will be happy to put it in the archives of the Library, which would be a very good place to put it.  I am assured that one teaching order in fact orders 12 dozen of these straps in the year.  I do not know what the mortality of an individual strap is, and it may well be that many of them disappear and could be found in private archives of many pupils of these schools, but this figure has been cited to me.  I wonder if the number purchased will increase, now that the strap can be used without breaking the Rules.  It may be that the number will not increase because the departmental Rules have been flouted with impunity all along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to Senator Brosnahan and I must confess&mdash;I hope he will not be offended&mdash;that his whirling words and flailing arms cause me to reflect how much I would rather, if I had to choose, be in a class of Senator McAuliffe's than in a class of Senator Brosnahan's.  He did not frighten me quite as much as Senator Ó Maoláin <Col N="1753" /> and his ghost of Cromwell but certainly he had me scared.  He seemed to be wilder, less controlled, less equable, more insecure, if he will permit me to say so, and more uneasy than Senator McAuliffe who was a good deal more peaceful and equable.</P>
    <P>Senator Brosnahan did not, I think, understand the purpose of my references to the Keeley case in Ballyfermot, or the Hurley case in Raharoon, West Cork.  My object in referring to the Keeley case was to show by example what type of punishment would not be considered, in the words of the new Rules, &ldquo;excessive or improper&rdquo;, and I cited a specific case which was not considered excessive or improper.  I was not making the case that this was a typical example.  I was making the case that it would not be considered improper or excessive.</P>
    <P>I referred to the Raharoon case in order to refer to the ministerial inquiries and to illustrate their secret and furtive nature.</P>
    <P>In the Keeley case, Senator Brosnahan said that, in the phrase used by the school manager, Canon Troy, &ldquo;examined the child&rdquo; and found him to be a liar about the cause of the beating.  I would recall to the Seanad, however, that the school manager refused to examine the child about the effect of the beating.  We have here a situation in which a mother brings a seven-year-old child to the school manager and says: &ldquo;My child has 10 weals on his back.  Will you look at what happened to him?&rdquo; And the manager refuses even to look at what is stated to be the result of school punishment.  The child is a liar, and this is enough.  I feel that to say that the school manager &ldquo;examined&rdquo; the child is perhaps an incomplete statement.  &ldquo;The child is a liar&rdquo;&mdash; perhaps he is.  Many seven-year-old children are liars, and I would almost say that if such a child always told the absolute truth, there would be something abnormal there which would need watching.  I would also say that some adults, shall we put it, have different interpretations of the truth.</P>
    <P>I notice, for instance, that in this particular case the defendant teacher swore on oath that he had given three <Col N="1754" /> or four strokes to the child.  His colleague, Mr. Kenealy, swore also on oath that he had witnessed five strokes being given; the dispensary doctor swore, also on oath, that ten weals were on the child's back, some of them three or four inches long; and the defence doctor swore that the worst mark he saw on the child's back was only an inch long.  These clearly are different interpretations of the truth, and I feel that in these circumstances he who is without sin perhaps might well be best qualified to throw the first stone at the boy who may not be a staunch adherent of the truth.</P>

The point of order I am endeavouring to make is that this case has been tried by judge and jury in the High Court and a decision has been handed down.

      <P>The Chair has no intention of listening further to either Senator.  Senators should always exercise great care in discussions on matters which have been through the courts.  It has been a custom of this House that decisions of judges in the courts should not be criticised.  I have been examining very carefully what Senator Sheehy Skeffington has been saying during the past few minutes.  He started out by referring to what had been the interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;reasonable punishment&rdquo;.  He developed that at greater length than the Chair would have wished.  In my opinion, he was very close to the bounds of order but not out of order.</P>

      <P>This demonstrates the attitude of mind of the Senator, which is not very attractive or helpful.  The point I was making relates not only to what Senator Brosnahan said about the case at length but also to a point Senator Nash made.  Senator Nash asked me if, in the light of what he said, I would modify what I said.  Senator Brosnahan tried to have this ruled out of order.  Two defence witnesses testified on oath that the Department's representative who investigated the case exonerated the teacher.</P>
      <P>Senator Nash made the case&mdash;I certainly believe what he said&mdash;that this arose not from an official report from the Department but from a casual remark by the inspector involved, and that, therefore, in good faith, these two witnesses might well have said that an official of the Department had investigated the case and had exonerated the teacher.  This is quite a probable explanation of the apparent discrepancy between this sworn testimony and what the Minister said on the point in the Dáil.  I quote from column 765 of Volume 218 of the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Mr. Ryan asked the Minister for Education whether he caused an investigation to be carried out into a complaint of beating in a school (details supplied); if so, the date and nature of such investigation; whether the pupil in question or his parents or medical advisers were consulted by the Department's inspector; if not, why; and whether the findings of any such investigation were communicated to (a) the school manager (b) the teacher and (c) the parents of the pupil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1757" /> Mr. Colley: As in the normal practice in such cases, when resort was had to legal proceedings the official investigation by my Department was suspended.  The Deputy is no doubt aware of the outcome of these proceedings and in view of it I do not propose to take any further action in the matter.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: Is the Minister aware that a statement was made in court regarding the findings of an inquiry which the Minister now tells us was never held?</P>
    <P>Mr. Colley: I am not aware of any such thing.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: I would ask the Minister to look up the records.  It is a very serious matter.</P>

      <P>Before the interval I had just quoted from the question in the Dáil put to the Minister for Education by Deputy Richie Ryan and the supplementary questions and answer which I considered relevant, and which Senator Nash had not available when he was quoting the question. It was made clear in the quotation, which I just gave, that the Minister was not fully aware that a statement had been made on oath in court regarding the findings of an inquiry which the Minister now tells us was never held.  Apparently, the Minister heard about this for the first time when Deputy Richie Ryan mentioned it in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Nash asked me to recognise that the statements by those two witnesses might well be in accordance with the facts, arising possibly from the fact that the inspector made a remark in private conversation which was interpreted by the two defence witnesses as meaning that he had reached a judicial conclusion to an investigation which, in actual fact, was never concluded, according to the Minister. I wrote to the Minister on this point since the Seanad debate, and I inspector in question as to whether an <Col N="1758" /> injudicious remark in private conversation had been made which might lead the authorities in the school to think that the investigation was completed and the teacher exonerated as was said subsequently in court.  Unfortunately, the Minister has replied to me that the inspector in question has retired from the service and apparently he cannot be got in touch with.  I do not know the details, but I am prepared to accept what I have been told.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to suggest that he has been held <i>incommunicado</i>, but apparently the Minister cannot get in touch with him. For some reason it is not possible to put this question in such a way that he could answer it.  However, I am prepared to accept that those two witnesses said in good faith in court that the case had been investigated and the inspector had exonerated the teacher. I would say, according to the facts before them, that this seemed to be the truth.  I would think, however, it would have been necessary, in order to tell the whole truth, to tell the court that this was in casual conversation, not in official reply from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see Senator Nash is back here now, because he told us he was giving us the facts on this Keeley case.  I do not want, at tedious length, to go back over that.  I do not, in fact, challenge very much of what Senator Nash said but what I have to say merely adds some facts to which, like the Minister's reply to the supplementary question, he apparently had not got access in his brief.  The alleged beating of the child took place on 2nd October, 1964.  The assault case was taken arising therefrom.  Of course, it became necessary for the defendant to show that no more force than necessary was used in order to prove that this was an assault.  The various facts were presented, but I need not go into that in detail.  The mother complained and brought the child to the manager. The manager became convinced that the child was telling lies.  He did not have a look at what the mother alleged <Col N="1759" /> about the wounds of the child.  He then suspended the child from the school.</P>
    <P>There is a relevant point here that has not been made but which I should like to put before the Seanad, that is, that no previous complaint had been made to the parents by the school as to the language or behaviour of this boy, about whom it was said later he was an extremely bad boy, a bad influence, using bad language and so on. I should like to read, therefore, to the Seanad a letter, first of all, from the manager of the school to the parents, arising out of the incident.  This is October 15th, 1964, from the Presbytery, Ballyfermot.  It is signed by the school manager, Canon M.C. Troy. It says:</P>
    <P>Dear Mrs. Keeley,</P>
    <P>We have a high standard of discipline in our Parish Schools&mdash;Our Lady Queen of Angels.  I am fortunate in having excellent teachers who take personal interest in all the boys in training in hygiene and cleanliness, good manners, games and discipline.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate also in having excellent boys who co-operate with the teachers, by being studious, obedient and respectful.</P>
    <P>I regret that your boy, coming with a record of boldness from his previous school, has maintained that bold attitude by being unruly and disobedient with displays of bad temper and bad language.  In justice to the other excellent children and their parents, I cannot allow this bad example to continue as it would ruin the discipline and the good name of the school.</P>
    <P>Since his return to school this unsettled unruly conduct has continued. Accordingly, I find myself in duty bound to the other children, and indeed in an effort to cure the boy, to suspend him from the school for one week as from Monday next, October 19th to Monday, October 26th.</P>
    <P>It is your obligation primarily to correct him sufficiently, so that he will conduct himself on his return to school.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1760" /> Should there be no improvement after this warning and suspension, it will be my painful, though very necessary, duty to expel him from the school.</P>
    <P>I would like to do all that I can to make a good boy of him.  So I suggest for your consideration that if you feel that he is beyond your power to control and improve him you should send him to a child psychiatrist for expert treatment.</P>
    <P Just="Right">I remain,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Sincerely yours,</P>
    <P>Now Mr. and Mrs. Keely were distressed by this, the first indication to them from the school of any bad conduct on the part of their boy.  So, on their behalf, Messrs. Ryan and Wallace wrote to the Very Reverend Michael Canon Troy.</P>

      <P>In the speeches made subsequent to my opening of this motion, I was challenged very strongly about the factual details of this case and, in particular, with relation to my query as to the suspension of the boy.  Senator Nash was allowed &mdash;and I think rightly allowed&mdash;to trace the facts of the case as he saw them and I would submit, with respect, that in answering, I should have a similar right to mention some of the facts he did not mention at all, probably because he was not aware of them.  This is related, in fact, to a case which was dealt with in quite a lot of detail by these two other Senators.  I beg leave to read the letter, which is very important, on behalf of the parents written by the solicitors bringing out the fact that they asked for specific information about this.</P>

      <P>Dear Reverend Father,</P>
      <P>We act on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Keeley of 176 Blackditch Road, Ballyfermot, Dublin 10, who have handed us your letter of the 15th October in which you informed them that you had suspended their son, Seamus, for one week from 15th October.</P>
      <P>Our clients instruct us that your letter came as a great shock to them, especially as this was the first time that they had ever received any complaint about their son's conduct either from you, the Principal Teacher, or any of his other teachers. While our clients appreciate the need for dicipline and correction and do not except their son, Seamus, from the ordinary faults and failings of children of his age and from the need constantly to correct and supervise him, they naturally resent the stigma you have placed upon him by suspending him, without prior warning or consultation, as to the best means of dealing with him.</P>
      <P>We have perused the Rules and Regulations for National Schools and fail to find therein any authority under which you are entitled to suspend their child from the school, or to expel, as you threaten in your letter.  We are instructed to inform you that should you proceed to expel their son, they will be obliged to have recourse to the Courts to enforce the constitutional right of their son to free primary education.</P>
      <P>Our clients are deeply conscious of their obligations to their child and have no desire to have their son singled out from his school mates by being identified with Court proceedings or anything else which might tend to injure him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a view to obviating further trouble in their child's schooling and so that he may grow up like other children, they would appreciate your and his teacher's assistance and cooperation <Col N="1763" /> at every stage.  In order that they may correct his school faults, they would be obliged if you would let us know in greater detail:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  How has he been unruly and disobedient?</P>
    <P>(2)  The occasions he has displayed bad temper and some idea of the bad language he is said to use.</P>
    <P>It is our clients' intention to discuss their son's conduct with him and to keep a watchful eye at home over such of his bad habits that might give rise to disciplinary action at school.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours faithfully,</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>Now the case was traced by Senator Nash, but he omitted to say that, although the defence denied that the infant plaintiff suffered personal injury at all, the defendant lodged £26 in court and £8 for special damages including medical treatment necessary. Five guineas was accepted by the defendant's father on account of medical treatment for this &ldquo;inexcessive&rdquo; punishment.  I think it highly relevant to notice that it is possible to punish a child in school legitimately to the extent of incurring five guineas damages&mdash;for which the medical treatment would cost five guineas&mdash;without this being considered &ldquo;improper&rdquo; or &ldquo;excessive&rdquo;.  It is very relevant to the change in the Rules, because this is the phrase which is used.  I am not suggesting that five guineas is the ceiling. It may be possible to do more expensive damage to the child, but I am suggesting that you can do at least this amount of damage, financially assessed to the extent of five guineas, without the punishment being necessarily regarded as excessive.</P>

      <P>I have a great affection for Senator Yeats, but I cannot accept him as the arbiter of order in this House.  Senator Yeats will recall that the Leas-Chathaoirleach had great trouble in keeping him in order when he tried to deal with the one- and two-teacher schools arising out of this motion, and when he was challenged as to what particular Rule he was referring to, he had to confess he was quoting not the Rules but the syllabus!</P>

      <P>I also have respect for Senator Sheehy Skeffington. Senator Brosnahan quoted at length from a judgment in the High Court, and I should like with your permission, Sir, to quote from a judgment in the Supreme Court, if I may.  This judgment is given in the case of Bourke, an Infant v. CIE and Sarah Nolan. It arises out of an application under section 63 of the Civil Liability Act, 1961.  I will not weary the Seanad by reading the section but it can be looked up and quoted if necessary. The judgment was given by Justice Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh and contains the following:</P>
      <P>But whether complex or simple, the section requires the judge to decide what should be done.  If he decides in favour of acceptance then the case is at an end; if not satisfied of the adequacy of the lodgment then he orders the case to go to trial.  In the latter instance circumstances may arise where a judge may think it proper to make a speaking order if he considers that there is something he wishes to bring to the notice of the judge who will later be called upon to rule on costs.</P>
      <P>That demonstrates that in the first application of this case in the circuit court the judge had two alternatives, either to rule that the £26 lodged was enough and dismiss the case, or that it was not enough and that it should go forward for trial.  In fact, what happened was that he would not rule either way despite his legal obligation, in the opinion of the Supreme Court, to do so.  I suggest that the child at that juncture, therefore, had a right to one judicial determination in his favour which he did not get, under section 63 of the Civil Liability Act, 1961.</P>

      <P>The Chair has been very lenient with the Senator and again calls on him to come to the <Col N="1767" /> question of the recent changes made by the Minister in the Rules for National Schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I relate what I have been saying closely to what I regard as regrettable in the reframing of the Rules.  In the previous Rules there was a precise definition of what constituted &ldquo;excessive punishment&rdquo;. Most of that definition has gone. Several Senators asked the Minister to define more precisely the terms &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; and &ldquo;improper&rdquo;.  I am afraid I must say the Minister was either unwilling or unable to give a more precise definition.  Consequently, this strengthened my desire that he should have a fresh look at the regulations that have been changed in this respect and see whether it would not be better to re-phrase and re-frame them, and make the definition of what is&ldquo;excessive&rdquo; and &ldquo;improper&rdquo; more precise, more readily available, and more readily understandable by the teachers, the managers, the children, and the courts if necessary.</P>
      <P>I pass now to what Senator Brosnahan said in relation to the fact that the INTO&mdash;I hope I will not misrepresent him&mdash;will not stand over excessive punishment administered by a teacher.  My purpose in referring earlier to the Raharoon case was to indicate the ineffectual, secretive and furtive nature of ministerial inquiries by the Department of Education.  In the Raharoon case as Senators may remember, £25 damages was awarded to an 11-years old girl, and it was accepted by the court that she had received 11 heavy strokes of a cane on the hands.  In this case there was a judicial finding that excessive punishment had been administered by a teacher, but the INTO far from not standing over it, did stand over it and backed the teacher, not only before the court case which was quite proper, but after the teacher was found guilty and fined £25 for what must be termed excessive punishment, since the case was brought for an assault on a child.  Yet, both before and after the teacher in question was completely backed by the INTO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1768" /> That seems to me to be one example which demonstrates that the claim made in this connection by Senator Brosnahan is not soundly grounded. Furthermore, he said that in this same case many parents in the locality were for the teacher.  In fact, he said 34 out of 37 families&mdash;I hope I have his alleged figures correctly&mdash;were in favour of the teacher.  He omitted to mention that there was an unofficial threat by his organisation to boycott the school if the inquiry found against the teacher.  Arising out of that fact it may well be that the petition which was canvassed from door to door was signed by as many as 34 out of 37 families.</P>

      <P>I think that since Senator Brosnahan is not occupying the Chair he is not in a position to rule upon points of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say further that in this case the Department's inquiry&mdash;and that is the relevance of my mentioning the case at all&mdash;led to no official action, and according to Senator Brosnahan, himself the teacher who did in fact leave the school after the father and his ten children had left the country, the father having sold his 159 acre farm, did so &ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo;; despite the fact that 34 out of 37 families were in his favour, and presumably one of the opposing 3 had gone over to London, having sold his farm, so that by a majority of 34 out of 36, the families wanted the teacher to stay!  This is what Senator Brosnahan asks us to accept, that he left &ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo;.  I put this question: how does Senator <Col N="1769" /> Brosnahan know that the Department took no action in this case; because, as we all know, if the Minister is questioned in the Dáil on such matters, all he will say is that suitable investigation was made and appropriate action was taken.  Nobody knows what action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator said that the teacher was sent into the wilderness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that the teacher went or was sent to Inishere.  I am prepared to accept that he went voluntarily, though from the figures I am asked to believe he had almost unanimous local support.  How does Senator Brosnahan know that the Department took no action?  He may be right, but the Dáil will not be told, no Senator will be told, and I question whether Senator Brosnahan himself will be told.</P>
      <P>I pass to another point of a more general character, that is, that Senator Brosnahan spoke&mdash;and he shares this with quite a number of speakers in the debate&mdash;about the necessity for punishment in order to have discipline as if unconsciously he regarded punishment as always being corporal punishment. It should be quite clear that there are a variety of forms of punishment which are not corporal punishment, and it would be quite possible to employ various punishments such as depriving of privilege or withholding of privilege which would constitute punishment, but which is not necessarily corporal punishment. I am contending that if one establishes the necessity for punishment, one has not necessarily established the necessity for corporal punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Brosnahan also said, in what seemed to me to be rather a sneering tone, that I could only quote two cases in 15 years.  I would suggest that in this case Senator Brosnahan did not do his homework.  I do not intend to impose any punishment on him for this, but for his information, the 15 years to which he referred in 1965, went back to the first occasion on which I raised this in the Seanad, which was 1955. Simple arithmetic makes this ten, not 15 years, so that on that particular <Col N="1770" /> point there is an exaggeration of 50 per cent.  I do not know why it is felt necessary so to inflate things.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if he will take the trouble of reading what I said on the various occasions that I raised the matter&mdash;on June 30th, 1955, July 19th, 1955, February 10th, 1956, and April 19th, 1956&mdash;he will find that I raised case after case after case, including, most significantly, 32 cases which were already on the Minister's files, all of which had been sent to him in the previous 12 months, all of which he identified not by the parents' name but by the date and signature of the acknowledgment from his officials.  All of these were within the year before I raised the matter, and a year exactly almost to the day before he stated both in the Seanad and the Dáil&mdash;General Mulcahy was Minister at the time&mdash;that his Department never received more than one complaint of this nature a month&mdash;it &ldquo;never&rdquo; received more than 12 a year. I was able to draw attention to 32 in the previous year which his Department had actually acknowledged.  I do not propose to go further into that in detail, but I mention these figures to protest against the suggestion that in 15 years I managed to bring up only two cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the old regulations and I read the new, and I made very specifically the case that the new in this connection are a change for the worse.  In my opening speech last November, I mentioned a whole lot of other Rules to which I will make slight reference presently, but this particular Rule&mdash;the one about corporal punishment&mdash;was the one upon which Senators challenged me&mdash;those who did challenge me&mdash;and I think I am entitled to make that answer to Senator Brosnahan, who taunts me <Col N="1771" /> with not being able to find more than two cases in 15 years.</P>
      <P>I would like to mention a series of cases about which the present Minister is personally informed and concerned. There is the case of a school in Brittas, County Dublin.  The parents of children in this school have been complaining about the treatment meted out to the children there for years, and I have documentary evidence of that fact going back to 1963.  They came to me and to others interested in this kind of thing.  When they came, they were decided on holding a school strike.  It was put to them very strongly both by the Schoolchildren's Protection Association and by myself, that they would be better to seek an interview with the new Minister, who seemed to be very much concerned with this kind of thing.  They did this, and the Minister received the deputation of seven fathers from this district.</P>
      <P>I might say in parenthesis that this is something of a record, because we must recognise to our shame that in Ireland when the welfare of the child is involved, nine times out of ten it is the mother who is expected to do all the protesting and take any action that may be required.  There is nothing unusual in the Minister's receiving a deputation, but there is something unusual in seven fathers from the district of Brittas in County Dublin going in to see the Minister about these cases of alleged mistreatment of the children in the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were very well received by the Minister and he listened to all the cases.  He was clearly sympathetic, and he asked the Chairman of the Committee to collect the complaints from the various parents of this fairly extensive farming district and to send them in in writing.  This was a perfectly legitimate and reasonable request.  The Chairman and two or three others of those fathers went around and collected the complaints in writing and they were sent to the Minister.  There were 19 sent.  An inquiry was held on 18th November, 1965 which went on for four days.  There was a supervening week-end.  I am sorry to say that the INTO representative at the inquiry <Col N="1772" /> accused of conspiracy the parents who obeyed the Minister's instructions to go around and collect complaints and to send them in in writing.  This word was used by the INTO representative to the parents at the inquiry and was used a dozen times.  This is a small point, but it is an attitude of mind which is a little bit unfortunate when the parents did what the Minister asked them to do and they are then accused of &ldquo;conspiracy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to leave this and, when dealing with the Minister's speech I want, with the permission of the Cathaoirleach, to return briefly to that inquiry. I read some of the complaints arising out of this particular school, which seemed to me to be quite unusual.  I am not suggesting at all that this is a common occurrence.  In fact, there is evidence that neighbouring schools are totally different in their approach because some of the children who left this school and went to Kilbride school got on very well and were extremely happy there.  I am not suggesting that this school is typical but it is a school in which an inquiry has been held. When I recall some of the accusations and allegations that were made recently, when we were talking about the damage by warble fly on cattle, I could not help regretting that the hides of Irish children have not got a cash value, because there would be wider concern for them if prices were involved.  I again recognise that this school is an exception and far from being the rule.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the speech of Senator O'Kennedy.  He said, quite correctly, that I wanted corporal punishment abolished altogether.  This is true and I said so quite clearly, but I made it clear that this is not what is requested in my motion.  The suggestion in my motion is that the Minister look again at the Rules.  I made the point that the old Rules, the Ó Deirg Rules, were good.  I said they were imperfectly adhered to, due either to ministerial weakness, or to managerial contempt for ministerial authority, but they were better Rules than the present Rules.  Arising from the recent changes, Senator O'Kennedy rightly said that while he did not agree <Col N="1773" /> with abolishing corporal punishment it should not happen for failure at lessons, and yet it does happen and widely in our schools.  This is something that is still prohibited under the new Rules.  Here in his own words is that statement at column 607, volume 60, No. 6:</P>
    <P>In the majority of cases where corporal punishment is inflicted in schools it is for failure in lessons.</P>
    <P>This is what Senator O'Kennedy said and I have every reason to believe it is correct.  He also said at column 608:</P>
    <P>Unless a strong case is made against it, this regulation should be honoured and I am afraid at the present it is not being honoured.</P>
    <P>Again, I put the case strongly that the Minister might look at his Rules and see whether he cannot improve on the changed Rules and also&mdash;this is very important in view of the points made by other Senators&mdash;ensure that all the existing Rules are adhered to.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see Senator Lenehan here.  He gave us a living example of the unhealthy results derived from being beaten all over the place by his teachers.  He has survived, and he is obviously thoroughly alive and kicking but he admitted that all his teachers were driven to the grave.  Every one of them was dead and gone: they did not survive.  None of the teachers survived after teaching Senator Lenehan.</P>

      <P>I turn now to Senator Rooney.  He argued judicially&mdash;I do not agree by any means with everything he said&mdash;that reasonable punishment is necessary.  I would put the question again.  Need it be corporal? I would certainly agree that punishment is necessary.  Senator Rooney asked the Minister to specify what he meant by &ldquo;improper&rdquo; and &ldquo;excessive&rdquo;.  I am afraid he did not really get an answer to that.  It should be specified what is meant by &ldquo;improper&rdquo; and &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; and I would argue from that it is necessary, at least, to change the Rules, if only to clarify the definition of &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; and &ldquo;improper&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Senator Alton referred to the opinion of reasonable doctors.  Speaking not as &ldquo;an extremist&rdquo; but as a balanced doctor, he said they would allow corporal punishment.  He gave the necessity for corporal punishment as the opinion of reasonable doctors, balanced doctors. He said they were not against total abolition, but they insisted that it be on the open hand only.  This is Senator Alton speaking judicially, not taking the extremist view.  He was giving the view of the medical profession, the reasonable and logical section of it. He insisted that it be inflicted on the open hand only.  Therefore, I would argue that the old Rule, which prohibits its administration on any part of the body other than the hand, was better than the changed Rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also made the point&mdash; it is worth underlining, I think&mdash;that all the circumstances surrounding a beating incident, disobedience or serious misbehaviour on the part of a child should be investigated, although it is quite clear that no teacher instructing 60 or 70 children has time to do so, <Col N="1775" /> and no manager has the time.  Senator Alton suggested&mdash;perhaps he is being over innocent but I think we should be taken seriously&mdash;a service akin to the almoner service in hospitals in relation to schools where seriously maladjusted children, who normally look as if they are wilfully misbehaving, can have the surrounding circumstances investigated.  I am glad to see the Minister has set up a committee of psychologists.  This is something to which they might perhaps usefully turn their attention and there might be some modification, perhaps, when the Minister comes to reconsider these Rules.</P>
    <P>Senator Mrs. Ahern thought &ldquo;a little slapping&rdquo; does not do any harm, and without this, as it were, the teacher would &ldquo;lose authority&rdquo;. I am not prepared really to accept that.  I would argue that in the book which I quoted earlier <i>The Challenge of the Retarded Child</i> Sister Mary Theodore is nearer the truth when she said:</P>
    <P>The person imbued with Christ-like charity will discover ways for a friendly approach to negative children. Her attitude will not be: &ldquo;I will show you who is the boss&rdquo;, but rather &ldquo;I will show you how much love and kindness can do to bring happiness and security into your lives&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I feel that Senator Mrs. Ahern places too much emphasis upon the &ldquo;authority&rdquo; of teachers, and I do not think she is right in saying that if teachers lose the right to strike children, they will lost authority.  I would suggest that the authority of teachers is based on respect won by the teachers.  This is the case with the vast majority of our teachers in our national schools, whether they use corporal punishment or not.  Authority is based not on the way in which they inflict corporal punishment, but on the respect of the children.  I would even say that there is capacity on the part of the children to forgive the teachers for inflicting even corporal punishment if they think it is justly administered. Senator Mrs. Ahern seemed then to think that the only form of punishment was corporal.  I do not think so <Col N="1776" /> and I do not think, in fact, that girls should have corporal punishment administered to them at all.</P>
    <P>In relation to this question of authority, I would furthermore suggest to Senator Mrs. Ahern that after all, the authority in the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis, which she so competently chaired on occasions, was not based upon enforced respect for the Chair but respect for the holder of the office.  I do not think it would be increased if some coercive action were placed at the disposal of the chairman or chairwoman.  The point I do make is that, after all, Fianna Fáil, in their coming to power, have not got a record of absolutely unimpeachable acceptance of legally constituted authority.  I would argue that on many occasions, when they defied authority, they were right; but they cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>I turn to what Senator Mrs. Ahern said about Scotland.  She said that even in Scotland, which has a good educational system, they were still using the strap.  I quote from the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> of 15th October, 1965:</P>
    <P>The Scottish Education Department may soon announce an agreed policy on the controversial issue of corporal punishment in schools This will probably keep strapping as a carefully controlled ultimate sanction but will aim&mdash;sooner rather than later&mdash;at its abolition.  This might be done by instalments.</P>
    <P>There is just one other quotation from the same article:</P>
    <P>Scotland's past tendency towards more corporal punishment than the average has caused her educationalists much concern and increased the desire to find effective alternatives.</P>
    <P>I quote that simply in answer to the point made by Senator Mrs. Ahern, that the Scotch themselves who were noted for their educational theory practice, were retaining corporal punishment.  I think the quotations I have given rather modify this view.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy compared the new Rules and the old and found that the Minister's defence of the new Rules <Col N="1777" /> was unconvincing, and rightly asked also for some definition of &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; and &ldquo;improper&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator McQuillan noted that there is no corporal punishment for criminals and that it is retained for school children only.  He made two valuable suggestions.  He said it should be incorporated in the Rules that corporal punishment should be used only if the teacher's authority was seriously challenged.  His second suggestion was that there should be a punishment record book in every school so that the quantity and extent of the punishment could be noted and seen.</P>
    <P>Senator Dolan spoke against me.  He referred to letters to the editor.  I do not think he was wholly serious when he suggested that perhaps I wrote some of the letters which I quoted myself. This was just a joke.  I would not take it seriously, but I do draw attention to the fact that all the letters to the editor which I quoted were signed; they were not anonymous.  Senator Dolan mentioned, and was allowed to mention in some detail&mdash;and read&mdash;a full letter from the teacher involved in the case of the two Perry boys in Drumcondra.  This is on the records of the House and I should like to be allowed to quote the Minister's observation on this case, to which I shall refer first and also the parent's.  I do not propose to read all the father's comment although the teacher's letter was put in in full.  The Minister says, writing to the father, Mr. Patrick Perry, on 13th January, 1966:</P>
    <P>I am to refer to the letter received from you on 23rd November last regarding the treatment of your son, Vincent, a pupil of the above-named school, by the principal teacher, and I am to inform you that the Minister for Education is satisfied, from the investigations that have been carried out, that the complaints made by you in that letter are unwarranted.</P>
    <P>The fact is, of course, and I made this clear in my first speech, that the complaints arose from the treatment of two boys.</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling, Sir, but I would urge you to recognise that the full letter of the teacher is on the records of the House.  I am asking to be allowed to quote simply two paragraphs of the father's letter.  This seems to be relevant, particularly since I drew the Minister's attention to the fact that two boys were involved, and the younger boy was the boy who had just come out of hospital, who had been six months in Blanchardstown, and the father wants to know what can be done, what can they do.  Would you permit me to read the relevant portion of the father's letter?</P>

      <P>It reads:</P>
      <P>I have now received reply from Secretary, Department of Education, in relation to this complaint which I enclose.  As you will see by this reply, he only refers to my son, Vincent, as I complained about the Head Master hitting my other son, Brian, on the back of the ear and this boy spent six months on his back on Blanchardstown Hospital.</P>
      <P>This was when he had just come back to school.  The father says, further on in the letter:</P>
      <P>I do not think that a proper investigation was carried out in this matter. My boys, Vincent and Brian, have informed me that an inspector visited the school and, in the presence of the Head Master and another master, asked the boys in the class did they see him strike Vincent and Brian.  Some said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  One boy said he definitely saw him, and that seems to have ended the matter as far as I am aware.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Quigley was kind enough to pay a tribute to me in answer to what Senator Dolan had said, for which I thank him, naturally.  But I think no offence was meant by Senator Dolan in this; he was just pulling my leg.  Senator O'Quigley made the point that he would not abolish corporal punishment because he thinks, in certain cases, it is necessary.  I should like to stress the fact that mv motion is not asking for the abolition of corporal punishment; it is asking for a reconsideration of recent changes, the most significant of which have been made in relation to corporal punishment. Senator O'Quigley thinks it might be a good thing to incorporate in the Rules a teachers' disciplinary committee. This, I think, also would be a good thing&mdash;that is to say, if this could be done with teachers in general, by the INTO, in conjunction with the parents.  This was suggested at a meeting of the Irish Civil Liberties Association some years ago, but the INTO refused at that time.  Perhaps they might consider it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Nash made the point that hanging up the Rules in the schools was a monstrous thing to do.  I suggested that posting safety regulations in a factory was not insulting the owner of the factory.  He mentioned at some length the case I have largely dealt with.  One point he did make&mdash; and he has now left the chamber&mdash; was that he did challenge me that if I saw any inaccuracies in what he said to be sure to point them out to him.  I should hate to disappoint him in that matter.  He said, for instance, that in <Col N="1780" /> the Circuit Court, Canon Troy, the manager of the school, did not give evidence.</P>

      <P>The point was made by Senator Nash in relation to the evidence given by Canon Troy in the High Court that he did not give evidence in the Circuit Court.

I do not think I want to challenge any of the other points he raised, but I regard some of them as incomplete.  He did not know about Deputy Ryan's supplementary question. He did not get the Dáil debates.</P>
      <P>I want to come now to the Minister's speech.  My first point is particularly appropriate, because I am glad to see the Minister for Justice now here.  He is a good strong man, and he will certainly be able to convey what I say here to the Minister for Education. I also have the greatest respect for the Minister for Education.  My point is that the Minister could easily have said : &ldquo;These Rules are not perfect. They were made with good intentions. I have been in office for a short time only and these Rules were framed six months before I took office.  I think it not unreasonable to have another look at them.  If reconsideration leads me to reframe them, I will do so.&rdquo;  That would seem to me to be in accordance with a correct ministerial attitude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not say he would reconsider them.  A very relevant example which I want to mention was given by Senator McQuillan of the attitude of the Minister for Justice towards the Succession Bill.  He found himself piloting a Bill which had been framed by his predecessor, but he did not feel himself bound by every clause. It is an accident that he happens to be now present, and that does not change what I was going to say.  We recognise that his attitude was flexible and strong, flexible without showing weakness on the question of amendments. I feel that this should be the attitude of the Minister for Education. I was disappointed that he felt he had to defend every dot and comma of the changed Rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice also that his brief dealt with corporal punishment only and he was silent on the other points I raised.  I mentioned eight or nine other Rules <Col N="1782" /> which had been changed, some for the better and some for the worse.  He was silent on these points and ignored them totally.  He said I raised the other points as a &ldquo;smokescreen&rdquo;.  That is a little over-convenient.  I asked why Rule No. 10 had been modified and I got no answer except that I was using it as a smokescreen.  I asked why Rule No. 15, section 4, dealing with a written undertaking by the managers to obey Rules had been modified, and I got no answer.  I asked about Rule No. 20 which relates to various recommendations for the school managers and I got no answer.  I urged the desirability of parent-teacher groups and I got no answer, until when he challenged me for some constructive suggestion, I reminded him that that is a constructive suggestion, and all I got in reply was nebulous lip service and no active steps.</P>
    <P>This whole question of parent-teacher groups is becoming more and more urgently necessary.  I asked the Minister was he prepared to change the Rules so as to urge the desirability upon the managers of having parent-teacher groups and the only answer I got was nebulous lip service.</P>
    <P>I praised Rule No. 31 and I asked related questions on Rule No. 44 which relates to overcrowding in the schools and I got no answer, except the all-covering answer that it was a smokescreen. I asked a question about section 3 of Rule 71 which says that English may be an optional subject in infant classes.  I asked why the change was made and again I got no answer. I asked the Minister how he interpreted the &ldquo;inalienable&rdquo; rights of parents referred to in the preamble to the Rules and I got no answer.  I asked did he think that the Constitution means that they could not be transferred and I got no answer.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned at the start of his speech my reference to the fact that a motion of this type might be delayed.  He seemed to think that was an accusation against himself which it certainly was not.  My fear derived from past experience of motions being delayed.  I put down a motion on the corporal punishment Rules on December <Col N="1783" /> 16th, 1955, and it was finally dealt with on April 19th, 1956.  This time the motion was not perhaps unduly postponed, though I first raised this matter in October, 1965, and this is March 9th, 1966.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote now what the Minister said about the printing strike and about nailing falsehoods in this connection.  At column 587, volume 60 of the Seanad Official Report he said:</P>
    <P>In doing that, I want, first of all, to nail one falsehood which appeared, I think, in some newspaper and has steadily been repeated and propagated since until we had it again here today from Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  There is a suggestion that these Rules were produced by stealth during the newspaper strike.  The facts of the matter are that the new Rules were issued to school managers and principal teachers in June of this year and they came into force on the 1st July, 1965.  The newspaper strike commenced on the 5th July, 1965.</P>
    <P>And then he said that we cannot &ldquo;put forward, as an alleged fact, that the Department sneaked these Rules out when there were no newspapers&rdquo;.  The reference to me is not exact.  I did not say that the Rules were sneaked out. With your permission, I would like to put on the record what I did say. This is at column 520 of the same volume.  I said that</P>
    <P>the new Rules were signed by his predecessor in office, Dr. Hillery, on the 22nd January, 1965; they were printed, as the Seanad will remember, early in July of this year when there was not a newspaper to be had in Dublin and consequently there was not much knowledge of the changes, really, until about a month ago.</P>
    <P>There was no accusation there. There was a statement of fact.  There is also a misstatement by the Minister that they were brought out on 1st July and that the newspaper strike started on the 5th.  The rules came out on 1st July, and on 2nd July we had the newspaper strike.  This is a <Col N="1784" /> small point but I would like to get the record straight on that.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that he would like to find ways of finding out the facts about the schools.  I would suggest that is the kind of information which an intelligent and regular-running parent-teacher group in relation to the schools would help to find out.  The Seanad will remember that in July I quoted nine years of effort to find out the facts about how many classes there were in Dublin with more than 40 children and less than 50, more than 50 and less than 60, and so on, and that although I gave notice of the question and asked only for the latest available figures, the Minister was not able to give any.  I do notice that we are promised these figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am only making a quip.  I am not demanding his presence.  I feel sure he will read the debate carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had come to the point where the Minister said he would welcome suggestions. When he gets suggestions, such as suggestions made by parent-teacher groups, he seems to shy away from them.  I suggested that he could add to the things for which he urges desirability in the Rules, the desirability of having parent-teacher groups. The Minister said, in a correspondence in which we engaged in the newspapers, that he did not want to do it in this <Col N="1787" /> way, because if he were to change the Rules, so as to urge the desirability of parent-teacher groups, it &ldquo;might have overtones of Ministerial orders&rdquo;. That was his phrase, which surprised me, I must say.  It might have overtone of Ministerial orders if he were to urge the desirability, not only of libraries and of lectures, which he does, but of parent-teacher meetings.</P>
    <P>I feel this is an over-reluctant attitude towards those groups and a departure from what he said as a Deputy about parent-teacher groups.  He said here he does &ldquo;not take back one iota&rdquo; of what he said as a Deputy about parent-teacher groups, when he declared that &ldquo;interest by parents in education is actively discouraged by the teachers, the churches, and the Department. I feel the Minister should take active steps to encourage the foundation of parents' committees.&rdquo;  I asked then what had he done?  His answer was that he had &ldquo;watched certain developments with considerable interest.&rdquo;  He says he takes back not one iota and yet this is all he has done!  He said the Minister ought to take active steps to encourage the foundation of parents' committees. This is what he said when he was a Deputy.  When he is Minister, he says he takes back not one iota of that.  I want the Minister then to take active steps.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in the Dáil when asked by Deputy Crowley&mdash;I quote now from the Dáil Debates, Volume 219, No. 6, column 891 of 14th December, 1965&mdash;if the Minister was contemplating the introduction of a parent-teacher organisation, he went so far as to say that the Rules prevented him:</P>
    <P>Under our system of national education the managers are the persons charged with the direct government of the schools.  There is no way under the Rules for National Schools by which I could accord formal recognition to a parent-teacher association but any such organisation, established in co-operation with the school authorities, would have my full moral support and approval.</P>
    <P>This is the same man who said he was <Col N="1788" /> not content with lip service.  He wanted his predecessor to take &ldquo;active steps&rdquo; yet, when he becomes a Minister, what he gives, I am afraid, is not active steps but this &ldquo;moral support and approval&rdquo;.  If and when the parents and teachers form these groups themselves with the co-operation of the school authorities, from which he excludes himself apparently&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

What, I ask, is stopping him from taking the active step which he wanted his predecessor to take?  Doctor Hillery, when Minister for Education, said in this House, in answer to my motion on parent-teacher groups in 1961, that he was in favour of them, and if anybody started one, he would approve of it. This did not satisfy Mr. Colley the Deputy.  What has changed him?  I am afraid it is a gradual passage to that malady or condition which might be called &ldquo;ministeria&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In many changes the Minister has shown himself not to be a weak man &mdash;he is not a man without courage&mdash; and I would urge upon him, through his colleague here, to be courageous in this field also, the field of acquiring in relation to each national school, a parent-teacher organisation, which I feel would, in many cases, give strong support to many of the policies he is now having difficulty in putting through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another change I should like to see the Minister consider in relation to the Rules respecting departmental inquiries.  The Seanad will remember that I asked for the right to attend the Brittas inquiry as an observer.  The Minister says that these inquiries are fair and impartial investigations, and he assured me in a letter which I quoted that &ldquo;justice would be seen to be done by the people concerned&rdquo;.  I asked the question: &ldquo;How can it be seen to be done; how is it seen to be done in practice&rdquo;. I refer again to the inquiry in Brittas and I have here letters addressed to <Col N="1789" /> the then Minister on 20th June, 1963, signed by 12 parents.  I need not give the details here but they are specific complaints and they will be on the file of the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>I am making the point that, even when finally an inquiry comes up into cases which would merit attention, nothing emerges.  The Minister has called these inquiries &ldquo;fair and impartial investigations&rdquo;. I do not want to pause too long on this but I should like to make the point that, of the 19 cases submitted to this inquiry, only 16 appear on the official Department list of the complaints to be inquired into and many of these 16 are incompletely given.  When the inspector in charge of the inquiry is asked: &ldquo;What about the other cases by representatives of the parents&rdquo;, he replies: &ldquo;I am sorry; I am only dealing with the cases officially presented to me by the Department&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am replying to a point made by the Minister that whenever a complaint is made, it is given a full and impartial investigation. Also, when I asked to be allowed to be present, in order to see that justice would be done, he said: &ldquo;It is all right; the people concerned will see that it is done.&rdquo;  I want to demonstrate that in this case the people concerned did not see that justice was done.  Only a selected portion of those complaints lodged was put before the inquiry.  Therefore, the inquiry was not impartial, was not complete, and the people involved did <Col N="1790" /> not see that justice was done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made the point that the official list was only a select number and select portions of those which were sent to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I can cite many examples.  I would simply ask the Minister to compare these letters&mdash;the letters on his files&mdash; with the document which was issued by his Department purporting to place all the complaints before the inquiry. For example a complaint was made against a teacher in Brittas national school, Co. Dublin.  I suggest to the Minister that he will find that the complaint submitted did not fully represent the complaint submitted by the parents.  The case relates to a boy named Eustace, about whom the Minister was very concerned.  The boy was expelled from school because he was taking Irish dancing lessons from a teacher at a neighbouring school.  He was told: &ldquo;If that is the case, you can go, bag and baggage.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>This arises out of corporal punishment of this boy Eustace, which apparently was connected in the mind of the teacher with the fact that he was deriving his skill at Irish dancing&mdash;he won prizes &mdash;from another teacher from a neighbouring school and, in a fit of temper, she expelled him from the school. When the Minister heard that, he asked for full details, and the father and the boy both wrote in to the Minister.  This boy has succeeded very well from the other school.  He is now 15 years and he is in good employment. The father and the boy attended at the inquiry, but neither would be heard, although the Minister specifically asked for details of the case to be investigated.</P>
      <P>It seems to me, therefore, that the Minister's claim, which I am sure is sincere, that there are full and impartial inquiries, is not soundly based.  The Minister told these people they could &ldquo;go back ten years&rdquo; if they liked.  He was very struck by this Eustace case but, in fact, the boy was not allowed to give evidence.</P>

      <P>This case had not been ten years back.  The boy is only 15 years.  It happened about three years ago.  I could quote from other letters, but I know they are on the Minister's files.  He will be surprised to find that complaints submitted to inquiry do not represent the full complaints made by the parents. Furthermore, this is 9th March, and so far the parents involved have heard nothing of the result of the inquiry which terminated on November 23 last. How then can the Minister justify what he said in a letter to me, that the people concerned will see that justice has been done?  They have not, and I do not think they will.  I venture to <Col N="1792" /> suggest they will never be told what the result of the inquiry was.</P>
      <P>I will pass from that.  The House will be glad to know, not that I have quite concluded&mdash;I should not like to raise hopes too high&mdash;but that I am reaching the end of what I want to say about the Minister's speech.  I should like to mention one case which came up recently.  It was a case in which a member of the public wrote to me from somewhere in Munster and complained that she had met a small boy who seemed to be terrified&mdash;he was aged five years&mdash;because he was frequently beaten at school.  She asked me to pass the letter on to the Minister, and I did.</P>

      <P>The Chair is again troubled that the correspondence between the Senator and the Minister is not relevant to this debate. All that is relevant at this stage is a rebuttal of statements and arguments made by other speakers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a further point made by the Minister.  In reply he said that any complaint that came to him was fully and adequately investigated.  A complaint was submitted on 18th January of this year to which he answered:</P>
      <P>While it is difficult to pinpoint the teacher concerned from the information available, it would appear that the lady in question is employed merely in a temporary capacity.  In that connection it may be explained that it is sometimes necessary to appoint temporarily in a national school a person holding the Leaving Certificate.  Such a person is given no formal recognition and her employment is terminated on the appointment of a qualified assistant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am making is that I do not think it is satisfactory to deal with such a case where children are unjustly beaten&mdash;if this is true&mdash;by saying that the teacher is employed in a temporary capacity and that she may not be there for more than a year or two.  I do not want to pre-judge this case.  It may be that investigation would not, in fact, bear out what was said, but I am suggesting that the Minister is <Col N="1793" /> too easily satisfied with an imperfect inquiry into complaints.</P>
    <P>In his reply the Minister asked how could one frame Rules to deal adequately with punishment.  His late predecessor, Tomás Ó Deirg, had a good shot at it in 1946.  He made a most useful attempt, and perhaps the Minister could do even better by reconsidering the Rules framed by his immediate predecessor last year, and not accept them holus-bolus as if they were incapable of useful modification. My submission here tonight and in my original motion is that they are capable of useful modification, after reconsideration.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been made&mdash;and I would back it up&mdash;that, in each school, punishment records should be kept giving the date, the name of the punisher, the authoriser, the child's sex, name and age, the reason for the punishment, the number of blows or slaps, the instrument used, the part of the body struck, the time involved. This could be regularly sent by the school manager to the Minister for his information and comparison and, if necessary, for his comment.  A punishment book or punishment card, or a series of cards, could make this possible, and if corporal punishment is as rare in the schools as we are told it is, these details would not take very long.  It is only if it is far more widespread than we are told it is that it would take a lot of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I may as well.  I think I have made it clear that I am opposed to all corporal punishment. <Col N="1794" /> I think that the inculcation of fear through physical pain is bad educationally, and that it produces either bullies or toadies.  That is not the point of the motion but it is related thereto.  The old Rules, if applied, permit corporal punishment.  I am asking for reconsideration of the changes in the Rules.  The old Rules did give reasonably good protection, although I think they might have been modified to exclude altogether corporal punishment for girls.  I think even Senator Yeats agreed with me on that.  Therefore, I think the Minister should reconsider that aspect of the Rule.  I do not believe that if we so modified the Rules as to exclude corporal punishment for girls this would cause our entire educational system to collapse.  I do not believe that discipline would break down.</P>
      <P>The new Rules, in my contention, make corporal punishment, among other things, more widely permissible than it was under the old Rules. There is no question that this is so.</P>
      <P>I challenge the Minister to deny the following facts: (1) that grave transgression in a child is a rarer and weightier eventuality than serious misbehaviour.  Grave transgression was necessary for corporal punishment to be applied under the old Rules; serious misbehaviour is all that is required under the new Rules, and I therefore submit that the new Rules widen the scope of the application of corporal punishment; (2) the boxing of ears was totally prohibited under the old Rules; now not only is is not specifically prohibited but the Minister, who was asked specifically about it in the Dáil, said that he could not give &ldquo;a blanket answer&rdquo; to the question as to whether it would constitute &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; or &ldquo;improper&rdquo; punishment now: therefore the scope has been widened; (3) the instrument of punishment under the old Rules was confined to a light rod or cane: this restriction is now abolished and here too the scope is extended; (4) punishment used to be confined to the open hand: this restriction is now removed, therefore the scope of corporal punishment is here too extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A clear example was in fact the <Col N="1795" /> Keeley case, where under the old Rules the teacher was clearly breaking the Rules if he struck the boy on the body, which he admitted in evidence that he did.  Under the new Rules, this would not be against the rules unless it could be shown to be &ldquo;improper&rdquo; or &ldquo;excessive&rdquo;. It is true that this instance was in 1964 when the old Rules applied; yet the Minister told the Dáil that he would not even conclude the investigation he had started.  In this instance, the Rules of 1964 were openly broken, and apparently the Minister does not care.</P>
    <P>I contend therefore that although the conditions of overcrowding and the failure to segregate backward children from the normal child make it extremely difficult for a teacher to maintain discipline in present conditions, nevertheless I suggest that there is, unfortunately, deriving from these facts, which are not the fault of teacher or children, a widespread use of corporal punishment with no records of punishment kept, and that this can lead to abuses, however infrequent. Furthermore, it teaches by example that the big may strike the small, the strong may strike the weak, and it teaches the weak to show cowardly deference to the wielders of force, or else resort themselves to the use of weapons.</P>
    <P>If the two great causes of the widespread use of corporal punishment in national schools were removed&mdash;over-crowding and the inclusion of backward children with normal children&mdash; the good teacher, who is in the big majority, would never need to use it. If he did use it, it would be extremely rare.  As I have shown, the new Rules <Col N="1796" /> in this connection widen in effect the whole scope of the application of corporal punishment.  There is strong evidence, as I have tried to show, that public opinion, and in particular parental opinion, is against these recent changes in the Rules for National Schools.</P>
    <P>There are also several other Rules capable, in my submission and that of several other Senators, of useful amendment or fruitful amplification, and these other Rules, too, would benefit from a reconsideration by the Minister.  I therefore ask the Seanad to agree that it would welcome a reconsideration of these Rules by the Minister.  As I said, the Minister could have said that these Rules are not perfect, and that as a new Minister, he was quite prepared to have another look at them.  I am disappointed that he did not say that.</P>
    <P>I want to make the point, in concluding, that in voting for this motion, those of us who do so are not asking for this or that specific change in the Rule, though several such changes have been suggested by several Senators.  We ask merely that the Minister shall take a fresh look at his Rules for National Schools and the changes recently made therein.  The motion reads: &ldquo;That the Seanad would welcome a reconsideration by the Minister for Education of recent changes made by him in the Rules for National Schools.&rdquo;  I hope the majority of Senators will vote in favour and will even go so far, if necessary, as for once to defy that parliamentary symbol of corporal punishment, the Party Whip.</P>
